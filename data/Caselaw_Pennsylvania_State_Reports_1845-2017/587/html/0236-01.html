The Building housed, <em>inter alia, </em>offices of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (“PennDOT”), Public Utility Commission (the “PUC”), Emergency Management Agency (“PEMA”), and Department of State, with PennDOT being the principal occupant of office space. In the aftermath of the fire, the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”), a class of synthetic chemicals, was detected on surfaces and in <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>ambient air inside the Building. Although in the weeks that followed Building occupants were permitted to return to all floors but the four that were most directly affected by the fire, the Commonwealth implemented ongoing, protective health and safety measures, including extensive monitoring of PCB levels throughout the structure. Ultimately, a decision was made to demolish the Building at least in part due to the presence of PCBs, and it was imploded in 1998 and replaced with a new office tower designated as the Keystone Building.</p>

The action was originally lodged against United States Mineral Products Company (“U.S. Mineral Products”), since it apparently initially was believed that asbestos-containing fireproofing manufactured by that company and installed in the Building was the source of the PCBs, and the proceedings were consolidated with a pending action by DGS and PennDOT against U.S. Mineral Products for damages relative to planned abatement of the asbestos' hazard. U.S. Mineral Products contended, however, that other building materials were the source of the PCBs, and Appellees sought and obtained leave to join as defendants the PCB manufacturer, appellant Monsanto Company (“Monsanto”), as well as the manufacturers and installers of PCB-containing products found in the Building..</p>

Monsanto filed motions for post-trial relief and a mistrial. The latter request was based upon comments of the jury foreman during deliberations, in which he told other jurors that his brother suffered from cancer and that the foreman believed this was caused by Monsanto’s PCBs. The trial court denied the motions in a published opinion. <em>See Commonwealth, DGS v.

Monsanto, for its part, portrays the T &amp; S Building as a maintenance-starved, asbestos-infested, fire-ravaged structure, which, independent of any involvement of PCBs, required enormous rehabilitative efforts and expenditures. Monsanto highlights the Commonwealth’s pre-fire failure to accede to repeated requests from Harrisburg officials to install a sprinkler system in the Building to bring it into compliance with the local fire safety code; the consequence of such failure in terms of prolonging the June-1994 fire; the impact of the fire in terms of generating the contamination by consuming, <em>inter alia, </em>PCB-containing building products, which were assertedly spread throughout the Building in the resultant smoke and soot; the consequences of the fire in terms of its exponential magnification of the Commonwealth’s existing difficulties in addressing Building issues; and the Commonwealth’s steadfast and extensive downplaying of the significance of the PCB presence in the Building prior to the commencement of the present lawsuit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Monsanto also criticizes the case that Appellees were permitted to present to the jury as lacking in foundation and as distorted by extensive and persistent overreaching. Indeed, Monsanto casts Appellees’ efforts to assess it with liability for the destruction of the Building and various of its contents based upon the presence of trace amounts of PCBs as nothing more than a transparent attempt to shift the Commonwealth’s own financial responsibility to a deep-pockets defendant. Several <em>amici curiae, </em>including a number of Pennsylvania legisla<a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>tors, also characterize the litigation as an example of lawsuit abuse, perpetrated by arms of the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[167,420,1160,1808]]]'>Appellees, on the other hand, regard the verdict as a just consequence of Monsanto’s manufacture and distribution of dangerous chemicals, which are classified as probable human carcinogens, have the tendency to bioaccumulate in the environment and in humans, and have been banned by Congress since 1976. Appellees acknowledge the role of the fire in terms of its leading to the discovery of the chemical contamination, but contend that Monsanto is liable nonetheless, since a fire is a foreseeable event. Moreover, Appellees highlight their presentation of evidence to the effect that PCBs used as a component of certain of the Building’s ductwork were spread throughout the structure through heating and ventilation over the course of its thirty-year life span via “off-gassing” or volitization and dispersal through the air system. Although Appellees acknowledge that occupied portions of the Building were managed in such a way as they remained safe during the period of reoccupancy, there was no question that PCB remediation was necessary, and Appellees rely primarily on the anecdotal experience with cleaning efforts in the Building and other contaminated structures as suggesting that the extraordinary measures taken (including implosion and replacement) were essential to ensure a satisfactory result. Appellees also take issue with Monsanto’s characterization of the condition of the Building as decrepit, asserting that most Building issues other than the PCB and asbestos contamination were capable of being addressed through manageable maintenance and repair efforts far short of what was required to remedy the PCB contamination. They maintain that they met their burden of proof with respect to each and every element of their product liability claim seeking compensation for property damage and argue that, under the guise of advancing legal claims, Monsanto truly seeks nothing more than for this Court to reweigh the evidence and inappropriately supplant the role of the jurors as fact finders.</p>

Therefore, regardless of the merits of the theoretical position set out in the responsive opinion, its conclusion that the existing liability verdict should be sustained on a theory constructed upon the crashworthiness precept is tenuous at the outset.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

Monsanto asserts that compensation based on replacement costs was unavailable as a specific measure of damages in this case under <em>Crea </em>as a matter of fact, since the T &amp; S Building had an ascertainable market value. In this regard, Monsanto notes that other buildings situated on the Capitol campus are privately owned and/or have been appraised, sold or exchanged in the past, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.T., February 29, 2000, at 190-94; private offers were made to purchase the structure even in the aftermath of the fire, <em>see, e.g., </em>R.R. at 3075a-3090a; and various Commonwealth representatives had expressly contemplated the option of privatizing the T &amp; S Building. Monsanto also observes that the trial court's reliance on the need for legislative pre-approval of a sale is not persuasive, since such approval is not greatly distinguishable from the necessity for obtaining authority from a board of directors for sale of a building owned by a corporation and has nothing to do with the availability or non-availability of willing buyers. Furthermore, Monsanto complains that the trial court's logic would render all similarly-situated Commonwealth buildings valueless. Moreover, according to Monsanto, the Building's amenability to conventional market valuation has been conceded by Appellees in the present briefing. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellees at 44 ("The Agencies were prepared to put a dollar amount on the value of the T &amp; S Building[.]”).</p>

Notably, in distinguishing the child-play fire scenario, Justice Newman indicates that the present circumstances involving PCB contamination throughout the T &amp; S Building represent "a situation where the inherent defect increased the severity of the injury through no fault or misuse on the part of the intended user.” Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 282, 898 A.2d at 618 (Newman, J.). In fact, and as noted, Monsanto presented evidence that the Commonwealth’s failure, <em>inter alia, </em>to install a fire suppression system to protect the building and its contents and occupants consistent with the local fire code represented a misuse that caused the complained of injury. Furthermore, over Monsanto's objection, the trial court refused to issue a misuse instruction relative to causation. <em>Compare </em>Proposed Jury Instructions of Defendant Monsanto Company, at 32 ("One of the factors <em>you may </em>consider [in assessing proximate causation] is plaintiffs' own conduct, and what role, if any, it had in causing plaintiffs’ alleged damages.

Like Cocciardi, however, Halliwell also did not testify that the PCBs in the Building could not be remediated, or that wholesale replacement was required (on the pages referenced by Appellees, the thrust of Halliwell's testimony was that certain wiring raceways underneath the concrete flooring had to be abandoned and replaced by a substitute system. <em>See </em>N.T., July 28, 1999, at 134-37; August 11, 1999, at 78-81). Appellees' present assertion that Halliwell’s testimony goes to causation is also inconsistent with various representations they made to the trial court during the course of trial in their attempts to secure Halliwell's qualification as an expert witness. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., June 29, 1999, at 236, 337 <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>(reflecting the representation of Appellees' counsel that "all [Halliwell] is offering the opinion of what the contracts cost to abate the PCBs from the building pursuant to the specifications!,] • • • [a]nd subsequently what did it cost either to build a new building, assuming Mr. Crowell was right, he needed to implode it, or, number two, assuming the defendant is right and you only needed to clean it to a level of 10.").</p>

However, the majority, of jurisdictions that have addressed the crashworthiness doctrine have been persuaded by the rationale that an intended user who uses the product in its intended fashion may still be involved in a crash through no fault or misuse of his or her own. The crashworthiness doctrine permits strict liability as a means of ensuring that automobile manufacturers create a product that is safely designed for its purpose, including foreseeable conditions that do not involve misuse on the part of the user. Those same considerations exist in a case such as this one; namely, that the producer of building materials designs a product that is inherently safe when used as intended by the intended user and foreseeable misfortune occurs through no fault of that user. Ultimately, the defect is one that increases the severity of the injury due to a foreseeable outside cause or instigator of the injury. This is not a situation where the user intentionally or unintentionally was the direct cause of the injury, and I do not profess to address a scenario where a user has intentionally set the material on fire.

In <em>Kimeo, </em>a manufacturer was not allowed to rely on misuse on the part of the defendant to receive a reduction in damages based on comparative negligence. The foam product was defective in that it was flammable and could be placed near sources of heat. Thus, the doctrine of foreseeable misuse was not implicated, as that is part of an analysis of negligence and not one of strict liability. <em>Kimeo </em>allowed for strict liability recovery when a product was used as intended by its intended user under foreseeable conditions.

As emphasized throughout my Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, the building materials in this case were used as intended by the intended user. The ability to recover may exist only if these two prerequisites are met. <em>Azzarello, supra. </em>When a manufacturer designs a product that must be safe for its intended user and intended use, common sense dictates that such safely intended use must include all reasonably foreseeable conditions and events affecting that intended use. Thus, a sense of fair play to the innocent consumer mandates that recovery is allowable pursuant to a theory of strict liability. Moreover, as the materials were used in their intended fashion by their intended user, no prior case law in this Commonwealth precludes recovery. Rather, the Majority appears to equate foreseeability of conditions of intended use with foreseeable misuse. Maj. Op. at 252-53, 898 A.2d at 600 ("Madame Justice Newman posits that the Court should extend the liability without fault of manufacturers, beyond the realm of injuries occasioned in the actual course of the use of a product as the manufacturer intended, to injury or damage occasioned by exposure of a product to some unintended but reasonably foreseeable condition of use or ‘outside cause or instigator.’ ”) (citing Concurring and Dissenting Op., Newman, J. at 277, 280, 281, 281-84, 898 A.2d at 615, 617, 618, 618-19). In reality, the two are distinguishable; namely, the product was used as intended and, thus, the negligence doctrines of "foreseeable misuse” and "foreseeable unintended user” are not implicated. Accordingly, I would find that: (1) it is those negligence concepts that have no place in strict liability; and (2) foreseeability may play a role in determining the conditions to which a product may be subjected when used as intended.</p>
