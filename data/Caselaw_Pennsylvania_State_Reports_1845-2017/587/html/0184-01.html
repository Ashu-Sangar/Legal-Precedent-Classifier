In 1988, in a remote wooded location in Lebanon County, a man discovered human skeletal remains buried under logs, brush, and leaves. Dr. Neil A. Hoffman (Dr. Hoffman), a forensic pathologist, determined that the remains were those of Kathy Lynn Fair (Fair), whose sister had reported her missing on September 4, 1982, when Fair did not show up for an outing. Dr. Hoffman concluded that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds inflicted by a short, single-edged weapon, most likely a knife.</p>

At trial, Detective Michael F. Wahmann (Detective Wahmann) testified that, at the time the remains of Fair were discovered, he remembered an incident that occurred in December of 1982. In that series of events, two girls, G.S. and S.S., who had accepted rides from May, were stabbed with a short, folding single-edged knife and left for dead not far from the place where Fair’s remains were ultimately discovered; both G.S. and S.S. survived the attack.

Stanley also stated that May always carried a folding buck knife, which is a short, sturdy, single-edged knife. Denise DeHaven (DeHaven), May’s wife, stated at trial that when she visited him in jail in connection with the 1982 rape and assaults, May told her that he had hurt another girl and buried her under leaves and bushes in the woods. Subsequently, May wrote letters to DeHaven reiterating the same story. Thomas W. Fryberger (Fryberger), an acquaintance of May, testified that May had taken him and two girls up to a wooded location; Fryberger later took a state police trooper to that location, which is where Fair’s remains were eventually found. Charles W. Neidig (Neidig), an inmate at the prison where May was incarcerated, testified that he had a conversation with May in the prison yard when May returned from a hearing held in connection with the rape and assault convictions. May indicated to Neidig that the hearing did not go very well because the police were going to be able to “put a body on him” and that he “did it.”</p>

On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the conviction, but reversed the sentence, concluding that the jury could not properly consider whether May committed murder while in the perpetration of a rape because the court never instructed the jury on the elements of rape. <em>May I, </em><a href="/pa/540/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="656 A.2d 1335" data-case-ids="472159,7889297" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0237-01,/a2d/656/1335-01">656 A.2d at 1344-45</a>.

The trial court imposed a sentence of death pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(1)(iv), which requires a death sentence if the jury finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances. On September 19, 1996, the trial court denied post-trial motions, prompting a direct appeal to this Court.

May does not articulate any exception into which the statements could fall, and our review likewise reveals none. During the 1991 trial, May could have attempted to call the individuals who claimed that they saw Fair alive after December of 1982, but he did not, and he does not now contend that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to call those witnesses to testify. The presentation of direct testimony from Cunningham and Witherspoon, among others, would have alleviated the hearsay problem and would have provided the Commonwealth a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. Because May has not demonstrated that the trial court erred in ruling the statements contained -within the Investigative Report inadmissible, appellate counsel were not ineffective for failing to appeal this ruling. <em>Commonwealth v.

Trial counsel wished to call Turner to show that Fair’s lifestyle was such that “she would party on weekends and she would like to go out and have a good time” without caring for or accepting responsibility for her child. N.T., March 8, 1991, at 903-06. The Commonwealth objected, asserting that the only purpose for this testimony would be to smear Fair’s name. The trial court agreed and refused to allow Turner to testify in this regard, concluding that the evidence was irrelevant as “it’s just as illegal to kill the devil as it is to kill a saint” and “[i]t’s not legal to kill irresponsible people.” <em>Id. </em>at 904, 906.</p>

However, a full and fair review of the record makes it clear that trial counsel sought to introduce the testimony of Turner only to disparage Fair.

Accordingly, appellate counsel were not ineffective for failing to appeal the decision of the trial court to estop the questioning of Turner as it related to Fair’s character. <em>See Tilley, supra </em>(holding that counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim).</p>

Justice Saylor expresses concern that any documents prepared in anticipation of litigation should not be considered a business record. Concurring Opinion of Justice Saylor at 1. Although I agree with Justice Saylor's theoretical concern, I fail to identify any cause for concern in the instant case. In <em>Pompa v.

The prosecutor noted that the new jury had to be given some sense of the underlying facts, and that he had considered presenting live witnesses to “give the jury a flavor” of what had occurred at trial, but felt that the court’s exclusion of the attempted rape aggravator precluded that option. The prosecutor suggested that the court could apprise the jury of the factual background of the case by reading the same synopsis of the trial evidence which it had provided prior to charging the guilt phase jury, and then note that the guilt phase jury had found appellant guilty of first degree murder.

With respect to mitigation evidence, defense counsel asked the court whether, if appellant were to present evidence concerning his character, work history, and conduct in prison, the Commonwealth would be permitted rebuttal.

The trial court indicated that it did not see such “bad childhood” evidence fitting into any of the eight enumerated mitigating circumstances, and noted that it would sustain a Commonwealth objection to such evidence.

Counsel noted that Judge Aldisert stressed that an effective appellate advocate should attempt to narrow and focus issues for review, and <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>“don’t ‘just raise issue after issue after issue;’ instead, ‘[ljimit the number of issues, pick your best, and go with that.’ ” N.T. 4/9/02 at 23.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> Consistently with Judge Aldisert’s teachings, counsel was inclined to raise no more than five issues.</p>

On cross-examination, counsel acknowledged that he raised only two issues on appeal and stated that he did not make a tactical decision not to pursue other issues of potential merit, merely to limit the number of issues; rather, he did not see other issues of possible merit. With respect to the court’s ruling that it would sustain a Commonwealth objection to evidence concerning appellant’s childhood on grounds of irrelevance to any statutory mitigating circumstance, counsel stated that he viewed this issue as a discretionary one which this Court was unlikely to overturn on appeal. In addition, counsel reiterated his more overarching concern that any testimony the defense presented concerning appellant’s “character” could be met with harmful rebuttal evidence. The thrust of this observation, presumably, was that the fear of live rebuttal evidence was enough to make counsel shy away from presenting any penalty phase testimony, irrespective of the technical propriety of the trial court’s ruling on admissibility.</p>

However, the evidentiary record in this case also makes clear that counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to challenge the trial court’s ruling barring appellant from introducing mitigation evidence concerning the abuse he allegedly suffered at his father’s hand as a child. In light of existing and expansive authority from the U.S. Supreme Court, it is clear that appellant was entitled, if he so chose, to forward evidence concerning this childhood abuse under the so-called “catchall” mitigating circumstance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8), and the trial court clearly erred, as a matter of law, in ruling such evidence irrelevant.

Counsel’s lapse was on appeal and the proper focus when considering a claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness obviously must be on the effect of the deficient performance on the outcome of the appeal. On this controlling question, I believe that there is a reasonable probability that, if counsel had raised this claim upon the resentencing appeal, this Court would have remanded for a new sentencing proceeding. This is so, in my judgment, because there was but one aggravating circumstance — which was hotly contested — and the erroneously precluded mitigation evidence was not redundant, but instead would have introduced a distinct statutory mitigator for the jury’s consideration. To be frank, I am not so sure as some others that this sort of childhood information generates sympathy with a jury. As this Court noted in <em>Commonwealth v. Moore, </em><a href="/pa/580/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="213" data-cite="580 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1100738" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0279-01">580 Pa. 279</a>, <a href="/pa/580/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="214" data-cite="860 A.2d 88" data-case-ids="1100738,9145814" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0279-01,/a2d/860/0088-01">860 A.2d 88</a>, 99 (2004), such information “may or may not be perceived as mitigating (one juror may see this as reason for sympathy; another might see it as assuring [the defendant had] his violence permanently ingrained in him)....” Nevertheless, on this record, I am satisfied that the probability of prejudice was not ephemeral. The remedy for this deficient performance is to award a new sentencing proceeding.</p>

First, <em>Chambers </em>has been closely confined to its facts and circumstances, involving third-party confessions that, if believed, would exculpate an accused. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Scheffer, </em><a href="/us/523/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="229" data-cite="523 U.S. 303" data-case-ids="11503568" data-case-paths="/us/523/0303-01">523 U.S. 303</a>, <a href="/us/523/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="230" data-cite="523 U.S. 303" data-case-ids="11503568" data-case-paths="/us/523/0303-01">118 S.Ct. 1261</a>, <a href="/us/523/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="231" data-cite="523 U.S. 303" data-case-ids="11503568" data-case-paths="/us/523/0303-01">140 L.Ed.2d 413</a> (1998). Further, as Appellant acknowledges, even if it could be extended to the present circumstances, <em>Chambers </em>requires that the evidence at issue contain sufficient indicia of trustworthiness to implicate an overarching fairness principle. <em>See Chambers, <a href="/us/410/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="232" data-cite="410 U.S. 284" data-case-ids="11957222" data-case-paths="/us/410/0284-01">410 </a></em><a href="/us/410/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="232" data-cite="410 U.S. 284" data-case-ids="11957222" data-case-paths="/us/410/0284-01">U.S. at 302</a>, <a href="/us/410/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="233" data-cite="410 U.S. 284" data-case-ids="11957222" data-case-paths="/us/410/0284-01">93 S.Ct. at 1049</a>. However, much of the information contained in the missing person report at issue facially lacks such trustworthiness. For example, Appellant contends that the jury should have been presented with a portion of the report summarizing a confidential informant’s statement that the victim had been killed by a motorcycle gang as a result of a betrayal associated with drug activity, particularly since the investigating officer asserted in the report that the informant was believable and had provided reliable information in the past. <em>See </em>Brief for.Appellant at 85. The informant’s statement also indicates, however, that the victim was taken to Canada and burned in an incinerator leaving no evidence, <em>see </em>Supplementary Report dated January 20, 1984, an assertion that has no basis in fact, since the victim’s remains were eventually found in Lebanon County. On its broadest reading, <em>Chambers </em>does not override prevailing state hearsay rules in such circumstances. With respect to the report’s summary of several witness accounts of having seen the victim alive <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>after the time that Appellant became incarcerated, again, Appellant does not identify particularized circumstances strongly evidencing trustworthiness associated such statements (he points out only that the alleged sightings were by persons who knew the victim and had no apparent reason to lie). Rather, the report seems to me to represent an amalgamation of frequently inconsistent information from numerous sources collected by police over the course of several years, containing a collage of fact, rumor, and unreliable information which are, in many instances, indistinguishable on the face of the report, as frequently occurs in missing person investigations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

With regard to Dr. Hoffman’s testimony referencing the report of the non-testifying defense expert, Dr. Mihalakis, I tend to agree with Appellant that there was a modest degree of improper bolstering in the identified passage from the transcript, <em>see </em>N.T., March 6, 1991, at 650 (reflecting the district attorney’s question to the Commonwealth expert, “Again going to Dr. Mijalakis’s report, you indicated that he was in agreement with you in most points ... ”), as distinguished from the latitude afforded to experts to explain the basis for their opinions in terms of <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>material not in evidence, including other expert opinion, where such material is of a kind that is relied upon by experts in the field. <em>See, e.g., Boucher v. Pennsylvania Hosp., </em><a href="/a2d/831/0623-01" class="citation" data-index="240" data-cite="831 A.2d 623" data-case-ids="9089625" data-case-paths="/a2d/831/0623-01">831 A.2d 623</a>, 628 (Pa.Super.2003). I would therefore also address this aspect of the claim in terms of the absence of sufficient prejudice appealing on the face of the record, and the absence of an extra-record proffer which might implicate a right to an evidentiary hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a>

    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[168,768,1160,1180]]]'>Finally, concerning the discussion and resolution of the mitigation-related claims (Issue 7), <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 207-13, 898 A.2d at 572-76, my thoughts largely align with the majority’s analysis, but I agree with Mr. Justice Castille’s point that, upon a sufficient penalty-phase investigation uncovering all reasonably available mitigating evidence, informed strategic choices by counsel may shape the information that is ultimately presented to the jury. <em>See </em>Concurring Opinion, at 218-19, 898 A.2d at 579-80. Here, however, as the majority amply develops, at the appellate review stage, the claim that the trial court had improperly blocked Appellant from developing relevant mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of his trial was strong, obvious from the record, and meritorious. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 207-13, 898 A.2d at 572-76. At least in the absence of some extraordinary circumstance more compelling than the adherence of counsel to some fixed notion concerning the number of claims that should be raised on appeal, I agree with the majority that an appellate advocate’s failure to raise a strong, obvious, and meritorious claim should be sufficient to satisfy a post-conviction petitioner’s burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the verdict has been rendered unreliable by deficient performance.</p>

The report, however, as such appears facially to fall within the scope of the statutory public records exception to the hearsay rule, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6104, and I agree with the majority that a distinct evaluation is warranted with regard to the discrete layers of hearsay.</p>

What does seem to be amply supported in the document is that the victim was involved in illegal drug activity and associated with others in such endeavor; this information was first conveyed to police by the victim's parents at the outset of the investigation and runs throughout the witness accounts over the three-year period covered by the report. Absent some more specific, admissible evidence that the victim was killed as a consequence of this activity, however, I believe that the admission of the evidence of drug activity resided within the discretion of the trial court.</p>

The majority incorrectly indicates that Appellant does not offer this contention. <em>Compare </em>Majority Opinion, at 196-97, 898 A.2d at 566 (indicating that Appellant “does not now contend that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to call those witnesses to testify"), <em>with </em>Brief for Appellant at 87 ("Alternatively, defense counsel should have conducted an independent investigation of the information in the missing persons report and should have been prepared to present the witnesses named in that report ...

It is obviously necessary in undertaking such assessment to guard against the distorting effects of hindsight. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em><a href="/pa/553/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="241" data-cite="553 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="356260" data-case-paths="/pa/553/0266-01">553 Pa. 266</a>, 274, <a href="/a2d/719/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="242" data-cite="719 A.2d 233" data-case-ids="11673024,356260" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0233-01,/pa/553/0266-01">719 A.2d 233</a>, 237 (1998).
