A verbal exchange began in the living room of the Clearfield County home of their mother and stepfather and escalated into a physical altercation in the kitchen. Spotz has maintained that Dustin stabbed him in the back with a butter knife, prompting him to leave the kitchen and go upstairs to retrieve a .9-mm handgun. Spotz returned to the kitchen with the weapon and the argument continued. Spotz fired at least seven shots at Dustin, two of which were fatal, striking him in the chest. Spotz then put the gun in his pants and fled his parents’ house with his then-girlfriend, Christina Noland (No-land), in a vehicle driven by Spotz’s stepfather.</p>

Spotz and Noland had no money or any mode of transportation, so they unsuccessfully attempted to locate a vehicle to steal. At approximately 5:30 a.m., Spotz and Noland approached the Harris Mini-Mart as June Ohlinger (Ohlinger) arrived in her car to open the store. Spotz moved toward Ohlinger with the ,9-mm handgun drawn and ordered her to the passenger side of her car. Noland got into the back of Ohlinger’s car and Spotz drove the three to a secluded area. Spotz handed the gun to Noland and proceeded to remove Ohlinger’s jewelry and money from her person. Noland returned the weapon to Spotz, who ordered Ohlinger out of the car and made her stand on the side of a bridge. Spotz shot Ohlinger in the back of the head and kicked her body into the creek over which the bridge spanned.</p>

Other crimes evidence may be admissible for a variety of evidentiary purposes.

The killings involved four different victims, committed in four counties, occurring on different days, and generating four separate criminal investigations. The first killing occurred on January 31, 1995, in Clearfield County, when [Spotz] killed his brother during a family argument. The second killing occurred on February 1, 1995, in Schuylkill County, where [Spotz], after fleeing Clearfield County, abducted [Ohlinger], stole her car and murdered her. Following that murder, [Spotz] and Noland fled to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. They returned to York County, Pennsylvania, on February 2, 1995, where they abducted [Gunnet], stole her car and [Spotz] ultimately murdered her. After murdering [Gunnet], [Spotz] fled to Harrisburg, without Noland, abducted [Amstutz], stole her car, used her to get money and lodging from the victim, and then killed her. The killings are logically connected primarily by the fact that [Spotz] committed all four of them. Furthermore, although Noland was an important witness at all three capital trials, there were other, equally important witnesses here who testified only to evidence proving that [Spotz] murdered [Amstutz], Thus, the Commonwealth called numerous witnesses to establish that [Spotz] was seen with [Amstutz] prior to her murder, that a man matching [Spotz’s] description was seen standing near a vehicle matching [Amstutz’s] at the location where her dead body was later found, and that [Spotz] was staying at the Knight’s Inn. Moreover, an investigation unique to this killing was conducted by local law enforcement officials, which resulted in testimony from different investigating officers and authorities. What this Court noted in <em>Spotz II </em>is equally applicable here: this is not a case in which the <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>Commonwealth relied solely upon the same witness(es) to prove each of the killings. Instead, the cases generated testimony of different lay and police witnesses as well as the establishment of separate chains of custody.

Noland did testify on cross-examination at her hearing to withdraw her York County guilty plea that “[C]ammerano used to always tell me that I was going to go home and I was going to get time served.” (Exhibit 12 to the Initial Brief of Spotz, Sentencing Hearing of Christina Noland, 10/7/96, at 42). However, Noland stated that she did not have any idea how long her sentence could possibly be at the time she pled guilty. <em>(Id. </em>at 18). In fact, Noland confirmed that the prosecutor never made to Noland any promises about her sentence. <em>(Id. </em>at 64-66).

Dr. Ragusea’s examination revealed the existence of post-traumatic stress disorder but ruled out the possibility of an insanity defense.

In this context, he is simply contending that trial counsel impermissibly failed to present medical records or expert testimony to establish that Spotz’s injuries were so severe that he could not have killed Ohlinger.

Given the testimony and evidence relating to Spotz’s involvement in the death of Dustin, the jurors would have reasonably inferred that Spotz would potentially be brought up on charges for that incident as well. Therefore, even if the jurors noticed the Clearfield County tag and even if, as Spotz contends, the jurors believed that the tag indicated that Spotz had been previously charged and tried for having caused the death of Dustin, Spotz has still failed to demonstrate prejudice. Thus, trial counsel was not ineffective for having failed to object or move for a mistrial on this basis. <em>Pierce, supra.</em>

According to Spotz, the prosecutor: (1) stated as a fact that Noland did not kill Ohlinger; and (2) asserted as a fact that Spotz was wanted at the time that he tried to steal a car in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania.

However, this argument of Spotz was discredited and undermined by the PCRA testimony of his own expert witness, Robert Fox (Dr. Fox), a psychiatrist. At the PCRA hearing, Dr. Fox testified that, after reviewing all of the available institutional records of the Spotz family, including those to which Dr. Ragusea was not privy, and interviewing Spotz privately at prison for three hours, he diagnosed Spotz with preexisting post-traumatic stress disorder, which dated back to his childhood as a result of abuse and neglect at home.

While testifying to the criminal record of Spotz, Gwinn stated that Spotz had pled guilty to eight counts of burglary. (Sentencing N.T., 3/5/96-3/6/96, at 29).

After the sidebar, the judge instructed the jury to disregard a portion of the testimony of Gwinn. <em>(Id. </em>at 31-32). Although the judge did not mention the misstatement in his instructions, once direct examination continued, the prosecutor asked Gwinn whether Spotz entered a plea to three counts of burglary, and Gwinn responded, “Yes.” <em>(Id. </em>at 32). Moreover, immediately following Gwinn on the stand was David John Bennett, a state parole officer, who confirmed that Spotz had pled guilty to “three counts of burglary.” <em>(Id. </em>at 34).

On this question, Mr. Justice Saylor’s Concurring and Dissenting Opinion cites the decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Hughes, </em><a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="422" data-cite="581 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1140661" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01">581 Pa. 274</a>, <a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="423" data-cite="865 A.2d 761" data-case-ids="1140661,9035570" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01,/a2d/865/0761-01">865 A.2d 761</a> (2004).

      <em>Hughes, </em>however, does not stand for the broad proposition that counsel may always be faulted for failing to anticipate any. and all future judicial interpretations of a statute.

Notably, the single case that the Majority cites in arguing that <em>Doyle </em>commands its result, <em>Thomas v.

The fact that one of the twelve Circuits believes that the rule in <em>Wainwright v.

There simply is no special finding on the record to the effect that Appellant actually perpetrated the killing of the victim; Appellant adduced affirmative evidence tending to support his defense theory that his accomplice, Christina Nolan, was the actual killer, <em>see e.g., </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 49 n. 31, 896 A.2d at 1220 n. 31 (citing testimony of Darcy Smith and Lawrence Shugars); the primary direct evidence that Appellant was the actual shooter derived from Nolan, who, by virtue of applicable law, is to be regarded as a tainted source, <em>see </em>N.T., March 2, 1996, at 770 (reflecting the trial court’s directive that the jurors “shall view [Nolan's] testimony with disfavor because it comes from a corrupt and polluted source”); the trial court affirmatively instructed the jury in the guilt phase of trial that Appellant could be held liable for first-degree murder as an accomplice, <em>see id. </em>at 788-90; and the jury returned a general verdict to first-degree murder.</p>

For example, the <em>Kelly </em>majority specifically credited the state court decision tinder review for correctly framing the legal issue arising under <em>Simmons </em>by considering whether the defendant's future dangerousness was "a logical inference from the evidence," <em>or </em>was injected into the case through the State's closing argument. <em>Kelly, </em>534 U.S. at 252, 122 S.Ct. at 731.

During Appellant’s trial, the Commonwealth asserted two alternative theories of guilt for the first-degree murder charge: (1) Appellant pulled the trigger and was directly <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>responsible for murdering the victim; or (2) Ms. Noland pulled the trigger, but Appellant had the intent to kill and thus Appellant was guilty as an accomplice. It is well-settled law that in order for an accomplice to be guilty of first-degree murder, it must be determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the accomplice possessed the necessary specific intent to take a life. <em>Commonwealth v.

According to the majority, “[ajbsent an admission from Spotz that he had shot and killed [the victim], trial counsel could not have presented a diminished capacity defense.” Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 47, 896 A.2d at 1218. However, pursuant to the intent requirements necessary to establish accomplice liability for first-degree murder, this is not so. Where, as here, the Commonwealth asserts alternate theories of liability, the defense may put on alternate theories of defense, even when those alternative theories are inconsistent. <em>Commonwealth v. Legg, </em><a href="/pa/551/0437-02" class="citation" data-index="502" data-cite="551 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="507770,507790" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0437-02,/pa/551/0437-01">551 Pa. 437</a>, <a href="/a2d/711/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="503" data-cite="711 A.2d 430" data-case-ids="11820697,507770" data-case-paths="/a2d/711/0430-01,/pa/551/0437-02">711 A.2d 430</a> (1998); <em>Commonwealth v.

Therefore, in response to the alternate theories of liability asserted by the Commonwealth, the defense could have responded: (1) Appellant did not pull the trigger and did not realize, or intend, that Ms. Noland would pull the trigger; and (2) if, for some reason, the jury concludes that Appellant did realize that Ms. Noland was going to kill the victim, then they should be aware that Appellant did not have the capacity to form the intent necessary to commit first-degree murder. As Justice Saylor aptly discusses in his Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, because this court and others have frowned on'the use of a diminished capacity defense in the alternative, trial counsel’s failure to raise such an alternative defense does not necessarily rise to the level of ineffectiveness. <em>See </em>Saylor, J., Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 106-08, 896 A.2d at 1254-55.</p>

However, because the plain meaning of § 9711(d)(6) explicitly requires that the <em>defendant </em>must have committed the murder at issue, and because defense attorneys should be held to a standard which at a minimum includes an ability to carefully read the statute, I find that the claim has arguable merit, fulfilling the first part of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Commonwealth v.
