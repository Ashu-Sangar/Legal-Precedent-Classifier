    <p id="b739-8" data-blocks='[["BL_739.9",739,[157,886,1159,1341]]]'>The primary issue on appeal is whether appellees Andrea D. Wilkes, David H. Ehrenwerth, and Charles K. Clark, trustees of the Mark E. and Myrna L. Mason Irrevocable Trust, and Mark E. Mason and Myrna L. Mason (collectively “appellees”), are barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>from bringing suit in Pennsylvania against appellant, Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company (“appellant” or “Phoenix”), due to an out-of-state class action settlement in New York. The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County granted summary judgment for Phoenix and dismissed appellees’ suit, finding that since appellees had not opted out of a class action settlement filed in New York state court against appellant concerning the failure of some of its insurance policies to perform as promised, <em>res judicata </em>barred appellees from subsequently bringing suit against appellant in Pennsylvania on the same matter. On appeal, however, the Superior Court found that the class action notice apprising appellees of the New York settlement was constitutionally inadequate and reversed the trial court. This Court granted further review to determine the <em>res judicata </em>effect of the New York class action settlement, including the question of whether the class action settlement notice was constitutionally adequate. For the following reasons, we find that the Superior Court’s decision was in error and, accordingly, we reverse that order and reinstate the trial court order granting Phoenix summary judgment.</p>

Mason (“the Masons”) established a trust to purchase $7 million in <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>life insurance that would enable the Masons’ children to pay estate taxes without having to dispose of any illiquid portion of their estate. Andrea D. Wilkes, eldest daughter of the Masons, David Ehrenwerth, lawyer for the Masons, and Charles K. Clark, accountant for the Masons (collectively “Trustees”), were selected as the trustees for the trust. The Masons desired a policy where the premiums would diminish over time and, eventually, cease altogether at Mr. Mason’s retirement, a point when the Masons would welcome fewer financial obligations.</p>

Lenenberg suggested that the Masons purchase a whole life insurance second-to-die policy from appellant called a “Survivorship Life Protector” (“SLP”), with a rider referred to as “Optionterm,” that would function as annual term insurance. Appellant advertised the proposed policy with phrases such as “quick pay,” “rapid pay,” and “vanishing premium.” Theoretically under this plan, after premium payments had been made for fifteen years, the policy would produce enough dividends and paid-up additions<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> to obviate the need for further out-of-pocket premium payments. The targeted death-benefit value of the policy at the death of the second-to-die (i.e., Mark or Myrna) was $7 million. The proposed whole life insurance portion of the policy consisted of nearly $4.1 million, with the “Optionterm” rider contributing approximately an additional $2.9 million. Based on Lenenberg’s projections, the base annual premium cost for the first five years <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>would be $80,813, with the last of such payments required in 1993. The premium payments would then decline to $60,813 through 1999, and would diminish to $40,813 until the last premium payment in 2003. No premium payments would be owed after 2003. Lenenberg’s projections did not illustrate any payment scenario to demonstrate what effect the first death of either Mark or Myrna Mason would have on the premiums.</p>
    <p id="b741-4" data-blocks='[["BL_741.5",741,[165,746,1154,457]]]'>In 1989, the Trustees purchased the SLP policy with the “Optionterm” rider. The policy summary showed that the face value of the whole life insurance was $4,117,647, and the “target face amount” of the “Optionterm” rider was $2,882,353.

Appellant responded by letter in April of that year:</p>

The letter also provided a new illustration showing that the premium payments would last until the twenty-third year of the policy (as opposed to the fifteenth year) and decline at a slower rate than initially expected. The Trustees then contacted Lenenberg about this letter and, subsequently, appellant reissued a new illustration conforming to the original proposal from 1989.

Phoenix later provided several illustrations in response to Lenenberg’s inquiry on behalf of the Masons and the Trustees, but again none of the illustrations included a first-to-die death scenario. In March of 1995, Ehrenwerth contacted Lenenberg to inquire why the Trustees had received a notice stating that an additional $5,584.41 was owed on the policy, when Lenenberg had previously indicated that a payment of $60,813 would be sufficient for 1995. Because there were not enough paid-up additions in 1995 to account for the premium expenses in excess of the payment that the Trustees had made for that year, the Trustees took a loan on the policy, as suggested by Phoenix, to cover the balance due. In February and March of 1996, appellant produced additional illustrations to show how the premium payments would change if the Masons altered their out-of-pocket premium payments for a few years. Again, no death scenario was reflected in the charts provided.</p>

In addition, the present suit concerns the same subject matter as the class action; indeed, in both cases, the claims against appellant include allegations that it misled its policyholders into purchasing an insurance policy with the “quick pay” feature and the policy did not perform as promised. Moreover, a final judgment on the merits was rendered in <em>Michels, </em>as the New York court in that case rendered an opinion on the adequacy of the class settlement, which is deemed a final order under New York law. <em>See Sound Distributing Corp., </em><a href="/citations/?q=577%20N.Y.S.2d%20863" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="577 N.Y.S.2d 863">577 N.Y.S.2d at 863</a>.

Appellant emphasizes that the notice clearly explained that appellees would be subject to the terms of the class settlement if they failed to opt out of it, and that all known or unknown claims that may thereafter exist would be precluded by the settlement. In response to appellees’ claim that the notice should have provided more information concerning their specific policy, appellant counters that appellees failed to seek further information by calling the toll-free number provided in the <em>Michels </em>notice and in the accompanying brochure. Appellant also notes the impracticality of the Superior Court’s adverse decision, as it effectively would require that specific information pertaining to individual policies should have been disseminated to the 510,000 potential class members who were affected in <em>Michels. </em>Appellant submits that constitutional requirements respecting notice impose a more practical and less burdensome duty: class notice need only provide a reliable means for interested parties to become apprised of the pending action and an opportunity to present objections. Appellant argues that the toll-fee number provided this necessary forum for each potential plaintiff to learn what specific impact the class action would hold for an individual policy. Finally, appellant argues that the fraud <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>alleged should not have any effect on reviewing the adequacy of the class notice because appellees had notice and an opportunity to participate in the litigation, as well as warnings that they could not bring any claims against appellant in later litigation.</p>

In support of this reasoning, appellees point to appellant’s failure to notify them of the effect that a death of one, but not both, of the Masons would have on future policy premiums. Appellees argue that the Superior Court rightly found that injury to the Masons had not manifested itself at the time of the settlement, that the class notice omitted necessary information, and that appellant deliberately prevented appellees from learning of the nature of the Masons’ harm under the policy.

In <em>Epstein, </em>the dominant issue was the adequacy of class representation, while <em>Stephenson </em>pertained to the propriety of a class member’s inclusion in the class which was subject to a prior settlement. In <em>Epstein, </em>the settlement court had already reviewed specific challenges to class counsel’s representation, but in <em>Stephenson </em>the certifying and direct appeal courts had not previously addressed the interests of class members who became injured following the exhaustion of the 1984 settlement funds. Thus, the two approaches may not necessarily represent a schism in the law, so much as the reality that courts reviewing a collateral attack on a class settlement, and asked to balance judicial efficiency, finality of a judgment, and an individual’s due process rights, may reasonably make different determinations in different circumstances. Class actions do promote judicial efficiency by resolving claims shared by a large number of individuals when <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>they are respected as final.

Second, the four-page question and answer brochure made clear that the instant insurance policy was covered in the suit, as it stated that vanishing premium policies were included in the plaintiffs’ action, and that an offset for “Optionterm” policies would be automatically awarded in the settlement. The brochure, like the letter, also provided counsel’s toll-free number for further information.

SLP policies were only one type of whole life insurance policy that might be adversely impacted by the vanishing premium policy option that was a primary claim in <em>Michels, </em>a claim that appellees were made amply aware of in the class notice. Due process does not require the notice to list every policy in which vanishing premiums are involved. Instead, an individu<a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>al of reasonable intelligence could comprehend from the <em>Michels </em>notice that if he has an insurance policy with vanishing premiums, whatever the type of underlying policy, then that policy will be affected by the class settlement and he should investigate to determine the best course in his individual circumstances. The Superior Court’s approach would essentially require that the notice list every potential negative consequence of having a policy with “vanishing premiums” or “quick pay,” such as the possibility for premiums to skyrocket for SLP policies. This requirement, we believe, is too burdensome — and it certainly is not required to satisfy basic notions of due process.

Second, the Court ruled that the putative class could not satisfy Rule 23(a)(4)’s requirement that the named parties fairly and adequately represent the class’s interests, since class members currently suffering from asbestos disability would desire a immediate compensation for their injuries, whereas exposure-only claimants would be interested in preserving an ample fund for future possible expenses. <em><a href="/us/521/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="521 U.S. 591" data-case-ids="915571" data-case-paths="/us/521/0591-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/521/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="521 U.S. 591" data-case-ids="915571" data-case-paths="/us/521/0591-01">at 625</a>, <a href="/us/521/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="521 U.S. 591" data-case-ids="915571" data-case-paths="/us/521/0591-01">117 S.Ct. at 2250</a>.

The panel nevertheless proceeded to find that appellees were like the exposure-only claimants in <em>Amchem Products, </em>who were unaware of their asbestos exposure and the potential health risk, because appellees “had no reason to believe they had or were being defrauded as they had received numerous assurances from Phoenix and Lenenberg that their policy coverage was as originally represented in 1989.” Therefore, in the panel’s view, appellees did not have the necessary information to decide whether to stay in or opt out of the class action. <em><a href="/a2d/851/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="851 A.2d 204" data-case-ids="9235088" data-case-paths="/a2d/851/0204-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/851/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="851 A.2d 204" data-case-ids="9235088" data-case-paths="/a2d/851/0204-01">at 213</a>. But the panel’s finding in this regard is contradicted by the fact that the policy premium bill for 1994 was $20,000 more than the Masons expected, policy illustrations from 1994 showed the decline of premium payments occurring at a slower rate than initially expected, and the Masons had to borrow roughly $5,500 on their policy in 1995 to account for an unexpected premium payment shortage. While it is true that at the time the Masons had to decide whether or not to opt out of the class action they were unaware of the extent to which they might be defrauded in the future, they had ample evidence that their policy was not operating as advertised at the <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>time the class action notice arrived. Thus, even assuming that <em>Amchem Products </em>would support a holding that class notice is deficient where it does not provide class members with sufficient information to determine whether they share in the injury alleged to have been caused by the defendant, it is of no avail to appellees here because they were given multiple indications that they had suffered the type of injury that was covered by the class action.</p>

In the alternative, appellant argues that appellees were well aware that their policy was not operating as initially expected, they had opportunities to inquire about the class action’s effect on the policy, and they never took reasonable steps to do so. Appellant argues that the only time period that is relevant to appellees’ fraud claim is from August to October of 1996, during the opt-out period, since appellees only claim fraud in inducing them to fail to opt out of the class action. Appellant further contends that any improper illustrations it provided to appellees before that time are irrelevant because claims of that nature were directly addressed by the <em>Michels </em>suit.

Although Phoenix disputes that Lenenberg had an agency relationship with them, appellees claim that this relationship must be accepted as true for purposes of summary judgment. Moreover, appellees argue that appellant is not entitled to an inference that appellees were on notice of the policy defects, as appellees assert that they reasonably relied on appellant’s false and misleading representations and their right to rely on these representations is a question of fact. Lastly, appellees dispute appellant’s contention that they must prove fraud occurred in connection with the <em>Michels </em>class action attorneys. Appellees argue that public policy requires that courts ensure that an individual plaintiff’s rights in a class action are not sacrificed by “collusive attorneys;” therefore, courts must examine claims of fraud with respect to the individual class members. Appellees also assert that it is unrealistic to expect class members to actively contact class counsel and inform counsel of a defendant’s and defendant’s agent’s representations to a class member.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

Recognizing that this risk of relitigation inheres in our federal system, the Framers provided that ‘Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.’ U.S. Const., art. IV, § 1. This Court has consistently recognized that, in order to fulfill this constitutional mandate, ‘the judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect, in every other court of the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced.’</blockquote>

Appellees did not know that this aspect of their policy varied from their original discussions and request for coverage. Nor did they have any reason to doubt the veracity of Appellant’s and Lenenberg’s representations until over one year after the period for invoking ADR ended. Appellant and its agent deliberately kept Appellees ignorant of their situation. As such, Appellees did not have the information or foresight needed to decide, intelli<a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>gently, whether to stay in or opt out of the <em>Michels </em>class action or whether the notice of settlement applied to them.</p>

As such, I would remand to the trial court and allow the matter to proceed past the summary judgment stage and allow Appellees the opportunity to prove the alleged fraud.</p>

Although his discussion is well-written and is a persuasive argument concerning the choice of <em>res judicata </em>doctrine, I cannot join it at this time because it is not properly before us. Again, as discussed <em>infra, </em>because fraud is found in the record as viewed in the light most favorable to Appellees, the matter should not be precluded or governed by the <em>res judicata </em>doctrine.</p>

In addition, I would err on the side of allowing review of the decision of another jurisdiction when it is possible that fraud, a different issue, or any other material difference exists.
