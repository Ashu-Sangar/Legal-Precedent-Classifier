Second, the majority noted that the procedural defect at issue in <em>Ward </em>was that the magistrate retained a financial interest in the outcome of the case, whereas the present dispute concerns the assertion that the Board, as a matter of policy, improperly considers extra-record evidence in the adjudication process. As these claims implicate two distinct aspects of procedural due process, the Commonwealth Court majority considered <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>the Supreme Court’s reasoning in <em>Ward </em>inapplicable to the present case. <em>See <a href="/a2d/847/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="847 A.2d 172" data-case-ids="9256382" data-case-paths="/a2d/847/0172-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/847/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="847 A.2d 172" data-case-ids="9256382" data-case-paths="/a2d/847/0172-01">at 175-76</a>. Hence, and in light of the subsequent <em>de novo </em>review statutorily afforded to Appellants, the majority held that equitable relief was unavailable. Finally, concerning the civil rights claim under Section 1983, the Commonwealth Court majority explained that such challenge may not be brought without first exhausting administrative remedies, and Appellants may not maintain a claim under Section 1983 where, as here, the state’s administrative process provides an adequate remedy. <em>See <a href="/a2d/847/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="847 A.2d 172" data-case-ids="9256382" data-case-paths="/a2d/847/0172-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/847/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="847 A.2d 172" data-case-ids="9256382" data-case-paths="/a2d/847/0172-01">at 176</a>.</p>

However, she declined to join the majority’s disposition of the other claims. She noted that Appellants’ complaint was in the form of a class action lawsuit, alleging that hundreds of real estate tax assessment decisions were tainted by the receipt of non-record evidence; she observed, in this regard, that, to defeat equity jurisdiction, the legal remedy provided must be “full, perfect and complete,” and that, where relying solely on the statutory appeal mechanism would result in a “multiplicity of duplicative lawsuits and, in contrast, an action in equity would provide a tidy global resolution,” the legal remedy should be deemed inadequate. <em>Pentlong Corp. v.

In the Section 1983 context, however, the lack-of-an-adequate-legal-remedy prerequisite is motivated by the federal government’s reluctance to interfere with state tax operations, and its resulting “hands-off approach.” <em>National Private Truck Council, </em><a href="/us/515/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="515 U.S. 582" data-case-ids="1564347" data-case-paths="/us/515/0582-01">515 U.S. at 586</a>, <a href="/us/515/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="515 U.S. 582" data-case-ids="1564347" data-case-paths="/us/515/0582-01">115 S.Ct. at 2354</a>; <em>see supra </em>note 11.

A fourth Justice concurred in the result and expressed the view that the conflict between <em>Lynch </em>and <em>Rochester </em>was illusory. In his view, because assessment appeal boards merely review tax assessments and have no constitutional expertise, any time a substantial constitutional question arises concerning the assessment process, the statutory remedy is inadequate, as following it would result in a multiplicity of duplicative lawsuits. <em>See id. </em>at 283-86, <a href="/pa/459/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="459 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="481054" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0268-01">328 A.2d at 826-28</a> (Roberts, J., concurring).</p>

GLS Capital, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/573/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="573 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="197190" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0034-01">573 Pa. 34</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="159" data-cite="820 A.2d 1240" data-case-ids="197190,9315622" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0034-01,/a2d/820/1240-01">820 A.2d 1240</a>, 1245 (2003).</p>

      <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>In the instant matter, the question is whether Appellants have qualified for this exception by establishing that a <em>de novo </em>appeal to the trial court from an unfavorable decision by the Board is not adequate or complete. The Majority concludes that Appellants have shown that such a remedy is not adequate or complete and thus qualify for the exception. The Majority provides several bases of support for this conclusion. First, the Majority reasons that allowing this class action matter to proceed in equity would achieve the laudable goal of avoiding “a multiplicity of individual <em>de novo </em>appeals to the trial court____” M.O. at 559, 901 A.2d at 1012 (relying on <em>Pentlong, supra). </em>The Majority also finds that this matter should be allowed to proceed in equity because “the general procedures of which Appellants complain can be facially tested against constitutional norms unaided by agency expertise.... ” <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Majority concludes that equity jurisdiction was properly invoked based on the speculation that “many of the taxpayers potentially affected by the Board’s procedures may not have known” that the decision in their appeals was premised on evidence which is allegedly <em>dehors </em>the record. <em>Id. </em>at at 559, 901 A.2d at 1012. Thus, equity will lie because some taxpayers may have failed to pursue their statutorily-allowed appeal because they were ignorant of this potential due process claim.</p>

First, I do not believe that <em>Pentlong </em>holds that equity jurisdiction may be invoked simply because such invocation will avoid having multiple matters proceed through the legislatively-endorsed appeals process. It is true that the <em>Pentlong </em>Court’s concern over piecemeal litigation supported the Court’s decision to allow the plaintiffs to forego the statutory remedy and invoke equity jurisdiction. <em>See Pentlong, </em><a href="/pa/573/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="160" data-cite="820 A.2d 1240" data-case-ids="197190,9315622" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0034-01,/a2d/820/1240-01">820 A.2d at 1246</a>. Yet, what drove the <em>Pentlong </em>decision was not simply that equity jurisdiction would provide “a tidy global resolution” to that controversy. <em><a href="/pa/573/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="820 A.2d 1240" data-case-ids="197190,9315622" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0034-01,/a2d/820/1240-01">Id.</a> </em>Rather, the <em>Pentlong </em>Court noted that that matter involved “purely legal challenges....” <em><a href="/pa/573/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="820 A.2d 1240" data-case-ids="197190,9315622" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0034-01,/a2d/820/1240-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/573/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="820 A.2d 1240" data-case-ids="197190,9315622" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0034-01,/a2d/820/1240-01">at 1247</a>. In <em>Pentlong, </em>there was no simmering question of fact; in that matter, it was undisputed that the County of Allegheny (“County”) sold its title and rights over thousands of tax hens located within <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>the County. Thus, that matter was well-suited to resolution via a class action in equity. In contrast, in the matter <em>sub judice, </em>there are open questions as to whether all members of the class had the assessment appeals determined via reliance on evidence <em>dehors </em>the record. A “tidy global resolution” will thus not be afforded by a class action in equity.</p>
    <p id="b711-4" data-blocks='[["BL_711.5",711,[166,631,1157,924]]]'>I also reject the Majority’s reasoning that equity jurisdiction is proper here because “the general procedures of which Appellants complain can be facially tested against constitutional norms unaided by agency expertise____” M.O. at at 559, 901 A.2d at 1012. By stating that “agency expertise” is not needed here, the Majority implies that equity is properly invoked because funneling these matters through further agency adjudication will not aid in resolution of these matters. This is paper tiger reasoning. Appellants have already appeared before the Board. In fact, it is the Board’s actions which Appellants complain are constitutionally deficient. The next step in the statutory appeals process which Appellants are trying to avoid would have taken them not to an administrative body but rather to the trial court. Thus, the fact that “agency expertise” is not necessary in the resolution of these legal issues is of no moment because “agency expertise” would not have been sought had Appellants followed the statutory appellate process.</p>
    <p id="b711-6" data-blocks='[["BL_711.6",711,[162,1578,1159,614]]]'>Finally, the Majority reasons that equity is properly invoked because some taxpayers may have declined to take a statutory appeal as they may have been unaware that the Board relied on evidence <em>dehors </em>the record in determining their assessment appeals. Even if we accept such speculation as true, I do not see how it renders the statutory process inadequate or incomplete. As noted by the Commonwealth Court, the statutory process allows taxpayers to ferret out information via discovery. <em>See </em>Commw. Ct. slip op. at 8. And any constitutional issues which a taxpayer would wish to raise could adequately and completely be addressed to a trial court in a <em>de novo </em>appeal.</p>
    <p id="b711-7" data-blocks='[["BL_711.7",711,[162,2214,1158,145]],["BL_712.1",712,[299,310,1153,199]]]'>I fear that the Majority’s interpretation of when a statutory remedy is incomplete and inadequate is so broad that the exception threatens to engulf the rule. As I believe that <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>Appellants have not shown that the statutory remedy is either incomplete or inadequate, I dissent to that portion of the majority’s order and would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
