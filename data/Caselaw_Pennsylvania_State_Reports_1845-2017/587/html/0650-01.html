The first question is whether Section 2711(a)(5) of the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S. § 2101 <em>et seq., </em>requires the consent of appellant Washington County Children and Youth Agency (the “Agency”) for appellees to have standing to petition to adopt the children.

W.U. is the biological father of C.J.U., and K.F. is the biological father of J.E.F. and N.G.F. On October 2, 2003, by order of the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County, the parental rights of the mother and both fathers were terminated, and the Agency was ordered to maintain custody of the children pending a final adoption decree. The two younger children continued placements in two separate foster homes, while C.J.U. remained in a residential group home.</p>

On the same date, the Agency, apparently acting as intermediary for the foster parents of the two younger children, filed competing petitions for adoption of those two children. The trial court consolidated the petitions, set a hearing date of January 28, 2004, and appointed a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to represent the children. On January 21, 2004, one week prior to the scheduled hearing, the Agency filed a motion to dismiss appellees’ petitions for adoption and a motion requesting de-consolidation of the various adoption petitions. If granted, the latter motion would prevent appellees from participating at all in the foster parents’ adoption proceedings. The motion to dismiss noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Agency had “expressly consented” to the adoption of the two younger children by their respective foster families, while the Agency did not consent to the adoption of any of the three children by appellees. For the proposition that such selective (ie., petition-specific) Agency consent was required before appellees could petition for adoption, the Agency cited Section 2711(a)(5) of the Adoption Act, which provides as follows:</p>

The court suggested that agency consent to appellees’ petitions in this case was “required pursuant to the best interests of the children.” The court opined that the Agency knew the children, their history, their needs, and what was best for them in terms of their long-care placement. Rejecting the concerns of the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>who had suggested that the views of all persons expressing an interest in the children should be considered and that the three children should be preserved in a family unit, the court noted that the children had not lived as a family unit for more than two years, the two younger children had settled into their foster homes, and each set of foster parents wished to adopt their respective foster child. The court concluded that it was compelled to deny appellees standing to participate in any of the adoption proceedings, and the denial of standing could not be overcome absent “proper consent under the Adoption Act.” Trial court slip op. at 5-8.</p>

The panel then discussed this Court’s holding in-Hess and the decision in <em>In re Adoption of A.M.T., </em><a href="/a2d/803/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="803 A.2d 203" data-case-ids="11447210" data-case-paths="/a2d/803/0203-01">803 A.2d 203</a> (Pa.Super.2002), where the Superior Court had permitted the paternal aunt and uncle of children whose parents had died as the result of a murder-suicide to petition for adoption notwithstanding the absence of consent from the children’s guardian, a maternal aunt. From these decisions, the panel derived ah overarching proposition that interested prospective adoptive parents who have a familial relationship with the adoptee(s) should be permitted to participate in adoption proceedings so that the best interests of the children could be fully explored before the court. <a href="/a2d/864/1207-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="864 A.2d 1207" data-case-ids="9043261" data-case-paths="/a2d/864/1207-01">864 A.2d at 1210-12</a>.</p>

Further, the panel rejected the Agency’s argument, which was founded upon the dissenting opinion in <em>Hess, </em>that, the termination of the parental rights of the mother and father automatically and necessarily terminated any legal interest that other family members may have had regarding the children. In the panel’s view, appellees remained the aunt and uncle of the children despite the termination of parental rights. Having determined that the lower court erred in denying appellees standing, the panel did not pass upon appellees’ alternative argument that the Agency’s refusal to consent to the proposed adoptions here was unreasonable. Finally, the panel found <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>that the separate adoption petitions should be heard together, thereby ensuring that all relevant evidence concerning the best interests of the children could be heard. The panel remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. <a href="/a2d/864/1207-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="864 A.2d 1207" data-case-ids="9043261" data-case-paths="/a2d/864/1207-01">864 A.2d at 1212-14</a>.</p>

Appellant further argues that standing is a preliminary, jurisdictional question, resolvable as a matter of law. Like the trial court, appellant supports its statutory construction argument, in part, by citing as if it were controlling the OISA in <em>Cunningham, </em>without recognizing that the <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>opinion lacks precedential value, and without discussing the competing views of the three Justices who comprised the OISR in that case.

This is so, appellant maintains, because appellees are merely the aunt and uncle of children whose parents’ rights have been terminated and who have been placed in the custody of appellant, a public agency, thus rendering appellees disinterested third parties. Indeed, appellant goes so far as to declare that: “The laws of adoption are clear. Once parental rights are terminated, the familial ties to the whole family are severed.” Brief of Appellant, 14. In support of this “clear law,” appellant cites to the dissenting opinion in <em>Hess. </em>Under appellant’s reading of the Act and the case authority, when it serves as a legal custodian or guardian of children, it essentially has the unilateral power (via its unchecked power to withhold consent) to veto an adoption petition of which it does not approve, and it thereby has the power to control who may participate in an adoption proceeding.</p>

This construct, of course, would allow the custodial agency to maintain a gatekeeping role nonetheless; Appellant then stresses that, in its Pa.R.A.P.1925 opinion, the trial court “found” that appellant did not unreasonably withhold its consent; instead, it considered the best interests of the children.

Appellees argue that a guardian is distinct from an entity merely having physical custody of a child. They note that custody is granted by order of the Family Division of the Court of Common Pleas or, in limited circumstances, by order of the Juvenile Division or the Orphans’ Court. In the Family Division, appellees note, only three types of individuals can be granted custody: parents pursuant <a id="p664" href="#p664" data-label="664" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*664</a>to 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5301 and 5303, grandparents pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5311-13, and parties standing in <em>loco parentis </em>to a child pursuant to decisional law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> In the Juvenile Division, on the other hand, a child welfare agency may be awarded custody after a child is removed from his parents’ home and adjudicated dependent. 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6324 and 6351.

C.S. §§ 5112-13 and Pa.O.C.R. 12.5 (guardianship of a minor child); 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 5511-12 and Pa.O.C.R. 14.1 (guardianship of an incapacitated person); 23 Pa.C.S. § 2313(a), 42 Pa.C.S. § 6311 and Pa.O.C.R. 12.4 (guardian <em>ad litem). </em>In appellees’ view, the fact that Section 2711(a)(5) requires consent of the “guardian of the person” of the adoptee is significant because the law distinguishes between “guardians of the person” and “guardians of the estate,” with each occupying a distinct “sphere of authority.” Appellees note that a guardian of the person is responsible for the physical care of a minor (or other incapacitated person), while a guardian of the estate would be responsible for the subject’s property. Appellant was never made guardian of the person of any of the children; instead, it merely was awarded custody as an incident of the termination of parental rights.

Appellees stress that each subpart of Section 2711(a) involves a distinct, common factual scenario <a id="p665" href="#p665" data-label="665" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*665</a>where a specific person’s consent is required, <em>i.e., </em>the adoptee, if over 12 years of age at (a)(1); the spouse of the adopting parent at (a)(2); the parent(s) of an adoptee under age 18 at (a)(3); the guardian of an incapacitated adoptee at (a)(4); and subsection (a)(5), at issue here. Appellees argue that (a)(5), like the previous subsections, is designed to capture a specific scenario — instances where there is a court-appointed guardian of the person. Consent under that subsection is required of, “[t]he guardian of the person of an adoptee under the age of 18 years, if any there be, or of the person or persons having custody of the adoptee, if any such person can be found, whenever the adoptee has no parent whose consent is required.” Appellees claim that the language “the guardian of the person” is grammatically linked both with “of the adoptee” and “of the person or persons having custody of the adoptee.” Thus, appellees read this provision as providing that consent is required of the court-appointed guardian of the person of the minor adoptee, where one exists; and/or of the court-appointed guardian of the person of an incapacitated adult who has custody of the minor adoptee, where one exists. Appellees note that incapacitated persons have children, too, and those incapacitated persons may also have guardians. This subsection, appellees reason, is intended to address, and plainly addresses, that distinct scenario. Because appellant was neither appointed guardian of the person of the adoptees here, nor guardian of the person who had custody of the adoptees, appellees contend, appellant’s consent to adopt was not statutorily implicated.</p>

Appellees contend that the Superior Court properly dispensed with the consent requirement in this case in accordance with Section 2713(2), <em>Hess </em>and <em>A.M.T. </em>In <em>Hess, </em>this Court held that agency consent was not required where the grandparents of the children sought to intervene in an adoption proceeding.

In the alternative, appellees argue that the trial court, at a minimum, should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether to dispense with the Agency’s consent to appellees’ proposed adoption of the children.</p>

The guardian <em>ad litem </em>argues that the Superior Court determination was thorough; it was consistent with the plain language of Section 2713(2); it was consistent with this Court’s reasoning in <em>Hess; </em>it was consistent with other relevant authority respecting the standing of other extended family members; and, “most importantly,” it was consistent with what was in the best interests of these children.</p>

But, the difficulty with appellant’s claim, that its failure to consent alone operates to eviscerate the very standing of a party that would seek to adopt, is that this provision, by its plain language, never purports to speak to standing, much less does the provision suggest that the consequence of withholding consent is to eliminate standing. That the Act does not contemplate delegation to custodial agencies of gatekeeping authority over adoption petitions is plainly demonstrated by Section 2713(2), which authorizes the trial court to dispense with consents “in its discretion.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> That <a id="p667" href="#p667" data-label="667" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*667</a>conferral of broad discretionary authority upon the trial court comes with no strings attached in a case, such as this one, where the adoptee’s consent is not at issue, and the adoptee is under 18 and has no living parent from whom consent is required.

However, we respectfully do not agree that the logic of that rationale commands a finding that the same total severance should be deemed to have occurred earlier, when parental rights are terminated. When the child is in that indeterminate state prior to a decree of adoption, there is not yet a new family into which he can be enfolded. A child’s aunt and uncle who indicate an interest in adopting the child at that stage are not a threat to the nurturing and maintenance of the new family bond; indeed, if their petition is heard and prevails, it is their family which will be the one to enfold the child. Moreover, <a id="p671" href="#p671" data-label="671" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*671</a>they may well be the most logical persons to adopt and, in many instances, the agency may be promoting their role as adoptive parents. More importantly, for purposes of the mere preliminary question of standing, a child’s blood aunt and uncle who indicate an interest in adoption clearly have an interest which surpasses that of the ordinary, unrelated citizen.

We do not agree. First of all, although appellant may not like the result, <em>Hess </em>was bottomed in statutory analysis and, for purposes of this appeal, that statutory analysis is sound. One of the arguments forwarded by the custodial agency in <em>Hess </em>was that the grandparents’ intervention was an exercise in futility because the agency had the power to refuse to consent to an adoption by the grandparents under Section 2711(a)(5), and it did not intend to confer that consent. The argument, thus, was similar to the argument appellant has forwarded here. The <em>Hess </em>Court soundly rejected the notion that the agency’s consent would be dispositive of the <a id="p673" href="#p673" data-label="673" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*673</a>grandparents’ prospects under the Act, noting, <em>inter alia, </em>that “it is clear from the Act that the court’s concern is not the will of the agency but the best interests of the child” and “[t]he agency’s wishes, therefore, are to be considered in light of that objective.” <em>Hess, </em><a href="/pa/530/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="530 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1833057" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0218-01">608 A.2d at 14</a>.

Since the parties at issue in <em>Hess </em>were grandparents, this observation obviously was unnecessary to the decision, and we do not suggest that any and all persons who declare an interest in an adoption proceeding must be heard. Nor do we deny that a party’s alleged “substantial, direct, and immediate interest” in an adoption may be affected by other restrictions arising under other provisions of the Adoption Act. <em>See, e.g., </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 2531(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> We simply hold that a custodial agency’s refusal to consent to an adoption does not, on its own, deprive a person who otherwise has a stake in the litigation standing to pursue that interest.

The party filing such a petition, however, must meet the requirements of Section 2701 entitled, “Contents of petition for adoption,” including subsection (7), which requires that the petition include the requisite consents contemplated by Section 2711 or the “basis upon which such consents are not required.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 2701(7). In a case where the party has not secured the Section 2711 consents, the party may request that the court dispense with the consent requirement under Section 2713 where the adoptee is over age 18 or where the “adoptee is under age eighteen and has no parent living whose consent is required.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 2713. If such leave is sought, the trial court, with or without a hearing as it deems necessary, shall decide whether it serves the proposed adoptee(s) best interests to dispense with the agency’s consent, <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>thereby permitting the petitioners to proceed with their petition for adoption. Although a custodial agency’s consent to a party’s proposed adoption is certainly relevant, and may even be deemed determinative by the court in conducting the best interests inquiry, otherwise necessary consents may be dispensed with by the court in its broad discretion. This statutory construct affords the trial court flexibility in determining what is best for the child, which is certainly a salutary consideration. We decline to interfere with the construct by imposing an artificial “standing” restriction which is not commanded by the Act. Instead, it is for the trial court, in the discretion afforded it under the Act, to determine whether it is in the best interests of the child to allow a party to proceed with the petition for adoption absent the statutory consents.</p>
    <p id="b819-5" data-blocks='[["BL_819.5",819,[154,1060,1158,620]]]'>We turn now to appellant’s alternative argument that the trial court, in its opinion, found that appellant did not unreasonably withhold consent to appellees’ adoption petition, and thus the court’s holding that appellees lacked standing should be affirmed on that ground. There are multiple flaws with this argument. First, the court’s order, which is the subject of this appeal, did not address this alternative argument; instead, the order was confined to the <em>per se </em>notion that the absence of agency consent alone deprived appellees of standing and rendered the court powerless to entertain appellees’ adoption petition. The discussion in the court’s opinion does not alter the nature of the order.</p>
    <p id="b819-6" data-blocks='[["BL_819.6",819,[152,1713,1157,253]]]'>Second, even in its opinion, the trial court still determined that the consequence of the custodial agency’s failure to consent, if reasonable, was to deprive appellees of standing.

The approach thus preserves a preliminary gatekeeping function for the agency — less absolute, but gatekeeping nevertheless— which would restrict the information and options available to the court in the substantive adoption proceedings. This approach cannot be squared with the Act. Nothing in the plain language of Section 271S(2)’s conferral of broad discretionary power upon the court requires it to deem a custodial agency’s “reasonable” refusal to consent to be conclusive of anything, much less the preliminary question of standing.</p>

However, such a scheme would insure that the courts, not social service agencies, make the final decision as to whether adoption is in the best interests of the child in any given case.

There is no suggestion that a more stringent test for standing should apply in adoption matters, based upon the inherent nature of the action; rather, appellant confines itself to interpretation of the Act and traditional notions of standing.</p>

A maternal aunt was declared guardian of the decedent’s two younger children while the third child, who was fifteen, refused to consent to that guardianship. Thereafter, a maternal aunt and uncle and a paternal aunt and uncle filed separate, competing petitions to adopt. Not surprisingly, the guardian consented to the proposed adoption by the maternal aunt and uncle, but declined to consent to adoption by the paternal relatives. (The paternal aunt, and . uncle had, by then, been declared guardians of the older child.) Citing this Court’s decision in <em>Hess, </em>the <em>A.M.T. </em>panel concluded that while the trial court had properly permitted the paternal aunt and uncle to intervene, it erred in failing to allow them “ 'to participate in the proceeding just as any other individual or individuals who seek to adopt a child.’ ” <a href="/a2d/803/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="803 A.2d 203" data-case-ids="11447210" data-case-paths="/a2d/803/0203-01">803 A.2d at 203</a>, <em>quoting Hess, <a href="/pa/530/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="530 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1833057" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0218-01">608 </a></em><a href="/pa/530/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="530 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1833057" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0218-01">A.2d at 15</a>.

The trial court did not pass upon the issue given its holding on the preliminary issue of standing. The Superior Court held that the hearings on the separate adoption petitions should be heard together to allow the trial court to hear all of the evidence relevant to a determination of the best interests of the children in a single proceeding. While we agree that a single proceeding may be the most expeditious manner of resolving competing adoption petitions, we leave it to the trial court in the first instance to determine whether to consolidate petitions or hear them separately. We can envision scenarios where, for a myriad of reasons, including privacy issues affecting the children or the prospective adoptive parents, a trial court may find it necessary to conduct separate proceedings. Therefore, we will not establish a bright-line rule regarding consolidation, but rather leave that decision to the trial courts.</p>

For example, if the child is in the custody of an incapacitated person or a minor, then the consent of the “guardian of the person” of that incapacitated person or minor is required.
