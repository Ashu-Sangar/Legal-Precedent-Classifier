Baltimore, Inc., d/b/a The Holly Inn (collectively “the Holly Inn”) in which ESC agreed to make extensive improvements to the roof of the motel owned by the Holly Inn. Pursuant to the agreement, the Holly Inn paid $29,855.00 for the work, which included the roofing work covering of eight motel units, an office, and a <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>banquet room area.

After receiving an unfavorable response, the Holly Inn undertook some repairs to the interior of the motel at its own expense. The motel rooms and the ballroom area were reopened in the summer of 1996. ESC took the position that the water damage to the motel was due to the Holly Inn’s perforation of the roof membrane in several places during its attempt to remove accumulated snow and ice. Although ESC subsequently repaired the roof, it refused to pay for the property damage associated with the leaks.</p>

The Holly Inn asserts that it is entitled to delay damages pursuant to Rule 238. The express language of the Rule provides for delay damages in actions involving property damage; therefore, according to the Holly Inn, application of Rule 238 is based upon the nature of the relief involved, and not the underlying cause of action. <em>Loeffler v.

Specifically, the Commonwealth Court has previously suggested that any claim for property damage permits delay damages pursuant to Rule 238. <em>Loeffler, <a href="/pa-commw/101/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="516 A.2d 848" data-case-ids="1354271" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/101/0514-01">supra.</a> </em>In <em>Loeffler, </em>the Commonwealth Court opined that the Rule identifies its coverage in terms of the “relief” involved and not the underlying cause of action. <em>Loeffler, </em>at 851. Conversely, the Superior Court has found that Rule 238 does not apply to contract actions, but applies only to tort actions. <em>Reliance Universal, supra. </em>In <em>Reliance, </em>the Superior Court reasoned that the <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>rule simply makes no provision for delay damages in contract actions; as the penalty for delay was designed to ease congestion and delay in the disposition of civil actions for bodily injury death or property damage, delay damages are not appropriate in contract actions. <em>Reliance, </em>at 41.</p>
    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[287,588,1159,1212]]]'>As exemplified by the differing, but equally reasonable, interpretations that our intermediate appellate courts have given the terms of Rule 238, Rule 238 is susceptible to different constructions and capable of being understood in more than one sense. On one hand, the terms of Rule 238 suggest that delay damages would be appropriate in any “civil action” which seeks relief for “bodily injury, death or property damage.” Yet the Rule limits the type of action to those for recovery for “bodily injury, death or property damage.” These types of redress have traditionally sounded in tort. <em>See, e.g., </em>W. Page Keaton, <em>Prosser and Keaton on the Law of Torts, </em>§ 1 (5th ed.1984). Damages in a contract action, to the contrary, are for the protection of various interests, i.e., expectation, reliance, and restitution interests, in the event of a breach of a promise, and are generally spoken of in terms of money damages, restoration damages, or specific performance. John E. Murray, Jr., <em>Murray on Contracts, </em>§ 117 (3rd ed.1990). Thus, the terms of the Rule which speak to, <em>inter alia, </em>“property damage,” could also reasonably be construed to limit the availability of delay damages to tort litigation. Thus, based upon the above, we cannot say that the words employed in Rule 238 are so explicit and free from all ambiguity such that they clearly manifest the Court’s intention.</p>
    <p id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.6",438,[274,1824,1168,514]]]'>Therefore, consistent with our rules of interpretation, we turn to other considerations in ascertaining the intent of the Court regarding the breadth of Rule 238.

Specifically, the Comments make clear that the Rule did not apply to eminent domain proceedings or any pending actions for damages to property in which damages for delay are already allowable under prior decisions of the Court, <em>citing Marrazzo v. Scranton Nehi Bottling Co., </em><a href="/pa/438/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="438 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1929297" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0072-01">438 Pa. 72</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20336" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="263 A.2d 336">263 A.2d 336</a> (1970) in which “compensation for delay may be allowed in trespass actions lor destruction or involuntary conversion of property where the compensation can be measured by market value or other definite standards.” 8 Pa. B. at 2669. While Rule 238 did not apply to these types of pending actions, new actions of this type were to be governed by Rule 238.

Specifically, a recent decision by the Commonwealth Court has brought the holding of <em>Loeffler </em>into question. In <em>McIntyre v.

Judge Leavitt concluded without qualification that “delay damages are not recoverable in contract actions” <em>citing Reliance, supra. </em>Thus, the current practice, as exemplified by this case law, is to look to both the type of action and the type of relief, and finds Rule 238 delay damages inapplicable in contract actions.</p>

Thus, the purpose for which Rule 238 was promulgated was already recognized by the legal right to prejudgment interest in contract actions.

Furthermore, Section (e)(2) of Rule 238 offers that it shall not apply to “actions in which damages for delay are allowable in the absence of this rule.” Although not explicit, as damages for delay in the form of pre-judgment interest were permitted in breach of contract actions prior to the adoption of Rule 238, Section (e) of that Rule advises that it is not applicable to breach of contract actions. Furthermore, were we to interpret Rule 238 delay damages to be applicable to a breach of contract action in addition to tort litigation, we would be injecting unnecessary confusion and possible duplication into this area of the law. Indeed, to permit both the right of prejudgment interest and delay damages pursuant to Rule 238 would not only create uncertainty, but could lead to an unwarranted windfall for a plaintiff.</p>

Initially, the Holly Inn submitted a claim to its insurer, Commercial Union Insurance Company ("Commercial Union") in the amount of $87,581.72. It received payment in the amount of $49,736.54 for a portion of the loss. Commercial Union subsequently sought subrogation from ESC’s insurance company, Erie Insurance Company ("Erie”) for the amount it paid to the Holly Inn. The matter was submitted to inter-company arbitration, and Commercial Union was awarded $50,347.54, which represented $44,230.50 in compensation for the physical damage to the property and $6,117.04 for damages associated with the Holly Inn’s loss of business during repairs. Erie satisfied the arbitration award.

The Holly Inn's Complaint was divided into three counts: negligence; breach of contract; and breach of warranty, yet, there is no dispute that the Complaint was based upon the contract between the parties.

Additionally, the Holly Inn does not assert before our Court that the underlying action is one in tort and not contract.
