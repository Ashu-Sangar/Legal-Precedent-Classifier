Appellee McCandless Police Officers Association (the “Association”) is the collective bargaining representative for McCandless police officers within the meaning of Act 111. McCandless and the Association are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (“CBA”) for the period at issue. Richard W. Hart, Jr., was a McCandless police officer and <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>president of the Association. At the end of his shift on the morning of September 19, 2002, Hart engaged in a verbal dispute with Sergeant Brian Madden.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Sergeant Madden subsequently requested that the Chief of Police subject Hart to disciplinary action for his conduct. In a letter dated September 30, 2002, the town manager notified Hart that a special meeting of the McCandless Town Council was being held on October 9, 2002, regarding his continuing employment. The town manager also enclosed a letter from the Chief to Hart with a statement of the charges against him. The letter informed Hart that he had violated various sections of the Police Department’s rules and regulations (conduct unbecoming an officer, insubordination and other violations), for which he was being suspended without pay pending a special meeting of the town council convened to consider the Chiefs recommendation to discharge him. The letter further informed Hart that a <em>Loudermill</em>

Following the hearing, the town council voted to terminate his employment based upon the September 19, 2002 incident. On October 16, 2002, the Association filed a grievance contesting Hart’s termination under the CBA. The grievance alleged that Hart did not violate Police Department rules and regulations, that the discipline was discriminatory given Hart’s union position, and that he was disciplined without cause. The grievance sought reinstatement with back pay.</p>

Instead, the McCandless parties alleged that such matters were reviewable only by the Personnel Board.</p>

As a result of this separate incident, the Chief of Police sent Hart a letter dated October 14, 2002, setting forth a second statement of charges, citing Hart’s misuse of the contractual clothing allowance “as additional grounds in further support of the termination of your employment.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Hart was also notified of a second <em>Loudevmill </em>hearing before town council to be held on October 28, 2002.

Hart did not file a grievance following the second hearing and termination, nor did he file an appeal to the Personnel Board. Thereafter, on November 25, 2002, the town manager notified Hart that his failure to file a second grievance or to request a hearing before the Personnel Board challenging his second termination rendered his termination final and rendered moot the proceedings pertaining to the initial grievance that he had filed.</p>

The arbitrator reasoned that the broad language of the governing contractual grievance procedure, coupled with other provisions in the CBA discussing bases for disciplining police officers, established a contractual right to contest discipline via the grievance procedure. The arbitrator further rejected McCandless’s mootness argument, reasoning that the Association’s grievance challenged the fact of the termination of Hart’s employment and not just the underlying allegations/reasons for the action. The arbitrator concluded, “[tjhere is just no basis whatsoever in arbitral principles or reason why the grievant would have to file a second grievance to deal with ‘additional grounds in further support of his <em>prior </em>termination.’ ” Arbitrator’s Opinion and Award, 4/8/03, at 17.</p>

The trial court dismissed the petition, holding that <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>(1) the CBA specifically allowed Hart to choose between an arbitration hearing and a hearing before the Personnel Board in order to challenge the termination; and (2) with respect to mootness, the effect of Hart’s failure to request a hearing or to utilize the grievance procedure a second time was a proper question for the arbitrator.</p>

Under this dual standard, if the question of arbitrability turns upon a pure question of law or upon the application of law to undisputed facts, appellate review is plenary; but if arbitrability depends upon fact-finding or an interpretation of the CBA, “the extreme deference standard” governing Act 111 awards controls.

The panel majority was persuaded by the arbitrator’s reasoning on mootness; thus, the panel majority quoted the arbitrator at length and essentially adopted his analysis, adding only that “[bjecause the second statement of charges was, in effect, only an amendment to the first statement of charges, we agree with the arbitrator that there was no need to appeal the second statement of charges.” Slip op. at 4-5. Turning to the question of the availability of the CBA grievance procedure to challenge Hart’s termination, the panel held that it was bound by the arbitrator’s decision that disciplinary matters are covered by the CBA, thus allowing for an election between an arbitration hearing and review before the Personnel Board, because that question involved fact-finding and an interpretation of the CBA, making it subject to deference under narrow certiorari review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

      <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>Turning to the mootness question presented for review, Appellant McCandless takes no issue with the Commonwealth Court’s framework for review: thus, it agrees that, although the scope of review in Act 111 arbitration matters is narrow certiorari, the standard of review is plenary because the question of mootness, which it characterizes as one implicating the arbitrator’s jurisdiction, poses a pure question of law. On the merits, McCandless contends, as it has throughout, that the grievance concerning the termination of Hart’s employment based upon the first statement of charges was rendered moot when neither Hart nor the Association filed a second grievance or requested a hearing before the Personnel Board with respect to the second statement of charges. McCandless argues that Hart’s unchallenged termination pursuant to the second statement of charges was an intervening factual change which eliminated any actual controversy, thus rendering moot the grievance concerning the first statement of charges and termination of employment.</p>

On the merits, the Association argues that McCandless’s mootness argument attempts to erect “formal procedural barriers to arbitration on the merits,” an attempt which is antithetical to the very purpose of public sector collective bargaining laws utilizing arbitration for dispute resolution, since such legislation is designed to encourage swifter, less <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>expensive, and less formal decision-making. In the Association’s view, to permit employers to stagger charges, issue multiple terminations of the same employee, and then require separate grievances would cause the Act 111 arbitration process “to become mired down in ... formal pleading.” In addition, the Association argues urges that, because an employee “may be terminated only one time,” McCandless’s position on mootness “exceeds the bounds of logic.” In this regard, the Association notes that the CBA requires the filing of a written grievance within 15 days of the “event” giving rise to the grievance. In this case, that event was Officer Hart’s termination, and the Association submits that that “event did not change simply because the Town sought to pile on new charges.” In the Association’s view, the new charges did not “undo” Hart’s existing termination and his appeal of that termination through the grievance procedure, and employers should not be permitted, or encouraged, to engage in “mock personnel proceedings” merely to erect procedural barriers to merits review of a pending grievance arbitration.</p>

Neither the parties nor the Commonwealth Court panel majority explain why the trial court’s conclusion was erroneous. Moreover, the panel majority’s reasoning seems to beg the question, as it suggested that the arbitrator could be said to lack jurisdiction only if and after it was determined that the grievance indeed was rendered moot, thus leaving “nothing for the arbitrator to arbitrate and no relief [to! be granted.” If mootness truly posed a question of arbitral jurisdiction, the answer should not be tautological; <em>i e., </em>jurisdiction over such questions should not vary depending upon the outcome of the mootness inquiry.</p>

On the other hand, in the absence of the parties’ CBA and course of dealings actually addressing the mootness effect of separate charges, the parties do not argue that there is anything external to the agreement, in the Act 111 context, which suggests that mootness questions should, or should not, be deemed questions falling within the province of the arbitrator.
