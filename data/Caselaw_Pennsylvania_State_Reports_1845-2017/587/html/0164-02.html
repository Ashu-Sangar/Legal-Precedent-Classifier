      <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>In March 2000, Regis F. Burger, M.D. (“Dr. Burger”) prepared the last of a series of several wills, in which he named five beneficiaries to share in the residue of his estate. Dr. Burger was a widower with no children of his own, and the residuary legatees were the heirs of his deceased sister, Anzelma Burger Nash, including her granddaughter, Linda Nash (“Appellee”), each of whom was designated to receive a specified, fractionalized share of the residue. For example, with regard to Appellee, who was to receive the largest share, the will provided as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b311-5" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[212,846,1114,306]]]'>I give 50% of my residuary estate to LINDA NASH, 120 Bingay Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237.

    <p id="b311-6" data-blocks='[["BL_311.6",311,[167,1172,1156,521]]]'>The residuary clause was similar to those that were contained in prior wills, but Dr. Burger had increased Appellee’s share of the residuary estate in each new will, from twenty-five percent in 1998, to thirty-four percent in 1999, to fifty percent in 2000. The March 2000 will also named Appellee and National City Bank of Pennsylvania as executors, as distinguished from earlier wills in which solely the bank was designated. This will, however, like the prior wills, did not mention Dr. Burger’s brother James, or James’ daughter and heir, Janice Burger Leckey (“Appellant”).</p>

In this regard, Appellant averred that, as of March 1999, Dr. Burger had granted a broad power of attorney in favor of Appellee and, by the end of that year, Dr. Burger’s physical and mental condition had weakened and Appellee had assumed responsibility for his finances, terminated the services of a twenty-four-hour caregiver, and otherwise engendered and exploited a confidential relationship. According to Appellant, the twenty-five percent increase in the residuary bequest to Appellee should therefore be deemed void, and' the result should be a partial intestacy, from which Appellant should benefit as the person nearest by degree of consanguinity to Dr. Burger, and his fifty-percent intestate heir.</p>

Further, in her supporting brief, Appellee cited a rule of interpretation set forth in Section 2514(11) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, which applies in the absence of a contrary intent discernable from a will. <em>See </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 2514 (“In the absence of a contrary intent appearing therein, wills shall be construed as to real and personal estate in accordance with the following rules[.]”).

The court noted that Appellant’s interpretation of Section 2514(11) was a novel one that ignored the plain meaning of the language used in the headings for clauses (10) (“Lapsed and void devises and legacies; shares not in residue”) and (11) (“Lapsed and void devises and legacies; shares in residue”). In conformity .with such headings, the court concluded that clause (10) offers guidance on the disposition of lapsed or void specific bequests, whereas clause (11) provides the same direction for residuary bequests. The court read clause (ll)’s cross-reference to clause (10) as merely incorporating the specified reasons why a bequest or devise might fail, <em>see </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 2514(10) (providing a presumption of intent to accomplish a substitute gift where “the beneficiary fails to survive the testator or because it is contrary to law or otherwise incapable of taking effect or which has been revoked by the testator or is undisposed of or is released or disclaimed by the beneficiary”), but not as requiring that a specific devise or bequest must be involved in the first instance to implicate <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>clause (11). In any event, the orphan’s court agreed with Appellee’s argument that Dr. Burger’s provision for an alternative disposition in the event of Appellee’s death should be treated as evincing an intention to effect the same distribution in a broader range of circumstances, including partial invalidity of his will on account of undue influence. Thus, the court determined that a partial intestacy would not be created, even if Appellant were able to prove undue influence.</p>

Simply stated, there is no necessary connection between the reason for the failure of a bequest and the testator’s determination of a secondary beneficiary. Where, as here, the Will makes clear that the testator was cognizant of the possibility that his bequests might not be effectuated as written and gave specific direction for the treatment of those bequests, we are compelled to conclude that his intent to dispose of the property via Will is at least “reasonably certain.” <em>Estate of Kehler, </em>[<a href="/pa/488/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="488 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="1761033" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0165-01">488 Pa. 165</a>, 167,] 411 A.2d [748,] 750 [(1980) ].</blockquote>

Since the potential for a failure due to undue influence is a contingency that is not addressed in the will, Appellant argues that this Court’s decisions mandate a finding of partial intestacy should undue influence be found.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> With <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>regard to the statutory anti-lapse and void legacy provisions, Appellant maintains that Section 2514(11) can only be read to apply exclusively to gifts that fail or lapse under Section 2514(10), in light of the plain terms of the clause.

Assuming, arguendo, that this Court would find that Dr. Burger’s will failed to provide sufficient direction, Appellee contends that clause (11) of Section 2514 plainly mandates that the residuary gift would pass to the other residuary beneficiaries. In this regard, Appellee notes that the purpose of Pennsylvania’s anti-lapse and void legacy statute is to prevent precisely what Appellant seeks to achieve, namely, a partial intestacy. Appellee observes that, in contravention of this legislative purpose, Appellant’s interpretation would render the statute devoid of any provision addressing the disposition of lapsed and void residuary gifts, leaving a substantial, unexplained, and inexplicable gap in its coverage. Furthermore, Appellee contends that Appellant’s construction would render clause (11) superfluous, since clause (10) already directs that a failed non-residuary bequest shall pass to the residuary beneficiaries. Like the orphan’s court, Appellee views clause (ll)’s cross-reference to clause (10) as merely incorporating the latter’s broad enumeration of reasons why a bequest may fail. In conformity with the clause headings, the orphan’s court’s reading of the statute, and this Court’s treatment of Section 2514’s immediate predecessor, Appellee maintains that clause (10) governs the disposition of lapsed or void non-residuary devises or bequests, and clause (11) governs the disposition of lapsed/void residuary devises or bequests.</p>

This interpretation, however, is in tension with several of the words that follow. For example, clause (11)’s reference to a “devise or bequest as described in clause (10)” is qualified by subsequent words of limitation restricting the subject matter to devises and bequests which “shall be included in a residuary clause of the will.” By definition, however, the specific devises <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>and bequests that are the subject matter of clause (10) are those “not being part of the residuary estate.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Additionally, in the event of a relevant lapse or invalidity, clause (11) provides for a substitute gift to “the <em>other </em>residuary devisees or legatees,” 20 Pa.C.S. § 2514(11) (emphasis added), suggesting that the Legislature contemplated a situation in which the gift to at least one residuary beneficiary has been thwarted.

      <em>Accord </em>80 Am.Jur.2d Wills § 1037 (2005) (“The presumption against an intestacy is particularly strong where the subject of the gift is the residuary estate.”). In this landscape, it seems unlikely that, in revising and codifying the anti-lapse and void legacy provisions within Section 2514, the Legislature intended to effect a substantial retreat by eliminating the presumption applicable to residuary devises and bequests. Indeed, as to such gifts, in material respects Section 2514(11) closely tracks the specific language of the Uniform Probate Code which ■prevailed at the time of its enactment. <em>Compare </em>Uniform Probate Code § 2-606 (1969) (indicating that, upon failure of a residuary gift not addressed by the anti-lapse provision favoring the heirs of the designated beneficiary, the “share passes to the other residuary devisee, or to other residuary devisees in proportion to their interests in the residue”), <em>with </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 2514(11) (“it shall pass to the other residuary devi<a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>sees or legatees, if any there be, in proportion to then-respective shares or interests in the residue”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

Like the orphan’s court, we therefore understand clause (11)’s cross-reference to clause (10) to refer to the various circumstances that may give rise to a lapse or failure of a residuary gift. Hence, absent some factor or factors not presently before the Court, clause (11)’s presumption would govern in the event of a partial failure of Dr. Burger’s will on account of undue influence attributable to Appellee, and Appellee’s fifty-percent share of the residue would be directed as a substitute gift to the other residuary beneficiaries, not to Appellant as an intestate heir.</p>

Appellant also contends that, as between clauses (10) and (11) of Section 2514, only clause (11) actually directs the disposition of a lapsed or void residuary devise or bequest, since clause (10) merely indicates that the devise or bequest "shall be included in the residuary!,]” 20 Pa.C.S. § 2514(10). <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 24-25 (contending that "Subsection (10) does not direct how the failed or void bequests are to be distributed”). The language of clause (10), however, is also directly parallel to Section 2-604 of the Uniform Probate Code (formerly Section 2-606 in the pre-1990 version). <em>See </em>Uniform Probate Code § 2-604(a) (1990) ("Except as provided in [the anti-lapse provision favoring the heirs of the devisee or legatee], a devise, other than a residuary devise, that fails for any reason becomes a part of the residue.”). The difference in phraseology as between clauses (10) and (11), as well as their counterparts in the Uniform Probate Code, is apparently accounted for by the fact that the subject matter of clause (11) requires some additional elaboration pertinent to the treatment of the residue, since the express residuary scheme will have been disrupted. Moreover, clause (10) is phrased in substantially the same manner as the common law formulation of the relevant presumption, which this Court has understood to direct a disposition for the property. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>
