Thereafter, on December 16, 1994, WCJ Sarah Makin issued a decision in which she found that Claimant had fully recovered from her work injury effective August 6, 1991. The WCJ terminated Claimant’s benefits as of August 6, 1991. By Order dated December 15, 1995, the Board affirmed the decision of the WCJ and, on September 6, 1996, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the decision of the <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>Board.

    <p id="b619-5" data-blocks='[["BL_619.6",619,[158,769,1157,682]]]'>The matter was assigned to WCJ Alan Gilbert, who carefully considered all the potentially significant dates in this case and found that Claimant’s most recent payment of compensation was a check from Employer dated December 14, 1994, which indicated that it covered payment of benefits for the period from December 6, 1994 through December 19, 1994. He remarked that no testimony was presented as to when Claimant either received or cashed the check. The WCJ observed that, in a post-hearing submission, counsel for Claimant stated in a letter dated January 20, 1999, that Claimant had endorsed the check on December 19, 1994. The WCJ noted that this was not entirely clear from the back of the check.</p>

He concluded that Claimant mailed the Petition to Reinstate Terminated Benefits more than three years after the date on the last check, exactly three years from the date of the earlier WCJ’s decision, and less than three years after Claimant cashed or deposited the check. The WCJ resolved the date of the most recent payment as the date on the Employer’s check, relying on <em>Urick Foundry Co. v.

He <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>sought to set aside the final receipt approximately three years later. The WCJ dismissed the Petition because it was not filed within three years “from the date to which payments had been made.” <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 1001. The Board reversed, finding that the Petition was timely because it was filed within three years of the date on which Claimant cashed the benefits check, some sixteen days following its receipt, and remanded to the WCJ for consideration of the merits. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court declined to reach the substantive issue in the matter because the Order of the Board was intei’locutory. However, the court observed in <em>dictum </em>that, when compensation payments are made by check, absent any fraud or intentional delay in transmittal, the three-year statute of limitations period begins to run as of the date of the check. <em>Urick Foundry, </em><a href="/citations/?q=496%20A.2d%20883" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="496 A.2d 883">496 A.2d at </a>885 n. 2.

The WCJ believed that he could not disregard the footnote in <em>Urick Foundry, </em>especially in the absence of clear authority to the contrary and, thus, concluded that Claimant’s Petition was not timely filed within three years of the most recent payment of compensation, dismissing her Petition as untimely. The Board affirmed, also relying on <em>Urick Foundry.</em>

There, we observed that a note is payable “like so much money paid to whomsoever the note is given.” <em>Id. </em>at *3. We also remarked that “the acceptance of a negotiable instrument for and on account of a debt must be taken <em>prima facie </em>to be in satisfaction of that debt, unless it appeared that the note still remained unpaid in the possession of the party, without any laches by them.” <em>Id. </em>We reinforced the principal that a negotiable instrument is not payment until the proceeds are received in <em>McGinn v. Holmes, </em><a href="/watts/2/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts 121" data-case-ids="1840117" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0121-01">2 Watts 121</a> (Pa.1833) (holding <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>that bills or notes taken for a precedent debt, without special agreement to the contrary, do not constitute payment before the proceeds are received). <em>Accord McLughan v.

However, when the proceeds were received, the check was valid. Further, the courts held that the recipient of the check could not tarry, but must cash or deposit the check as soon as practicable. Failure to do so could render the debt paid without receipt of the proceeds. <em>See, e.g., Nat’l Newark Banking Co. v.

Briggs gave Holmes a cashier’s check for the proceeds of the livestock sale on Saturday, drawn on the Penn Bank. Unfortunately, the Penn Bank closed its doors forever on the following Monday. Holmes sued Briggs contending that payment by cashier’s check is only conditional until receipt of the money. Briggs argued that, based on the course of dealing between the parties, Holmes had been paid when he accepted the cashier’s check. This Court concluded that a course of dealing whereby checks were accepted as absolute payment could rebut the presumption that the payment was conditional, a fact for jury determination, and remanded for a new trial. Pursuant to the particular facts of the case, then, a check could be considered payment as of the date it was tendered to the creditor.</p>

Kent leased property from Sayers on an oil lease that provided that Kent would drill a well within thirty days or the lease became null and void. The lease contained an exception to the termination clause stating that, even if Kent did not drill the well, he could unilaterally extend the lease for another thirty days by paying $52.25 in advance to Sayers at the Farmers’ &amp; Drovers’ Bank. The day before the lease expired, Kent went to the Farmers’ &amp; Drovers’ Bank with a check to pay the advance and was told that Sayers had left for West Virginia. The bank, however, agreed to accept the check as cash and deposit it to Sayers account. When Sayers returned, he repudiated the lease and instructed the bank not to accept any more checks from Kent, who still arrived every thirty days with a check for the advance amount. The bank accepted the checks from Kent and held them for Sayers, but could not deposit them based on his instructions. This Court concluded that, when Kent tendered the check it was legal payment to forestall the expiration of the lease and that Sayers was obligated to perform. Thus, the check, although uncertified, was accepted as cash by the bank on behalf of Sayers and the date of tender marked the date of payment.</p>

The matter involved property redemption where the property had been sold at a tax sale. Pursuant to the local rule, the property could be redeemed through payment by cash, money order, or cashier’s check. The property owners mailed a personal check to the county treasurer to pay the taxes and fees and redeem the property. The county treasurer returned the check with instructions to submit cash, a money order, or a cashier’s check. This Court held that the statute did not require anything but a personal check, which constituted conditional payment until it is either paid or dishonored. It also concluded that the property owners paid the redemption amount on the date their check was first received by the county treasurer. Thus, the Court established the rule that payment occurs upon receipt of a check, with the condition that it be honored.</p>

When the check is paid on presentment, the condition to which the payment was subject is performed and, what had been a conditional payment at the time of delivery of the check becomes an absolute payment. Such payment then relates back to the date the check was delivered.

This language operates as a bar to the right as well as the remedy in the same manner as the nonwaivable defense of Rule 1032.

The British High Court held that the date of payment was May 10th, with the condition subsequent satisfied on June 20th, thus rendering May 10th as the last date of payment and the suit was time barred. <em>Accord, Coltrane v.

      <p id="b635-13" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[163,2075,1155,269]]]'>. Again, my reservation in this regard is limited to the interpretation of the language of Section 434. Contrary to the majority's indication, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 482 n. 4, 901 A.2d at 483 n. 4, I am not suggesting that judgment should be reserved on the Section 413(a) issue. Indeed, while I have noted my differences with the majority's reasoning on the Section 413(a) question, I have also expressly indicated my agreement with its holding.</p>
