The District Attorney maintained that because Appellant is not a resident of the Borough of Fountain Hill, Appellant is not a “suitable person” and is not “qualified as required by law” under 13 P.S. § 11, since residence in the borough to be served is a common-law requirement for the appointment of constable, citing the decision reported as <em>Plymouth Borough Constable, </em><a href="/citations/?q=12%20Pa.%20D.%20188" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Pa.

Appellant also argued that by promulgating a specific residency requirement for deputy constables in Section 1 of the Act of June 19, 1913, P.L. 534, 13 P.S. § 21, and not promulgating a specific residency requirement for constables in 13 P.S. § 11, the General Assembly intended that there be no residency requirement for constables.</p>

Were this Court to ignore the common-law rule that to hold the office of constable one must be a resident of the district in which he or she serves, we would be the party guilty of acting as a “super legislature,” by in effect re-writing 13 P.S. § 11 to exclude the residency requirement via judicial fiat.</p>
