It is further hereby ordered that the portion of the Order of the Superior Court affirming the judgment on the verdict with respect to liability for medical malpractice and compensatory damages is VACATED.\nThis Court concludes that the reason the Superior Court gave for its determination that Petitioner sustained no prejudice as a result of the trial court\u2019s error is insufficient to support that determination. Therefore, it is hereby ordered that this case be REMANDED to the Superior Court, with instructions to review the record and reconsider whether Petitioner has demonstrated that it has suffered prejudice from the trial court\u2019s error. If the Superior Court concludes that, given the record before it, it is not in a position to decide the matter, and that Petitioner is entitled to a new trial, the Superior Court shall remand the case to the trial court to conduct a new trial. Jurisdiction relinquished. See Harman v. Borah, 562 Pa. 455, 756 A.2d 1116 (2000); Morrison v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Public Welfare, 538 Pa. 122, 646 A.2d 565 (1994).",
