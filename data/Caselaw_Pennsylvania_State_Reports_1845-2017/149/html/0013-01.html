J., plaintiff testified that the terms of his employment were $35.00 per week, whether the mill ran or not; and extra pay for all time over 60 hours made by the mill in any week. Defendants’ evidence was to the effect that plaintiff was to be paid at the rate of $35.00 per week of 60 hours for such time as he actually worked. Part of the evidence of the plaintiff was a letter from defendants in which they said: “Your wages were to be $35.00 as we understood it.” Defendants introduced their time books and pay rolls in evidence, and showed that plaintiff had regularly handed in his time as did other employees, and was paid accordingly, and that he had never made any objection. Plaintiff’s explanation of this was, that he had been requested to keep the terms of his contract from other employees; that he had spoken to defendants about money being due him, and they had said that would be all right. He also stated that he had given up a six months’ engagement at Steer Mills to come to defendants. Defendants offered in evidence the deposition of the treasurer of the Steer Mills, of which the answers to the 7th and 8th interrogatories were ruled out. [1] These interrogatories and the answers thereto were as follows:</p>

He says that he had employment in Rhode Island, at Providence, and was receiving a certain compensation there and that he had a six months’ engagement. You have heard what the company in Rhode Island state as to that employment, and the plaintiff claims through his counsel that it is unreasonable to suppose he would quit that employment and seek one with these defendants under such unfavorable terms as he now says he would have if the defendants’ version of the contract is to be believed; that he had a large family and that he would not have brought this family here with such an uncertain contract, and that therefore it is unreasonable, that you are to find that it is unreasonable that any such contract would be made as alleged by the defendants.</p>

Because the contract was entered <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>in the time book by the defendants according to their version of it, this does not make the contract; but when the plaintiff handed in his time and received pay according to such time, it is a fact to be considered by you, which may give light in determining what the contract really was, and it is for that purpose only that that evidence was permitted to be given. You have heard all that was said about that. You will, however, be careful to take the plaintiff’s answer to it, because he said that he gave in that time for the purpose of showing, not what time he made particularly, but the time of the mill.

    <p id="b40-9" data-blocks='[["BL_40.10",40,[278,1453,1162,554]]]'>The first assignment of error must be sustained. Plaintiff testified that he had had a six months’ engagement at the Steer Mills, which he had given up to enter defendants’ service, and on this fact it was argued to the jury and submitted to them in the charge, that it would be unreasonable to suppose he would have given up that position for a contract such as defendants alleged he made with them. The truth of his alleged agreement with the Steer Mills was therefore relevant to the issue, and the answers of the treasurer of the mill company to the 7th and 8th interrogatories bore direct^ on this subject. They should have been admitted.</p>
    <p id="b40-10" data-blocks='[["BL_40.11",40,[278,2015,1162,399]],["BL_41.1",41,[109,374,1172,545]]]'>The third assignment must also be sustained. The plaintiff and defendant had given conflicting testimony as to the contract, and, after stating to the jury the argument that it would be unreasonable to suppose plaintiff would do as defendants claimed, the learned judge told the jury also to consider any other testimony in the case, and added “ If you believe the evidence of the witness Barker, that evidence may throw light upon his (plaintiff’s) motive and conduct.” Now Barker had testified <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>directly as to the contract. Whether his testimony was accurate or not was a question for the jury affecting his credibility, but if they believed him, he proved the contract as defendants alleged it, affirmatively and conclusively, and to say of his testimony that it might “ throw light ” on plaintiff’s motive and conduct was not a full and adequate presentation of its bearing on the case. It tended to divert the attention of the jury from the effect of Barker’s testimony on the very point of the issue, the contract actually made by the parties, to its effect on the mere argument what it was reasonable to suppose the plaintiff would have done.</p>
    <p id="b41-5" data-blocks='[["BL_41.4",41,[113,938,1171,1120]]]'>We are obliged also to hold that the fact of plaintiff’s turning in his time and taking his pay by hours, and its bearing on the issue, were not adequately presented to the jury. They were told that it was “ a fact to be considered by you, which may give light in determining what the contract really was. . . . You will however be careful to take the plaintiff’s answer to it, because he said that he gave in that time for the purpose of showing, not what time he made particularly, but the time of the mill, ” etc. This was not only passing too lightly over what should have been the controlling evidence in the case, but immediately neutralizing its effect by an apparent judicial sanction of an explanation that does not explain. Plaintiff’s version of the contract was that he was to have $35.00 a week, without regard to the hours he worked. It is hardly consistent with this that for the weeks in which he worked more than sixty hours he dreAV more than $35.00 pay, but even if this be explained as overwork specially overpaid, and therefore not absolutely irreconcilable with the contract alleged, there is no explanation at all of the acceptance for a week in which there were less than sixty hours of work, of an amount of pay the exact proportion of $35.00 that the number of hours turned in by plaintiff himself were of sixty.</p>
    <p id="b41-6" data-blocks='[["BL_41.5",41,[118,2067,1168,349]],["BL_42.1",42,[269,379,1169,554]]]'>Wages are paid at stipulated times, weekly monthly or otherwise according to custom or contract.

Courts and juries must recognize that business is done in this way. When therefore an employee is shown to have accepted wages from week to week for a period of months at a rate in accordance with bis own returns of time, it is convincing evidence that he was to be paid according to time and not only should it be so set before the jury but the jury should not be permitted to disregard it, in the absence of an explanation equally clear, complete and convincing, and made out by evidence that does and ought to carry conviction. The principle of McConnell’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=97%20Pa.%2081" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="97 Pa. 81">97 Pa. 81</a>, applies with great force to such a case.
