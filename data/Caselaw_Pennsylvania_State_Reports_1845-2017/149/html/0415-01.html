He further insists that if this was done and water was thereby caused to flow on the lands of the plaintiff at the point ‘ A ’ that he is entitled to nominal damages, even though no <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>injury resulted, basing his claim for damages upon the fact that if nominal damages were not granted the defendant would acquire a right to cast his water upon the land of the plaintiff. But, gentlemen of the jury, I instruct you that such is not the law. If you believe the contention of the defendant to be true, that there was an open drain from the bridge through the land of the plaintiff up to ‘ B ’ and from there up to the point ‘ A,’ and that this open ditch was in existence at the time that Mr. Rodenbaugh (defendant’s predecessor) went upon the premises, about 1871, and constructed these drains in dispute, upon his own land, taking into consideration the fact that there was no standing body of water on the Rodenbaugh lands above—no water there, if the evidence is to be believed, except that which descends from the falling rains or from the melting snows, then we instruct you [that he had a right to collect those waters by means of drains and discharge them upon the land of the plaintiff at the point ‘A.’”] [4]</p>

The defendant had a right to lay an artificial drain on his land to carry off the ordinary rainfall and discharge the water at one point, if the jury find that point was the natural watershed for both tracts of land, and further find that there was an open ditch on the plaintiff’s land into which the waters from the defendant’s land naturally descended, and further find that the water from the drains did not materially increase the flow of water upon the defendant’s land and work injury to him. If the point of discharge of the defendant’s drains was not the natural outlet for the water <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>from the defendant’s land over that of the plaintiff, and there was no ditch at the point of discharge on the plaintiff’s land to receive and carry off the water, and the defendant collected the water on his own land by underdrains, and discharged it on the plaintiff’s land in greater volume than it would naturally flow there, and thereby injured the plaintiff, then we affirm the point, and plaintiff can recover.”</p>

It is settled law that, “ for the sake of agriculture, a man may drain his ground which is too moist, and discharging the water according to its natural channel, may cover up and conceal the drains through his lands; may use running streams to irrigate his fields, though he thereby diminishes, not unreasonably, the supply of his neighbor below; and may clear out impediments in the natural channel of his streams, though the flow of water on his neighbor’s land be thereby increased : ” Kauffman v.

The very act of draining land necessarily increases the flow of water, whether such drainage is caused by open ditches or underground tiles. In doing so, however, care must be taken not to cause unnecessary injury to the owner of the servient tenement. The water must not be diverted from its natural channel by the opening of new or different channels. Judgment affirmed.</p>
