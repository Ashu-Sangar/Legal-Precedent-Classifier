Searight and F. W. Searight, in favor of the executors of J. W. Bosler. Subsequently this judgment became the property of the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Co., as guardian of the minor children of the testator. S. Hepburn, Jr., a reputable attorney, was employed by the Fidelity Co. to collect the judgment, and his name appeared as counsel of record.</p>

Hepburn, the attorney, had given an unrecorded mortgage for $10,000 to the Rev. Mr. Wherry, who was in China, John T. Stuart being his attorney in fact. Hepburn proposed to Joseph A. Stuart, who was anxious to have the judgment assigned to some one willing to hold it, that it might be easily arranged by Wherry’s surrendering Hepburn’s mortgage, and then Hepburn would assign the judgment to Stuart, paying a small sum of money to make up the difference, and Stuart could then assign the judgment to Wherry; this Mr. Wherry’s attorney in fact, John T. Stuart, agreed to, and it was accordingly so done.</p>

Stuart and John Wherry to show cause why the assignment to them should not be declared null and void and be stricken from the record and the said judgment be decreed to belong to the Fidelity Co. To this petition, an answer was filed by Joseph A. Stuart and depositions taken. On March 10, 1891, the court below entered a decree declaring that the assignment by Hepburn to Joseph A. Stuart was null and void and decreeing that the judgment belonged to the Fidelity Co., in an opinion by Sadler, P. J., in part as follows :</p>
