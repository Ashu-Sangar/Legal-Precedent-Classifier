It would not affect the contract. It is the same person, same individual, and the name amounts to nothing. As I understand it, in a general way, because I am not going to refer particularly to the testimony, Mr. McConway at that time was a member of the firm of McConway and Torley, understood that the plaintiff had gotten up some device by which the supposed, or alleged, or actual defect in this coupler was to a certain extent or perhaps entirely obviated by making a tongue such as you have heard suggested. ■ He was interested, and if he did not own the Janney coupler he had a license to manufacture it, or at all events was interested in the manufacture and sale of the couplers.

The upshot of it is that while this partnership existed, before either of these corporations were formed, if I understand it, an arrangement was made as alleged by the plaintiff—-denied however, you will recollect, by the defendant—that McConway &amp; Torley were to manufacture these articles, and at first there was no compensation perhaps fixed upon, they let it lie over, and subsequently, I am not sure now whether that was after the organization of the Janney Company or before, the conversation took place by which the price was said to be fixed, by the plaintiff <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>—I think before the change of name, and during the existence of the Janney Company.

He says he did not.] [15] “Mr. McConway says—directing your attention more particularly to that matter—that all this conversation took place ; that there was a payment of one hundred dollars, there was a talk of twenty-five cents royalty; and there was, in addition to that, something that was never done; that this was all preliminary to-the fact of there being a patent on that article that was available-, and that the right was to be exclusive, and that the matter lay in that way until the patent was obtained by him and submitted to counsel, when he was advised it was not such a patent as would protect the article he was manufacturing; and thereupon he ceased to recognize or to have anything more to do with it; in other words, he stopped the negotiation and just went on manufacturing it. If that is true, the company is not bound to pay, and we have not any jurisdiction, although the company might be liable and would be if it infringed this patent right. But if that is so, our jurisdiction is gone. We could not dispose of a case of that kind, but we can dispose of the other claim; if there is a mere contract we have jurisdiction. Outside of the question of contract, where the facts show there was no agreement to use a man’s patent, and without his permission the party went on and used it without any contract or arrangement from which a contract could be fairly implied, the user becomes a wrongdoer—he does not do it under an assumed or actual contract, but does it because he can do it, assumes to do it in violence to the rights of the other, and the only way to bind him, so far as damages are concerned, is in the United States court.</p>

Although that might seem to you clear, yet if it was not done in such a way as to justify the jury in finding there was an agreement by which the defendant was .allowed to do it, whether for compensation or not, yQU must find for defendant because we have no jurisdiction.</p>

You have had the number of machines manufactured, and you have, if you believe the plaintiff’s story, the amount agreed upon. If that is taken as the measure, the sum is readily arrived at. If you should think there was an arrangement.by which it was fairly understood that the defendant might use this die, so as not to subject himself to an action of damages by way of infringement of patent, but a general use arrangement by which they were to just go on and manufacture and make the best of it and settle up afterwards, instead of giving twenty-five cents a coupler, you would have to give whatever the evidence justified you in thinking was fair compensation for the use, not by way of damages, but for the use of this die.</p>

I have refused them all, and sealed a bill, which will, if I am wrong, put the case in such shape that the supreme court will have no trouble in understanding what I have undertaken to bring before the jury. The sole question on which the defendant’s liability depends, is whether the company expressly or impliedly agreed to use the dies and pay and compensate the plaintiff for their use, allowing a fixed sum, or, in the absence of any agreement for a fixed price, whatever the jury may think he is entitled to recover by way of compensation under the evidence.</p>

If that is so, if the jury should not think that the article manufactured by the defendants was substantially the article that the plaintiff allowed- them to manufacture, or gave over to them to manufacture, (whether it is covered by the patent or not, I do not <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>think it makes any difference) but think it is some other article, of course the defendant is not bound to pay the plaintiff for making something they never contracted to pay for; but because there may be some slight change or something that does not interfere with the substance or effect of the thing, that is substantial and material, I apprehend is not going to take away the right of the plaintiff to have his royalty. If that were the case, all a man would have to do would be to make a slight change in operation, which in principle or mechanical operation would not be of substance, and thus avoid paying for something he would never have thought of in the world, if the general principle had not been given to him by somebody else, and that somebody else one he had agreed to pay.</p>

    <p class="author" id="AZdu" data-blocks='[["BL_480.6",480,[531,520,463,40]]]'>Mb. Justice Mitchell,</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.7",480,[245,571,1163,438]]]'>A judge is not bound to answer in detail every point that ingenious counsel may put to him, nor even to affirm correct legal propositions in the exact phrase asked for. As was said by the present Chief Justice in Com. v. McManus, <a href="/pa/143/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="143 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="978545" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0064-01">143 Pa. 64</a>: “ If the law applicable to his ease is plainly, fully, and accurately stated, he has no cause of complaint though the judge choose to express it in his own words.” If this is the rule in trials for murder, a fortiori it must be the rule in merely civil issues.</p>
    <p id="b480-6" data-blocks='[["BL_480.8",480,[244,1028,1164,449]]]'>In the present case fourteen points were presented by counsel for defendant, most of them sharply drawn and of some intricacy. The judge formally refused them all, without reading them to the jury, and gave the latter the law applicable to the case as a connected whole in a general charge. This was entirely within his discretion, and defendant has no cause of complaint if the charge contained nothing erroneous, and omitted nothing favorable to defendant which the points properly called for.</p>
    <p id="b480-7" data-blocks='[["BL_480.9",480,[242,1487,1163,246]]]'>The action was assumpsit for the use of an article obtained by defendant from plaintiff. The fact that the article was patented, or claimed to be, was entirely immaterial to the case as presented and tried, and bore upon it only incidentally. No question of the validity of the patent, or of infringement arose.</p>
    <p id="b480-8" data-blocks='[["BL_480.10",480,[240,1740,1164,551]]]'>The undisputed facts were that plaintiff had invented a method of making car-coupler hooks of wrought iron, for which he had obtained a patent, that McConway procured from him the right to make hooks of the kind, and that McConway’s firm, and subsequently the McConway &amp; Torley Co., the defendant, did in fact make such hooks from the very patterns and dies procured from plaintiff. The disputed facts were, whether a price for the use of his invention had been agreed upon by plaintiff and McConway; and whether the agreement, whatever it was, between McConway and plaintiff, had been adopted by defendant, or by McConway for it with its authority.</p>
    <p id="b480-9" data-blocks='[["BL_480.11",480,[241,2299,1160,88]],["BL_481.1",481,[111,373,1162,189]]]'>Two other points were made in defence, and are assigned for error here : 1, that the hooks made were not such as were <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>covered by plaintiff’s patent, and 2, that the plaintiff declared upon a contract to give McConway the exclusive right to make the hooks, and the evidence did not show that the right was exclusive.</p>
    <p id="b481-3" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[111,579,1165,503]]]'>On the case thus outlined the learned judge instructed the jury specifically that plaintiff must prove a contract as the basis of the action, explaining that a suit for infringement was not within the jurisdiction of the court; that he must further prove an adoption of the contract by defendant, and an agreement as to the royalty, or the value of it on quantum valebat. Without going over it in detail it is sufficient to say that there was evidence to justify the jury in finding all these points in plaintiff’s favor, and the law in relation to them was clearly and correctly laid down for their guidance.</p>
    <p id="b481-4" data-blocks='[["BL_481.5",481,[113,1090,1172,1369]]]'>Upon the point that the article made by defendant was not the same as the article covered by the patent, the learned judge instructed the jury that if the articles were substantially alike in form and made under the assumption that they were made under the patent, or under the permission obtained from the plaintiff, it would he sufficient. This was quite as favorable to the defendant as it was entitled to ask. Whether the patent was followed strictly or not was entirely immaterial. Plaintiff claims that the modification was devised by himself and merely consisted in making the die in two pieces instead of three; and the evidence is indisputable that the article defendant did make was made upon the plans, under the instruction, and with the identical dies that were got from the plaintiff. Whether it was the thing patented or not, it was the thing defendant procured from plaintiff and agreed to pay for. An unpatented article, though of a kind that would entitle it to a patent, may nevertheless be the subject of purchase. So long as the inventor holds the secret in his own possession, and a fortiori when he has the model or die as plaintiff had here, it is property, or a thing of value for the transfer of which he may demand a price, and if he passes it over to a purchaser on an agreement to pay, it is no defence to the latter to say that there is no patent. The learned judge was therefore entirely right, even without calling in the aid of the principle enforced in Hubbard v. Allen, <a href="/pa/123/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="123 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="967120" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0198-01">123 Pa. 198</a>, that the licensee is liable for the stipulated royalty if he uses any part of the invention, which clearly covers the present case.</p>
    <p id="b482-3" data-blocks='[["BL_482.3",482,[253,372,1165,802]]]'>
      <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>The only remaining point to be noticed is the variance between the contract declared upon for an exclusive use of the invention, and that shown by the evidence. This is not a good ground for reversal under the circumstances. The evidence was admitted without objection ; no surprise was alleged, nor was any request made for the withdrawal of a juror and continuance. Nor was there any question of fraudulent representations,, or of failure of consideration. Had the defendant admitted a contract for exclusive use and defended on the ground that the use had not been exclusive, and thereby loss had accrued or the agreed royalty had been rendered excessive, the variance would have become material, but nothing of this kind was alleged. The defence was a denial in toto of any contract at all. The case was tried on its merits on that issue, and defendant having taken its chance of a verdict cannot now be allowed to profit by the variance.</p>
    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[252,1182,1163,82]]]'>The motion to amend is allowed, and thereupon judgment affirmed.</p>
