J., it appeared that defendants claimed title under an oil lease of which plaintiffs had notice when they purchased. If oil was found within six months from its date, the lease was to “ continue in force so long as oil shall be found, whether for fifteen years, more or less.” The date of the lease was January 30,1886. The consideration was $50.00, and one eighth of the oil produced. The first well was completed within six months from the execution of the lease and oil obtained. It was admitted that nothing was done toward the drilling of any well subsequent to the first.</p>
