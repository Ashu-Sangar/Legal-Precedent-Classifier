It was known that it was proposed to operate the same by electricity. Its old roadway had been adapted to this end. The failure to refer to and describe certain wires used in connecting the rails, running along the same, or extending through them by tubes into the earth was not material. The ordinance was designed to bring to the attention of the city officials such matters as would be likely to affect the street as a public highway. Besides, no objection was made by the councils that the kind of materials to he used was not set forth with sufficient detail, but the ordinance was refused because the road had been leased and was no longer operated by the complainant.</p>

The grant to do so is not conditioned upon the assent of the two councils of that municipality. That the railroad is not subject to the constitution of 1874 nor to the subsequent legislation, which provided that ‘ the construction of street railways shall be subject to the consent of local authorities,’ has been settled by the eminent and learned president judge of this district in the case of the Harrisburg City Railroad v. Fritchey et al., No. 125, equity docket. The right of the plaintiff, therefore, to extend its tracks over the streets in contention is not dependent upon the will of the municipal authorities.

It is also the law that, when a corporation accepts the grant of a franchise upon a highway over which a municipality possessed a general power of regulation and control for public purposes, it accepts its special privileges upon the implied condition, that they shall be held subject to the reasonable and necessary exercise of the general powers of the municipality: West Philadelphia Passenger Railway Co. v. City of Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Phila.%2070" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="10 Phila. 70">10 Phila. 70</a>. But while regulations may be thus imposed upon the exercise of its franchises of a passenger railway, occupying the streets of a city or borough, they must be reasonable in character. Ordinances which conflict with the statutes of the commonwealth are invalid. They must not attempt to nullify corporate rights. They should have in view a common benefit. When ordained with reference to a street or highway they should have due regard for all who may use it. Street cars are now as clearly recognized as vehicles for the transportation of persons over the highway of a city as hacks or omnibuses. Much travel is thus cheaply and conveniently provided for. The occupancy of streets by passenger railways has been found to be not incompatible with their use for ordinary purposes, therefore, when ordinances regulating the same are passed due consideration should be given to the whole public, those who use the cars as well as others. The ordinances of municipalities which are unlawful or unreasonable or oppressive or not impartial have been declared by courts of competent jurisdiction to be void: Dillon on Municipal Corporations, vol. 1, pages 368-370 and case cited in notes.</p>

If it cannot by ordinance prevent the occupancy of its streets by the railway company, it cannot provide that the railroad shall not be built or extended until plans are presented and approved, and an ordinance passed expressive of assent, and then refuse to pass such an ordinance or unreasonably delajr its passage, unless valid objections appear in the plans.</p>

It must be borne in mind that the complainants presented their request for an approval of the style of rail proposed to be used and plan of construction to councils on May 25th, that no objection was made that the same would obstruct the streets or was in any respect not satisfactory. They have merely refused'to act for the reason, it would seem, that the complainant had made a lease of its road, although even this objection does not appear to have been communicated to the latter until the hearing. If this could be lawfully done, the rights conferred by the commonwealth on the Harrisburg City Passenger Railway Company can be rendered of no effect. This will not be permitted. If such action be justifiable under the ordinance of June 6,1884, then the said ordinance would be void unquestionably, and might be disregarded; if otherwise, then the railway, after complying on its part fully with the requirements of said ordinance, and hearing no objections from councils, might after reasonable opportunity given for investigation and action by the councils infer that its plans are satisfactory and have been approved, and proceed with the construction proposed.</p>

An ordinance of that city provided that it should be the duty of all passenger railway companies to ‘ submit all proposed .plans, courses, styles of rails and the manner of laying the same, either as to repairs, extensions or constructions of such railway, to the highway department, for their approval and sanction, which shall be obtained before they proceed to make such repairs, break ground, or occupy any of the streets, <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>roads, ayenues or alleys within the limits of the city.’ The railway company had originally laid its track with flat rails. Without complying with the provisions of this ordinance it relaid in 1888 a portion of its track with ‘ T ’ rail. A portion of its track having been taken up by the city in making repairs to a bridge over which its roadway crossed, the company relaid the same with ‘ T ’ rail without complying with the ordinance referred to, and even after notice from the commissioner of highways not to do so. The authorities of the city thereupon undertook to tear up the same but were finally restrained. If the officials of that city under the circumstances were properly enjoined, it would seem that in the present case, where the proposed construction was identical with that in use in other streets of the city under the sanction and approval of its authorities, and the railway company having substantially complied with the requirements of the ordinance of the city of Harrisburg, and no objection having been made to the plan, and three months having intervened without any action on part of councils, and the complainant having commenced to extend its road, the city authorities may be properly restrained from interposing obstacles to such extension.
