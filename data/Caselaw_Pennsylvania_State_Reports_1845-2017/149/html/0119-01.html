      <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>By the opinion of the court below by Ftjbst, P. J., refusing a new trial, it appeared that on the trial before him, the record of the assessment of the land on the unseated list for taxes for several years prior to 1872 and a sale thereof in 1872 by the county treasurer, was offered and received in evidence; and the other evidence indicated in the charge of the court was also offered as evidence of the deed to Edmund Blanchard, which counsel stated was lost. No specific objection was made to the reception of this secondary evidence. The treasurer of the county having stated that he had not any recollection outside of what the books showed, about Mr. Blanchard paying the money and the delivery of the deed to him, counsel for the defendant objected to the testimony; whereupon, in response to a question by counsel for plaintiff, the witness testified that he acknowledged no deeds, unless the taxes were paid, except to the county. At the conclusion of the treasurer’s testimony, defendants’ counsel objected, on the ground that the oral testimony of the witness did not show anything different from what the books themselves contained. The objection was overruled and an exception noted.</p>

Weaver, the treasurer of the county at that time. The record books appear to indicate, without explanation, that the sale was to the county; but above the words “ Sold to the County” are the words “ Deed to E. B.” It is shown in this case that E. B* is Edmund Blanchard, a person connected with the previous title in the case, as to a portion of the tract.] [2] The acknowledgment of the deed, as required by the act of assembly, was shown in evidence; and [ the deed, as appears by the record in the common pleas, was made to Edmund Blanchard. This deed appears to be lost. The treasurer is called and testifies that the deed was delivered to Blanchard upon receipt of the purchase money; otherwise he would not have acknowledged it to Mr. Blanchard.] [8] By subsequent conveyance <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>the title to the Peter Hall tract became vested in the Snowshoe Coal Company and through several conveyances it became vested in the Lehigh Valley Coal Company, the plaintiff in this action.</p>
