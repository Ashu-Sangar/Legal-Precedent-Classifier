      <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>William H. C. Kerlin having filed a bill in equity against Warren L. Ewen for a dissolution of the partnership between them under the name of Ewen, Kerlin &amp; Company, Francis Shunk Brown, Esq., was appointed receiver. Upon the filing of his account, Thomas B. Reeves, Esq., was appointed auditor. The larger part of the money collected by the receiver was on claims which, after considerable litigation, it was finally decided in another court (which decision the auditor followed) belonged to appellant, having been assigned prior to the receivership by W. L. Ewen to secure indebtedness due by the firm of Ewen, Kerlin &amp; Company. The auditor allowed the receiver $750, as his fee, and a fee of $75 to his counsel, deducting these amounts and other expenses from the gross sum in his hands; and thus considerably diminishing the amount coming to appellant. None of the counsel who appeared before the auditor objected to the allowance of either of these fees; and all of them, including the then counsel for appellant, waived the usual ten days notice of the filing of the report and agreed that no exceptions should be filed to it. The appellant filed exceptions to the report of the auditor as follows:</p>
