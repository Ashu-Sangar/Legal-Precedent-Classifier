This trust was not created by the appropriation of a,part of the money defendant should receive under his appointment to a fund for the payment of the Warner mortgage ; but it belongs to the nature of the authority given him by plaintiffs to act for them.

Warner, being money which Warner had realized from the sale of oil belonging to the parties to this suit, but run in the pipe line to Warner’s credit under the arrangement referred to in exhibit ‘ A.’ This oil was produced from the same interests intrusted to the defendant’s care by that instrument, but it does not appear to have been in the mind of the parties when defendant was appointed attorney in fact and agent for the plaintiffs. The evidence shows that the money in Warner’s hands was not spoken of by the parties before it was received by the defendant. There was, therefore, no express authority given him to receive plaintiff’s share. But defendant was at that time representing plaintiffs as quasi trustee in kindred matters. At the same time Mr. Warner paid defendant this money he made an assignment of the working interest to him as trustee for the plaintiffs—that being the interest from which he had realized the money. Defendant likewise charged himself as trustee with this fund; and the evidence shows that when plaintiffs were informed of its receipt by defendant, they did not question his authority to receive it, but regarded then, and have ever since, treated it as a fund rightfully received for them by the defendant under the authority given him by the instruments ‘ A ’ and ‘B.’ From these circumstances it is evident that, while the terms of those instruments did not cover this fund, yet it was the character they gave to defendant as plaintiffs’ trustee, which enabled him to get their share of it; that defendant did receive it by being the trustee for plaintiffs, and that both the defendant and the plaintiffs understood the authority given by those instruments to be large enough to cover this act of defendant. Hence the authority which was originally lacking has been supplied by the subsequent conduct of the parties; aud the fund, which defendant thus received as a trust, cannot now be treated, to his advantage, as a common debt.</p>

Shearman thirteen hundred and seven dollars and twenty-six cents ($1,807.26), and to Charles F. Morrison fourteen hundred and thirty-four dollars and forty-five cents ($1,434,45). The defendant paid taxes on the common property to the amount of five hundred and ninety-four dollars and forty cents ($594.40). He also paid to the widow of Stephen R.

It is not questioned that defendant is entitled to credit, as against the plaintiffs, for two thirds of the two last items. The defendant claims that plaintiffs were indebted to him, when he accepted this trust, on account of certain payments made and certain expenses incurred by him, on behalf of plaintiffs and himself. The learned master found the items of this claim to be just and equitable, and gave defendant credit for them. The credit was given, however, on the theory that only so much of the money received by defendant for plaintiffs as should have been deposited to the credit of the Warner mortgage was trust funds., An opposite conclusion on that subject having been reached in this opinion, can the credit claimed be allowed defendant ? The answer must be against the credit, because, first, having received the funds as attorney in fact and agent for the plaintiffs, he could not avail himself of the advantage given him by that fiduciary position to apply them to his own benefit, to the injury of his principals: The Bank of the United States v. Macalester, <a href="/pa/9/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="960673" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0475-01">9 Pa. 475</a>, 488; Tagg v.

Second, defendant having received plaintiffs’ funds in a fiduciary character, the debts were not due in the same right, and were, therefore, not the subject of sét-off: Tagg v. Bowman, <a href="/pa/108/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="108 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="539288" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0273-01">108 Pa. 273</a>, 277. And third, the relation itself implied an agreement not to set off: Russell v. The Church, 65. Pa. 9, 16. And that implication was strengthened by the specific appropriation of one half the trust funds-to the Warner mortgage and defendant’s express promise to pay plaintiffs their respective shares of the remainder. Hence, in the absence of plaintiffs’ consent to such a diversion of the trust funds, this credit could not be allowed defendant.</p>

The defendant was the treasurer and paymaster for the plaintiffs, as well as for himself. All parties evidently regarded him as the source from which the labor and materials for these repairs and improvements were to be paid. The plaintiffs must have believed that he was paying their proportion out of such of their money as they supposed he had in his hands. So believing, they neither forbade further payments nor prohibited further improvements. It is considered that their silence, under those circumstances, was consent. But they did not suppose he had in his hands the money specifically appropriated to the Warner mortgage. They had the right to rely on the presumption that defendant had done his duty and deposited that beyond his control, to the credit of the mortgage. The other funds in defendant’s hands were the money realized from sale of timber ($153), and the part of the trust money payable to the plaintiffs personally. It is, therefore, considered that plaintiffs’ proportion of the expense of the improvements on their common estate cannot be allowed as a credit on that part of the trust fund belonging to the Warner mortgage, but that, after deducting the sum realized from the timber, the balance should be allowed as a credit, consented to by plaintiffs, on that part of the trust fund payable to themselves.</p>

This exception, hoAvever, cannot be sustained, because, first, the main issue has been determined against the defendant; and second, this suit was caused by defendant’s disregard of his duty as trustee. The defendant has never deposited any money in the Warren Savings Bank to the credit of the Warner mortgage, or so as to indicate that it belonged to a fund intended for the payment of that mortgage. It was not until after this suit was brought that he entered a credit on the mortgage. It is true, that before suit was brought he had used some of the trust funds to pay on the debts of Stephen E. Morrison’s estate, the purpose to which he, as administrator of that estate, was to apply the money realized from the Warner mortgage. But the payment of those debts out of the trust funds was, neither in letter nor in effect, a compliance with defendant’s duty as trustee. The defendant sustained at that time three distinct characters: that of an individual, that of administrator of Stephen E. Morrison’s estate and that of trustee for the plaintiffs. A confusion of those characters might work an injuiy to his bail as administrator, to the creditors or beneficiaries of that estate, or to his cestuis que trust. It was therefore important to determine the moment when a sum of money passed from defendant’s hands in one character, into his hands in another. Defendant had no more right to use the trust funds as administrator, until after it had been actually applied on the Warner mortgage, than he had to use it as an individual. This misstep was doubtless caused rather through lack of careful business methods, than 'through intentional wrong.</p>
