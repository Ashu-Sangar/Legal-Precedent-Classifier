The auditor was directed by agreement of counsel herewith filed to treat all the exceptions as withdrawn except the fifth and last exception, and which is to the effect that ‘ the accountant should have paid to exceptant the principal of two-fifths of decedent’s estate, less debts, expenses of administration and legacy to Mrs. King.’ This exception involves the construction of the last will and testament of Eleazer Robinson, and preparatory to this investigation the parties agree upon and admit the following facts, to wit: That Elizabeth Robinson, the wife of Eleazer, died during the lifetime of her said husband, and the testator himself afterwards died on the 29th day of March, 1889, leaving to survive him three children mentioned in his will, viz.: Emma, intermarried with Cortland Kiijg, William L. Robinson, and Mary E., intermarried with Dr. A. P. Bowie. That William L. and Mary E., while of tender- age at the time of the execution of said will, were of lawful age, and both married at the time of testator’s decease. With these facts before us, we proceed to examine said will. The testator in his said will, after making a bequest to his daughter Emma (who has been paid) and giving the balance of his estate to his wife, Elizabeth, during her natural life, provides as follows: ‘ After rne death of my said wife, I direct my executors hereinafter named to have an appraisement made of my whole estate, and I give, devise and bequeath unto my son William L., upon his arriving at the age of twenty-one years, the three-fifths of my estate, and to my daughter, Mary E., I direct my executors to pay her the interest arising from the two-fifths of my estate during <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>her natural life, and at her death the principal, being the twor fifths of my estate, is to be equally divided between her children share and share alike, but if my said daughter, Mary E.; should die without issue, then the said interest hereby devised to her shall revert to my estate.’</p>

Robinson took, upon the death of the testator, a fee simple estate in the said three-fifths of the property devised to him under the paragraph of the will first above quoted. The only question is, how was the-absolute estate thus granted in the first instance affected by the latter paragraph above quoted? In a leading case on this subject, (Mickley’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/92/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="92 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="491071" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0514-01">92 Pa. 514</a>,) Justice Sharswood says-: ‘ If a bequest be made to a person absolute in the first instance, and it is provided that in the event of death, or death without issue, another legatee or legatees shall be substituted to the share or legacy thus given, it shall be construed to mean death; or death without issue, before the testator. The first taker is always the first object of the testator’s bounty, and his absolute estate is not to be cut down to an estate for life, or what is practically the same thing, to be subjected to an executory gift over upon the occurrence of the contingency of death or death without issue, at any future period within the rule against perpetuities without clear evidence of such an intent:’ See also Caldwell v. Skilton, <a href="/pa/13/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="13 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="964993" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0152-01">13 Pa. 152</a>; Stevenson v.

      <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>“ The evidence of the testator’s intention, as gathered from the whole will, tends greatly towards giving William L. a fee simple estate rather than otherwise. For instance, he provides for the payment to William L., upon his arrival at the age of twenty-one years, before the death of his mother, ‘ such of his interest in my estate as his said mother may direct,’ and the paragraph last before quoted provides that should William L. acquire any property by way of remainder, upon the death of his sister, Mary E., that it should go to him ‘ absolutely.’ Thus the testator clearly contemplates the giving of at least parts of his estate to William L. absolutely. We are of the opinion that the testator’s words, ‘ die without issue,’ in the ease of William L., relate to and provide only for the case of his death during the lifetime of the testator, the contemplated life tenant, Elizabeth, having previously died; which doctrine, of course, under the facts here, gives William L. a fee simple estate. Even were it held that the words, ‘ die without issue,’ relate to death at any time within or beyond the life of the testator, we can see no practical difference in the case of William, for in that view of the matter the effect would be to give the said property to William L. and to- his ‘ issue;’ that is, to the ‘ heirs of his body,’ which under the rule in Shelley’s case would clearly create an estate tail, which under our act of April 27, 1855, becomes a fee simple estate. Nor would the reversion to testator’s estate or executory devise or remainder over to Mary E. in case of her surviving, in any way prevent William L. from thus taking a fee simple estate, as the said provisions are not at all inconsistent with a fee tail estate. In Taylor v. Taylor, 63 Pa., p. 485, Justice Sharswood says: ‘ An estate tail may no doubt be subject to an executory devise over on some condition or event to take effect in abridgment or derogation of it, though such an executory devise can be destroyed by a common recovery suffered by the tenant in tail, which enlarges his estate into a fee and excludes all subsequent limitation, whether in remainder or by the way of springing use or executory devise.’ From either standpoint, therefore, it will be seen that William L. Robinson took a fee simple estate in the property devised to him by his father, and that his share of the funds in the hands of the executor should be distributed to him.</p>

      <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>“ We next proceed to ascertain the character of the estate acquired by Mary E. Bowie. In paragraph of will first above quoted, testator says : ‘ And to my daughter, Mary E., I direct my executors to pay her the interest arising from the two-fifths of my estate during her natural life, and at her death the principal, being two-fifths of my estate, is to be equally divided between her children share and share alike.’ There can be no doubt, we think, of the fact that at least a life estate is therein devised to said Mary E., by implication, even if nothing further was said in the will on this point. ‘ A devise of the rents, issues and profits of land is a devise of the land for so long as the rents, etc., are given:’ France’s Estate, <a href="/pa/75/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="75 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="1036706" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0220-01">75 Pa., 220</a>; Jar-man, vol. 2, 112; <a href="/pa/63/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="63 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1018991" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0170-01">63 Pa. 170</a>. The testator evidently believing that he had substantially devised the said two-fifths of his estate to Mary E. at least for life,'continues: ‘but if my daughter, Mary E., should die without leaving issue, then the said interest hereby devised to her shall revert to my estate.’ Thus using the word interest in the last instance to cover much more than the mere income. The serious question here is not whether something less than a life, or freehold estate, but whether something greater than a life estate was not thus devised. A life estate does not necessarily preclude the existence of an estate tail, as the latter includes the former, and only is it necessary to use apt words of limitation in connection with the former to raise it to the importance of an estate tail. The facts and provisions in this case are so similar to the case of Haldeman v. Haldeman, <a href="/pa/40/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="40 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="478140" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0029-01">40 Pa., 29</a>, that the auditor relies greatly upon the opinion of the court in that case, and takes the privilege of quoting pretty freely from it. Our testator here, as in that case, provides that in the event of the death of the said Mary E., the said two-fifths of his estate to go to her ‘ children, share and share alike.’ There was no devise over, here, in case Mary left children, but the latter were to take absolutely. Had the testator stopped here, there would have been no doubt but that the word ‘ children ’ would be properly construed a word of purchase according to its ordinary legal signification, and a life estate thereby only granted to Mary, with the remainder to her ‘ children ’ living at the time of her death, if she left any such, if not then to lapse. In such a case should Mary leave no ‘ children, ’ but <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>grandchildren, the devise must fail, as the latter would not iill the requirement of the word ‘ children ’ used in its ordinary or restricted sense as before indicated, and thus we think the real intention of the testator as gathered from the whole will would be frustrated: Haldeman case; also Castner’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20Pa.%20491" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="88 Pa. 491">88 Pa. 491</a>. We have, however, additional light from the will itself as to the sense in which he used the word ‘ children,’ viz.: ‘But if my said daughter, Mary E., should die without issue, then the said interest hereby devised to her shall revert to my estate.’ Under this clause the said interest would not revert should Mary ‘leave issue.’ Does the word ‘issue’ here mean such issue, that is, ‘children,’ or does the word ‘children’ mean ‘ issue,’ that is, ‘ heirs of the body ? ’ The latter sense enlarges the class of persons who should take at the death of Mary to include her descendants, and thereby we think more fully expresses what the testator had in his mind. Justice Strong, in the Haldeman case, said: ‘ Whenever, therefore, in the devise of a remainder to the child or children of the first taker, it is thus made clearly to appear that those words are used in the sense of “ issue ” or “ heirs of the body,” they are to be treated as describing lineal succession to an entail. Cases are numerous of devises to one for life or for life only, with remainder to his “ son ” or “ first son,” or “ eldest son,” in the singular number, (all properly words of purchase,) with a devise over in default of issue of the first taker, in which he has been held to take an estate tail, in order to let in other sons, who, without such a construction would have been excluded. The estate tail has been implied from the devise over, and the word “ son ” or “ eldest son,” has been elevated into a generic term, embracing the whole line of male lineal succession, and therefore a word of limitation.’ ‘ For similar reasons limitations of a remainder to an unborn child or son of the first taker have been held evincive of an intention to use the word “son ” or “child ” in the sense of “heir of the body.’” The principles thus set forth are easily applicable to this case, and we may say here, as was said in that case, that our testator employed the words ‘ children ’ and ‘ issue ’ indiscriminately, and both of them as meaning an entire line of lineal descent. ‘ The intent that the devise should not lapse while issue of the daughter remains, is evident.’ In Carroll v. Burns, <a href="/pa/108/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="108 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="539243" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0386-01">108 Pa., 386</a>, it was said that ‘the rule is un<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>questioned that prima facie the word “issue” means “heirsof the body,” and will be construed as a word of limitation, unless there be explanatory words showing it was used in a restricted sense.” In Stone v. McMullen, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.N.C.%20541" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="10 W.N.C. 541">10 W. N. C., 541</a>, it was held that ‘the words “ die without legitimate issue,” must have their legal effect to create an estate tail in the absence of an unequivocal intent on the part of the testator, that thej^ shall not be construed in their technical sense : ’ See also Reinoehl v.

That the word ‘ issue ’ by our testator was not used accidentally, or without intending to employ it with all that it means, it will be seen that still further anxious to limit the respective interest to William and Mary and their respective line of descendants or issue, if they should have such, he again, with much deliberation, makes it the leading part of a new paragraph, wherein he provides as follows: ‘ If either of my said children should die without issue, then their share of my estate shall revert to my estate.’ Thus we have the word ‘ issue ’ again employed, and as before, in a most important place in the will. By it the testator reinforces what he had before evidently desired to express by the word ‘ issue,’ that is, ‘ heirs of the body,’ and thereby his intention becomes more emphatic and certain, and as said in the Haldeman case, ‘ shows an intent to express hereditable succession.’ Nor do we think it at all sufficient to overthrow this view of the case that the testator afterwards, in the latter part of the said paragraph, in a matter very remote, the providing for a contingency that has since passed, and which, in the first instance, was of much less importance, used the word ‘ children,’ but not, however, in relation to this above named devise of the two-fifths to Mary. In said paragraph, immediately following that word, ‘ children,’ which we believe he recklessly used, there is evidence of a strong intent on the part of the testator that the interest he had devised should go to the said Mary E. and William L. respectively, and to their descendants or issue, he says, ‘ but in no event is any of it to go to my daughter Emma.’ Should William die without issue before Mary, an occurrence which the testator was bound to know might happen, and should then Mary die leaving issue but not children, to whom would this two-fifths go ? The testator says not to Emma, the only other child, and shall we make him say not to Mary’s is<a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>sue ? We think not. He plainly excludes the only other heir that could inherit in such a case, and looks no farther than to Mary and her issue; but to her and her entire line of issue he does look, from all that is contained in the will taken as a whole.</p>
