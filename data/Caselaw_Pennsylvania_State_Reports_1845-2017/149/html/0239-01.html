    <p class="summary" id="b263-11" data-blocks='[["BL_263.13",263,[152,1296,1169,1061]]]'>On February 5, 1890, Wm. Marsh, one of the defendants in the above mentioned judgment, filed a petition for an order to subrogate him to the rights of the plaintiff so as to permit him to collect from Ezra Cooper the sum of $3,001.22, with interest from February 5, 1890. Ezra Cooper having filed an answer, the case was referred to a master and examiner, E. P. Gould, from whose report the following facts appeared: A. T. Marsh was the guardian of George S. Stanford, and Ezra Cooper and Wm. Marsh were his sureties, and the above judgment was entered on their bond, the amount being liquidated at $8,329.30, with interest from July 10,1889, and costs of suit. Ezra Cooper and Wm. Marsh, the sureties, each paid one half of said judgment, less $40 paid by A. T. Marsh. At the time this judgment was paid, Ezra Cooper had in his hands $5,004.83 belonging to the guardian of the plaintiff and held by said Cooper for the mutual protection of himself and Wm. Marsh, his co-surety; and this money not having been so applied, Wm. Marsh was compelled to pay out of his own pocket $4,295.83. The master reported that Wm. Marsh was entitled to subrogation to the right of the plaintiff in the judgment against Ezra Cooper to the amount of $2,502.41, with interest from February 5, 1890.</p>
