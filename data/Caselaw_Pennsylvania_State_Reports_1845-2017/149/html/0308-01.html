The first exists for the benefit of creditors, though the shareholder may doubtlessly avail himself of it, and is that the capital of a limited partnership is a trust fund for the benefit of creditors, and cannot be diverted from their reach: Coffin’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20Pa.%20286" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="106 Pa. 286">106 Pa. St. 286</a>. Justice PAX-SON there states the rule as follows: ‘ It (the capital contributed) is a fund, set apart by the act for the benefit of creditors, and to some extent partakes of the nature of a trust. I do not, of course, mean a technical'trust, which would require to be invested and so held, but a trust in the sense that neither the special nor the general partners can lay their hands upon it except for the purposes for which it was created. It may be used in the business, for it was contributed for that purpose, but it cannot be diverted either directly or indirectly by any device whatever.’</p>

As the master looks at it, there has not, for two reasons: 1st. The investment here is of a portion of the surplus, about one fourth, and the capital is still intact and answerable to creditors. 2d. The stock in the Bolton Iron and Steel Company represents the money expended, and is an available asset of the defendant company. The creditors of that company, are not turned over to extricate its capital from a corporation which has appropriated it. The limited company is untouched, and the only difference is that in the surplus account there is 501 shares of stock in the Bolton Company, in place of &lt;¡[&gt;50,000, just as there might be a government or railroad bond in place of a corresponding amount of cash.</p>

Prior to this purchase, they had bought their steel in the open market. The association of steel makers having forced up the price of this article, they found themselves at a serious disadvantage as against competitors who made their own steel. It can hardly be questioned that if, at this time, the defendant company had put up a plant for the manufacture of steel, the act would have been sustained as within the sound discretion <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>of the board of managers. The use of steel is a necessary link in the production of the finished article. It is in the discretion of the managers at what link in the chain they begin their operations. It would seem impossible for a court of equity to draw the line at any one step in the process, and forbid the company from taking up its work of manufacture beyond that point. As the master views it, the company have the right to start with the ore in the hills, if in the'judgment of the managers they can reach more advantageous results in this way, than by taking the partly finished product from the hands of other manufacturers.</p>

    <p class="author" id="Ay7q" data-blocks='[["BL_338.10",338,[540,1633,454,39]]]'>Mb,. Justice Stebbett,</p>
    <p id="b338-7" data-blocks='[["BL_338.11",338,[250,1683,1164,496]]]'>Both specifications are of the most general character. The first complains of the decree dismissing plaintiff’s bill. The second charges error in,not granting the relief prayed for, viz., a decree restraining the defendants, managers of “ The A. French Spring Co., Limited,” from any further appropriation of said company’s money to the payment of the notes given for purchase of the interest in the Bolton Iron and Steel Co., and ordering said managers to account, and pay back into defendant company’s treasury all sums of money paid out by them for the purchase of said interest.</p>
    <p id="b338-8" data-blocks='[["BL_338.12",338,[250,2188,1160,198]],["BL_339.1",339,[135,372,1161,87]]]'>Neither of the specifications alleges any error in the learned master’s findings of fact, nor in the approval of those findings by the court. The facts embodied in his report must therefore be accepted as correct. It is unnecessary to notice them in de<a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>tail. Brief reference to a few of the more important will be sufficient.</p>
    <p id="b339-3" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[135,474,1164,604]]]'>One of the facts thus established is, that the purchase of 501 shares in the Bolton Iron and Steel Co. was made, on or about Sept. 1, 1888, by Aaron French, on behalf of the defendant company. That purchase was made in conjunction with a similar one made by J. J. Young, whereby the two purchasers secured a controlling interest in the Bolton Iron and Steel Co. The purchase was made in good faith, for the purpose of securing protection for the defendant company against the combination or association of steel makers, which operated against the company by requiring them to pay more for their steel than it cost other competitors who manufactured their own steel supply.</p>
    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[136,1086,1167,747]]]'>The consideration of the purchase thus made by Mr. French was $50,100, of which $12,600 was paid in cash, and the residue in three notes of $12,500 each, in one, two and three years from Sept. 1, 1888. Only one of the notes was outstanding and unpaid when the hearing before the master was concluded. The payments were made out of the general surplus assets of the defendant company, consisting of money, etc., which, prior to that time, had been credited to the profit and loss account. In the language of one of the witnesses, “ the surplus account consisted of the amount of money which, prior to that date, had been credited to the profit and loss account, plus the amount that had been made during the year up to that time. ... In other words, it was the balance of the assets of the concern after deducting the capital stock, bills payable and all other liabilities.”</p>
    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.6",339,[139,1848,1164,247]]]'>It thus appears that the investment complained of did not, in any manner, impair the fixed capital of the defendant company. The purchase of the 501 shares in question required only a portion of its then surplus profits. The integrity of the transaction, in a business point of view, is unimpeached.</p>
    <p id="b339-6" data-blocks='[["BL_339.7",339,[139,2101,1165,250]]]'>The investment was made in good faith, and, so far as appears, for the sole purpose of advancing the pecuniary interests of defendant company. The plaintiff appears to think it will have a different effect, but in that opinion he evidently differs in judgment with the managers and other stockholders.</p>
    <p id="b339-7" data-blocks='[["BL_339.8",339,[182,2356,1122,45]],["BL_340.1",340,[256,369,1164,856]]]'>It was alleged by defendants that plaintiff knew and ac<a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>quiesced in the purchase of the stock in question for such a length of time as should estop him from now questioning either its regularity or legality; but the learned master, upon full consideration of the evidence on that subject, found as a fact that he was not fully informed as to the purchase until April, 1889 ; and, after being so informed, he protested against it, and filed his bill without unnecessary delay. He is therefore in a position to question the legality of the investment, on the ground that it was ultra vires. In view of the facts found by the master, and approved by the court, that appears to be the only ground on which there is any room for even a doubt. It is equally clear that the purchase was carefully made, in the exercise of a sound business discretion, and after full consideration of its propriety and expediency. All necessary precautions for the protection of the defendant company and its stockholders were taken; and, as the master found, “ the result appears to have justified the judgment of the managers.”</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[251,1231,1169,904]]]'>To hold that such an investment of surplus earnings, made under the circumstances, and for the purpose shown in this” case, is ultra vires, would greatly and unnecessarily cripple and interfere with the successful management of limited partnership associations. There appears to be nothing in the law of their being that requires us to do so. Considered either as a judicious investment of surplus earnings, or as the acquisition of an interest in an iron and steel company, from which supplies of those materials may be procured on more favorable terms than elsewhere, or as both combined, the transaction complained of is not in conflict with defendant company’s articles of association. One of these provides that the business to be conducted by the company shall be, as its name indicates, “ the manufacture of springs of every description.” There appears to be nothing in any of the articles that, in express terms, or by necessary implication, prohibits the company from preparing or manufacturing its own supplies of steel, etc., or otherwise procuring the same.</p>
    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[249,2143,1162,248]],["BL_341.1",341,[130,376,1164,198]]]'>After considering the facts, in connection with the authorities bearing on the subject, the master reached the conclusion that the purchase in question was not ultra vires, but, on the contrary, it was a matter within the sound discretion of the board of managers. Without reviewing the authorities cited <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>by him in support of this conclusion or further consideration of the facts, we think the master was right in recommending the dismissal of plaintiff’s bill, and that the court committed no error in decreeing accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b341-3" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[134,580,1160,96]]]'>Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>
