A case stated is a substitute for a special verdict, and is subject to similar rules. The court is confined to the specific facts presented, and cannot aid them by any inference, implication- or intendment of fact: Tuigg v. Treacy, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20Pa.%20498" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="104 Pa. 498">104 Pa. 498</a>. It must state facts, and not merely evidence. The court cannot draw inferences of fact, nor decide questions of fact however clear: Diehl v. Ihrie, <a href="/whart/3/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Whart. 143" data-case-ids="1833399" data-case-paths="/whart/3/0143-01">3 Whart. 143</a>; Berks Co. v. Pile, <a href="/pa/18/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="18 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="969105" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0493-01">18 Pa. 493</a>. In order that we may give judgment against the defendant it must appear that, at some time within two years before the bringing of this suit, <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>the defendant not having at the time a license as required by law, used and exercised the occupation or business of a real estate broker within the county of Warren and state of Pennsylvania. Simple as these facts are, they do not appear with certainty upon the face of the stated case. It is stated that the defendant was engaged in the business of real estate broker in the borough of Warren, but when, does not appear, nor whether the borough of Warren mentioned is in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts or Ohio. The recitals of transactions following are mere evidence, and are nowhere stated to have occurred in the county of Warren, nor is any time mentioned, except that they happened during three years before the bringing of the suit, which may or may not have been while the defendant was unlicensed, and may or may not have been within the limit of two years accorded by law for the prosecution of penal actions in favor of the commonwealth. Moreover the fact that the defendant had no license is rendered doubtful by the want of dates, and the added statement that the want of license was “ by reason of his neglect and failure to pay to the county treasurer the sum of thirty dollars as a license fee,” etc. This .... was repealed by the act of 1850, which substitutes a tax of three per cent upon the annual receipts, and if there be no other reason than this, the defendant may well have been legally commissioned as a broker. Before we can impose a penalty upon the defendant for an alleged violation of law, the fact that he has so violated it must appear with at least as much certainty as would be required to sustain a conviction before a magistrate. Upon the stated case we are unable to give judgment for the plaintiff; but under the terms of the submission we are equally unable to give judgment for the defendant. We are only authorized to do so in case ‘ upon the whole case the court is of opinion that under the law the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.’ We can decide only questions of law, and it is evident from what we have already said that the case presents a mixed question of law and fact, and this we cannot determine.”</p>
