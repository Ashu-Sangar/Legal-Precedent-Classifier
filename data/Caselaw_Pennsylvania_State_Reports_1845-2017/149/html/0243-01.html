On July 21, 1881, plaintiff brought an action of debt against defendants, at No. 129, Sept. T., 1881, in this court, based on the said contract shown by the said exhibits A, B, C and D.

The claim made in that declaration was not confined to plaintiff’s rights in 90 acres, or any other distinct part of the land demised. That suit was tried on the merits, and plaintiff recovered a judgment for $21,995.14, which sum was made up of arrears of rent or royalty, in part at the lower, and in part at the higher rate stipulated in the contract.</p>

      <em>“ </em>This is an inference drawn from the manifest purpose of such a contract, and from the fact that an opposite conclusion would deprive the grantor of the consideration of his grant. It cannot be said to be a distinct contract embraced in the same instrument with the one expressed. It is implied only because it is evidently a part of the contract expressed. The relation between it and the express covenant to pay a portion of the mineral produced is not similar to that between separate installments, successively falling due, under the same instrument. The implied covenant is rather a continuing, inseparable part of the express one, which it directly affects throughout the term of the grant. The relation between them is that between good faith and all executory contracts. Assuming, then, that such a covenant was implied in the contract in suit, it would seem to follow that, when plaintiff recovered in the former action the arrears of his portion of oil produced from the land demised, he recovered either all he was entitled to, or, at least, a part of an entire demand. In either event, the former judgment would be a bar to this suit: Carvill v.

There is no precise rule for determining what makes an entire cause of action. It depends upon the facts of the particular case, and is often a difficult question. In Carvill v. Garrigues, <a href="/pa/5/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="5 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="953541" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0152-01">5 Pa. 152</a>, the defendant bargained for certain parcels of lumber, a part whereof plaintiff had delivered, when defendant refused to accept the remainder. The plaintiff sued, first, for the price of the part delivered, and, in a second action, for damages resulting from the defendant’s refusal of the remainder. It was held that the claims were an entire cause of action. In Corbet et al. v. Evans et al., <a href="/pa/25/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="25 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="975881" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0310-01">25 Pa. 310</a>, defendants <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>purchased goods from plaintiffs, agreeing to pay for them partly in money, in separate installments, and partly in ‘ good obligations ’ of third persons. Certain notes were accordingly transferred to plaintiffs and a part of the money paid, when plaintiffs brought suit for overdue installments, which they recovered. Some of the transferred notes proving unavailable, plaintiffs brought a second suit to recover their amounts, on defendants’ contract to pay in ‘good obligations.’ But it was held that the demands in the two suits were parts of an entire cause of action. In Logan v. Caffrey, <a href="/pa/30/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="30 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="415587" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0196-01">30 Pa. 196</a>, the plaintiff below had wrought for defendant at one dollar a day during parts of 1854 and 1855, but, &amp;s was alleged, under the same contract. The plaintiff (Caffrey) then sued defendant for his wages, but at the trial he withdrew his claim for wages between Nov., 1854, and Feb. 5, 1855 ; the record showed this withdrawal, and no evidence was adduced to support that item. Thereafter Caffrey sued for that item, but it was held that, if the work was done under the same contract as the items in the former suit, then the second suit could not be maintained. In Buck v. Wilson et al., <a href="/pa/113/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="113 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="457626" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0423-01">113 Pa. 423</a>, Buck, being indebted to Wilson &amp; Co. in a book account, gave to Wilson &amp; Co. his five notes for the amount, they falling due at various dates. After two of the notes were due, Wilson &amp; Co. sued Buck, declaring in the common counts, and specially for the two notes, and attaching a verified copy of the book account. At the trial the plaintiff sought for and recovered no part of the account embraced in the five notes, save that represented by the first two. Thereafter Wilson &amp; Co. brought a second suit to recover so much of the book account as was represented by the remaining three notes; but it was held that, inasmuch as the book accouut was an entire demand, and as both suits were based on it, the first suit was a bar to the second. In that case, Mr. Justice Clabk, delivering the opinion, cites with approval Bendernagle v. Cocks, <a href="/wend/19/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="19 Wend. 207" data-case-ids="2023459" data-case-paths="/wend/19/0207-01">19 Wend. 207</a>. The doctrine of that case is, that ‘ where a party hath several demands or existing causes of action growing out of the same contract, or resting in matter of account, which may be joined or sued for in the same action, they must-be joined; and if the demands or causes of action be split up and a suit brought for a part only, and subsequently a second suit for the residue, the first action may be pleaded in abatement, <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>or in bar of the second action,’ and, as a corollary of that proposition, it was held, in that case, that, where there were breaches of several and distinct covenants contained in the same instrument, and suit was brought, claiming damages for some of the breaches, and subsequently a second action was commenced, claiming damages for other breaches, all the causes of action having accrued at the time of bringing the first suit, that the first action might be pleaded in abatement of the second. Our S upreme Court has expressed a- similar doctrine in a number of cases. Thus, in Logan v. Caffrey, <a href="/pa/30/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="30 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="415587" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0196-01">supra,</a> it is said: ‘ Where the consideration is fully executed, and there is no stipulation of severance, the obligation to pay is indivisible and entire, as much so as an obligation to build a house, to make a statue, or to paint a picture:’ <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Pa.%20201" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="30 Pa. 201">30 Pa. 201</a>; Buck v. Wilson, et al., <a href="/citations/?q=113%20Pa.%20430" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="113 Pa. 430">113 Pa. 430</a>. In both of those cases the doctrine was applied to accounts made up of distinct items, each with its own cost, but all belonging to the same contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b272-6" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[266,1244,1164,490]]]'>“ At the time when Henry Hill brought the first suit, his interest in the land was divested. Thereafter the defendants could receive nothing further from him, nor become further indebted to him under their contract. Hence, the consideration was fully executed, and there was no stipulation of severance. If the doctrine stated applies to distinct items of an account, arising under the same contract, the more strongly would it apply when the foundation of the second suit is an implied covenant, directly qualifying one on which plaintiff had already recovered.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b272-7" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[268,1753,1164,445]]]'>“ It is also true that the evidence that would support the one case would sustain the other.
