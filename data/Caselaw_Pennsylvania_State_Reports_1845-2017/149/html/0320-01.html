Our opinion was that the clause in the deed from George Sehynder to Emma M. Shiffer, viz.: ‘ this conveyance, made subject to <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>the following liens,’ was only a covenant on the part of the grantee which could not be enforced by an action of ejectment. Further reflection and examination of the authorities have satisfied us that it is a condition. George Schnyder sold and conveyed the premises in controversy to Emma M. Shiffer by deed dated August 1, 1885, for the consideration of $2,000, and recorded in Elk county on the twenty-sixth day of January, 1886. This deed contained the following clause: ‘ This conveyance made subject to the following liens, against the premises herein described; .... A. judgment of Prince E. Gifford to No. 96, May term, 1879, real debt, $155.75, with interest, from May 26, 1879, and costs. . . .’ These liens, according to the testimony of George Schnyder, formed part of the purchase money at the time of the sale to Emma M. Shiffer. This clause in the deed from Schnyder to Shiffer created a lien upon the premises conveyed, and Mrs. Shiffer, the grantee, took the estate, conditioned for the payment of these liens, and the performance of the condition could be. enforced by ejectment: Strauss’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/49/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="49 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="998532" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0353-01">49 Pa. 353</a>; Eichelberger v.

Orr, one of the defendants, the premises in dispute. When Orr purchased this land he had notice on the face of the title of his vendor of the condition upon which the land was held by her. It was the duty of Orr to have made inquiry and ascertained whether these liens were outstanding and unpaid. He stands in the place of his vendor, holding this land with notice of the amount remaining unpaid on these liens. The rule is that whatever puts a party on inquiry amounts to notice, when the inquiry becomes a duty, as in the case of a purchaser of land, and would lead to a knowledge of the requisite fact by the exercise of ordinary diligence and understanding. ‘ When inquiry becomes a duty the party who neglects to perform it should be visited at least with constructive notice of the facts that probably would have been brought to light if it had been only made: ’ Leonard’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/94/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="94 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="485733" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0168-01">94 Pa. 168</a>.; Hottensteinv.
