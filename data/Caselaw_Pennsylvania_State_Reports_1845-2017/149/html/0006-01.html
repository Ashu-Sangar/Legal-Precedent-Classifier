Leopold Oberdorfer, the plaintiff’s husband, about half past eight o’clock in the evening of March 11, 1891, came down Tenth street on the sidewalk. A gate across the driveway was down and de<a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>fendant’s flagman, with a lantern in his hand, was standing on the south-bound track while a train of empty cars crossed on the north-bound track. When this train had passed, the flagman saw a train coming toward him on the south-bound track and stepped on to the north-bound track. Between this latter track and the gate was a siding. When the flagman stepped on to the north-bound track, Leopold Oberdorfer had about reached the gate. The flagman called to hiin to stop; and then, as he did not stop, caught hold of him by the lapel of his coat; but he broke away and jumped in front of the engine and was killed. When the flagman caught hold of him, Oberdorfer was at least twelve feet from the south-bound track. The flagman’s instructions were to put the gates down when trains were in sight and not to allow anybody to go across the tracks. The court entered a nonsuit and refused to take it off.</p>
