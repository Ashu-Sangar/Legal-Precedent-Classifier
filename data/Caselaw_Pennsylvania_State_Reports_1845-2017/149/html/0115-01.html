In meeting the outlay required for this purpose, the money of Mrs. Pierce was exhausted and she raised the sum of $3,670 by giving a judgment and bond and mortgage for $4,000 to O. P. Jones, dated October 31, 1883, the mortgage being on a lot known as the “ Mansion property,” and both bond and mortgage being duly executed by the said Mrs. Pierce and her husband.

      <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>“ The title held by Schoonover prior to the purchase from Jones was based upon a sheriff’s sale of the opera house property on certain writs of levari facias issued on judgments taken on mechanics’ liens filed against both Pierce and his wife, and we think the master is entirely correct in saying that: ‘ The mechanics’ liens against the property were filed for honest debts both against J. H. Pierce and Rose L. Pierce, his wife, as owners and contractors. Writs of scire facias were issued thereon and judgments regularly obtained. All the necessary forms of law appear to have been observed in all the proceedings which resulted in the premises becoming the property of Mr. O. L. Schoonover. No irregularity has been alleged anywhere. The title, therefore, of Mr. Schoonover to these premises being good, it would not require the purchase of any so called outstanding interest of Dr. Pierce therein in order to perfect the title.’ And, as the master further says, there is nothing in the case to show that Schoonover’s title was in any way attacked, and therefore no facts have been shown which would justify charging Mrs. R. L. Pierce with the considerable sum of four thousand dollars for the purchase of an alleged title. Hence, we think that the master has shown sufficient reason for declining to so charge Mrs. Pierce, and therefore we do not think it necessary to enter into the question whether in any event, assuming the $4,000 borrowed by Dr. Pierce and wife from O. P. Jones, on the security of a joint mortgage given by them upon the Mansion property, to have been expended in completing the opera house, this money could be followed into the opera property by the creditors of Dr. Pierce, because it was afterwards repaid by a foreclosure of the mortgage. We do not consider such transaction the same as where an insolvent husband expends his own money in the improvement of his wife’s real estate. If the money so borrowed had been repaid by the wife, her husband would clearly have had no interest whatever in the opera house, because of the transaction; and it is not very easy to see why the question of his having or not having an interest in it should depend upon the fact whether the mortgagee should choose to foreclose his mortgage or not. But as we have said, we think the reason given by the master for the conclusion to which he arrived on this point is sufficient, and that there was no such cloud upon the title held by Schoonover, prior to his purchase <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>from Jones, as authorized him to make this purchase in the face of the notice found by the master to have been given him by Mrs. Pierce not to purchase.</p>
