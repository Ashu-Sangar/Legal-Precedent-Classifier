The alleged fraud consists in the fact that the respondent told the libelant before the marriage that she was pregnant in consequence of the intercourse between them. In order to constitute a fraud it is necessary that the statement should be untrue in fact and that the libelant should have been deceived by it. The respondent testified that she was pregnant at the time and subsequently had a miscarriage. There was nothing to corroborate her statement except the testimony of a woman who judged by appearance, and whose testimony was shaken by testimony upon the part of experts, that she could not form a correct conclusion in this way. The master has found as a fact that the statement was untrue. But was the libelant deceived by it ? The intercourse occurred in January and the marriage took place March 12, following. It may well be doubted whether a woman within that period could herself have any certainty as to her condition. He nowhere says that he believed the statement to be true, and, in fact, the only inference to be drawn from his testimony is that he did not believe it. He says: ‘ About a week after the intercourse referred to by me she informed me that she was pregnant, and she persisted in stating this up to the time of the marriage. When she first told me she was pregnant I told her that could not be, because I thought she was too old.’ There is no evidence of his reliance upon or even belief in the truth of her representation at the time of the marriage. It is doubtful whbther such a representation, even if false and relied upon <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>in good faith, would constitute sufficient ground for granting a divorce: Hoffman v.

    <p class="summary" id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[291,534,1167,1821]]]'>“ It is not alleged that there 'was any force used to compel the marriage, and in order to justify a divorce under the statute, upon the ground of threats, they must be such threats against the life or to do bodily harm as would overpower the judgment and coerce the will. There must be such a mental condition, as a result of the threats, that the libelant did not and could not in reality consent to the marriage. It does not appear, from the evidence, that the respondent made or knew of any threats against the libelant. She had two sons who were young men. One of them, at the commencement of a dental college in Baltimore, on the 5th of March preceding the marriage, pointed a cocked pistol at the head of a brother of the libelant, and by this means obtained the diploma of the libelant. At the same time he said that he would hunt the libelant until he found, him and then shoot him. These facts were communicated to the libelant. Dr. Winder, one of the witnesses, testified that a son of the respondent said to him, that ‘if George Todd did not marry his mother he intended to kill him; ’ and further, that he, witness, was ‘ perfectly satisfied that they would have killed him,’ but whether or not this was brought to the knowledge of the libelant does not appear. The libelant was a man of twenty-seven years of age. He was in Syracuse, New York, and the respondent and her sons were in Baltimore. The libelant, in his examination in chief, said nothing as to the effect of these threats upon him or upon his actions in consenting to the marriage, but, on cross-examination, he testified: ‘ Q. Do you say it was through any fear of bodily harm that you were induced to marry the respondent ? A. I do.’ This is the only evidence there is to prove the coercion required by the statute. Dr. Winder wrote to the libelant, promising to protect him from any violence on the part of the sons of the respondent until the marriage ceremony would be performed. The libelant went of his own will to Baltimore, and the ceremony was performed by a clergyman in the presence only of Dr. Winder and a wife of one of the sons of the respondent. No force and no threats were at that time made.</p>
