    <p class="summary" id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.9",435,[92,647,1173,1266]]]'>On the trial before Ingraham, P. J., the evidence was to the following effect: Plaintiff was employed in defendants’ mine as “ boss hauler,” and had been so employed for three months before the accident. While conducting a car along a tramway in the mine, he came to a place where the grade required the application of a brake. Plaintiff attempted to “sprag” the car, i. e., put a piece of wood called a “ sprag ” in one of the wheels to lock it, when the “ sprag ” flew out. He then seized the “ hitching ” (an iron for coupling the cars and sometimes used as a “ sprag ”) and attempted to “ sprag ” the car with it. While so doing he stepped on a piece of slate about 18 inches square and 6 to 8 inches thick, his foot slipped and went under the car, and he was so injured that his leg had to be cut off below the knee. The slate was up against the rib or side of the road, which at this point was about a foot from the rail. The slate had doubtless fallen from the roof. Plaintiff had been over the road once before on the day of the accident. Defendants employed a “ mining boss,” who had been employed in that capacity at this mine for some years. The plaintiff offered some evidence tending to show that the mining boss was incompetent; but the evidence offered by the defendants of his competency was very strong. The defendants’ first point, affirmed, was “ That under all the evidenóe in this case the plaintiff is not entitled to recover and the verdict must be for the defendants.”</p>
