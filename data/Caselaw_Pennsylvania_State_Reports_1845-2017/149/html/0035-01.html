Weller, who was then under the age of sixteen years. In one he was charged with fornication and bastardy, and in the other with rape, as defined by the act of May 19, 1887, P. L. 128. On June 1, 1891, he was tried on the indictment for fornication and bastard}*-, and the case was submitted to the jury, but, before-a verdict was returned in it, he was required to plead to the indictment for rape. " To this he replied, “ not guilty and once in jeopardy,” and, specially, the facts above recited. The learned judge ruled that these facts were not a bar to the prosecution, and the trial proceeded on the other pleas. There was a verdict of guilty in each case. In the one first tried, the appellant was sentenced to pay to the prosecutrix $40 for lying-in expenses and past maintenance of the child, and the further sum of $1 per week for its support during the next seven years, if it should live so long. In the other case he was sentenced to pay the costs, a fine of $100, “ and undergo an imprisonment, by separate and solitary confinement at labor, in the Lehigh county prison, for the period of one year and six months.” From the judgment on the indictment for rape this appeal was taken.</p>

On this point the rule is thus stated in Am. &amp; Eng.

It may be that under the circumstances and the provision of the criminal procedure act we have quoted, an order discharging the jury “ from giving any verdict upon ” the trial for the misdemeanor, would have cleared the way for a lawful conviction on the indictment for the felony. But a conviction on both indictments cannot be sustained. The commonwealth having, with full knowledge of the facts, elected to proceed to trial and judgment for the minor offence, cannot now prosecute an indictment for the felony which included it.
