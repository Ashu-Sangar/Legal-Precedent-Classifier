J., it appeared that plaintiff and defendant, in 1883, entered by parol into a partnership to procure options on and sell as one tract coal lands in Red-stone township, including land owned by the defendant. The options first taken expired and other options were subsequently taken. The options were taken in plaintiff’s name until December, 1889, when they were taken in defendant’s name, in plaintiff’s absence, and a sale made. Defendant contended that the partnership had expired before the options taken and sale made by him. This was denied by plaintiff, and was the principal question submitted to the jury. The verdict was for the plaintiff in the sum of $4,221.97.</p>

    <p id="b499-9" data-blocks='[["BL_499.12",499,[139,1463,1163,806]]]'>We are of opinion that the statute of frauds has no application to this case. The plaintiff and the defendant were partners, engaged in the single transaction of procuring options for coal lands, and reselling them at a profit. The profits were to be divided between them. It was held in Benjamin v. Zell, <a href="/pa/100/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="100 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="498481" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0033-01">100 Pa. 33</a>, that an interest in contingent profits, arising from a sale of real estate, to be made thereafter, does not amount to an interest in the land itself, within the meaning of the statute of frauds. It would be a novel doctrine to hold that a partnership agreement must be in writing because the subject-matter of the partnership was dealing in real estate. The plaintiff brought this action to recover his share in the partnership profits of a single transaction, and the only question of importance in the case was, whether the partnership had expired prior to the transaction in question. This was a question of fact which was properly submitted to the jury, and their verdict ends the case.</p>
