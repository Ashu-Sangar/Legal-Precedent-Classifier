Afterwards, it was decided by this court in Parel v. Roberts, No. 57 Nov. T., 1887, that the acts providing for legal arbitrations, so far as this county is concerned, were unconstitutional for the reason that they denied parties a right to a trial by jury, there being no provisions for an appeal from the award. Where the selection of a legal arbitrator is mutual, such action amounts to a voluntary submission by the parties, and, if not revoked before award is made, is irrevocable. The rights of the parties thereafter are determined by the common law rule applicable to arbitrations at common law, and not by the statute governing proceedings in compulsory arbitrations. There is no principle which provides for an appeal to the courts from the award of arbitrators chosen by the parties to whom their differences are voluntarily submitted, not under the provision of the compulsory arbitration act. Hence, the appeal must be stricken off, unless the plaintiff has waived her right to move to strike it off.</p>
