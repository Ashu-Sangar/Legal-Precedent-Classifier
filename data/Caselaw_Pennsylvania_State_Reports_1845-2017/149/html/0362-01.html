    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.5",387,[111,716,1167,606]]]'>The clause of the will above quoted is as clear as language can make it, that the note in question is to be treated by the executors as an advancement. While a testator may not turn an advancement into a debt, it is well settled that he may turn a debt into an advancement. It was contended, however, that to so treat it would produce inequality, and that there was no-share coming to John Snider, Jr., from which this advancement could be deducted. All this is outside of the case stated. If inequality is the result, it is neither the fault of the court below nor of this court, but the responsibility therefor must rest with the testator himself. Aside from this, we cannot know that he did not intend to create this very inequality.</p>
