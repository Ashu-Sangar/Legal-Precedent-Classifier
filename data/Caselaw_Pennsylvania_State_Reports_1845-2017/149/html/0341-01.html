To this conclusion we cannot assent. We think the act under which this application comes has no effect whatever upon the local laws of this county. It is as well settled as anything can be settled by decisions of courts, that a general law does not operate to repeal a local statute by implication. So clearly is this established by all the decisions of our Supreme Court, that a reference to them seems like a work of supererogation, nevertheless, as a possible question of public interest, we refer to some of the more recent cases involving this question.</p>

It is not inappropriate to observe that the general law of the commonwealth requires that the sureties on the bond shall be signers of the applicant’s petition. In this case the persons who sign the bond are not signers of the petition. It is not probably very important, and perhaps the law upon the subject has been changed by the legislature that is soon to adjourn.</p>
