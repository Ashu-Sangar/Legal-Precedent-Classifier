General creditors on the audit of the assignee’s account excepted to the allowance of $70,000 of this $100,000 on the ground that the judgment note on which the judgment had been entered was not authorized nor ratified by the directors of the corporation assignor, except for $30,000 cash actually advanced thereon. The auditor found that the note had been given by the assignor to secure a prior indebtedness of over $70,000, as well as $30,000 cash advanced, in accordance with a resolution of the assignor’s board of directors who also subsequently passed a resolution ratifying and confirming the giving of the judgment note. The court below dismissed exceptions to these findings of the auditor; and this action was affirmed by the Supreme Court.</p>

Ralston, made application to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company for an additional loan of $30,000 to meet the immediate wants of the Reading Iron Works, and that A. A. McLeod, then general manager of Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, who had the determination of the matter on the part of the railroad company, declined to advance any further loans to the Reading Iron Works unless the said freight bill due the railroad company was secured; and that then a meeting of the board of directors of the Reading Iron Works was convened, at which George F. Baer, Esq., informed the directors of the condition imposed by Mr. McLeod, whereupon the board of directors of the Reading Iron Works passed a resolution directing the president, Edward W. Coit, to execute a judgment note payable to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company for $100,000. That the note was executed by the president, as directed, and delivered to the executive committee of the board of directors of the Reading Iron Works. That the executive committee of the board of directors of the Reading Iron Works delivered the judgment note for $100,000 to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company with the understanding and agreement that the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Compaq should loan the Reading Iron Works $30,000 on the judgment note, and that the balance of the judgment note, to wit, $70,000, should stand as security for freight due on account of the said freight bill amounting to $76,596.78 then due and owing from the Reading Iron Works to the Philadephia and Reading Railroad Company. That in pursuance of said understanding and agreement between the executive committee of the Reading Iron Works and the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, the latter accepted the said judgment note for $100,000, for $30,000 in cash and $70,000 on account of freight, the Reading Iron Works receiving the $30,000 in cash upon a cheek of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company.....</p>

R. Co., for any purpose except for cash loaned them,” as recited in the second specification. On the contrary, we think he was warranted in finding as he did, that the giving of the $100,000 judgment note in question, in consideration of $80,000 cash, and $70,000 credit on account of freight bill then due the railroad company, was not only authorized, but was subsequently ratified by the board of directors. Moreover, the auditor’s findings of fact, as well as his conclusions of law, were approved by the court for reasons stated in its opinion; and there appears to be nothing in the record that would have warranted any other conclusion. The judgment note, as the auditor has found, was given in good faith and for a full consideration. The transaction was not collusive, nor was there any intention, on the part of either party, to hinder, delay or defraud any other creditor of the maker. Neither the validity of the note, nor of the judgment entered thereon, has ever been questioned by the latter. The auditor went quite as far as he' was warranted in doing at the instance of the appellant: National Bank’s Ap., <a href="/pa/85/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="85 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="440518" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0528-01">85 Pa. 528</a>; Meckley’s Ap., <a href="/pa/102/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="102 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="502707" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0536-01">102 Pa. 536</a>.</p>
