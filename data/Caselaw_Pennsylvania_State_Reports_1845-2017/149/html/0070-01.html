    <p class="summary" id="b97-12" data-blocks='[["BL_97.11",97,[121,1904,1168,438]]]'>“ The legal owners of the stock were the executors and trustees, viz.: Charles H. Lafferty, Rose E. Lafferty and P. J. Corcoran. They differed as to voting and each demanded to exercise their franchise rights as legal owners of the stock. The undoubted rule in this country is that where joint owners of corporate shares differ as to the vote to be cast, the stock cannot be voted upon, whether such joint owners be individuals, partners or fiduciaries: Re Pioneer Paper Co., 36 Howard Prac. 112.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b97-13" data-blocks='[["BL_97.12",97,[124,2360,1162,89]]]'>“ The master does not consider that this rule is affected by the codicil, for</p>

      <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>“ 1. At a corporate election, each vote cast and counted must be so cast in person or by proxy. The codicil is not self-executing, and cannot be treated as a proxy as to dissenting owners. It is neither a proxy in form or in substance. In fact, it could not of itself operate as a proxy, for a proxy can only be given by the owner; and at the time the codicil went into effect the testator’s death had terminated his ownership. Moreover, under the act of 1849, there cannot be a perpetual proxy. Such a proxy must be executed within three months of the election. And the codicil, so far from purporting to be self-executing, distinctly provides that its provisions shall be carried out by a proxy which the executors and trustees are directed to give, and to effect this Mr. C. H. Lafferty demanded that his coexecutors and trustees should give him this proxy. They declined to do so. Neither the judges of election nor the master can, at a corporate election, compel the other executors and trustees to give this proxy. This proxy must be obtained by appropriate proceedings before the proper tribunal, and if a proper case is presented, jurisdiction exists to compel the execution of such paper (see 2 Beach on Corporations, section 855, p. 1346, n. 3). Therefore the case presented to the judges of election seems to be simply that two joint owners desire to vote certain stock in one way, and the third joint owner desires to vote it in another way, claiming that under the codicil a majority in number should be treated as having executed the paper which the testator requested by said codicil. But the facts are that the two objecting fiduciaries have not executed such paper; that they decline to do so; that they themselves claim to vote the stock in a different manner; and in this proceeding it would seem clear that the judges of election cannot treat that as done which is not done, especially where no steps have been taken to compel the execution of such proxy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b98-5" data-blocks='[["BL_98.4",98,[247,2012,1166,400]],["BL_99.1",99,[135,373,1165,504]]]'>“ 2. If, however, the codicil is self-executing, and it is necessary to determine the question of its validity in this proceeding, the master is of opinion that it is not capable of enforcement against the two dissenting trustees. The effect of the will is that the testator vests the legal ownership of the shares in three executors and trustees (and requires that the trustees shall always be three in number), and deprives two of those three of the franchise connected with the ownership of the <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>stock. As a general rule, the right of voting follows the right of ownership, and cannot be validly separated therefrom against the will of the legal owner, and attempts so to do are usually as invalid as would be conditions in general restraint of trade, or against alienation in conveyances in fee. No authority was produced to the master authorizing such a limitation upon legal ownership as that attempted by this codicil. On the contrary, the decisions tend to the contrary view: Vanderbilt v. Bennett, 6 Pa. County Ct. Repts., 198, and cases therein cited; Shelmerdine v. Welsh, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20Leg.%20Int.%2026" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="47 Leg. Int. 26">47 Leg.

    <p class="summary" id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[136,885,1165,248]]]'>“ The eases wherein the separation of the franchise from the ownership has been sustained have been where the severance was by the agreement of all parties in interest. This is the foundation of the decisions sustaining voting trusts: 2 Beach on Corporations, section 855 and notes.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b99-6" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[136,1141,1168,1214]]]'>“ In those cases the voting power was conferred by the voluntary act of the owner—the stock was transferred and stood upon the corporate books in the name of the voter, and the proceeding was analogous to a proxy, or to a pledge with the stock transferred into the name of the pledgee. But in the present case the separation of the ownership from the franchise is made by one who, at the time the separation takes place, had by his death ceased to be the owner of the stock, and the stock itself is not transferred into the name of the party who solely claims the right to vote, but the legal ownership upon the books of the corporation remains in the estate, viz., in the three executors and trustees. It is true that the sole right of franchise is conferred upon an owner and not upon a stranger to the estate, and it was argued that as long as the voting power was vested in an owner he need not be the only owner. But while this result may be sustained when it occurs from the voluntary act of all parties interested, it is equally true that in the present case two joint owners are without their volition or consent deprived of their franchise rights. As to them the testator has attempted to separate the right of ownership from the right of franchise. They are deprived of one of the attributes of stock ownership, viz., of selecting agents to counsel and aid them in the prudent management of the property: Fisher v. Bush, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20Hun.%20644" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="35 Hun. 644">35 Hun. 644</a>.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b100-5" data-blocks='[["BL_100.4",100,[253,673,1167,857]]]'>“ Upon motives of policy and under the authorities it seems clear that the testator could not have conveyed the stock directly to one of his distributees and have directed that the voting power thereon should only be exercised by a third person. It would seem equally clear that he could not have bequeathed it to two or more trustees for his distributees and have also directed that the voting power should be solely exercised by some third person. And there would seem to be no difference in principle because the third person is appointed a cotrustee. Any other construction imposes upon the two trustees the legal responsibilities which might arise from holding this stock, and deprives them of their only method of controlling a management which might create that liability. The trustees may by consent permit one of their number to cast their joint ballot, but when they elect to exercise the power themselves I do not think the law will permit them to be deprived of that right.</p>

By the 13th section of the act of June 16, 1836, the Supreme Court and the several courts of common pleas have the jurisdiction and powers of a court of chancery, so far as relates to the supervision and control of all corporations, other than those of a municipal character. This gives the court all the powers and jurisdiction of a court of chancery over such corporations, to be exercised in the ordinary mode in which a court of chancery acts. This power includes that of supervising and controlling the election of directors, whenever it is made to appear that, by means of fraud, violence, or other unlawful conduct on the part of a portion of the corporators, a fair and honest election cannot be held. This power has been exercised, and its exercise approved by this court in a number of'instances. It is sufficient to refer, for present purposes, to Gowen’s Ap., 10 W. N. 85, where the court of common pleas No. 2 appointed a master to preside at and supervise the proceedings of a meeting of the Philadelphia &amp; Beading R. R. Co. The equity rules of this court provide that the court may appoint a master pro hac vice in any particular case. The law upon this subject is too well settled to require elaboration.</p>

It appears from the report of the master that Charles H. Lafferty offered to vote this stock; that the vote was challenged by a stockholder, and rejected by the master. Charles H. Lafferty was one of the executors and trustees of the estate of Charles Lafferty, deceased. The rejected ballot was in favor of what is known as the Lafferty ticket. The other two executors demanded that this stock should be voted for the opposing candidates, viz, for the “ Verner ” ticket, and tendered their ballot to that effect. They further asserted that certain of the cestuis que trustents had also objected to their permitting the said Charles H. Lafferty to have the sole vote of this stock.</p>

    <p id="b108-5" data-blocks='[["BL_108.4",108,[307,555,1170,1063]]]'>The master has found the facts elaborately, from which we condense the following: The will of Charles Lafferty, deceased, provides that the executors and trustees shall always be three in number. The present executors and trustees are Charles H. Lafferty, Rose E. Lafferty and F. J. Corcoran. By a codicil to his will he provides as follows: “I do hereby authorize and direct that all the stock held by me in the Race and Vine streets* Arch street, and Hestonville, Mantua &amp; Fairmount Passenger R. R. Company, shall be voted at all elections of said companies, as my son, Charles Lafferty, shall direct and appoint, and my executors are directed to give a proxy or authority to vote said stock as he may desire to vote the same.” The other two executors refused to give Charles H. Lafferty the proxy mentioned in the codicil, and protested, as before stated, against his right to so vote the stock. The judges of election announced that, unless otherwise instructed by the master, they would receive the ballot tendered by Charles H. Lafferty, and count it as he requested. If this ballot should be received and counted as. desired by him, it would elect the Lafferty ticket. The master sustained the objection to this ballot, and directed the judges of election to reject it, which was according^ done.</p>
    <p id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.5",108,[308,1626,1169,245]]]'>The master has given abundant reasons for his ruling. The principle may be briefly stated thus: At a corporate election* each vote cast and counted, must be so cast in person or by proxy. This is the law of the corporation, and the stock cannot be voted in any other way.</p>
    <p id="b108-7" data-blocks='[["BL_108.6",108,[309,1880,1166,549]],["BL_109.1",109,[86,377,1173,655]]]'>The codicil to Mr, Lafferty’s will was not a proxy, and could not be treated as such as to objecting owners or stockholders. A proxy is an authority or power to do a certain thing’ ,• in this case a power to vote stock. Such power can only be given by the owner. It cannot, of course, be given by a dead man. Charles Lafferty no longer owns this stock, for the reason that his ownership terminated with his death. It then passed, by his will, to the executors and trustees before named, in trust, for certain beneficiaries. The executors were entitled to vote this stock, because they held the legal title for the beneficial owners. If we concede that one executor could vote the stock* <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>in the absence of objection by his coexecutors, it is clear that he could not vote it against such objection. It is true, the codicil to the will directs two of his executors to give a proxy to Charles H. Lafferty, for the purpose of enabling him to vote his stock, but they did not give such proxjr, nor does it appear that any attempt was made to enforce the provisions of the codicil by any legal proceeding. <em>We </em>are not called upon to say whether the dissenting executors could have been compelled to give the other executor a proxy. In point of fact, they did not give one, and, under the law of the corporation, the stock could not be voted. The testator could not, by a codicil to his will, affect the rights of other corporators. The codicil, so far as the corporation was concerned, had no legal effect.</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[88,1040,1172,443]]]'>What has been said in regard to Charles H. Lafferty’s right applies, with equal force, to the attempt of the other two executors to vote the stock against his objection. The right of voting stock is inseparable from the right of ownership. The one follows as a sequence from the other, and the right to vote cannot be separated from the ownership, without the consent of the legal owner. It follows, logically, that one joint-owner of stock cannot vote it against the protest and objection of his co-owner.</p>
    <p id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[88,1501,1172,247]]]'>It is not needed, for the purposes of this case, that we should speculate as to the right of a man to control, from his grave, the election of directors of a corporation. No such question is legitimately raised by this record. It will be time enough to decide this grave question when it arises.</p>
    <p id="b109-7" data-blocks='[["BL_109.6",109,[90,1755,1168,96]]]'>The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellants.</p>
