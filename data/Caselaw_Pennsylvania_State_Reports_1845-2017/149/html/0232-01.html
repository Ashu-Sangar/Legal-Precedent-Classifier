On Aug. 7,1888, the plaintiff was working on a building which was being erected by defendant. It became necessary to raise the scaffold. In so doing, a ledger board (the board which is nailed to the uprights and acts as the support of the putlocks upon which the floor of the scaffold rests) was insufficiently nailed to all the uprights, except the westernmost one. In consequence, the scaffold fell while plaintiff was working <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>upon-it where he had. been directed to <em>go </em>by defendant.

The only ground laid by the plaintiff for proposing to cross-examine his own witness was the answers of the latter to the following questions : “ Q. Did John D. Hart superintend the construction of this scaffold? A. I don’t remember. Q. Did you not tell me so yesterday ? A. I don’t remember.” The witness had not testified to anything prejudicial to the plaintiff, nor does it appear that he had manifested any bias. Without any further effort to refresh his memory than is indicated in the foregoing questions, the plaintiff was permitted to treat him as an adverse witness, and to propound, by way of cross-examination, the leading question complained of. The result of this was to put in the mouth of the witness the very allegations of fact which the plaintiff wished him to verify by an affirmative answer.</p>
