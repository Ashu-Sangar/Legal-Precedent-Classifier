The minutes of the company were in evidence, and show that the appointment of general agent of the company was tendered on Sept. 9,1858, to Gen. Kane, which was accepted by him. He acted as agent until June, 1861, when he went to the war. Upon his return, in the latter part of 1863, he resumed his agency, and continued to act until June 17, 1867, when he tendered his resignation as general agent, which was accepted on August 27, 1867, and Hibberd Yarn all appointed general agent in his place. On Sept. 16, 1867, Kane was appointed special agent to make sales of the company’s lands, and to receive as compensation five per cent on all sales made by him. In the latter part of the year 1868 Gen. Kane assumed an attitude of hostility to the company, and instituted legal proceedings against it in the court of common pleas of McKean county, whereupon the directors, by resolution, called upon him to resign as special agent, which he did on Feb. 6, 1869. On Feb. 15, 1869, Hibberd Yarnall resigned as general agent, and Captain A. A. Clay was appointed in his place, who continued until May 8, 1874, when, by a resolution of the board of directors, his services were dispensed with for want of funds to compensate him.</p>

We are of the opinion that, even if his agency was established by competent proof, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. Kane, being the agent of the company, could not, as long as this fiduciary relation existed, purchase at a judicial or tax sale the lands of the company, and set up the title thus acquired in antagonism to that of his principal. Such a purchase would raise a constructive trust, and he would be seized of the legal title in trust for his constituents. But the title thus acquired would not be absolutely void, but voidable at the option of tire com<a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>pany, and the trust could have been enforced against him and those claiming under him with notice, either in a court of equity to obtain a decree setting aside the sales, or compel a re-conveyance of the lands, or by recovery of possession in an action of ejectment.</p>

Kane, as appears by the report of the board of directors to the stockholders, made on Feb. 9, 1875. If Kane held the relation of agent to the company at the time of the sheriff’s and treasurer’s sales, the title he acquired was voidable at the option of the company, and it was its duty, within a reasonable time, to make its election to have the sale set aside, otherwise it would be precluded from asserting its right to repudiate the sale. An unreasonable delay, unexplained in instituting proceedings to avoid the sale, will imply an election to treat the sale as valid, and a confirmation may be justly inferred after a considerable lapse of time. Thirteen years elapsed after these sales to Kane before any proceedings were commenced to have them invalidated; and in the meantime the taxes and other expenses, incidental to tlie ownership of the lands, had to be paid by the defendants. This is such an acquiescence on part of the corporation, and a confirmation of the sale to Gen. Kane, as would preclude an enforcement of the trust.</p>

Wade, 17 Ves. 87, Sir William Grant said: ‘It is certainly true that no time bars a direct trust as between cestui que trust and trustee; but if it is meant to be asserted that a court of equity allows a man to make out a constructive trust at any distance of time after the facts and circumstances happened out of which it arises, I am not aware that there is any ground for a doctrine so fatal to the security of property as that would be; so far from it, that not only in circumstances where the length of time would render it extremely difficult to ascer<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>tain the true state of facts, but where the true state of facts is easily ascertained, and where it is perfectly clear that relief would originally have been given upon the ground of constructive trust, it is refused to the party who, after long acquiescence, comes into court to seek that relief. In proof of this it is not necessary to produce any other case than that of Bonney v. Bidgard (cited in 4 Brown’s Ch. Cas. 138), in which Lord Kenyon, when master of the rolls, on the sole ground of length of time, reversed a decree by which Sir Thomas Sewell had granted relief against a fraudulent purchase, and had declared the purchaser to be a trustee for the plaintiffs in the cause, Lord Kenyon, agreeing perfectly that the purchase was originally fraudulent, and that the defendant must have been held to be a trustee if the suit had been brought in proper time : ’ Ashhurst’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=60%20Pa.%20315" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="60 Pa. 315">60 Pa. 315</a>, 316.</p>

And the objection of a long acquiescence will be entitled to much consideration, and perhaps will be a sufficient answer. Upon this point the court would observe that there is no precise rule as to what length of time, or what other fact or circumstance shall be considered sufficient proof of acquiescence.

Lawrence, 3 Yes. 752,-the court thought that an acquiescence of six years by a large number of creditors ought not to bar. But in the case now under consideration, the plaintiffs did not bring their suit until nine years after the defendant enforced his purchase by a recovery against one of the plaintiffs, without any objection on her part; and the purchase was made eleven years before the plaintiff’s bill was brought.

    <p id="b309-6" data-blocks='[["BL_309.8",309,[128,1185,1171,345]]]'>This case, although elaborately argued, both in the paper books and at bar, does not require an extended discussion. The-appellant contends that the purchases of the real estate by General Kane, at the tax and sheriff’s sales, in 1874, were void, for the reason that, at the time, he was agent of the plaintiff corporation, and that his purchases, because of the agency, were-fraudulent, and therefore void.</p>
    <p id="b309-7" data-blocks='[["BL_309.9",309,[131,1541,1169,348]]]'>The answer to this on the part of the defendants was, that the evidence did not show him to be such agent; that had he been an agent, intending to commit a fraudulent breach of duty,, by purchasing in a way hostile to his principal, the intended fraud would, by operation of law, not be allowed to prevail, but he would have been turned into a trustee for his employer; in other words, a trustee ex maleficio.</p>
    <p id="b309-8" data-blocks='[["BL_309.10",309,[134,1899,1168,197]]]'>The evidence that General Kane, at the time of the purchases referred to, was the agent of the corporation, is so slight that it hardly amounts to a scintilla. On the contrary, the evidence is overwhelming that at that time his agency had ceased.</p>

The case is so fully discussed by the learned judge of the court below in <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>Ms opinion refusing a new trial, that we do not think it necessary to elaborate it. A careful examination of the record does not disclose error.</p>
