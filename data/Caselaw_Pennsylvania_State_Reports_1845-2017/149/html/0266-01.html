    <p class="summary" id="b291-3" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[123,428,1174,1469]]]'>At the trial, the evidence for the plaintiff was to the following effect: On Sept. 16, 1890, plaintiff purchased at Bridgeport a round trip ticket to Gettysburgh Junction, and was informed by the agent at Bridgeport that he could return from Gettysburgh Junction at 11.24 P. M. That night, on his way to the train, he walked southward on Louther street across the north siding and main track of the railroad and then turned east and walked toward the station between the main track and the south siding. The night was dark and plaintiff did not see or know of the south siding. He felt his way with an umbrella. Hearing a rumbling he turned and saw the train approaching on the main track at a speed of 80 miles an hour. To get out of the way of the train he tried to move south, but was stopped by a coal car he had not seen on the south siding, a basket on his left arm was struck by the train and he was thrown down and one of his feet so injured that it had to be amputated. Plaintiff’s method of approaching the station was one in common use and one which he, being a stranger in the place, had been told to take by a man of whom he inquired. The station proper was about 150 feet from Louther street. In front of the station and running west most of the distance to Louther street, the space between the main track and the south siding was planked over. Plaintiff testified that he was on this planking when he was struck. There were no lights at the station. The station was in the borough of Carlisle, within which the speed of trains was limited by ordinance to 8 miles an hour. The engineer estimated the speed of this train at 15 miles an hour. The testimony as to the ringing of the bell and blowing of the whistle was conflicting.</p>

Verdict for plaintiff in the sum of $5,174.</p>
