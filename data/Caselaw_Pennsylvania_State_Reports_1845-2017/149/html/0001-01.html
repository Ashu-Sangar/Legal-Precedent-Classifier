Defendant, at the same time with its cross bill, filed an answer to the original bill. Upon a hearing on bill, answer, cross bill and affidavits, the following facts appeared: Complainant is a corporation organized under the act of May 14, 1889, for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating a street railway in Du Bois borough. The borough, by ordinance duly enacted, consented to the construction of complainant’s railway; and the construction and location of the road and line of track was approved by the street committee of the council and borough authorities. That to enjoy its franchises and perform its duty to the public, it was essential that complainant should lay and construct its line of track on Booth street across and beyond Franklin street. The defendant under an ordinance had constructed a railroad with two tracks, which crossed Booth street at its intersection with Franklin street, the tracks being on a level with the grade of Booth street. Complainant proceeded to construct its line at the intersection of Booth and Franklin streets and defendant removed and destroyed a portion thereof.</p>
