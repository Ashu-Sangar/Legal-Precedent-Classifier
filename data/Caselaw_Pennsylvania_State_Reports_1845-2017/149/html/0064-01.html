The questions of the defendant’s negligence and of contributory negligence by the plaintiff, were left to the jury. There was no medical testimony as to the injury to plaintiff. On the question of damages, the court below charged the jury as follows: “ The plaintiff has testified that her arm was broken in two places between the wrist and the elbow. From this injury she has recovered as fully as one can probably ever recover from such an injury. That she was also injured in her head, and as a result of that injury there is a permanent impairment of the sight of one eye and the hearing of one ear. If you find her entitled to recover you will consider the pain and suffering which she has endured because of this injury, [and she is entitled to recover compensation for the permanent injury which she has sustained.”]</p>
