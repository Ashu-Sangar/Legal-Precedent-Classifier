    "head_matter": "Langstrom v. Mooney, Appellant.\nNegligence\u2014Permanent personal injuries\u2014Pvidence\u2014Absence of medical testimony.\nWhere the plaintiff, in an action ior damages for personal injuries, has testified to a permanent impairment of sight and hearing, and no medical testimonj'- is offered on either side, it is not error to charge the jury that, if _they find for the plaintiff, she is entitledtto recover compensation for the permanent injury which she has sustained.\nArgued April. 6, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 232, Jan. T., 1892, by defendant, Daniel Mooney, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Phila. Go., Dec. T., 1887, No. 511, on verdict for plaintiff, Sadie R. Langstrom.\nBefore Paxson, O. J., Sterrett, Williams, McCollum and Heydrick, JJ.\nTrespass for personal injuries caused by the alleged negligence of defendant\u2019s driver.\nThe evidence on the trial was that the plaintiff was thrown down and injured by coming in contact with defendant\u2019s team. The questions of the defendant\u2019s negligence and of contributory negligence by the plaintiff, were left to the jury. There was no medical testimony as to the injury to plaintiff. On the question of damages, the court below charged the jury as follows: \u201c The plaintiff has testified that her arm was broken in two places between the wrist and the elbow. From this injury she has recovered as fully as one can probably ever recover from such an injury. That she was also injured in her head, and as a result of that injury there is a permanent impairment of the sight of one eye and the hearing of one ear. If you find her entitled to recover you will consider the pain and suffering which she has endured because of this injury, [and she is entitled to recover compensation for the permanent injury which she has sustained.\u201d]\nThe verdict was for $1,600; which amount was reduced by remittitur to $1,000.\nJErrors assigned were (1, 2) charging as above in brackets, without calling the attention of the jury to the absence of expert medical testimony.\nSamuel Cformley, Jacob Sehnare, Jr., with him, for appellant.\nRichard P. White, not heard, for appellee."
