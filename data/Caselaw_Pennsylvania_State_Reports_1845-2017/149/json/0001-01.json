    "head_matter": "Du Bois Traction Passenger Railway Company v. Buffalo, Rochester & Pittsburgh Railway Company, Appellant.\nRailroad\u2014Grade crossing of steam road by street passenger railway\u2014 Preliminary injunction.\nIn this case the Supreme Court failed to find anything in the record to justify them in reversing the decree of the court below dissolving a preliminary injunction obtained by a steam railroad to prevent its tracks on a public street being crossed at grade by the tracks of a street passenger-railway company incorporated under the act of May 14, 1889, and to be operated by electricity by means of an over-head wire; but stated that it might be the duty of the court below, in the exercise of its equity powers, to make such order as the facts of the ease might seem to require for the protection of life at the crossing, by the erection of gates, the employment of a watchman, or otherwise, at the expense of either or both of the parties. i\nArgued April 21, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 337, Jan. T., 1892, by-defendant, from decree of C. P. Clearfield Co., Sept. T., 1891, No. 5, in equity.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Heydrick, JJ.\nBill in equity by plaintiff, to restrain defendant from preventing plaintiff from constructing its line of track across the tracks of defendant; and cross bill to restrain plaintiff from crossing defendant\u2019s tracks at grade.\nPreliminary injunctions were issued on both bills. Defendant, at the same time with its cross bill, filed an answer to the original bill. Upon a hearing on bill, answer, cross bill and affidavits, the following facts appeared: Complainant is a corporation organized under the act of May 14, 1889, for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating a street railway in Du Bois borough. The borough, by ordinance duly enacted, consented to the construction of complainant\u2019s railway; and the construction and location of the road and line of track was approved by the street committee of the council and borough authorities. That to enjoy its franchises and perform its duty to the public, it was essential that complainant should lay and construct its line of track on Booth street across and beyond Franklin street. The defendant under an ordinance had constructed a railroad with two tracks, which crossed Booth street at its intersection with Franklin street, the tracks being on a level with the grade of Booth street. Complainant proceeded to construct its line at the intersection of Booth and Franklin streets and defendant removed and destroyed a portion thereof.\nIt also appeared that the motive power to be employed by complainant was electricity by means of an overhead wire; and that to construct an overhead crossing at the place in question would cost about $9,000.\nThe court below, in an opinion by Krebs, P. J., entered the following decree:\n\u201c And it is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed that the defendant, \u2018The Buffalo, Rochester & Pittsburgh Railway Company,\u2019 its agents, servants and employees, be and are hereby enjoined from preventing or in any manner interfering with the complainant, its contractors, servants, agents or employees from constructing its line along Booth street and across the respondent\u2019s line of track, at the intersection of Booth and Franklin streets, and from interfering with, or in any wise hindering or preventing the complainant from operating and maintaining its street passenger railway on Booth street, and across Franklin street, at the point where Booth street intersects the same.\u201d [3]\nOn the same day, the preliminary injunction on the cross bill was dissolved.\nErrors assigned were, (1) refusing to dissolve the preliminary injunction; (2) making it perpetual; (3) the decree as above in brackets, quoting it; (4) refusing to make perpetual the preliminary injunction on the cross bill; (5, 6) dissolving same.\nO. P. M Qauley and Frank Fielding, for appellant, cited among other cases, Penna. R. R. Co. v. Braddock Electric Ry. Co., 1 Dist. Rep. Ill [reversed, 152 Pa. 116].\nJ. P. Punter, W. O. Pentz and J. M. Morrison with him, for appellee.\nMay 2, 1892:"
