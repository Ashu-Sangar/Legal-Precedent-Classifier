        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Heydrice:,\nThe difficulty in the way of the plaintiff\u2019s contention, sustained by the court below, is twofold. In the first place there is no ambiguity in the contract declared upon, to be explained by parol evidence, and, in the second place, the effect, if any, and certainly the manifest object of the testimony offered and admitted under objection, was not to \u00e9xplain anything that was written, but to reform or write into the contract a stipulation that was not to be found there. The language of the contract, \u201c to divide equally the expense of making the American Steam Heater and the profits on the same,\u201d was alike appropriate to the business actually carried on, and to that which- the plaintiff says was contemplated. Whether the defendant employed mechanics to work by the day upon boilers in a shop fitted up by him for the purpose, or employed Boyer, the patentee, to do the same thing for him, the cost of the boilers would be the \u201c expense of making \u201d them, within the spirit of the contract. Nothing contained in the contract itself, or in the evidence offered in supposed explanation of it, indicates that any advantage was to accrue, or was likely to accrue, to the plaintiff in case, the boilers were actually manufactured by or under the personal direction of the defendant, which would not accrue to him if they were ordered from the patentee. There was, therefore, no reason for an attempt to vary what was, by the very offer of the testimony, conceded to be the plain meaning of the Avords used by the parties.\nThe real object, however, of the testimony, was not to explain, but to reform, or add to the contract. The plaintiff admitted that he was to bear half of the expense of making such boilers as the defendant should personally manufacture, and therefore as to such the provision must stand as written. None had been so manufactured, but all had been ordered from Boyer and paid for by the defendant, who had not been reimbursed by collections from patrons. To escape from liability for one half of the expense of the boilers that had not been paid for by patrons, and at the same time come in under the terms of the contract as to division of profits, the plaintiff must read into the contract a further stipulation. Neither fraud, accident nor mistake Avas alleged, but something like an attempt Avas made to prove, by the unsupported oath of the plaintiff, a cotemporaneous parol agreement inducing him to execute, or accept the written contract. It would be a waste of time to consider whether his testimony Avas sufficiently clear and precise upon this subject to entitle it to be submitted to the jury. Unsupported as it was, and contradicted by the oath of the defendant, it could not go to the jury. This subject has been so fully discussed in Thomas v. Loose, 114 Pa. 35, and Jackson v. Payne, Id. 67, and other recent cases, as to require no further notice.\nDeclarations of persons for whom work was done by the defendant, as to their dissatisfaction, were not evidence, nor should the fact that they resisted payment be permitted to prejudice the defendant, unless their resistance was effectual, and that upon the ground of negligence in the performance of the work, not of the unsuitableness of the boilers.\nThe judgment is reversed, and a venire facias de novo is awarded.",

J., Sterrett, Green, Williams and Heydrick, JJ.\nCase for damages for breach of contract.\nAt the trial, before Bechtel, J., it appeared that the written contract between the plaintiff and' defendant was contained in the following letter:\n\u201c Me. A. M. Halbeestadt,\nDear Sir: Your letter of even date this day received, and contents noted, to-wit; You to use your whole and undivided attention to the business of steam heating in my interest as well as your own, to-wit; To divide equally the expense of making the American Steam Heater, and the profits on the same, on all heaters sold in your territory, I to pay your traveling expenses for soliciting work, not to exceed five dollars per day, and I to allow you 12.5 per cent on the amount of all contracts for steam heat in the state of Penn\u2019a., where the American Steam Heater is used and furnished by us.\nThe above proposition is this day accepted.\nRespectfully,\n(Signed) F. B. BANNAN.\u201d\nThe defence was that by reason of nonpayment of various contracts placed by plaintiff, there was now nothing due him, after dividing equally the expense as provided for in the contract. The plaintiff was permitted, under objection, to question defendant as to the refusal of a purchaser to pay, because he claimed-that defendant did not perform his contract. [4] The plaintiff alleged that under the agreement he could not be charged with one half of the cost of boilers purchased, but only with one half of the cost of those made by defendant; and testified that such was their parol agreement. The court below, in the general charge, left this question to the jury. [3]\nJErrors assigned were, among others, (3) the portion of the charge above referred to, quoting it; (4) ruling on evidence above referred to, quoting bill of exceptions.\nJohn W. Ryon, for appellant.\nF. W. Bechtel, A. J. Pilgrim with him, for appellee.\nApril 25, 1892:"
