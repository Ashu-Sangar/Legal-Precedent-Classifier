        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice Paxson,\nWe are of opinion that the defendant\u2019s 2d point should have been affirmed. The point was as follows: \u201c If the jury believe that the plaintiff, on June 27,1890, agreed to take from the defendant $15.00 in full satisfaction of the damages caused by goring of plaintiff\u2019s horse by defendant\u2019s bull, and the defendant then and there paid the amount agreed upon, the subsequent death of the horse would not enable the plaintiff to maintain an action for the same injury, the damage for which had been settled.\u201d\nIn order to understand this point, it is necessary to state that the plaintiff\u2019s horse had been gored by defendant\u2019s bull. Shortly thereafter a settlement took place between the parties, as will appear by the following receipt:\n\u201c Pennville, Pa., June 27, \u201990.\n\u201c Received, of Jacob Bilger, fifteen dollars ($15.00), for damage sustained by bull hooking horse. In full.\n\u201c (Signed) J. Currier.\u201d\nA week after the settlement the plaintiff\u2019s horse died, as is supposed, from the effect of the injury. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff brought this suit to recover the value of the horse, before a justice of the peace, and obtained a judgment for $160, from which judgment the defendant appealed to the court of common pleas. On the trial in the court below the defendant set up this receipt as a bar to the action, and the 2d point referred to, prayed for an instruction to that effect. The point was refused and a bill sealed.\nWhile it is settled law that a contract made under a mistake, or in ignorance of material facts, may be relieved against in equity, we have no such question here. There was no mutual mistake of the parties as to any material fact. The only fact in the case was, that the plaintiff\u2019s horse had been gored by the defendant\u2019s bull. As to this there was no mistake, and each party was fully informed. The consequences resulting from this fact were of course unknown to either party, with any degree of certainty. The plaintiff made the mistake of underestimating the consequences of the injuries of his horse, and of making a settlement with the defendant before they were accurately ascertained. This may be his misfortune, but it is one which the law cannot remedy. No one will contend that if he had brought suit for this $15, and recovered, he could have maintained a second suit after the death of the horse. He could not have had two suits for the one injury: Logan v. Caffrey, 30 Pa. 196. Nor can he, after settling with the defendant, sustain a suit to recover additional damages for the same injury. In other words, he cannot first recover for the damages for the injury, and then sustain a suit for the consequences of the injury.\nJ udgment reversed.",
