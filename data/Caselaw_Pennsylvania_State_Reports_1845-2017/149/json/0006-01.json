    "head_matter": "Oberdorfer, Appellant, v. Phila. & Reading R. R. Co.\nNegligence\u2014Railroad crossing\u2014Interference by flagman.\nWhere one walking on a public highway attempts to cross the tracks of a railroad in front of an approaching train and the flagman at the crossing takes hold of him, after warning him to stop, but he breaks away and jumps in front of the train and is killed, the questions whether the accident was the result of the action of the flagman and whether the flagman\u2019s action was justified, under the circumstances, will not be submitted to the jury.\nArgued April 5, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 221, Jan. T., 1892, by plaintiff, Regina Oberdorfer, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Phila. Co., March T., 1891, No. 1011, compulsory nonsuit.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Williams, McCollum and Heydrick, JJ.\nTrespass for damages for death of plaintiff\u2019s husband by alleged negligence of defendant\u2019s flagman.\nThe evidence on the trial before Fell, J., was to the following effect: The tracks of the defendant cross Tenth street, Philadelphia, diagonally, just above Diamond street. Leopold Oberdorfer, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, about half past eight o\u2019clock in the evening of March 11, 1891, came down Tenth street on the sidewalk. A gate across the driveway was down and defendant\u2019s flagman, with a lantern in his hand, was standing on the south-bound track while a train of empty cars crossed on the north-bound track. When this train had passed, the flagman saw a train coming toward him on the south-bound track and stepped on to the north-bound track. Between this latter track and the gate was a siding. When the flagman stepped on to the north-bound track, Leopold Oberdorfer had about reached the gate. The flagman called to hiin to stop; and then, as he did not stop, caught hold of him by the lapel of his coat; but he broke away and jumped in front of the engine and was killed. When the flagman caught hold of him, Oberdorfer was at least twelve feet from the south-bound track. The flagman\u2019s instructions were to put the gates down when trains were in sight and not to allow anybody to go across the tracks. The court entered a nonsuit and refused to take it off.\nMrrors assigned were, (1) entry of nonsuit; (2) ruling that plaintiff\u2019s evidence was insufficient; (3) refusal to take off nonsuit.\nGeorge P. Rich, with him Mayer Sulzberger, for appellant.\u2014 The questions, (1) was the decedent\u2019s death the direct result of the assault upon him; and (2) was the flagman justified, under the circumstances, in making the assault; should have been submitted to the jury.\nGavin W. Hart, not heard, for appellee."
