    "head_matter": "Massey, Appellant, v. Snowden et al.\nNegligence\u2014Mine\u2014Mining boss\u2014Contributory negligence.\nThe plaintiff, a \u201c boss hauler\u201d in defendants\u2019 mine, while attemptingto \u201c sprag\u201d or brake a cai\\ stepped on a large piece of slate alongside of the track, his foot slipped and the car ran over his leg. He had been over the road once before that day. A \u201cmining boss\u201d was employed by defendants. Held, in a suit by plaintiff for damages, that under all the circumstances of the ease it was proper to give binding instructions for the defendants.\nArgued May 9, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 63, Jan. T., 1891, by plaintiff, William Massey, from judgment of C. P. Fayette Co., Dec. T., 1886, No. 148, on verdict for defendants, Charles L. Snowden et al, trading as C. L. Snowden & Co.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Heydrick, JJ.\nOn the trial before Ingraham, P. J., the evidence was to the following effect: Plaintiff was employed in defendants\u2019 mine as \u201c boss hauler,\u201d and had been so employed for three months before the accident. While conducting a car along a tramway in the mine, he came to a place where the grade required the application of a brake. Plaintiff attempted to \u201csprag\u201d the car, i. e., put a piece of wood called a \u201c sprag \u201d in one of the wheels to lock it, when the \u201c sprag \u201d flew out. He then seized the \u201c hitching \u201d (an iron for coupling the cars and sometimes used as a \u201c sprag \u201d) and attempted to \u201c sprag \u201d the car with it. While so doing he stepped on a piece of slate about 18 inches square and 6 to 8 inches thick, his foot slipped and went under the car, and he was so injured that his leg had to be cut off below the knee. The slate was up against the rib or side of the road, which at this point was about a foot from the rail. The slate had doubtless fallen from the roof. Plaintiff had been over the road once before on the day of the accident. Defendants employed a \u201c mining boss,\u201d who had been employed in that capacity at this mine for some years. The plaintiff offered some evidence tending to show that the mining boss was incompetent; but the evidence offered by the defendants of his competency was very strong. The defendants\u2019 first point, affirmed, was \u201c That under all the eviden\u00f3e in this case the plaintiff is not entitled to recover and the verdict must be for the defendants.\u201d\nError assigned, among others, was the affirmance of defendants\u2019 first point, quoting it.\nR. P. Kennedy and Edward Campbell, for appellant.\nS. L. Mestrezat, with him R. H. Lindsey, for appellees.\u2014\nThe evidence of the incompetency of the mining boss was insufficient to submit to the jury.\nDefendants are not responsible for the carelessness or negligence of the mining boss: Act of April 28, 1877, P. L. 58; Redstone Coke Co. v. Roby, 115 Pa. 364; Lehigh Valley Coal Co. v. Jones, 86 Pa. 432; Bridge Co. v. Newberry, 96 Pa. 246; Reese v. Biddle, 112 Pa. 72; Waddell v. Simoson, 112 Pa. 567.\nMay 23, 1892:"
