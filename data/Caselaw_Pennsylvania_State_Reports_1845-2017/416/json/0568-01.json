Plaintiffs appealed to this Court from an Order of the lower Court which dismissed their motion for a new trial.\nAs stated in the footnote in Mengo v. Sphar, 409 Pa. 223, 224, 186 A. 2d 9:\n\u201cToo many members of the Bar mistakenly believe that the appeal is from an Order which dismissed their motion for a new trial, instead of from a judgment which was entered on the verdict: Simpson v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 384 Pa. 335, 121 A. 2d 84. Compare also Hazle Township Supervisors\u2019 Appeal, 406 Pa. 641, 180 A. 2d 232.\u201d\nThe appeal is premature since no Judgment was entered in the lower Court, and for this reason the appeal must be quashed.\nThe record is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County without prejudice to the right to enter a Judgment on the verdict.\nAppeal quashed and record remanded.",
