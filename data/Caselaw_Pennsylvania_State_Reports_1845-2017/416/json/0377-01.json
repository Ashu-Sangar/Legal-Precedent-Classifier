The lower court held that since the assessment on the lots did not properly identify the assessed property, a tax sale based on the improper identification of the property was void and passed no title to plaintiffs. However, in order to make this determination it was necessary for the court below to consider factual matters neither averred in the comr plaint nor disclosed in any other part of the record.\nThe lower court was also of the opinion that plaintiffs were guilty of laches which we feel was a premature determination. Hence, the judgment entered by the lower court will be vacated and the record remanded to afford plaintiffs the opportunity to either further amend their complaint or require defendants to answer.\nJudgment vacated with a procedendo.",
