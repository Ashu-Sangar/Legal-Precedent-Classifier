In the first trial between these parties the jury disagreed; in the second trial, the jury returned a verdict for defendant; and in the third trial, i.e., the present trial, the jury likewise returned a verdict for defendant. In the present appeal, plaintiff alleges (a) prejudicial errors in the Court\u2019s charge and (b) the Court\u2019s failure to charge or correct his charge on one point as orally requested by plaintiff.\nWe find (1) no basic and fundamental error, and (2) no merit in any of plaintiff\u2019s contentions.\nJudgment affirmed.",
