And upon the death of the survivor of my said brothers and sisters to transfer, assign and pay over the principal of my said residuary estate unto such of the children and issue of deceased children of my said brothers and sisters as may be living at the time fixed for the said distribution, equally, absolutely, per stirpes.\u201d\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County, in a sound and comprehensive adjudication, determined that testator directed the distribution of principal per capita among the indicated nephews and nieces living at the termination of the trust, and that testator directed per stirpes distribution to the issue of deceased nephews and nieces.\nWe have carefully reviewed the record and the governing authorities and we are entirely satisfied that the court below correctly adjudicated the issues presented. We also share that court\u2019s view that the present controversy is governed by the principles of England Estate, 414 Pa. 115, 200 A. 2d 897 (1964).\nThe unanimous determination of the six judges of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County is affirmed.\nDecree affirmed.
