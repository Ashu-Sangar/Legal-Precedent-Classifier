While defendant-appellant does not dispute that the charge was erroneous he asserts it was harmless, because, under the proof, the erroneous portion was inapplicable to the case and, therefore, would not have entered into the jury\u2019s conelusion in favor of defendant. Accepting, for present purposes, defendant\u2019s view of the proof we are satisfied that the jury might have been sufficiently confused by the charge to bring the order of a new trial well within the bounds of the trial judge\u2019s discretion in such matters.\nOrder affirmed.",
