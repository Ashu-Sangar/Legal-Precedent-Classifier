        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nPlaintiff appeals from a judgment of nonsuit.\nPlaintiff brought a trespass action against Dome-nick Rechutti, the owner of Dorn\u2019s Normandy Market, a corner grocery store, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained when she bumped her leg on a basket in the defendant\u2019s grocery store.\nIn Repyneck v. Tarantino, 415 Pa. 92, 202 A. 2d 105, the Court said (pages 93-94) : \u201cIn Markle v. Robert Hall Clothes, 411 Pa. 282, 191 A. 2d 374, the Court quoting from Flagiello v. Crilly, 409 Pa. 389, 187 A. 2d 289, said (page 284) : \u2018 \u201cIt is hornbook law that a judgment of nonsuit can be entered only in clear cases and plaintiff must be given the benefit of all evidence favorable to him, together with all reasonable inferences of facts arising therefrom, and any conflict in the evidence must be resolved in his favor: Castelli v. Pittsburgh Railways Company, 402 Pa. 135, 165 A. 2d 632; Stimac v. Barkey, 405 Pa. 253, 174 A. 2d 868; Borzik v. Miller, 399 Pa. 293, 159 A. 2d 741.\n\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe law is likewise clear that the plaintiff has the burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence that defendant was negligent and that his negligence was the proximate cause of the accident: Stimac v. Barkey, 405 Pa., supra; Schofield v. King, 388 Pa. 132, 130 A. 2d 93.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nReviewing the testimony in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the following facts were established. On October 14, 1961, at approximately six o\u2019clock in the evening, plaintiff was marketing in defendant\u2019s store, as had been her custom for several years. The store was well lighted.\nPlaintiff asked for a \u201cpiece of meat.\u201d Defendant walked to the rear of the store where the meat was stored and plaintiff followed him. Defendant picked out a piece of meat and, standing behind the meat block and service counter, held up the meat and said, \u201cIs this all right?\u201d Plaintiff moved forward to see the meat better and bumped her right leg on a wire basket, one foot high and two feet wide, which was in front of the service counter. The basket was used by defendant to store potatoes and was in a well lighted aisle, with nothing to obstruct plaintiff\u2019s vision.\nIn Sloss v. Greenberger, 396 Pa. 353, 152 A. 2d 910, where this Court affirmed a judgment of non-suit, the Court pertinently said (page 355) : \u201c. . . It is normal, and certainly not improper, practice for supermarket operators to use part of the aisle for sale or display purposes, and it is impossible to find anything dangerous or even improper or unreasonable in the present display.\u201d\nFurthermore, defendant is not an insurer of the safety of his business invitees: Markle v. Robert Hall Clothes, 411 Pa. 282, 191 A. 2d 374, and numerous cases cited therein.\nPlaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant was negligent in holding up the meat, knowing that the basket was in front of the meat counter, is devoid of merit. Defendant, we repeat, is not an insurer and a plaintiff cannot walk blindly or carelessly into a clearly visible object and recover for injuries which resulted from her negligence.\nJudgment of nonsuit affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno and Mr. Justice Cohen dissent.",
