    <p id="b278-8" data-blocks='[["BL_278.11",278,[212,1234,1154,261]]]'>The action is based upon an alleged breach of a construction contract by the defendant, the Mellon-Stuart Company (contractor), and a breach of the performance bond by the other defendant, the Seaboard Surety Company.</p>
    <p id="b278-9" data-blocks='[["BL_278.12",278,[211,1505,1156,584]]]'>The lower court concluded that from a reading of the contract (i.e., all of the documents comprising it) as a whole, a cost-plus agreement was entered into; that this was the clearly expressed intention of the parties and that the plaintiff-owner was to pay the defendant-contractor as the work progressed; that in view of the candid allegation in the complaint that the plaintiff-owner was without funds to carry through its responsibility, the defendant-contractor was legally justified in rescinding and not completing the contract. We agree with this conclusion.</p>

It speaks for itself and a meaning cannot be given to it other than that expressed. Where the intention of the parties is clear, there is no need to resort to ex<a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>trinsic aids or evidence. While the documents comprising the contract here involved do contain some mutually inconsistent provisions, a reading of the entire contract permits of no reasonable interpretation other than that placed thereon in the court below.</p>
