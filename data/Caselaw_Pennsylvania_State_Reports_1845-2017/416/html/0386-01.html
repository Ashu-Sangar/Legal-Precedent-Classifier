The theory of joint estates of this character is that <em>each of the tenants holds the entire estate by the half and by the whole. </em>On the death of one, the other does not acquire a new interest by descent. The interest of the surviving tenant in the whole is not increased by the extinguishment of the interest of the other by death, but rather is freed of the restraints imposed upon it by the presence of an interest of like degree and kind which existed while both lived: Cf. Haggerty’s Est., <a href="/pa/311/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="311 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="1146241" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0503-01">311 Pa. 503</a>.

It is the contention of appellant that when the parties expressed in the agreement that ‘either of them’ could withdraw all or any part of the fund, one of the elements essential to an estate by entirety was lacking, . . . <em>The fund withdrawn is still subject to the legal status of the estate, and it has stamped on it in the hands of the one who withdrew it all the elements of a trust. </em>Where both husband and wife have the power to withdraw funds deposited in a joint account, the power must be exercised in good faith for the mutual benefit of both, and cannot be rightly exercised by the fraudulent withdrawal of the corpus of the funds for the exclusive use of one for the purpose of depriving the other of any use thereof or title thereto. We have held that the fact an agreement creating an estate by entirety contains the right to withdraw by either husband or wife, does not destroy the legal effect of the estate. ‘It is a joint deposit with right of survivorship where the certificates are payable to husband <em>or </em>wife, as well as where payable to husband <em>and </em>wife.
