    <p id="b414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[225,784,1155,476]]]'>The answer denied material allegations in the complaint, and, as an additional defense, averred under new matter, that plaintiff was barred from recovery of any compensation by the Eeal Estate Brokers License Act of May 1, 1929, P. L. 1216, as amended, 63 P.S. §431 et seq., in that during the time involved he was not licensed as a real estate broker or salesman, and did not come within the exceptions for which no license was required.</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.6",414,[224,1271,1155,315]]]'>In the reply to the hew matter, plaintiff admitted that he did not qualify under the Act of 1929, supra, but averred that his right to compensation was not barred “because the loan itself was not. to be secured by real estate within the meaning of the Act of Assembly.”</p>

L. 1216, §12, 63 P.S. §442). It further specifically bars any individual, association or corporation from instituting suit for recovery <em>“for any act done or service' rendered, the doing or rendering of which is prohibited under the provisions of this act to others than licensed real estate brokers, unless such person </em>. . . <em>was duly licensed ... at the time of the doing of such act or the rendering of such service.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.) (P.

    <p id="b415-3" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[172,733,1148,314]]]'>Plaintiff’s position is that the loan sought by the defendant was a working capital corporate loan in which the lien on the real estate was merely incidental and not the principal basis for the transaction. Hence, it is urged the loan is not of the nature contemplated by the real estate licensing act.</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[170,1059,1148,688]]]'>The facts to justify a conclusion that the loan was of such a character do not appear in the pleadings. The denial in the reply that the loan was not within the meaning of the act was purely a conclusion which amounts to nothing. See, <em>Verona v. Schenley Farms Co., </em><a href="/pa/312/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="312 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="1150671" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0057-01">312 Pa. 57</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.%20317" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="167 A. 317">167 A. 317</a> (1933). However, at the time of argument in the court below, counsel agreed that the loan agreement upon which the loan was finally effected with the second bank should be made part of the record. If this is examined and considered, appellant argues that the nature of the transaction clearly appears, and establishes that a working capital corporate loan was involved.</p>

The plaintiff’s complaint so alleges. The loan agreement negotiated with the second bank also provides for the execution and delivery of a mortgage on the borrower’s real estate. Therefore, under the clear language of the statute, plaintiff in negotiating such a loan was acting in the capacity of a real estate broker, and the secur<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>ing of a license was a condition precedent to any enforcement of a contract to pay commissions for such service: <em>Newhouse v.

The loan commitment agreement negotiated by plaintiff was a usual one between a commercial lender and borrower when a large sum of money is involved. Among numerous other conditions and restrictions which were present here, and which are usually present between such parties, the loan commitment was also made subject to the execution and delivery of a mortgage as collateral for the loan. The note itself, upon which the $500,000 was advanced, clearly indicated that the loan was made on the <em>note </em>collateralized by a mortgage.</p>

Even a casual observer realizes that the financial world draws a distinction between “commercial banking” and “mortgage banking,” the former being handled by banking institutions like the lender in the instant case, while the bulk of the latter is handled by federal savings and loan associations and savings banks. In fact, the controller of the currency restricts the activity of commercial banks in mortgage loans.</p>
