The Court, noting that the provisions of the will created a charitable trust even though the word “trust” was not contained therein and holding that the executor under the will could appeal from the probate of the codicil, stated (p. 664) : “The law, therefore, is well settled that a trustee under a will has a duty to protect the interests of the beneficiaries of the trust. Where those interests are adversely affected by a later will or codicil, he is aggrieved by a probate decree allowing the later will or codicil so that he may appeal therefrom. A trustee of a charitable trust has a special duty to protect the interests of the beneficiaries because the real beneficiaries are unascertainable and, therefore unable to protect themselves, [citing a case]. The plaintiff [executor] is a trustee who is in that position. It can make no difference that the attorney general may also have the right of appeal, as suggested by the defendants. That does not relieve the plaintiff of his duty. His is the primary obligation”.</p>

      <p id="b307-7" data-blocks='[["BL_307.8",307,[158,1855,1150,490]]]'> In the case at bar, the Attorney General took no appeal. Mosher argues that the Attorney General is faced with a conflict of interest in that the Commonwealth, on the basis of the validity of the codicil, has already received $90,000 on account of the estate’s tax liability and that, if the codicil prevails, the Commonwealth is enriched taxwise whereas, if the codicil fails, the Commonwealth will lose taxwise. This argument lacks appeal. We are fully satisfied that the Attorney General has and will continue to hold <em>paramount </em>his duty as <em>parens patriae </em>and that he will not be influenced by any interest in tax gathering on the part of the Commonwealth.</p>
