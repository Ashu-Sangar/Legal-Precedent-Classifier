    <p id="b141-6" data-blocks='[["BL_141.6",141,[147,1053,1154,911]]]'>Following the accident, the plaintiff promptly notified the defendant of her injury and, as a result, an insurance adjuster contacted her within a few days and secured a written statement describing the occurrence. From July 17, 1959, until July 6, 1961, three different insurance adjusters, acting on behalf of the defendant, called upon the plaintiff personally or contacted her by phone many, many times inquiring of her health, physical progress, and possibilities of settlement. That the plaintiff imposed great confidence and trust in these individuals throughout is clear. As early as June 25, 1960, a sum was suggested in settlement which was refused because, as of that date, the extent of the injuries was undetermined. On the same occasion, she was informed not to worry about her claim because the case would be continued by the adjustment agency in her best interests.</p>
    <p id="b141-7" data-blocks='[["BL_141.7",141,[145,1974,1151,368]],["BL_142.1",142,[218,338,1154,261]]]'>Having failed to respond satisfactorily to medical treatment, the plaintiff was hospitalized from March 9 to May 4, 1961, and surgery was performed. During this period, one of the insurance adjusters involved visited her. Before this visit, he was informed by his employer that, in his employer’s opinion, no liability existed, and was instructed to offer a small <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>sum as a nuisance settlement. He made no offer, did not inform the plaintiff of the insurance carrier’s position as to liability, and, on the contrary, told her that it would be impossible to settle the case at that time because the extent of the injuries was not known.</p>
    <p id="b142-4" data-blocks='[["BL_142.5",142,[215,611,1156,844]]]'>On June 1, 1961, the plaintiff forwarded a letter to the same adjuster inquiring about the possibility of an interim payment to take care of her pressing financial problems, and also the advisability of retaining the services of an attorney. On June 11, 1961, she was visited by this adjuster. He told her, inter alia, that the defendant would have to pay her hospital and doctor bills because of its responsibility for her injury; “why hire an attorney and pay him when we haven’t refused you yet”; that the case was still open and active; that he would write to the home office and ask if interim payments were possible and asked, “Do you mind waiting a little while longer for an answer?”; that he (the adjuster) was getting married, but not to worry and he would see her again on his return.</p>

He informed her that the carrier was not empowered to make interim payments; that only one check could be issued <em>when all of the facts were in </em>and the case was settled to their mutual satisfaction; and that the plaintiff would be cheating herself if she agreed to settle before the full extent of the injuries was known. Again he concealed the fact that the carrier considered the case one of nonliability. Admittedly, he did not mention the statute of limitations because before this visit he had discussed this point with a superior and was specifically instructed not to do so. He inquired of and noted the additional expenses that had been incurred. Upon leaving, he said <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>that he would see her again and that she should phone him if anything turned up.</p>
    <p id="b143-4" data-blocks='[["BL_143.5",143,[235,450,832,41]]]'>The plaintiff was never contacted again.</p>

However, our study of the opinion is not convincing that ■this is what the court did.
