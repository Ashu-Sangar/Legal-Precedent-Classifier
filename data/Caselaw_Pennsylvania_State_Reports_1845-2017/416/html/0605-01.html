Liability for payment is placed upon the executor, but where the ultimate burden rests is a matter of state law. Internal Revenue Code of 1954, §§2001, 2002. Pennsylvania’s Estate Tax Apportionment Act of 1951 provides that the ultimate burden of the federal estate tax is borne by “the persons interested in property includible in gross estate in proportion that the value of the interests of each such person bears to the value of the net estate,” Act of August 24, 1951, P. L. 1405, §4(a), 20 P.S. §884(a), although the testator may direct that the burden shall be placed in a different manner, Id. §3(a), 20 P.S. §883(a). We have held that this statute creates a presumption that federal estate taxes are to be pro rated in accordance with its provisions “unless the testator in his will has clearly indicated an intent inconsistent with such presumption” by “a specific provision, clearly expressed” in “language . . . not . . . of doubtful import”: <em>Hoffmann </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/399/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="399 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="1290544" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0096-01">399 Pa. 96</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.2d%20237" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="160 A.2d 237">160 A. 2d 237</a> (1960).</p>

In some of these cases the intent was even clearer because decedent not only specified the fund but used such words as “deduct from” or “charge against” or specified that certain recipients were not to bear any tax burden.

With respect to federal estate taxes this contention has no force. Federal law requires the executor to pay the entire federal estate tax,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> including amounts attributable to assets not passing through his hands, e.g., jointly owned property.

Surplusage is not uncommon in wills. No one has or would contend that the words in the very provision in question directing executors to pay “just debts” are anything but surplusage. Further, while we ordinarily attempt to give some significant meaning to all the words of the will it must be remembered that the inference we are required to draw in this case is one that is <em>inconsistent </em>with the statutory presumption of pro rated federal tax burdens.</p>

Unlike federal taxes, the executor need only pay the state inheritance taxes on assets passing through his hands. Therefore, goes the argument, the words used direct him to do more than the law requires him to do. Such a direction standing by itself might be sufficient to imply an intent that the recipients of the nonprobate assets be relieved of their tax burden. But where such a direction would have to be extracted from a very loosely drawn clause which is obviously surplusage in part and is insufficient to shift the federal tax burden, it would be improper to find that the testator intended to draw such nice distinctions. Such an intent is not “plainly inferable”. <em>Anderson’s Estate, </em>supra. At <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>least, there is doubt; so the burden must be left where the law places it. <em>Dravo Estate, </em>supra.</p>
