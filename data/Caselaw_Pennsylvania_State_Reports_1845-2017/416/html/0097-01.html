Plaintiff seeks to recover losses incurred as a result of a contract between the parties which it was allegedly induced to enter as a result of fraudulent misrepresentations by the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b147-7" data-blocks='[["BL_147.11",147,[234,1279,725,40]]]'>The facts pleaded are as follows:</p>

In the process of negotiations toward the execution of this contract, Tasa exhibited to Linda various maps and drill records which substantiated its representation that the vertical cover line (overburden) did not exceed a maximum of 50 feet. This representation was false, which Tasa well knew, and was made with the fraudulent purpose of inducing Linda to enter into a contract for the removal of all recoverable coal on the tract, for ivhich Linda was to receive from Tasa $2.95 per ton. So too, the exhibited maps and drill records falsely represented the amount of overburden, as Tasa again knew, because it had prepared the maps and drill records at a time prior to Tasa’s earlier strip-<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>mining operations on the tract, during which operation Tasa had placed additional earth oyer the coal which was the subject of this contract.</p>
    <p id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[207,505,1153,313]]]'>Upon learning that the overburden exceeded 50 feet, and in fact averaged 60 feet, Linda entered re-negotiations with Tasa and it was orally agreed that, as a result thereof, Linda would receive $3.15 per ton of coal removed for Tasa, instead of the originally contracted for $2.95 per ton.</p>
    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.6",148,[205,832,1155,420]]]'>Nonetheless, because the overburden averaged some 60 feet in depth, it remained economically impractical for Linda to remove the coal and Linda ceased the operations called for in the contract. Thereupon, Linda instituted this action of trespass for fraud and deceit to recover the actual loss which it suffered as a result of the fraudulent misrepresentations regarding, inter alia, the overburden made to it by Tasa.</p>
    <p id="b148-6" data-blocks='[["BL_148.7",148,[203,1262,1155,585]]]'>The court below held, <em>as a matter of law, </em>that the renegotiation between the parties “after all the facts and true status were known to the plaintiff”, and the entering into a new contract for an increased profit to the plaintiff, waived any right of action for alleged misrepresentations which were the very basis and consideration of the new contract. Further, the court below said that a mere allegation of fact that Linda did not intend to waive its rights regarding the fraudulent misrepresentations could not destroy the legal effect of its actions in renegotiation.</p>
    <p id="b148-7" data-blocks='[["BL_148.8",148,[202,1856,1154,476]],["BL_149.1",149,[155,340,1147,152]]]'>A waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right: <em>Brown v. </em>Pittsburgh,, <a href="/pa/409/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="409 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="1883184" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0357-01">409 Pa. 357</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="186 A.2d 399">186 A. 2d 399</a> (1962). For a waiver to exist in the instant case, it would be necessary for Linda to have had at the time of the renegotiations full knowledge of all the material facts regarding the fraudulent statements which induced the original agreement, and, with this knowledge, to have entered into the new arrangement with an intention to waive any then ex<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>isting cause of action: <em>Browning v.

    <p id="b149-3" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[152,504,1150,1072]]]'>We agree with the court below that if Linda, with full knowledge of the fraud and deceit practiced upon it during the original negotiations, entered info a new agreement stipulating an increased tonnage price, it cannot now say that it did not intend to waive any then existing rights. If at that time Linda knew of the false representations and that the same were <em>fraudulent, </em>it could not renegotiate and accept a new agreement without waiving its claim upon the original fraud. Both parties being possessed of the same knowledge, the new contract would be an arm’s length bargain supplanting the original, fraudulently induced one. It is fundamental that a party to a contract cannot complain that he was fraudulently induced to accept a less than fair consideration for the contract, renegotiate the consideration after discovering the fraud, and then sue upon the original inducing fraud: <em>Negley v.
