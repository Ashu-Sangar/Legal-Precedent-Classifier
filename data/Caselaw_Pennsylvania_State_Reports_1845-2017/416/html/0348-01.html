    <p id="b398-7" data-blocks='[["BL_398.10",398,[213,999,1155,750]]]'>Appellants are holders of a hotel liquor license. As a result of an open inspection on September 22, 1962, by Liquor Control Board agents at the licensed premises, appellants’ license was suspended for 20 days on the ground that “[t]he licensees, their servants, agents, or employees permitted minors to frequent the licensed premises on September 22, 1962,” in violation of the Liquor Code. This statute provides, inter alia, that “[i]t shall be unlawful . . . (14) for any hotel . . . liquor licensee ... to permit . . . minors to frequent his licensed premises . . . except minors accompanied by parents, guardians, or under proper supervision.” Act of April 12, 1951, P. L. 90, §493(14), 47 P.S. §4-493(14).</p>
    <p id="b398-8" data-blocks='[["BL_398.11",398,[212,1760,1154,366]]]'>Licensees appealed from the suspension to the court of quarter sessions.

The board appealed to the Superior Court which reversed the court of quarter sessions. We granted allocatur.</p>

We find it unnecessary to <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>reach this question because, regardless of whether there was “proper supervision,” the record does not support a finding that minors <em>“frequent” </em>the licensed premises. Such a finding would be necessary to make out a violation.</p>
    <p id="b399-3" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[188,621,1148,1125]]]'>The officer who conducted the only inspection of record, on September 22, 1962, testified before the board that on that date he found 10 minors on the premises. (It was established that these minors were only having pizza and cokes and that no alcoholic beverages were requested or served.) Four of these minors testified before the board. It was uncontradicted that two of them had never been to the premises before and that the other two had been there only once or twice before with their parents. Counsel stipulated that the remaining minors would testify substantially the same as these four. In the hearing before the court of quarter sessions, licensees themselves made general statements indicating that on other occasions minors came to the licensed premises for food. But in regard to these occasions there was no evidence of names, dates, or conditions surrounding their visits. In short, outside of the finding of 10 minors on the premises on September 22, 1962, there was no specific evidence going to the necessary element of whether minors “frequent” the premises.</p>
