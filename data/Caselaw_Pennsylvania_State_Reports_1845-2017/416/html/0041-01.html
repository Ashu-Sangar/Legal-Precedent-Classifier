Prior to his death on July 21, 1960, W. P. Webster was the controlling stockholder and thereafter his widow, Gladys S. Webster, succeeded to his stock and became president of the company. On September 6, 1962, the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, sitting in equity, and acting upon Erie Drug’s petition, appointed the First National Bank of Erie as temporary receiver to liquidate the corporation’s assets. On September 27, 1962, First National was made permanent receiver. Its first and final account filed on September 13, 1963, showed distributable assets of $105,775.35 and unsecured claims due general creditors in the amount of $247,079.76.</p>

Also allowed was a debt due the receiver as a creditor of Erie Drug on a note in the amount of $26,000, plus $1,484.82 in interest computed at 5% to October 1, 1963.</p>

    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[234,1065,1156,1181]]]'>After careful consideration of the record, we must conclude that the chancellor correctly allowed Mrs. Webster’s claim for the principal sum due on her notes. The exception to the general rule which the <em>Gordon </em>case embodies is not applicable on the facts of the case presently under consideration. The <em>Gordon </em>holding resulted from a corporate situation readily distinguishable from that which existed in the Erie Drug Company. The corporation in <em>Gordon </em>was a mere form, an instrumentality of the shareholder-creditor. The result was that the loan from the creditor-shareholder to the corporation was a loan to the creditor himself, only in a different form. The Court in <em>Gordon </em>recognized this factor as generating an exception to the usual rule. <a href="/pa/350/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="350 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="461174" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0277-01">350 Pa. at 288</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20A.2d%20229" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="38 A.2d 229">38 A. 2d at 234</a>. There is, furthermore, no evidence whatever of bad faith which would operate to remove the case from the general rule stated above. It is quite evident that the loan by Mrs. Webster was bona fide. The court below, in distinguishing the <em>Gordon </em>case from the instant situation, properly stated the governing considerations and correctly applied them to the instant facts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

They submit that the due date of these obligations must, at the latest, be considered the date on which the company was placed in receivership, September 6, 1962. As an alternative to their argument recited in the paragraph above, they urge that if interest is to be allowed to anyone after the date of the receivership, they are also entitled to interest. Since we have held that interest terminates with respect to all general creditors as of the date of receivership, we need only consider whether appellants are entitled to interest prior to that date. The court below, while allowing interest claimed by Mrs. Webster and the bank for the period prior to the receivership, denied any interest on appellants’ claims, on the ground that, while Mrs. Webster and the bank properly claimed interest, the other creditors failed to do so. The court took the position that the “receiver could not allow an amount in excess of a claim and, even if inclined to do so, was not in possession of sufficient facts upon which to base a judgment as to when the interest period was to begin.” In challenging this determination, appellants have made several assertions which were not advanced below, including, among others, allegations that the receiver gave no notice to file proofs of claim, and that no order was ever made by the court fixing a deadline for filing claims.

        <em>Sterling Co.] </em>was that the company was the stockholder’s instrumentality and when he put money in it, he was, in effect, lending money to himself. ... [I]t should first be noted that the Supreme Court in Gordon reiterated the principle — often announced in other cases — that a stockholder, who in good faith advances money to a corporation for the corporation’s benefit, is not necessarily precluded from sharing in the distribution of assets upon the same terms as other unsecured creditors. While the court departed from this principle in the Gordon case, it pointed out that the other, nominal stockholders in the corporation paid nothing for their shares and no stock certificates were ever issued to them. Further, the debt due the sole stockholder arose out of advancement made to the corporation before it was formed for the purpose of buying the assets with which it commenced business, and the sole stockholder received his control of the corporation through the issuance of stock to him as a partial repayment of his advancements. The debt thus created was not the result of money loaned in the regular course of company business, but was merely a financing arrangement to permit the sole stockholder to form a corporation and gain its control.</p>
      <p id="b93-6" data-blocks='[["BL_93.2",93,[139,1493,1153,765]]]'>“In this case there is no evidence whatever that the other stockholders of the corporation, either before or after Mr. Webster’s death, were not, in fact bona fide stockholders in every sense of the word. Neither Mr. and Mrs. Webster combined, nor Mrs. Webster alone, following her husband’s demise, were ever the sole stockholders of the company. Whereas in the Gordon case the indebtedness was to the sole stockholder, the indebtedness in this case was to a substantial stockholder; whereas in the Gordon case the indebtedness was a fiction for the purpose of enabling a sole stockholder to form and operate a corporation as an individual enterprise, the indebtedness here was very real and genuine. Every dollar loaned by Mrs. Webster to the corporation was loaned after the corporation was formed and for the purpose of promoting the best interests of the company. There is a total absence of any evidence that the indebtedness was not created in good faith for the benefit of the company or that there was any double-dealing, fraud or improper purposes in the transactions.</p>

Of course, where there is fraud or bad faith, the offending stockholder should not be allowed to profit by his own deceit .... [I] n a case such as this, where money was actually loaned to the company for business; where the lending stockholder actually paid interest due on company obligations from her personal funds in order to keep the company afloat; where the stockholder-creditor refused to cash interest checks issued on notes due to her by the company, and where the officers of the company, at times, declined to accept salary so as . . . not to deplete company funds, the picture is so devoid of evidence of bad faith, fraud or covin among the stockholders and officers that the general principle of allowing a stockholder-creditor to participate in distribution pro rata with other creditors should not be disturbed.”</p>
