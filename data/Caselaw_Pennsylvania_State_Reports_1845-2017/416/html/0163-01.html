Objection was made on the ground that §601 was unconstitutional. In upholding the power of the courts to act, the Superior Court pointed to (1) the Act of March 24, 1803, 4 Sm. L. 30, which gave to the courts of quarter sessions the power, upon petition, to erect new townships and to alter the lines of adjoining townships “so as to suit the convenience of the inhabitants thereof,” (2) the similar power regarding wards of boroughs contained in the Act of May 14, 1874, P.

L. 283, the borough authorities were required, when they annexed any territory to the borough by ordinance, to file a plan of the extension with the court of quarter sessions and to publish notice of their action. Thereafter, any citizen of the borough or of the annexed territory could appeal from the ordinance to said court; and the court had the power “at its discretion” to decree or refuse the extension of the borough limits in the same manner as it did under the Act of 1834, supra. While this discretion was repealed by the Act of April 22, 1903, P. L. 247, it reappeared in the Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 312, The General Borough Act.</p>

In other words, the grand jury was to decide if the statute had been complied with and the annexation was “expedient”; and the court of quarter sessions had power to confirm the report or take such further action “as to right and justice shall appertain.?’</p>

While discretion is not always a feature of these powers, it was present in each of the above cited acts — including acts dealing with annexation; and although existing annexation statutes provide for discretion in only two cases — under The Borough Code and under the Act of 1953 — this factor does not alter the obvious historical fact that the court of quarter sessions has long exercised wide discretionary powers in this area. In this respect we find no basis for distinguishing between the presently challenged “propriety of the annexation as serving public interests” and the prior phrases, such as “at its discretion” and “as to right and justice shall appertain” or even just “the propriety.” They all require reference to the body of law developed over the years; and even though an annexation may, in fact, be different from an incorporation or a boundary line alteration or a ward division or abolition, it raises issues not dissimilar in the context of the general affairs of political subdivisions.</p>

Whether or not the continued reliance on judicial discretion in this limited portion of the total annexation potpourri is wise and beneficial in today’s administration of local government is not for us to determine. Change in these matters must come from the General Assembly; it is here sufficient that what has been done is constitutionally proper.</p>

Act of 1953, supra, §1, 53 P.S. §67501. In the proceedings below the present appellants attempted to show that while a majority of freeholders in the Bethlehem Township territory to be annexed had signed the petition, this majority resided in a small area of this territory and that the freeholders residing in the remaining area were opposed to the annexation. The lower court disposed of this attempt by holding (1) the evidence was insufficient on this point and (2) the establishment of the annexation line is in the hands of the petitioning freeholders and annexing subdivision.</p>

However, in view of our disposition of this proceeding, we believe certain comments are in order. Where, in the unusual circumstance of an annexation proceeding involving an area considerably larger than that in which the petitioning freeholders reside, it can be shown that the freeholders in the remaining area are opposed to the annexation, this fact is one which must be taken into consideration by the lower court in determining the propriety of the annexation as serving public interests. Otherwise, it may be that the dissatisfied freeholders, after the annexation is completed, will simply petition their former governing subdivision for reannexation minus the area in which the original petitioning freeholders reside. Avoidance of this type of action is desirable; and even though the lower court cannot change the line set by the petitioners, it may consider these possibilities in weighing the question of propriety.</p>

If, within thirty days after certification, no aggrieved person complains to the court and asks for the appointment of a fact-finding body, the court is to satisfy itself regarding the “legality of the proceeding and the propriety of the annexation as serving public interests” and, if satisfied, is to affirm the annexation. Thus, even if no complaint is made, the court must be satisfied that (1) the procedures that have been followed conform in all respects to the statutory requirements and are not irregular in any way and (2) the annexation is in the public interest. The court has the duty of making its own inquiry with regard to these two matters, and it cannot satisfy itself as to the second simply by referring to the wishes of the majority. As we recently said: “The statute clearly makes the wishes of the majority of the area freeholders only one of the factors to be considered; consideration of such factor as the sole factor . . . negates both the language and the intent of the statute.” <em>Chartiers Township Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/414/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="414 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="1890353" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0176-01">414 Pa. 176</a>, 181, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.2d%20443" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="199 A.2d 443">199 A. 2d 443</a>, 445 (1964).</p>

In this respect there is no burden of proof. It is the court’s duty to inquire even in the absence of complainants; and while the complainants may present evidence to assist the court in making its determination, it is wrong to place a burden of proof upon them as the court below did here. Similarly, of course, the proponents may present whatever evidence they can to support the legality of their procedures and the propriety of the annexation; but <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>here, too, no burden of proof is upon them.

It is then to report to the court which considers its findings plus any additional facts submitted to it and makes a final order. Act of 1953, §5, 53 P.S. §67505. Obviously, the purpose of this additional proceeding is to adduce all of the necessary information to assist the court in making a final decision as to whether the annexation is in the public interest. It is not a hearing in the sense that exceptions are to be filed by the parties or that either party takes on a burden of proof. It is simply a supplemental procedure sanctioned by statute for the court’s benefit and to enable the parties to submit expeditiously to the court the relevant facts.</p>

In doing so, the board has obviously gone beyond the usual procedures for it stated in its report that it “made inquiry by conferring with interested counsel, by taking testimony, by viewing the ground, by considering certain unsolicited communications and verbal advices, and by studying relevant documents and maps.” The first and fourth of these were improper methods of finding facts. Counsel may stipulate facts before the board; otherwise, they are not sources of facts. The other erroneous source is unfathomable to us; such communications and advices can only be considered if produced at the board’s hearing. These improper procedures by the board cannot be said to have been disregarded by the court below in its final opinion.</p>
