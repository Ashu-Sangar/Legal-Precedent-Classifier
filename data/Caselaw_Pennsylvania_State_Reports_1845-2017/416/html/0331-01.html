The appellant was lying seriously wounded at or near her feet. The murder weapon was found in an adjoining room. The appellant was immediately taken to a hospital where an emergency operation was performed. Later that morning, he was interrogated by the police at which time he was first and immediately warned that anything he said would be recorded and used against him in court. However, the assistance of counsel was not offered nor requested. His description of the event was stenographically recorded. Subsequently, it was typewritten and four days later presented to the appellant to read. After suggesting an important correction, he signed it. This statement was admitted in evidence at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The question immediately arises: Were the police required to afford or at least offer the assistance of counsel before proceeding with the questioning.

    <p id="b384-4" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[215,559,1155,904]]]'>The statement here involved was obtained through a perfectly legitimate, police investigation of what was then an unsolved murder. While the circumstances undeniably indicated the guilt of the appellant, this conclusion was far from being exclusive. Before an arrest was made, the police were not only justified in their actions, but were required in fulfillment of their responsibilities to hear “the other side” and to give the suspected individual the opportunity of explanation. To hold now that his description of the event at that time is inadmissible, because he did not have counsel or waive his right thereto beforehand, is tantamount to precluding the police from ever interrogating individuals suspected of crime, and could result in barring from evidence all admissions obtained in the course thereof. No decision has as yet stated this to be the law.</p>

In that case, the defendant requested the opportunity to see his counsel before and during the questioning, which requests were rejected; the police knew he had engaged and consulted counsel several days before he had been taken into custody; the engaged counsel had come to the police headquarters, and had attempted for three hours to see his client during the period of interrogation, and was, in fact, in an adjoining room but was “quickly ushered away”; therein the accused was already in custody but was not advised of the fact that any statements made would be used against him in court; and finally, the accused was informed by a police officer that if he made the desired statement, he <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>would be released and held only as a witness.

However, a contrary result has been reached in California. <em>People v. Dorado, </em><a href="/citations/?q=40%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20264" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="40 Cal. Rptr. 264">40 Cal. Rptr. 264</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=394%20P.2d%20952" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="394 P.2d 952">394 P. 2d 952</a> (1964), rehearing granted.</p>

      <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>While I join in the majority opinion and conclusion, I am not entirely untroubled by the fact that, at least in part, our test turns on a request for counsel. There are some logical problems in making it do so. See <em>People v. Dorado, </em>supra, at 268, <a href="/citations/?q=394%20P.2d%20952" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="394 P.2d 952">394 P. 2d at 956</a>. In fact, Justice White in dissent in <em>Escobedo, </em>joined by Justices Clark and Stewart, sees difficulty in limiting the <em>Escobedo </em>majority’s ruling to cases where counsel has been requested. <a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">378 U.S. 478</a>, 495, <a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">84 S. Ct. 1758</a>, 1767. Among other things, I am somewhat bothered by the fact that a “request test” may protect only those who know enough to request counsel. Those most likely to know that they should request counsel are persons often in criminal trouble before, perhaps the habitual criminal. Those who are having their first encounter with the law may be much less likely to have either the knowledge or presence of mind to request counsel.</p>
    <p id="b387-3" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[184,1333,1147,412]]]'>Nevertheless, I do see a greater deprivation of rights when an accused requests counsel and the state refuses to permit him to exercise that right. I am willing, at least for the present, to believe that this situation violates constitutional imperatives, while the situation in the present case does not. In part, this willingness stems from <em>Escobedo’s </em>repeated references to the “circumstances” of that case.</p>
    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.5",387,[184,1766,1147,367]]]'>No doubt, we shall have further guidance from the Supreme Court of the United States on this subject. In any event, if the law enforcement officers of this Commonwealth unfailingly advise one upon whom the spotlight of accusation has swung that he has a right to counsel, then the stress in this area will be substantially lessened.</p>
