Liberty Street is intersected by Eleventh Street, a <em>one way </em>street for vehicular traffic proceeding in an easterly direction, and, at that intersection, a stop sign is located which requires Eleventh Street vehicular traffic to stop before entering Liberty Street. As Daly’s motor vehicle entered this intersection, it was struck by a motor vehicle, owned and then operated by Edward Buterbaugh (Buterbaugh), which had been traveling in an easterly direction on Eleventh Street. As a result of this collision, both Nancy Daly and Daly sustained personal injuries.</p>

Sometime thereafter, Daly’s post-trial motions were dismissed and the prothonotary directed to enter judgment on the verdict. The judgment <em>as entered </em>on August 28, 1963, reads: “. . . judgment in <em>favor of </em>Nancy Daly against Donald Daly, additional defendant, in the amount of the verdict $16,000.00 plus int. from date thereof October 18, 1962. . . .” From that judgment this appeal is taken.</p>

It is clear that questions which could have been but were not raised in the court below need not be considered on appeal: <em>Clark v. Rutecki, </em><a href="/pa/408/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="408 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1308387" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0025-01">408 Pa. 25</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.2d%20687" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="182 A.2d 687">182 A. 2d 687</a>. To this contention Daly’s counsel answers that it was not until disposition of the post-trial motions and the entry of the judgment under direction of the court below that the invalidity of this judgment appeared. In other words, Daly’s counsel assumed — with some justification — -that the judgment directed to be entered would be in favor of Nancy Daly against Buterbaugh, original defendant, and Daly, additional defendant, and not in favor of Nancy Daly against Daly, additional defendant. We believe that Daly’s counsel’s position has merit. The attack on the validity of the judgment as entered could not have been raised at any other stage of the proceeding and the error complained of may be considered “basic and fundamental” within the rationale of <em>McDonald v.

Our inquiry into the validity of Daly’s position must be initiated by an examination of the pleadings of Nancy Daly and Buterbaugh. There is no averment in the complaint of Nancy Daly that Daly had been negligent nor that Daly was in anywise liable to her for damages; therefore, the effect of this judgment is to award to her damages for which she made no claim and for negligence which she did not aver.

In <em>Fisher, </em>a wife and husband instituted a trespass action against a third pa,rty to recover damages resulting from a collision between the husband’s motor vehicle, then operated by him, and a truck owned by the third party and then operated by the third party’s employee. The third party requested a severance of the actions and a joinder of the husband as an additional defendant, the latter on the theory that the husband was solely or, in the alternative, jointly liable for the accident. The court below granted both the requested severance of the actions and <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>the joinder of the husband as an additional defendant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> At trial, the jury returned a verdict against <em>both </em>the third party and the husband. On appeal, the sole question at issue was the propriety of the joinder of the husband as an additional defendant. In ruling that such joinder was proper, the late President Judge Keller stated: “The action of the court below was not equivalent to permitting an action by the wife against her husband. Her husband is not a party defendant to the action as far as she is concerned. The judgment against him, as restricted by the Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> is not enforceable by her, nor does it enure to her benefit. It is simply a judgment enuring to the benefit of the original defendant if he pays or is required to pay the wife’s judgment; and it then requires the husband to pay to the original defendant only one-half of the damages paid by the latter as a result of the joint negligence of both.” (pp. 488, 484). The Court held the joinder of the husband as additional defendant was proper and the judgment against both the third party and the husband should be affirmed subject, however, to the provision that “no execution be issued by the plaintiff [the wife] on the judgment entered against the additional defendant [the husband], ‘so that the wife may recover only from the original defendant, [the third party], and that the [third party], original defendant, may obtain only contribution from [the husband]’.” (p. 487). By the application of <em>Fisher to </em>the case at bar, Nancy Daly could recover <em>only </em>on her judgment against Buterbaugh and Buterbaugh could <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>recover only by way of contribution against Daly but, in no event, could Nancy Daly recover on the judgment against Daly.</p>

We said (p. 133) : “The court <em>en banc </em>recognized that although [the husband] was properly joined as a defendant for purposes of contribution in the action by his wife against [the third party], he [the husband] could not be directly liable to his wife. The court concluded, nevertheless, that the error was not prejudicial to the [husband and wife], and could be corrected by striking the verdict in favor of [the wife] against her husband from the record.

Ten months later Janet Meisel married Little and, sometime thereafter, she sued Little as an original defendant alleging that his negligence was the cause of the accident. Little moved for judgment on the pleadings which judgment the court granted. On appeal, this Court stated the issue: may a wife maintain an action against her husband for personal injuries caused by a tort committed by the husband prior to the marriage? In affirming the judgment entered by the court below, we held that the rule that a wife could not maintain an action for personal injuries against her husband for a tort caused by the latter was both “statutory and decisional” and that such rule “has been always strictly adhered to in this Common<a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>■wealth”. While the actual decisional point in <em>Meisel </em>is that a direct trespass action for personal injuries is not maintainable by a wife against her husband during coverture even though the husband’s tort preceded the marriage, its language in proscribing a trespass action by a wife vis-a-vis her husband is much broader.</p>

Carol Dallas sued the operators of the other two motor vehicles and Ondovehih was brought upon the record as an additional defendant. Sometime thereafter, Carol Dallas married Ondovehih. When the case was tried the jury returned a verdict against Ondovehih alone. The court below set aside the verdict “because the plaintiff and additional defendant were husband and wife”, (p. 645). This Court, in reversing the judgment n.o.v. entered in the court below, distinguished <em>Meisel </em>in the following manner: (a) in <em>Meisel, </em>suit was begun <em>after </em>the marriage and <em>during coverture, </em>whereas in <em>Ondovchik </em>suit was begun <em>prior </em>to the marriage; (b) in <em>Meisel, </em>suit was instituted directly against the husband as an original defendant whereas in <em>Ondovchik </em>the suit was entered against third parties who brought Ondovchik upon the record as <em>an </em>additional defendant; (c) in <em>Ondovchik, </em>the wife did not testify against the husband or vice versa, whereas in <em>Meisel, </em>had the suit proceeded to trial, the wife would have been required to testify against the husband and vice versa. The real nub of <em>Ondovchik </em>is to be found in the language of the Court: “It was the <em>verdict of the jury </em>which imposed liability upon the additional defendant [the husband]” (p. 646). (Emphasis supplied) The rationale of <em>Ondovchik </em>was that the <em>verdict </em>was “not the equivalent of a <em>suit </em>or <em>action” </em>by the wife against the husband so as to bar com<a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>meneement of the suit itself, that no <em>suit </em>had been commenced by the wife against the husband within the meaning of the Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344, §3, as amended, 48 P.S. §111, and that neither our case law nor statutes prohibited or proscribed a <em>verdict, </em>as distinguished from a <em>suit, </em>by a wife against a husband. Simplified, <em>Ondovchik </em>holds that, while a wife under the circumstances cannot <em>sue </em>her husband, she can <em>recover </em>damages from him.</p>

      <em>Ondovchik </em>presents real difficulties to an understanding of this Court’s view on this important problem, a problem which the bench and bar, relying on the statutes and prior case law, with justification, have assumed to be settled. Until <em>Ondovchik, </em>it was the law of this Commonwealth that (a) a wife could not directly institute a suit against a husband and (b) that while a husband could be joined as an additional defendant in a suit instituted by the wife against a third party or parties, the wife could recover <em>only </em>against the third party or parties but not against the husband, although the third party or parties could recover against the husband by way of contribution. An examination of <em>Koontz, Fisher </em>and <em>Kiser </em>clearly indicates that both our Court and the Superior Court have recognized that the law precludes any <em>recovery </em>in tort by a wife against a husband under the circumstances. To repeat that which we said in Koontz: <em>“Plaintiff [the </em>wife] <em>has had and could have no recovery against her husband, although the latter is joined as additional </em>defendant”. (p. 494). (Emphasis supplied). In <em>Ondovchik, </em>a wife was permitted to <em>recover </em>against her husband and, even though <em>Koontz </em>and <em>Fisher </em>were cited in <em>Ondovchik, </em>this Court failed to recognize that <em>Ondovchik </em>repudiated the rationale of <em>Koontz, Fisher </em>and <em>Kiser.</em>

This was based upon the legal premise that a husband and wife are one person, one entity. See, Prosser on Torts, 2d Ed. 670 (1955). This rule, now based upon social reasons and public policy, is still followed in a great majority of jurisdictions in the United States, [citing authorities]. The same rule has been always strictly adhered to in this Commonwealth. However, here in Pennsylvania, <em>it is both statutory and decisional. </em>The Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344, §3, as amended by the Act of March 27, 1913, P. L. 14, §1, 48 P.S. §111, specifically prohibits such an action. . . . Moreover, this Court has said repeatedly over a long period of years that the common law prohibition of litigation between spouses has not been abrogated by the Acts of 1893 or 1913, supra, [citing cases]. It is argued that the rule is based upon an antiquated fiction which has been dissipated by the passage of the Married Women’s Acts beginning in 1848. This overlooks the fact that the legislature in clear specific language has said as late as the year 1913, that neither a husband nor a wife may sue the other during coverture upon such a cause of action.” It is crystal clear that under the law in this Commonwealth, until <em>Ondovchik, </em>such an action for personal injuries could not be maintained during coverture.</p>

First, whether the husband’s tort occurred <em>prior to </em>or <em>during </em>coverture should be of no moment; the impact on the family relationship is the same and the public policy which denies the right to <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>maintain an action for a tort occurring during coverture applies equally to tlie denial of tbe right to maintain an action for a tort occurring <em>prior to </em>marriage. Second, recognition of the right of joinder as an additional defendant in an action by a wife against a third party is only for the purpose of protecting the right to contribution of the third party against the husband and does not create any right in the wife as against her husband. Third, it is the impact of litigation upon the relationship of a wife and husband which our case law and public policy proscribe, not simply the fact that a wife may have to testify against a husband and vice versa. Lastly, the distinction drawn in <em>Ondovchik </em>between the <em>verdict </em>— the so-called “end result” of the litigation — and the <em>suit </em>— the inception of the litigation — is a distinction without a difference. Our case law and public policy have forbidden tort litigation for personal injuries between a husband and wife because of the potential danger to the marriage relationship inherent in such litigation; whether the litigation is <em>instituted </em>by the one spouse against the other or whether litigation results in a <em>recovery </em>by one against the other should be of no moment because the injurious impact upon the marriage relationship is present in both instances. The actual result reached in <em>Ondovchik </em>is at complete variance with the results reached in <em>Koontz, Fisher </em>and <em>Kiser; </em>either <em>Koontz, Fisher </em>and <em>Kiser </em>should be overruled or <em>Ondovchik, </em>even though so recently determined, must be rejected. <em>Ondovchik </em>cannot co-exist with <em>Koontz, Fisher </em>and <em>Kiser.</em>

Schlosser, </em>supra, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the wife-plaintiff solely against her husband (an additional defendant) after instructions from the trial judge that such a verdict was permissible. This Court agreed with the lower court’s determination that this trial error could be corrected by having the judgment stricken from the record. <a href="/pa/389/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="389 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="1274014" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0131-01">389 Pa. at 133</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20A.2d%20344" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="132 A.2d 344">132 A. 2d at 346</a>. The issue in <em>Kiser </em>was not the question presently before us. It dealt primarily with the propriety of the grant of a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b593-4" data-blocks='[["BL_593.5",593,[147,894,1148,519]]]'>In <em>Ondovchik </em>the issue was whether our statute, which prevents direct suits between husband and wife, bars recovery by a plaintiff-spouse on a judgment entered against her additional defendant-husband on a suit begun before the parties were married. Whatever the “majority” thinks of the issue now before us, an examination of the above cases discloses that none of them involved the issue presented in <em>Ondovchik </em>and that <em>Ondovchik </em>was not controlled by those prior decisions.</p>
    <p id="b593-5" data-blocks='[["BL_593.6",593,[146,1434,1149,634]]]'>Moreover, a study of these cases convinces me that we have never squarely decided the issue now raised directly by the merits of this case. We must now decide whether a wife-plaintiff may have the benefit of a judgment entered upon a jury verdict returned against both the original defendant and her additional defendant-spouse. In any event, none of the cases which the “majority” finds compelling, except <em>Meisel, </em>involved either a reference to the statute or an analysis of the policy underlying it. We found such an analysis necessary in Ondovchik; it is likewise essential to a proper approach here.</p>

Hence, the <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>proceeding there was not in violation of the statute. Nor did the result reached there offend public policy since the litigation itself did not create or promote domestic discord. One spouse did not testify against the other. Both testified to facts which would have placed liability upon the original defendants. The imposition of liability by the jury was not the product of dispute, contention or any other disruptive circumstance between them.</p>
    <p id="b594-5" data-blocks='[["BL_594.5",594,[216,839,1155,527]]]'>It is clear here that this is not a case of spouses being adverse parties at the institution of suit or during any phase of the proceeding prior to or after verdict and judgment. Nor is the verdict and judgment a product of direct action by one spouse against the other as was sought in <em>Meisel. </em>On the present record, there is not a single, apparent, possible or even suggested element of “potential danger to the marital relationship inherent in such litigation” which the “majority” assumes.</p>
    <p id="b594-6" data-blocks='[["BL_594.6",594,[212,1376,1156,582]]]'>In the absence of any spousal conflict, dissension or disagreement created by the institution of the trespass action itself, there is no basis for concluding, as a matter of fact or policy, that domestic harmony is threatened or destroyed by litigation of the present nature. There is an obvious and significant difference in the impact which direct litigation (such as that in <em>Meisel) </em>may have upon a marriage as contrasted to recovery, as here, on a judgment created by third party litigation in which both spouses unite in a joint effort to place liability upon an original defendant.</p>
    <p id="b594-7" data-blocks='[["BL_594.7",594,[209,1967,1155,315]],["BL_595.1",595,[167,349,1147,466]]]'>All that is prohibited by our <em>statute </em>is direct suit by one spouse against the other on a tort claim arising out of negligence. In the absence of a showing (or even a suggestion) that the circumstances here in any way offend the <em>judicially </em>announced public policy of preventing marital discord, there is no reason for deny<a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>ing tlie spouse enjoyment of the judgment. To do otherwise, on this record, is to employ the public policy doctrine where the reason for the rule does not, in fact, exist. So employed, the doctrine is not a concept for preserving domestic harmony, but becomes instead a misdirected application for defeating a fair and just result. Surely, developing concepts of proper responsibility for negligent conduct prompts the rejection of ueedless extensions of immunities.</p>
    <p id="b595-3" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[160,834,1153,1122]]]'>Realistically and practically, probably the only time one spouse will seek to secure the benefits of a judgment against the other in a trespass case will be in those instances where, as here, the husband has provided a fund for the satisfaction of such judgments by contract or liability insurance. This presents a situation which is <em>especially </em>and <em>particularly </em>free from concern that efforts to <em>satisfy </em>the judgment entail possibilities of a marital discord. Undoubtedly, a wife is one of the persons a husband most desires to protect by his purchase of insurance, yet this protection is precisely what the “majority” needlessly precludes. The “majority” reaches the same result as if Daly’s insurance policy contained a spousal exclusion or an express family exclusionary clause, as was in issue in <em>Great American Ins. Co. v.

Just as the “majority decision” adds nothing to marital harmony, so too, the judgment which the “majority” reverses contributes nothing to marital discord. The “majority” adds immunity where none is needed and where none is provided for in the husband’s contract for the protection of his wife. The “majority” extends interspousal immunity to an area never intended to be included within that doctrine. It ultimately fails to recognize the realities of the present situation and relies upon a fictional view of the rights and relationship of the litigants.</p>

In that event, the wife receives the full judgment even though half of the funds, in reality, have come as a result of the judgment against her spouse. On the other hand, the “majority” now holds it is not permissible to allow a wife to immediately recover half the damages from the third party and half from her spouse, the additional defendant. What is precluded directly is permitted by circuity. Marital discord, if any, is no more present in one route of recovery than in the other. Surely, reasoning which leads to so curious an inconsistency should not be the foundation for a rule of law. It lacks the fundamental soundness and reality expected of a prevailing legal principle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_10" id="ref_footnote_2_10">10</a>

Totally aside from this, the fact that no contribution has so far been elicited in this particular case is a purely fortuitous factor.
