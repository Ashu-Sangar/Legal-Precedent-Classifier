Dr. Dakin again saw testatrix on November 7, 1960, when she returned from the hospital; she still had poor memory for recent events. He saw testatrix on February 17, 1961, when she had another cerebral incident. A third incident occurred on October 10, 1961. Dr. Dakin again saw the patient on November 4, 1961. On January 10 and 27, and July 11, 1962, he attended the testatrix for a glandular condition. The doctor visited her again on November 8, 1962. He stated she was never able to answer any questions and he concluded that she did not have testamentary capacity on any of the above dates.</p>
      <p id="b178-6" data-blocks='[["BL_178.7",178,[197,1292,1157,533]]]'>Testatrix was also under the care of Dr. Richard P. Shapera, a specialist in internal medicine, who first saw her on October 10, 1960, and later when she was admitted to the hospital. He diagnosed her condition as resulting from a cerebral vascular accident affecting the area of the brain associated with thinking, remembering and orientation. In the doctor’s opinion, testatrix was “demented” when she was discharged from the hospital. He did not see her at any later time. Dr. Shapera expressed the opinion that she lacked testamentary capacity when she was discharged from the hospital and doubted that her condition would have changed within twenty days (the period within which testatrix allegedly revoked her 1953 will).</p>
      <p id="b178-7" data-blocks='[["BL_178.8",178,[194,1838,1155,401]]]'>Dr. Shapera consulted with Dr. Lowell Lubie, a neurologist, who examined testatrix and rendered a neurological evaluation and determination of her mental status while in the hospital. Dr. Lubie found the patient suffering from cerebral vascular insufficiency with organic syndrome. The frontal lobe of the brain (responsible for indirect reasoning and judgment), he concluded, was affected and the condition was not reversible. It was his opinion that she could not have had testamentary capacity at any time after the episode.</p>

Altman, also a neurologist, who expressed the opinion that testatrix could have <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>had remissions to normalcy at the times in issue. He had never treated or examined testatrix, nor had he consulted with any of her physicians or discussed her condition with anyone who observed her after the stroke. Moreover, the court below noted that appellant’s position was not that testatrix had lucid intervals or periods of remission when she revoked the first will and executed the second, but that she was competent at all times. Accordingly, the court concluded that Dr. Altman’s testimony was of little value.</p>

For these services he received $75 per month. David A. Hunter stood in a confidential relationship to Adelaide O. Hunter.

She did not know her neighbors with whom she had previously been friendly. She did not know her way about in Murrysvüle where she had lived for a long time. She did not know who lived along the short road into her house and did not know the way to her own home. In the Fall of 1960, after October, she could not answer any questions such as what she had for breakfast or what happened the day before. She was attended constantly after her stroke by a practical nurse, a Mrs. Adelaide Lennox, on the advice of her physician. She became lost in her own house. She believed she was still working at Kaufmann’s, although she had retired in 1953. She did not recognize her own church until the minister spoke. She repeatedly asked the same question several times when talking to neighbors.” From the findings of fact in the opinion of the court below.</p>
