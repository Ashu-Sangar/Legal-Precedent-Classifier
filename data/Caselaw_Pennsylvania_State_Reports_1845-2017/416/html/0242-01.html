Bowen, </em>supra, we were presented with a situation most apposite to the case at bar. In <em>Lhormer, </em>the plaintiffs filed an application for a building permit to construct a gasoline service station upon land then zoned “Commercial District C-2”, under which classification such use was permitted. The permit was refused on the ground that, at the time the application was filed, there was pending before the council an amendment to the zoning ordinance which would prohibit the use of plaintiffs’ property for a service station. An amendment to this effect was finally adopted on May 14, 1962.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> This Court, speaking through Justice Eagen, recognized (410 Pa. at p. 511) “that a property owner does not have a vested right to obtain a building permit, when the intended use is repugnant to the terms of an ordinance then <em>pending </em>upon the date the application is filed, and which is subsequently enacted.” However, the Court held that, under the factual situation therein presented, the ordinance was not legally “pending” on the day of the application for the permit. The Court noted (p. 511) “no public hearings were held by either the borough planning commission or the borough council prior to the date of the filing of the application for the permit, or the complaint in mandamus. Neither was there a prior public declaration by the municipality that it intended to rezone the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>area, nor is there evidence to justify a conclusion that the permit was sought in an effort to circumvent the ordinance. Under such circumstances, the ordinance involved was not ‘pending’, [citing a case]. The application should have been disposed of in accordance with the law then in effect, or at least pending.” It was then noted that (p. 514) “where the right to the permit is clear, the issuance thereof by the proper official is no more than the performance of a ministerial act which admits of no discretion in the municipal officer, and mandamus is both appropriate and proper to compel performance: [citing cases]”. In our view, <em>Lhormer </em>controls this case and compels the conclusion that mandamus does lie to command the issuance of the permit.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[218,1147,1156,1126]]]'>The court below sought to justify its refusal of mandamus upon the ground that the two prior ordinances which had classified the district in which the lots were located as “B-Business” constituted “spot zoning”. Such a declaration of the invalidity of these ordinances cannot justify the refusal of the building permit under the existing circumstance. Presumably both these ordinances were valid when passed and no attack had been made on their validity, even though both ordinances had been in effect for over six years. The attack, when made, was by the Township through whose legislative process these ordinances were passed. It ill behooves the Township now to challenge its own legislative actions to defeat the issuance of a building permit when the use sought by the application was clearly a permitted use in conformity with the two ordinances. Cf: <em>Jacobi v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/413/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="413 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="1888597" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0286-01">413 Pa. 286</a>, 289, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.2d%20742" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="196 A.2d 742">196 A. 2d 742</a>. Such belated declaration that these ordinances were invalid because they “spot zoned” these lots cannot now justify denial of a building permit under the circumstances.</p>
