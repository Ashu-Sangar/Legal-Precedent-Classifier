At trial, he was represented by court-appointed counsel, one of whom had previously served as a common pleas judge and an assistant district attorney. No post trial motions were filed, nor was an appeal taken from the judgment of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b339-11" data-blocks='[["BL_339.18",339,[139,1846,1149,261]]]'>On March 11, 1964, an action in habeas corpus was instituted. Court-appointed counsel again represented the appellant in this proceeding. After answer filed, the court below denied the writ without hearing. An appeal from this order is presently before us.</p>

    <p id="AeH" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[215,1699,1153,367]]]'>In the confusion that followed, Brewster and Walls escaped in the stolen automobile and drove to Tennessee. They returned to Butler a few days later, and abandoned the automobile in a wooded area after they had attempted to set it on fire to destroy any fingerprints or other telltale evidence. The automobile was located by the police on November 24th.</p>

After days of police investigation, the finger of suspicion pointed at Brewster and he Avas taken into custody on November 30th. Brewster admitted his guilt, but did not know the name or address of the other <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>man involved. After describing liis companion of the night in question, he was shown several photographs and finally identified one of Jesse R. Cricks. The latter was located in his own home where he was sick in bed, suffering from pneumonia. Brewster was taken to the bedside of Cricks and identified him as the other man involved. By coincidence, Cricks strongly resembled Walls and the mistaken identification was an honest one. After further investigation, the police exonerated Cricks and gained information which indicated Walls was the other man wanted. He was finally apprehended on December 4th, and readily admitted being the one who did the shooting, but plead that the result was purely accidental. He also denied any participation in the holdup. His statement was stenotyped, subsequently signed by the appellant, and admitted in evidence at trial without objection.</p>
    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[146,1269,1151,1008]]]'>Appellant’s first complaint is that he was illegally taken and detained in custody without the issuance of an arrest warrant. It is well established that an arrest may be made by a police officer where he has reasonable and probable cause to believe that the person arrested has committed a felony: <em>Henry v. United States, </em><a href="/us/361/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="361 U.S. 98" data-case-ids="6165250" data-case-paths="/us/361/0098-01">361 U. S. 98</a> (1959). “Probable cause . . . exists Vhere “the facts and circumstances within their [the (arresting) officers’] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that” an offense has been . . . committed.’ (citing cases)”: <em>Ker v. California, </em><a href="/us/374/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="374 U.S. 23" data-case-ids="8495" data-case-paths="/us/374/0023-01">374 U. S. 23</a>, 35 (1963); see also, <em>Henry v. United Slates, </em>supra. The record in this case discloses ample evidence to sustain a finding that the arresting police officers had reasonable and probable cause to believe that the appellant was involved in the crime in question.</p>

The record <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>discloses that he was held for action by the grand jury as the result of a hearing or inquest conducted by the coroner of Allegheny County on November 26, 1953, and January 14, 1954. There is no common law, statutory or constitutional right to a preliminary hearing. See, <em>Goldsby v.

However, the right of an accused to a preliminary hearing, with some exceptions (none pertinent here), has become part of the law in this Commonwealth. But, a defendant is not denied any of his rights because of the absence of a preliminary hearing, where there has been a coroner’s inquest: <em>Com. ex rel. Bandi v. Ashe, </em><a href="/pa/367/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="367 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="1228376" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0234-01">367 Pa. 234</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.2d%2062" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="80 A.2d 62">80 A. 2d 62</a> (1951). Moreover, mere irregularities in the arrest or proceedings before indictment, which do not constitute a denial of constitutional rights, cannot be raised for the first time in habeas corpus after conviction and sentence.

A study of the record discloses that nothing that occurred at that hearing was introduced in evidence at the trial on the indictment, or in any way entered into the jury’s determination of his guilt or innocence. Under the circumstances, no violation of constitutional rights occurred. See, <em>Com. ex rel. Maisenhelder v.

      <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>Appellant next complains that the jury in returning its verdict did not “fix” the punishment at life imprisonment, but rather “recommended” such punishment. Under the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §701, as amended, 18 P.S. §4701, where a defendant pleads “not guilty” to a murder indictment, it becomes the duty of the jury in the event a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree is returned to <em>fix </em>the penalty at life imprisonment or death. See, <em>Com. v. Homeyer, </em><a href="/pa/373/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="373 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="1240350" data-case-paths="/pa/373/0150-01">373 Pa. 150</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.2d%20743" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="94 A.2d 743">94 A. 2d 743</a> (1953) ; <em>Com. v.

While “fixing” and “recommending” are substantially different, there is no question of what the jury intended. Further, no objection to the form of the verdict was voiced or noted of record. The question was not raised in post trial motions or on appeal from the judgment. Under the circumstances, such an irregularity cannot now be raised for the first time in habeas corpus many years after the conviction and sentence.</p>

This does not constitute error. See, <em>Com. v.
