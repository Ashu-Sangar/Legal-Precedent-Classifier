L. 272, §1, 17 P.S. §299, it had no jurisdiction to grant an injunction against the erection of public works “until the questions of title and damages shall be submitted, and finally decided by a common-law court. . . .” or (2) that plaintiffs’ only interest in the property was “a license at will which was terminated. . . .” We express no opinion on the propriety of either of these grounds.</p>
