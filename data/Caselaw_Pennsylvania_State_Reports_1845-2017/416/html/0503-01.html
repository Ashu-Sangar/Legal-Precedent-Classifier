The litigation has been here before, <em>Schwartz v.

When we first reviewed this litigation, the chancellor had entered judgments of compulsory nonsuit, at the close of plaintiffs’ case, and we heard appeals from the refusal of the court en banc to take off the non-<a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>suits entered.

    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.6",558,[221,946,1154,964]]]'>From the foregoing brief history of this litigation, it must be readily apparent that the standard of review which governs our deliberations in the instant appeal differs markedly from that which led to the result achieved in the former appeal. When this matter first appeared here, we were dealing with judgments of compulsory nonsuit and held, merely, that the plaintiffs’ evidence was sufficient to create a prima facie case, thereby precluding nonsuits. In so holding, we were bound by the rule that a nonsuit should be entered only in a clear case, and, on appeal from the refusal to take off a compulsory nonsuit, the plaintiff must be given the benefit of all favorable testimony and every reasonable inference of fact arising therefrom and all conflicts therein must be resolved in favor of plaintiff. <em>Miller v.

He has found that the Authority’s rejection of the Schwartz proposal was based on proper criteria for the orderly development of the project and, therefore, no abuse of discretion existed. The Urban Redevelopment Law, Act of May 24, 1945, P. L. 991, 35 P.S. §1701 et seq., sets forth the powers of the Authority. Section 9(k) of the Act, 35 P.S. §1709 (k), gives the Authority the power “To sell, lease or otherwise transfer . . . any real property in a redevelopment area: <em>Provided, </em>That with respect to a redevelopment area the Authority finds that the sale, lease or other transfer of any part <em>will not be prejudicial to the sale or lease of other parts of the redevelopment area, nor be in any other way prejudicial to the realization of the redevelopment proposal </em>. . . .” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

The General Assembly declared the policy of the Commonwealth in the following language of the Act: “Therefore, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to promote the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants thereof by the creation of bodies corporate and politic to be known as Redevelopment Authorities, which shall exist and operate for the public purposes of the elimination of <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>blighted areas <em>through economically and socially sound redevelopment </em>of such areas, as provided by this act, in conformity with the comprehensive general plans of their respective municipalities for residential, recreational, commercial, industrial or other purposes, and otherwise encouraging the provision of healthful homes, a decent living environment and adequate places for employment of the people of this Commonwealth. Such purposes are hereby declared to be public uses for which public money may be spent, and private property may be acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain.” 1945, May 24, P. L. 991, §2; 1957, May 27, P. L. 197, §1, 35 P.S. §1702. (Emphasis supplied) There is evidence from which the chancellor could find that the Authority considered the Schwartz proposal to be at variance with sound economic and social redevelopment of the area.</p>

Further, we held that, on appeal, the question is not whether the appellate court would have reached the same conclusion on the same evidence, but whether the evidence is sufficient to support the chancellor’s conclusion.

This argument is based on the Authority having “invited, induced and encouraged” Schwartz to submit a proposal, and the subsequent submission by him of a proposal, at considerable expense, for the erection of what the Authority had led him to believe was an acceptable structure. Of course Schwartz was “invited” and “induced” to make a proposal, as were many others, by virtue of advertising conducted by the Authority in connection with land disposition. All bidders had to expend efforts and funds in the submission of proposals, accompanied by plans, drawings, etc. The cases cited by appellants are inapposite. The expenditures made by Schwartz were normal business expenses required of all bidders on the expectancy of success. Appellees correctly state that if we accepted appellants’ view, “every bidder who hired an architect and expended money to purchase property from a redevelopment authority for an allowable use, would have his bid automatically accepted without further consideration of his proposal. The Authority would be estopped from considering other factors in connection with his proposal so long as his use was allowable. . .</p>

In view of the declared legislative purpose of the Act, we cannot agree with this contention.
