On that day the account had a balance of $2,160.28. Brozenic then deposited an additional $1,010 and changed the account from his own name to a joint account in the name of himself <em>or </em>Mara Bosiljevac with right of survivorship, each tenant having the right to withdraw. Brozenic was given by the bank a signature card for the creation of such an account, which he was instructed should be signed by both himself and Mara. Brozenic immediately signed it but the <em>card </em>was never returned to the bank and was not in its files or in his files at his death. However, Mara produced a letter which had been sent by Brozenic to her and her husband dated July 31, 1957. This letter pertinently read: “. . . I am writing you few words and sending you two forms, signed your name and last name under my where it is marked M.B. and little cross, so that you know what it is, I have some money at this bank and I have it registered with me so that after my death nobody will be able to claim it except you as much as there will be left. There is quite a bit now, but this is not only for your self but all four of you in equal shares, but after my death four of you do not forget Toneta, all of you must help him from your shares, I have picked you as the mother because you are honest and smarter than others. If you <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>want, you can tell other sisters and read them this letter, even though one of them wrote my why did I choose you as most trustworthy. Keep this letter which you will need in case of my death. <em>These cards return to me because I have to put them in the bant </em>(Peoples Trust National Bank and Trust Company, Fifth Avenue, Box 506, Pittsburgh 30, Pa.). This address is not necessary for you now, just so that you know. These forms send to me and I myself will return them to the bank, . . . .”</p>

    <p id="b259-6" data-blocks='[["BL_259.6",259,[140,1323,1152,637]]]'>It is clear that Mara failed to make out a prima facie case showing a gift inter vivos to her. She did not produce a signature card or a contract signed by both co-tenants, and Brozenic’s intentions, so far as they are disclosed in his letter to Mara, would seem to be clearly tentative and ambiguous or at best for Mara testamentary. If Brozenic intended a testamentary gift, — and the evidence to prove such a gift is certainly insufficient — such a gift was revoked by the execution two years later of a will containing a clause of revocation. For the above reasons, the Court below properly dismissed Mara’s claim.</p>

It was stipulated that the bank handed Brozenic a signature card for the creation of such an account which he immediately signed; that he was instructed by the Association to obtain the signature thereon of (Barbara) the other tenant; but that no signature card was ever filed with the Association, nor was there any evidence that Barbara had ever signed the card.
