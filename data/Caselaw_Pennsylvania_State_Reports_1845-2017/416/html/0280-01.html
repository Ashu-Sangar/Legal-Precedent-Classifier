On December 10, 1960, for reasons unconnected with the said burglaries, police officers of the City of Philadelphia searched the automobile of Michael Paul Chatary, in the City of Philadelphia, County of Philadelphia, and found certain of the aforementioned stolen articles therein. As a result, Chatary was later indicted in Montgomery County on charges of burglary, larceny and receiving stolen goods.</p>
    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.5",330,[210,889,1155,422]]]'>Chatary was tried on the indictments on April 27 and August 7, 1961, in Montgomery County before a judge without a jury. He was found guilty on the indictments charging the crime of receiving stolen goods, but not guilty on the burglary and larceny indictments. He was sentenced on October 23, 1961, to a term of imprisonment in the county prison of from two and one-half to five years.</p>

Chatary testified and denied involvement in the crimes charged and offered testimony in explanation of the presence of the stolen goods in his automobile. The trial judge found the defendant’s denial “incredible” and his explanation of the possession “fantastic.” Nevertheless, he acquitted him of the burglary and larceny charges.</p>

Mull, </em><a href="/pa/316/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="316 Pa. 424" data-case-ids="1159014" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0424-01">316 Pa. 424</a>, 426, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.%20418" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="175 A. 418">175 A. 418</a>, 419 (1934). It is equally well established that unexplained possession in the defendant of property recently stolen is evidence that he is the thief. Also, if the larceny was committed in the perpetration of breaking and entering, such possession is evidence of guilt of the charge of statutory burglary. Also, if the indictment charges receiving stolen goods only, the unexplained possession is evidence of guilt of that crime. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Gomori, </em><a href="/pa-super/192/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="192 Pa. Super. 325" data-case-ids="748916" data-case-paths="/pa-super/192/0325-01">192 Pa.

However, such evidence is not conclusive and may be rebutted. It is for the trier of fact alone to say whether the guilt of the defendant is a reasonable inference, fairly deducible from his possession of recently stolen property, in light of all the circumstances, including the reasonableness of his explanation, if any, as to how he came into possession: <em>Commonwealth v. Newman, </em><a href="/pa/276/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="276 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="1077558" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0534-01">276 Pa. 534</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=120%20A.%20474" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="120 A. 474">120 A. 474</a> (1923) ; <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[210,512,1159,956]]]'>But while evidence of such possession is, in itself, sufficient to warrant a jury in finding that the defendant is guilty of the crime of receiving stolen goods,, it is not, in itself, sufficient to establish jurisdiction and venue, where, as here, the possession in the defendant was found in another county. While it is true that venue may be proved by circumstantial evidence (2 Wharton, Criminal Evidence §928 (11th ed. 1985)), the record herein fails to disclose any circumstance (other than the possession) upon which an inference of venue could be based. While the possession does give rise to an inference of guilt, it does not, in itself, and should not, under the circumstances presented, permit an inference that the goods were received in the county in which they were stolen. This would be contrary to logic and practical experience, especially in these days of rapid transportation and communication.</p>
    <p id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[207,1487,1155,744]]]'>Moreover, as above noted, the possession gives rise to a <em>rebuttable </em>inference only. When the trial court found the defendant “not guilty” of the burglaries and larcenies, this finding established conclusively that the defendant was not at the scene of these crimes, either as a ■ principal or an accessory. Since Montgomery County’s connection v/ith the crime, for which the defendant was convicted, was limited, under the evidence, to the fact that the burglaries and larcenies occurred there', the above finding by the court destroyed the only evidentiary lint connecting the defendant with the reception of the goods in that county. The trial evidence was, therefore, insufficient to establish proper venue and jurisdiction. ■</p>

It is true that the question of lack of jurisdiction of a trial court should, as a general rule, be reviewed by appellate proceedings and not by means of habeas corpus. However, the question may be raised in habeas corpus where the lack of jurisdiction is “clear and undisputable” on the face of the record, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Ritchey v. McHugh, </em><a href="/pa-super/189/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="189 Pa. Super. 515" data-case-ids="744953" data-case-paths="/pa-super/189/0515-01">189 Pa.

While there are statements in several cases to support this contention (See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v.
