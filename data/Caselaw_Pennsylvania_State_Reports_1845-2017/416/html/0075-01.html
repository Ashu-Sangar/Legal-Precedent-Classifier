Prom this it subtracted interest on United States securities of $2,094.91 and paid tax (at 6%) on the remainder. The tax, thus computed, was $3,048.37. The State settled the tax by determining net income to be $676,140.18 (the amount of taxable income reported to the Federal Government) which, after substraeting the interest on United States securities, left an income of $674,045.27 subject to tax. Tax was then computed at $40,442.72. The State’s computation was made without resort to the allocation fractions set forth in the Corporate Net Income Tax Act, Act of May 16, 1935, P. L. 208, as amended, 72 P.S. §§3420a-3420n. It simply applied the six percent tax rate to 100% of appellant’s net income as determined by the State.</p>

The total income was the $676,140.18 previously determined by. the State plus $15,665.17 added to federal taxable income by the Federal Government or $691,805.35.

This latter figure was determined by breaking down total sales into two categories — stevedoring and other activities<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> — and subtracting from each the cost of goods sold computed for each category. To these gross profit from sales figures other items of income (e.g., bond interest, rents, capital gains) were added, where appropriate, to each category; and the items of expense were then deducted from each. In determining how to allocate expenses between stevedoring income and other income, two methods were used: (1) expenses specifically identifiable with one or the other type of income were allocated to that type and (2) items not so identifiable were allocated in accordance with the direct labor ratios or cost of goods ratios previously determined. It is clear from the record that in making this breakdown of income and expense, appellant necessarily had to make arbitrary decisions, albeit reasonable in the minds of appellant’s officers and accountants, because no contention is made by appellant that it was engaged in separate businesses for which it maintained separate books and records. Its activities were purely unitary, and its categorization was made solely for Pennsylvania tax purposes.</p>

Instead, it argues that it should be entitled to allocate its income by use of the apportionment fractions provided for in the Corporate Net Income Tax Act and, in so doing, to exclude from the numerator of each fraction the tangible property values, wage expenditures and gross receipts attributable to its stevedoring activity. Further, appellant states, if the statute is interpreted in such a way as to deny it the right to make such allocations, the statute, as so applied, is unconstitutional for it would contravene both the commerce clause<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> and the export-import clause<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> of the Federal Constitution.

L. 80, imposed a tax for the privilege of doing business in Pennsylvania on every corporation exercising such privilege. The tax rate was six percent, and the measure of the tax was the corporation’s net income. Net income was defined in the Act as the taxable income returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government. The Act, §2, stated that if the entire business of the corporation is transacted within the State, the net income is 100% of the federal taxable income. However, to provide for situations where a corporation transacts business outside the State, the Act, §2, further stated that in such situation a cor<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>poration could apportion its Pennsylvania net income (i.e., federal “taxable income”) by use of allocations and apportionments^ including the abovementioned tangible property, wages and salaries and gross receipts fractions.</p>

    <p id="b129-6" data-blocks='[["BL_129.6",129,[136,883,1156,1115]]]'>While the State argues before us that appellant’s income should all be allocated to Pennsylvania by applying the allocation fractions at 100% each to such income and that the Department of Revenue followed this method in determining appellant’s tax, we believe the State has misinterpreted both the statute and what the Department did. As just pointed out, the statute does not permit resort to the fractions in a case like this one; it requires simply that tax be imposed at six percent on all of appellant’s net income (federal taxable income). Moreover, in resettling appellant’s tax, the taxing departments did not resort to the allocation fractions; they simply did what the statute requires and taxed the total income at six percent. The court below also pointed out that this was the correct procedure, and the State apparently recognizes this difference for it refers to the lower court’s method as an “alternative theory.” This, it is not; it is the only statutorily prescribed “theory” and the only one which could be applied here within the terms of the Act.</p>

Subsequently, the concept was approved that a corporation carrying on an activity separate from and unrelated to its business in Pennsylvania could exclude from its tax computation for Pennsylvania the proceeds from and factors applicable to this separate business. <em>Commonwealth v. Baker-Whiteley Coal Co., </em>60 Dauph. 434 (1950), aff’d, 62 Dauph. 207 (1951). We have recognized the availability of this procedure. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s argument is that while it is proper for a state to impose a tax on the net income of a corporation, such a tax must be properly apportioned so as fairly to impose tax only upon the corporation’s “local activities;” that stevedoring is not a “local activity” but an integral part of foreign commerce; and, therefore, that receipts from stevedoring cannot be taxed by a state since such activities are beyond the jurisdiction of the state. Alternatively, appellant argues, stevedoring is part of the exporting process; and no tax can be imposed on such activity without violating the Federal Constitution’s prohibition<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> against a state’s imposing an impost or duty on imports or exports.</p>

Rather, it is engaged in a combination of foreign, interstate and intrastate commerce. In such a situation it has long been held that a state may impose a tax or excise on the privilege of doing business within the state and require such a tax to be measured by the net income of the corporation derived from all of its activities as long as that income is fairly apportioned to the taxing state by reference to in state factors. <em>Memphis Natural Gas Co. v.

In such a situation a state necessarily is gathering tax from what appellant here would refer to as a “nonlocal activity.” The problem is that appellant confuses the concept of “local activity” with the income derived from such activity. What the Supreme Court of the United States has upheld is a tax on or measured by all net income apportioned only by reference to activities and property producing the income. Where all of these activities take place in one state and all the property is located in the same one state, as here, all of the net income, regardless of its source, is subject to tax. Appellant, agreeing that it <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>cannot exclude directly its income from foreign commerce, wants to accomplish, that result indirectly by creating allocation fractions in which exclusion from the numerators are computed by reference to the receipts from foreign commerce rather than by reference to the factors measuring the activities carried on by appellant in Pennsylvania which produce the receipts.</p>

Thus, where a corporation is transacting part of its business outside of Pennsylvania, this state permits it to apportion out of the state values and amounts based on tangible property, wages and salaries and gross receipts. On the other hand, where a corporation conducts all its activity in one state, even if that activity be a combination of foreign, interstate and intrastate commerce, there exists no basis for saying that some other apportionment, based on excluding directly the income derived from foreign and interstate commerce, must be permitted.</p>

Ct. 815</a> (1947) (partial dissent by Douglas, J.). As indicated by the dissenting opinion writer in this last case, the scope of this clause protects from taxation any step in the import-export process — such as stevedoring — and a state tax on the gross receipts from stevedoring would presumably infringe upon this protection. This is not the present case, however. Pennsylvania imposes no tax upon appellant’s gross receipts; rather, the tax is upon net income, a factor far removed from the import-export process.
