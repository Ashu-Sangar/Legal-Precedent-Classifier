Price, plaintiffs in this case, purchased for $5,000 a certain piece of land in Lehigh County for the purpose of operating a truck rental agency and a used auto part business which would necessitate storing thereon used automobiles from which parts could be removed and sold. The land, except for 40-60 feet, was located in Hanover Township. At the time of the purchase, an ordinance (hereinafter referred to as Ordinance No. 7) of the township provided for “regulating junk dealers and the establishment and mainte<a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>nance of junk yards and scrap yards, including, but not limited to, automobile junk or grave yards; providing for permits for engaging in business as a junk dealer and for operating, establishing and maintaining of junk yards.”</p>
    <p id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[219,624,1155,858]]]'>On February 4, 1963, the plaintiffs applied, under that ordinance, for a permit to conduct a so-called auto graveyard on the premises. Then on February 16, 1963, they applied for a building permit to erect on the same premises a temporary structure for conducting their truck rental agency. The building permit was immediately allowed. Then, on March 7, 1963, the township board of supervisors rejected the plaintiffs’ application, under Ordinance No. 7, for the operation of a junk yard, and, contemporaneously, revoked the building permit already granted. The reasons given by the township for these decisions was that the plaintiffs were preparing to engage in a business which would be inimical to the provisions of a new zoning ordinance which was in the process of enactment and which eventually was enacted on May 6, 1963.</p>
    <p id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.6",614,[216,1491,1156,575]]]'>The plaintiffs filed a mandamus action in the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County to compel the township to issue the applied-for permits. They also filed an action in equity seeking to have Ordinance No. 7 declared unconstitutional and its application restrained. The Court upheld the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 7, the refusal of the issuance of a permit thereunder, and the revocation of the building permit. The plaintiffs appealed in both cases, the appeals being consolidated here for argument and disposition.</p>

We also affirm the decision of the court below that the refusal of a permit under Ordinance No. 7 was not an abuse of the board’s discretion and that the plaintiffs may not, therefore, compel the issuance of a permit allowing them to maintain on their premises a junkyard.</p>
    <p id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[151,844,1150,738]]]'>We reverse, however, that portion of the court’s holding that the revocation of the building permit already granted was proper. This is not a case where a property owner is seeking to rely on the building permit to enable him to violate the terms of a zoning ordinance enacted after the issuance of the permit and prior to the property owner’s full adaptation of the property to the use for which the permit was issued. Whether or not the property owner can, in such a case, continue on with the intended use which has now become violative of the new zoning ordinance, depends on whether he has made substantial expenditures in reliance on the building permit issued to him.</p>

It thus became a proper nonconforming use. The board of supervisors could not legally revoke a permit already granted on the basis that it would violate a zoning ordinance not yet promulgated. Although the structure had been built before the act of revocation, there was some question as to whether it had been placed on the property before the revocation, but a discussion on this phase of the matter is pointless. To uphold an act of revocation under the admitted circumstances of this case would be conducive to creating chaos in building operations. Prop<a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>erty owners would be afraid to make plans consistent with building permits already granted in view of tbe possibility the permits could be revoked because of possible conflict with proposed zoning ordinances not yet enacted.</p>

The Act of March 11, 1959, P. L. 13, as amended, 53 P.S. §65758, permits Townships of the Second Class to regulate and license, inter alia, automobile junk or grave yards. However, the present ordinance, enacted thereunder, fails to provide definite standards which would uniformly govern the board of supervisors’ determinations of whether or not a permit should issue. Cf. <em>Dauphin Deposit Trust Co. v.

They provide that the permit shall issue only on consideration of the suitability of the property, the character of the neighborhood, and the economic and aesthetic effect of the use on the township. The court below, admitting the vague and indefinite character of the provisions of §6 at least by implication, looked to §10 for clarification and fortification of the necessary standards.</p>

Section 10 provides standards for existing junk yards and is in no way applicable to vacant land proposed to be used as a junk yard. Unaided by §10 in the present instance, §6 provides inadequate standards for the issuance of a junk yard permit, and the ordinance as a whole is unconstitutional as applied to the land here involved. The ordinance being unconstitutional, no permit was necessary.</p>
