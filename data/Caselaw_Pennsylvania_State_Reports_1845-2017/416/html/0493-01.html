United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>supra, that a public servant and his surety bondsman were conclusively bound as to the fact of guilt, established by the record of the individual’s prior criminal conviction for criminal misbehavior in office introduced in a civil action, involving the same facts and issues. The parallels of the present case to that case are striking. In each case, the record of conviction of the <em>defendant </em>was offered by the plaintiff, in the civil action, to bar the defendant from avoiding restitution, as opposed to the record of conviction of the plaintiff, as was the situation in <em>Mineo, </em>supra. So too, in each case the defendant was seeking to avoid <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>payment of a sum of money to the plaintiff by asserting non-liability on the basis of the facts already established to the contrary in prior criminal proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[217,514,1157,859]]]'>In <em>Mineo, </em>at page 86, the Court said, “We are of the opinion that when one is convicted of a felony and subsequently attempts to benefit from the commission, the record of his guilt should be a bar to his recovery.” We are equally of the opinion that when one has been convicted of a felony, the result of which is of financial benefit to him, the record of his guilt should bar his avoidance of restitution therefor. This was implicit in the ruling of the <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission </em>case, supra, and we now directly so hold. In <em>Mineo, </em>the basic fact in issue was whether or not the plaintiff’s assignor had started the fire; in the <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission </em>case, it was whether or not Torrance had violated the trust of his office; here, it is whether or not the defendant extorted money from Eider. The parallel is persuasive.</p>

The defendant was presented with more than ample opportunity to overcome the charges lodged against him while he was swathed in a cloak of presumed innocence. His case was twice presented to a federal jury which found him guilty of extortion beyond a reasonable doubt, upon the same facts which are now urged as the basis for his civil liability. To now hold that the effect of those jury determinations is <em>nil </em>not only would be to fly in the face of reason, but also would be a general indictment of the whole American jury system. We are not now prepared to say that the mere technical effect of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel regarding identity of parties is sufficient to overcome the policy which requires us to give conclusive effect to the prior conviction herein. <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>The defendant should not now be heard to deny that which was established by his prior criminal conviction, without proof that his conviction was procured by fraud, perjury or some manner of error now sufficient to upset the conviction itself.

No valid reason exists why he should be given a chance to try his luck with another jury.</p>

Especially in traffic violations, expediency and convenience, rather than guilt, often control the defendant’s “trial technique.” In such cases, it is not obvious that the defendant has taken advantage of his day in court, and it would be unreasonable and unrealistic to say he waived that right as to a matter (civil liability), which was probably not within contemplation at the time of the conviction.

If the conviction may not be introduced where the offense is a lessor one, why should it be introduced where the offense is grave and calls for severe penalties and, in the event of an adverse civil verdict the judgment will also be a severe one?</p>

Kuhn, </em><a href="/pa/357/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="357 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="472128" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0200-01">357 Pa. 200</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20604" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="53 A.2d 604">53 A. 2d 604</a> (1947) we held that the record of a defendant’s conviction of criminal assault and battery was <em>inadmissible </em>in an action to recover civil damages for the same assault and battery. Today the majority holds that a conviction of a defendant in a <em>federal criminal court </em>for a violation of the <em>federal anti-racketeering law, </em>including extortion, as federally defined, is <em>conclusive proof </em>of plaintiff’s right to recover from the defendant in a <em>state unjust enrichment action.</em>

United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em><a href="/pa/412/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="412 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1887187" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0222-01">412 </a><a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a><a href="/pa/412/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="412 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1887187" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0222-01">Pa. 222</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.2d%20423" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="194 A.2d 423">194 A. 2d 423</a> (1963). First, we there established, at great length, that the conduct for which the public official had been criminally convicted was precisely the same conduct which, by contract, made his bondsman civilly liable to the Commonwealth. In fact, we were of the opinion that the criminal conviction itself was tantamount to a breach of the bond. Here we are left to speculate on the correlation of the precise facts supporting the federal offense and the precise facts necessary to prove the plaintiff’s alleged civil action. Second, in <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike </em>we found that the identical questions involved in the civil case had been “exhaustively and conclusively litigated” in the criminal case and that the questions were thoroughly explored in a long and well conducted trial when “detailed evidence was adduced.” Here, the majority merely states that defendant had “more than ample opportunity to overcome the charges lodged” and then asserts that it is “incredible in such a situation that a defendant would present less than his best defense, knowing that his failure would result in loss of substantial property, or even his liberty.”</p>

This, of course, is a prerequisite to collateral estoppel. <em>Helmig v. Rockwell Manufacturing Company, </em><a href="/pa/389/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="389 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1274035" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0021-01">389 Pa. 21</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.2d%20622" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="131 A.2d 622">131 A. 2d 622</a> (1957). The Commonwealth was the plaintiff-prosecutor in the criminal case and the Turnpike Commission was the plaintiff in the civil case. We said “[t]he commission is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth.” <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission </em>case, supra, at 229. While Torrance was the defendant in the criminal case and his surety the defendant in the civil case, we held that “[t]he surety <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>is bound by the determination of the principal’s liability.” Id. at 228-9. But by no stretch of the imagination can the plaintiff in this civil case be likened unto the federal government for purposes of the identity of parties rule in the application of collateral estoppel. Therefore, the criminal conviction cannot be conclusive proof of plaintiff’s right to recover in this case.</p>
    <p id="b555-3" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[153,728,1149,862]]]'>Finally, the majority would distinguish records of conviction in “minor matters” only on the supposition that “expediency and convenience, rather than guilt, often control the defendant’s Trial technique’ ” and that “in such cases, it is not obvious that the defendant has taken advantage of his day in court, and it would be unreasonable and unrealistic to say he waived that right as to a matter (civil liability) which was probably not within contemplation at the time of the conviction.” I doubt the propriety of this conjectured distinction as much as I do the application of collateral estoppel doctrine on the conjecture that it is unbelievable that defendant will not try in a “serious” criminal case. Also, I doubt that the distinction between “major” and “minor” matters can be well drawn by courts in this area of vital importance to the litigants.</p>
