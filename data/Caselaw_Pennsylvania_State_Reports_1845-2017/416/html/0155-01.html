Bankers National Life Insurance </em>Co., supra Note 1, at 604. The complaint recites the issuance of the certificates of insurance to Layman for $10,000, — a copy being attached to the complaint — , the payment of the required premium, the date of death of Layman, that the death proofs were furnished, that the insurance was in effect at the time of Layman’s death and that, although demand was made, the insurance company has refused payment. By way of answer, the insurance company, under new matter, avers that Layman on two occasions — September 26, 1962 and August 1, 1963 — had applied for group insurance and, on those occasions, had submitted applications, copies of which were attached to the answer and new matter; that, in these applications, Layman had stated that he had not <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>had any medical or surgical advice or been confined in a hospital during the period of the past ten years; that said statements were false and such falsity was well known to Layman; that upon the representations contained in these applications the insurance company was induced to issue the certificate of insurance; that Layman knew he had been confined in a certain named hospital from January 24, 1961 to January 31, 1961, and that his condition had been diagnosed as “arteriosclerotic heart disease and congestive heart failure”. By way of reply, Leah Q. Layman averred solely that, since the applications referred to had not been attached to and made a part of the certificate of insurance referred to in the complaint, the insurance company could not defend on the basis of statements contained in the applications. In the motion for judgment on the pleadings it was averred that Layman’s applications for insurance did not constitute a part of the contract of insurance since they were not attached to the certificate when issued. Belying on the Act of May 11, 1949, P. L. 1210, as amended, 40 P.S. §532.6 and the Act of May 17, 1921, P. L. 682, 40 P.S. §441, it was averred that, since the company failed to attach a copy of Layman’s application to the insurance certificate it can not use anything contained in said application as a defense.</p>

Moreover, the 1949 statute clearly distinguishes between the “policyholder” and the “person insured”, a recognition that in group insurance the master contract or policy is between the insurance company and the employer, — the latter being the holder of the policy, — and that the employees who obtain a certificate of insurance under the terms of the statute and the master contract or policy are within the class of “persons insured”.</p>

No copy of the application was attached to the <em>certificate </em>of insurance although, under the applicable Illinois law, a copy of such application was required to be attached to the <em>policy </em>before statements in such application could be received in evidence.

Appellant’s counsel ably points out that this Court has consistently maintained under the 1881 and 1921 statutes that statements contained in applications of which copies are not attached to the insurance policy are not admissible in evidence. With that position we are in full agreement. However, those statutes deal only with ordinary life insurance and not with group insurance. In group insurance we are faced with an entirely different factual situation than that present in ordinary life insurance situations and the 1949 statute recognizes the existence of such difference. In group insurance, the primary contracting parties are the insurance company and the employer and the insured employee or his beneficiary have no greater rights than are provided in the policy between the primary contracting parties. The 1949 statute expressly requires that a copy of the application of the <em>policyholder </em>— that is, the employer — be attached to the <em>policy when issued </em>— that is, the policy issued by the insurance company to the employer — but the statute does not require, either expressly or by implication, that a copy of the application of the <em>person </em>insured— that is, the employee — be attached to the certificate issued to the person insured. The reason for the distinction drawn between ordinary and group life insurance policies as to the attachment of a copy of the application of the person insured is evident: the practical difficulties which arise from the fact that one group policy may cover thousands of insured employees in several states. We are of the opinion that under the <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>applicable statute — the 1949 statute — a copy or copies of applications made by the person insured need not be attached to the certificate issued to such person and that the contention of appellant in this respect is without merit.</p>
