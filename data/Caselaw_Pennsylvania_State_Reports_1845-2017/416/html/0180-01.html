Thereafter, Lynn Hawkins, having failed to file surety bonds in accordance with the court order, was held in contempt of court.

The basis of this action was that Mrs. Hawkins, while acting as fiduciary of the Miller Estate, improperly induced the Bank, guardian of appellants’ <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>interests, to sell appellants’ interest in Tip Top to her for $20,000, an unfair, inadequate and improvident consideration; that, by fraud, misrepresentation and concealment of essential facts, the Bank was induced to request the court to approve the sale; that the court was misled, by misrepresentation, fraud and concealment, to approve the sale; that, by reason thereof, the sale should be set aside and appellants restored to their rights.</p>

Shortly after decedent’s death, Mrs. Hawkins approached Autumn Miller, appellants’ mother, (whom Mrs. Hawkins and her counsel mistakenly believed had a 1/3 of appellants’ 15% interest), and, in an effort to purchase her interest, told her that Lillie Oliver — owner under the Miller will of a 15% interest — had agreed to sell her interest for $20,000. It is uncontradicted that Lillie Oliver had never agreed to <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>sell her interest. The same misrepresentation was made by Mrs. Hawkins by letter to the Bank. Sometime thereafter, Mrs. Hawkins’ counsel misrepresented by letter to the guardian Bank that Lillie Oliver had given an option for the purchase of her interest. While it is true that Frank Miller — holder of another 15% interest — had sold Mrs. Hawkins his interest for $20,-000, the misrepresentations to the guardian Bank and appellants’ mother as to Lillie Oliver were untrue and obviously made to induce them to believe in the adequacy of the price of $20,000 and the suitability of a sale. Moreover, as a possible “club” to induce the sale, Mrs. Hawkins’ counsel represented to the guardian that the Miller estate held a $1100 mortgage against its wards’ mother’s property although Mrs. Hawkins well knew such mortgage, at decedent’s suggestion, had been placed on the property simply to enable appellants’ mother to secure mother’s assistance from the Commonwealth and was not a valid mortgage.</p>

Even the advertisement of the proposed sale was misleading in that: (1) it failed to state, contrary to the court’s preliminary order, that outsiders could bid on the property; (2) it stated that the interests to be sold were in 138.38 acres whereas, as the subsequent deed indicated, the proper acreage was 161.36 acres; (3) it stated 70 acres were unproductive whereas such acres were most productive. Twenty-three years after it had approved the sale, the court said: “he was not apprised nor aware of pertinent facts omitted in the petition relating to the true extent and nature of this property, the improvements and appurtenances thereto, the personal property located thereon,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> and the fact that the buyer [Mrs. Hawkins] had initiated the proceedings.”</p>

With that conclusion we must disagree.
