    <p id="b353-9" data-blocks='[["BL_353.12",353,[156,1366,1149,791]]]'>Bizik was the operator of one of three vehicles involved in an automobile accident on December <em>24, </em>1954. Two separate suits were instituted as a result of this accident. One was brought by Mr. and Mrs. Julius Japort, plaintiffs, against Bizik and Robert P. Murray in the Court of Common Pleas No. 3 of Philadelphia County [C.P. No. 3]. The other suit— the subject of this present appeal — was filed by plaintiffs, Hernandez, Pajon, and Whitford in the Court of Common Pleas No. 5 of Philadelphia County [C.P. No. 5] against Japort, Bizik, and Murray. Service of process was made in the C.P. No. 3 case (including service on Bizik) but the sheriff’s return of service as to Bizik was marked “not found” in the C.P. No. 5 case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>On June 28, 1955, Thomas R. White, Jr., Esq., entered his appearance on behalf of Bizik in the C.P. No. 3 case; in January 1957 his appearance was withdrawn. On or about January 11, 1957, appellant Steinberg entered an appearance in both actions. He made no attempt to withdraw his appearance in either suit until October 1957,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> when he alleged that his appearance was inadvertent in O.P. No. 5 and asked permission to withdraw from that case. A subsequent decree allowing withdrawal was vacated, and an appeal respecting such vacation was discontinued. After his original petition to withdraw was finally dismissed in 1963, he filed a new petition in February 1964, in which he incorporated by reference a deposition of defendant Bizik taken several months before.</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[214,1164,1154,475]]]'>Appellant’s principal arguments are that (1) since Bizik was not served with a copy of the complaint, Steinberg’s entry of appearance was inadvertent and erroneous, and (2) that defendant Bizik does not desire his representation. The trial court held that appellant showed no adequate legal basis to support the petition of withdrawal. The court also found that Bizik’s request for Steinberg’s withdrawal was not stated unambiguously in the deposition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

However, if we have misinterpreted the present petition, appellant Steinberg is not prevented from filing a new petition in the court below. Appellees have noted that a petition merely seeking termination of his representation would not be opposed by them. The granting of a petition of that nature does not operate to withdraw the appearance of the party defendant. <em>Wilson v.
