At approximately ten o’clock p.m., on March 10, 1962, plaintiff, who was sober at that time, and his wife went to a ballroom on the sixth floor of defendant’s hotel to attend a dance sponsored by the Optomist Club of Beaver Falls. The club provided the band. The defendant provided the space, bartenders, and waitresses and sold alcoholic beverages by the bottle and the drink directly to the persons attending the dance. The club paid a fee to the hotel, the amount decreasing in inverse proportion to the amount of liquor sold. By and large, bottles were sold to groups at tables, where “set-ups” were provided, and individual drinks were sold at a bar adjoining the ballroom. Between ten o’clock p.m. and two o’clock a.m. four or five “fifths” of liquor were sold to the group of twelve people at plaintiff’s table. Plaintiff spent very little time at his table after midnight. By two o’clock a.m. plaintiff had become exceedingly inebriated. At about that time plaintiff, who was causing a commotion in the men’s bathroom, was confined there for the purpose of keeping him out of trouble while the patrons were <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>leaving, the dance being over. But plaintiff crawled through a window in the bathroom that led out onto 'a roof adjoining the sixth floor of defendant. Plaintiff proceeded quite a few feet along a cyclone fence which enclosed the roof until he came to an opening in the fence. He went through the opening, out onto a ledge and, from there, fell or jumped some forty-five feet onto the roof of defendant’s kitchen below and was injured.</p>

However, there was clear and direct evidence, although it was contradicted, that plaintiff was served one drink at the bar at about 12:30 a.m., and there was a great deal of uncontradicted evidence that <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>plaintiff was visibly intoxicated at that time.

But <em>Zilka </em>did not involve a question of proximate cause. There it was held that defendant had <em>no duty </em>to plaintiff because it was not foreseeable that defendant’s conduct would cause injury to plaintiff. Here the duty to plaintiff is clear. Indeed, it is the high probability that intoxicated persons will be injured that, in part, gave rise to the statute prohibiting defendant from serving the plaintiff when visibly intoxicated.</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[240,1048,1157,1346]]]'>Third, defendant argues that its conduct was not the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury because the events intervening between the violation of the statute and the accident prevents the violation from being a legal cause. Defendant does not denote any specific event subsequent to the violation as being a superseding cause relieving defendant of liability. Bather, defendant appears to be restating its argument that the accident was too “freakish” to hold defendant liable. We have held, following Section 435 of the Be-statement of Torts, that “[i]f the actor’s conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another, the fact that the actor neither foresaw nor should have foreseen the <em>extent </em>of the harm or the <em>manner </em>in which it occurred does not prevent him from being liable.” (Emphasis supplied). <em>Shipley v.

      <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>The most problematical assertion made by defendant is that its negligence, i.e., serving plaintiff while visibly intoxicated, was not a legal cause of the injury because it was not a substantial cause of the injury. Defendant argues that since plaintiff was already “drunk” when illegally served the illegal serving of one or two drinks could not have sufficiently contributed to the happening of the injury to make defendant liable. In its opinion, the lower court disposed of this argument on the basis of <em>Schelin v. Goldberg, </em>supra. The <em>Schelin </em>court appeared to hold that where the plaintiff was served by defendant while visibly intoxicated and subsequently was injured <em>as a result of intoxication </em>proximate cause was established.

This would be clearly contrary to the basis of civil liability, namely, that there be fault on the part of defendant and that the fault contribute to the plaintiff’s injury. But the proposition in <em>Schelin </em>should not and need not be so interpreted. The court there was concerned with the difficulty that a plaintiff would have in proving which drink or drinks consumed by plaintiff in a number of bars contributed to the injury. Similarly, in this case, there is the problem of showing that the illegally served drinks (when plaintiff was visibly intoxicated) contributed to his injury, when, in fact, plaintiff was already “drunk” when the illegal serving took place. The <em>Schelin </em>court was aware that to place such a burden on the plaintiff would practically defeat his cause of action. But to meet this problem we need not go as far as the lower court’s opinion did in its interpretation of the <em>Schelin </em>case. When plaintiff has proved that defendant served him while visibly intoxicated, in violation of the statute, and that the injury resulted from intoxication then an inference <em>mag be </em>drawn that the illegal serving was a substantial cause of the injury. But this does not foreclose defendant from proving that the plaintiff was so intoxicated when defendant illegally served him that the accident would have occurred even if defendant had not ille<a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>gaily served him.

Defendant did request a specific charge on the substantial cause issue which was refused. But it was properly refused because, in effect, it would have <em>directed the jury </em>to find that defendant’s violation <em>was not a substantial cause </em>if the jury merely found that plaintiff was already very intoxicated when illegally served. While the jury might have been warranted in finding that plaintiff was already so inebriated when illegally served that the injury would have occurred independently of the illegal serving, the evidence in this case would not have warranted withdrawing this issue from the jury. Moreover, notwithstanding the lower court’s view of the <em>Schelín </em>case, the judge, in fact, charged the jury that in order to find defendant liable it must find that its conduct was a proximate cause of the injury and proximate cause was adequately defined. Even though the evidence in this case might have warranted a charge on proximate cause which specifically included the defensive theory discussed above, the failure to specifically charge the jury on such a theory does not warrant a new trial in view of the fact that defendant neither tried its case on this theory nor re<a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>quested a charge on it that would have been correct and that the trial court did adequately charge on the general requirement of finding proximate cause.</p>
