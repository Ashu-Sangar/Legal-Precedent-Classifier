    <p id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[165,674,1148,1182]]]'>The thrust of Blue Cross’ contention is that, since the City in its appeal from the Board’s action questions the <em>constitutionality </em>of the Nonprofit Hospital Plan Act, the statutory method of appeal<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> is not available and the court below, therefore, lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action. Such a position is completely untenable both in the posture of this litigation and in view of our case law. An examination of the attack by the City on the tax exemption granted Blue Cross by the Board reveals that the City not only challenges the constitutionality of the statute under which the tax exemption is sought but also the availability of Blue Cross to bring itself within the terms of the statute. The City, inter alia, claims that, (a) Blue Cross is not a “charitable and benevolent” institution within §8 of the statute and (b) even if Blue Cross is such an “institution”, only its “funds and investments” as distinguished from the instant realty are exempt from taxation. Clearly, this latter claim is one which can be determined by the method of appeal provided in the statute and for such determination the statutory remedy is adequate.</p>

While a court of equity has jurisdiction to restrain the collection of taxes in the event there is <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>a challenge to the constitutionality of a taxing statute or official action under such statute <em>(Y.M.C.A. v. Reading, </em><a href="/pa/402/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="402 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1296717" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0592-01">402 Pa. 592</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20469" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="167 A.2d 469">167 A. 2d 469</a>; <em>Philadelphia Life Insurance Company v.

Commonwealth, </em>supra), or where there are challenges other than to the constitutionality of the tax statute, the statutory remedy may and, sometimes, must be resorted to. In the case at bar, where the applicability of the tax exemption to Blue Cross is challenged, there is no reason why the statutory remedy cannot be pursued. That a court of equity might have jurisdiction to pass on the constitutionality of the statute does not deprive the City of its right to resort to the statutory remedy which is adequate nor is the court below deprived of jurisdiction in this class of cases because, inter alia, the validity of the taxing statute may be challenged.

One who seeks an exemption from taxation has the burden of so proving his right, under the statute, to such exemption: <em>Woods Schools Tax Exemption Case, </em><a href="/pa/406/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="406 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="1304870" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0579-01">406 Pa. 579</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.2d%20600" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="178 A.2d 600">178 A. 2d 600</a>; <em>University of Pittsburgh Tax Exemption Case, </em><a href="/pa/407/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="407 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="1307368" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0416-01">407 Pa. 416</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20760" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="180 A.2d 760">180 A. 2d 760</a>. Blue Cross is not an exception to that rule. The Nonprofit Hospital Plan Act does not relieve Blue Cross of the burden of proving that it is a “charitable and benevolent” institution within the tax exemption provisions of the statute or that the instant realty is <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>within the term “funds and investments” exempt under the statute.</p>
