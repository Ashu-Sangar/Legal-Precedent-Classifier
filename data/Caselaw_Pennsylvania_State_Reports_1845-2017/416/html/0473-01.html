Seeking damages for the minor plaintiffs’ injuries, the minor plaintiffs’ parents — Rita Hollinger’s brother and sister-in-law — instituted a trespass action against Rita Hollinger in Philadelphia County on the last day prior to the running of the statute of limitations. On behalf of Rita Hollinger, preliminary objections were filed which challenged the validity of the service purported to have been made on Rita Hollinger in Philadelphia County.

However, both logic and common sense restrict the conclusive nature of a sheriff’s return <em>only to facts stated in the return of which the sheriff presumptively has personal knowledge, </em>such as <em>when </em>and <em>where </em>the Avrit was served; when, in his official return, the sheriff states that he served a writ at a certain time and at a certain place, such facts are known to the sheriff personally and should be given conclusive effect. However, the immutability of a return should not extend (a) <em>to facts stated in the return of which the sheriff cannot be expected to have personal knowledge and which are based upon information obtained through hearsay or statements made by third persons or (b) to conclusions based upon facts known to the sheriff only through statements made by others. </em>When a sheriff’s return states that a certain place is the <em>residence </em>or <em>dwelling house </em>of the defendant, such statement is not of a matter ordinarily within the personal knowledge of the sheriff but only a statement based <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>upon that which he has been <em>told </em>by other persons, i.e., he had been instructed by a third person to make service at a certain place which he is <em>told </em>is the residence or dwelling house of the defendant. No sound reason exists for giving a conclusive effect to a statement in the sheriff’s return as to a fact or conclusion which arises not from the sheriff’s own personal knowledge or observation but from information given him by other persons. In the case at bar, no attack is permissible upon the statements in the sheriff’s return that he served this writ at a certain specified time at 5537 North Palethorpe Street, Philadelphia, but the rule does not preclude an attack upon the statement in the return that 5537 North Palethorpe Street, Philadelphia, was the <em>dwelling house </em>or <em>residence </em>of Rita Hollinger.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>Two contentions are made by appellees which, by reason of their amazing nature, require answer. In the first place, appellees suggest that the real party in interest is not Bita Hollinger but her insurance carrier and, therefore, urge that it is unimportant whether Bita Hollinger did or did not reside at the Philadelphia address. That suggestion is based upon matters <em>outside the record, </em>a resort to which is not countenanced by this Court. But, even if such was a matter of record, the conclusiveness of a sheriff’s return should not be made dependent upon the capacity of the person attacking the return. In the second place, the suggestion is made that it is of no consequence whether this suit is instituted in Montgomery or Philadelphia County. Such suggestion directly contravenes Buies of Civil Procedure promulgated by this Court. An action against an individual may be brought <em>only </em>in the county in which he or she may be served: Pa. B. C. P. 1006.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Rita Hollinger was not <em>personally </em>served and, in the absence of such personal service, she could be served only, under Buie 1009(b) (2) (i), by handing a true copy of the writ to an adult member of the family, with whom she resided, <em>at her residence. </em>Therefore, unless the address in Philadelphia County was the bona fide residence or dwelling house of Bita Hollinger, under our Buies suit could not be instituted in Philadelphia County. The <em>real reason </em>for the institution of this action in Philadelphia, rather than Montgomery County is certainly not obscure.</p>

It is unrealistic and ridiculous to continue to hold that, in the absence of fraud, a sheriff’s return <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>is <em>conclusive </em>as between the parties. The majority concedes that the effect and result of this rule will often produce injustice and create a very large liability on the part of a defendant who in actuality was never served, but was falsely or erroneously reported to have been served with the challenged paper. It is also a matter of common knowledge that a suit against a sheriff for damages resulting from a false return would often fail to provide an adequate remedy. In attempting to remedy this situation which is fraught with possible hardship and gross injustice, we are confronted, inter alia, with two lines of cases which present an irreconcilable conflict. See: <em>Vaughn v. Love, </em><a href="/pa/324/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="324 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1171340" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0276-01">324 Pa. 276</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20299" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="188 A. 299">188 A. 299</a>, infra.</p>
