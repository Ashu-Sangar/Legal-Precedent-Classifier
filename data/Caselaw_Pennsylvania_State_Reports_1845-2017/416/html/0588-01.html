Under this section of the Act <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>Bobick would have been entitled to the vacant police position even if his name had not stood highest on the eligible list. How much more so is he entitled to the policeman’s badge when, after receiving the additional 10 points also provided by law, his name did stand highest on the eligible list.</p>
    <p id="b650-4" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[209,667,1157,854]]]'>The record clearly reveals the following: There is a duly constituted police force in Sayre; the Council of Sayre certified a vacancy on that police force and requested the civil service commission to certify qualified applicants; the commission did certify the names of applicants who had successfully passed the examination; the police committee of the borough unanimously recommended the appointment of Bobick who had passed the civil service examination; the council met to make an appointment to the vacancy caused by the resignation of Fedorka; the Veterans’ Preference Act, supra, mandatorily requires that once an appointing power decides to make an appointment, and the council here did decide to make an appointment, the appointment must go to the person who qualifies as a military veteran.</p>
    <p id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.6",650,[205,1533,1155,311]]]'>With this undisputed situation, there was nothing left in law for the court below to do but to grant the writ. The reward which the Legislature of this Commonwealth has prescribed for those who serve their country in the military, has too long been denied the plaintiff in these proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b650-6" data-blocks='[["BL_650.7",650,[203,1856,1154,312]]]'>The judgment of the court below, therefore, should be reversed, and the record remanded with directions that a writ of mandamus issue to the appropriate authorities of Sayre so that the plaintiff, Andrew Bobick, may assume the duties of the office of borough patrolman which the law already states is his.</p>
