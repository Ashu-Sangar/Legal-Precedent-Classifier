    "head_matter": "ESTATE OF JACOB L. MOYER, DECEASED.\nAPPEAL BY JOHN MOYER FROM THE ORPHANS* COURT OF BERKS COUNTY.\nSubmitted March 5, 1891\nDecided March 23, 1891.\nAn adjudication upon the account of an executor and trustee, ordering the investment of a definite sum for the benefit of a legatee, is conclusive, on the adjudication of a second account, against the claim of the legatee for interest on the sum from the death of the testator.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Clark, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 336\nJanuary Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, number and term not shown.\nOn April 11, 1890, the Pennsylvania Trust Co., administrator d. b. n., c. t. a., of the estate of Jacob L. Moyer, deceased, filed an account showing a balance for distribution of $1,999,29, proceeds of the sale of certain real estate.\nAt the adjudication- of said account, on September 8, 1890, John Moyer appeared and claimed to have distributed to him arrears of interest on his distributive share, under the will of Jacob L. Moyer, deceased, from February 2, 1882, the date of the testator\u2019s death, to February 1, 1887, the date when a decree was made directing \"the executor to invest $3,000 for the benefit of the petitioner.\nAfter hearing, the court, Schwartz, P. J., filed an adjudication in part as follows:\nUpon the adjudication of the first accounts on this estate, filed by Adam H. Schwartz, executor and trustee, the court put an interpretation upon the will. The executor and trustee appealed from the findings and construction placed upon the will. The court was affirmed. It then found, among other things, that the testator intended to treat his five children alike, in so far as his $5,000 legacies to them were concerned. It also found that said legacies were all conditioned. It further found that the accountant did not have sufficient funds in hand to meet the payment of said legacies in full, and that if the unsold property available to the appropriation to said legacies be added to the funds in hand for that purpose, they might amount to $3,250 to each of said legatees, and directed $3,000 to said Adam H. Schwartz, to invest for the use of said John Moyer. It also distributed a like sum to Ella Lewis.\nCounsel for John Moyer now contends that the court erred in the then distribution, in that it should have allowed him interest for three years on said sum. At the former adjudication, none of his numerous counsel thought of raising this point, nor did they or either of them object to the distribution of the court, or take an appeal thereform. If the court, as is alleged, erred upon this point, it cannot now correct the error.\nThe court takes the liberty to state that the claimant had every other week different counsel, and that the poor fellow had no object in view except to obtain a few hundred dollars to squander to his injury; and that it took his interest under the will into consideration, and gave him what his sorrowing father wanted him to have. It acted for him and for the interest of his family. It is not in my power to alter the report under said proceedings and findings then had. They were recognized to be correct by his then counsel, and are now SO' held. The claim must be dismissed.\n\u2014Exceptions to the adjudication, filed by the claimant, were dismissed on November 25, 1890, and the adjudication confirmed. Thereupon, the exceptant took this appeal, specifying the refusal of his claim for arrearages of interest for error.\nMr. D. J7. Sehroeder, for the appellant.\nThere was no appearance for appellees.\nSee Moyer\u2019s Est., 119 Pa. 337, wherein an adjudication of the accounts of Adam H. Schwartz, executor and trustee, was reviewed."
