But neither the plaintiff nor his appointee made a tender of the money, and for anything that appears, neither of them had the money to pay for the property.

    "head_matter": "JOS. KELLOW v. DINAH JORY ET AL.\nAPPEAL BY PLAINTIEE EROM THE COURT OE COMMON PLEAS OE NORTHAMPTON COUNTY.\nArgued March 10, 1891\nDecided March 23, 1891.\n(a) In consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s undertaking to use his best efforts to sell their land for a certain price, the defendants bound themselves to convey to the plaintiff, his heirs or assigns, or to his appointee, \u201c whenever called upon so to do; \u201d the defendants to remain in possession in the meantime.\n(b) Four years afterwards, the plaintiff demanded a conveyance to his appointee, but without tendering the purchase money. In the meantime, the defendants had an offer for the property embraced in the agreement, at a largely increased price; and refused to convey to the plaintiff\u2019s appointee:\n1. Though the agreement was something more than an authority to the plaintiff to sell the land, being an option for the purchase of it, yet he was not entitled to recover damages for the defendant\u2019s refusal to convey, without proof of tender or of his appointee\u2019s ability and readiness to perform.\n2. When one has an option for the purchase of property and has delayed the exercise of it for several years, and in the meantime it has greatly increased in value, if he claim a conveyance he should at least show a tender of the purchase money, or that his appointee has the means to pay it.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 167\nJanuary Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 46 June Term 1884, C. P.\nOn May 16,1884, Joseph Kellow brought case against Henry Jory, John L. Jory, and Robert Kellow. Subsequently, the deaths of Henry Jory and John L. Jory, defendants, were suggested, and their respective administrators, Dinah Jory and John L. Jory, Jr., were substituted. The defendants pleaded, n on-assumpsit, payment, payment with leave, etc.\nAt the trial on April 21, 1890, it was shown that, in 1880, Henry Jory, John L. Jory and Robert Kellow were the owners of a valuable slate quarry near Pen Argyl; that on April 14, 1880, they executed an agreement in writing under seal, which, after reciting that they desired to sell their tract of land containing about sixty acres, with the slate quarry thereon, the quarry plant and appliances, provided as follows :\n\u201c In consideration whereof, the said Joseph Kellow will undertake to use his best efforts to sell the property, hereinbefore, referred to, for the sum of fifty thousand dollars, the price hereby stipulated and agreed to be paid.\n\u201c In consideration of the said agreement, and upon the condition of the same being eventually carried into effect, the said parties of the first part do bind themselves, their heirs and assigns, to make out a clear title to the said lands, etc., and to assign, transfer, and give possession of the same unto the said Joseph Kellow, his heirs or assigns, or to his nominee, whenever called upon so to do.....\u201d\n\u201c It is finally hereby agreed that the owners shall remain in possession, and that they shall continue to carry on the quarries and farm the land, until such time as the said Joseph Kellow, his heirs or assigns, shall be prepared to carry into effect the provisions of this indenture.\u201d\nThe ellipsis in the foregoing contract embraced provisions for the payment of the purchase money.\nIt was made to appear, further, that in the latter part of 1883 or 1884, one Creary, after an inspection of the property, decided to become the plaintiff\u2019s appointee under the contract, and to pay the plaintiff therefor $80,000. Accordingly, the plaintiff went with Creary to Henry Jory, one of the defendants, and demanded a conveyance under the terms of the contract. Mr. Jory replied, that the defendants refused to convey. At the time of this refusal, the defendants had entered into a contract to sell the property to one Miller for $80,000, and a short time afterward executed a conveyance to Miller for that amount as a consideration. This suit was then brought to recover damages for the defendants\u2019 breach of their contract with the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff having rested, the defendants, without offering any testimony, requested the court to instruct the jury that under all the evidence in the case the verdict should be for the defendants. The court thereupon directed a verdict for the defendants, as requested, with leave to the plaintiff to enter a motion for a new trial. Verdict for the defendants accordingly.\nA rule for a new trial having been argued, the court, Schuyler, P. J., on June 23, 1890, filed the following opinion:\nBy written articles, the plaintiff agreed with the defendants \u201c to use his best efforts to sell \u201d certain real estate belonging to the latter, for $60,000. \u201c In consideration of the said agreement, and upon the same being eventually carried into effect,\u201d the defendants obligated themselves to convey said real estate either to the plaintiff or his nominee. The plaintiff, having found a purchaser, in the person of one D. B. Creary, demanded a conveyance to Mr. Creary, which was refused. The price agreed to be paid by Mr. Creary was far in excess of the $60,000. Upon the refusal of the defendants to convey, the present suit was instituted to recover, not compensation for the plaintiff\u2019s services in affecting the sale, but damages for the loss of \u201c the gains and profits which the plaintiff might and would otherwise have made and acquired, if the said defendants had performed their contract, amounting to $30,000.\u201d A verdict was directed for the defendants.\nThe plaintiff has declared on a contract for the sale of land; and having done so, he must exhibit such a contract, or fail in his action, in accordance with the familiar rule that the allegata and probata must agree. Does the contract in suit come up to this requirement? We think not. True, the defendants agree to sell, but such an agreement without a corresponding agreement, either express or implied, to buy, would be void for want of mutuality. There is no express agreement to buy, and we are not permitted to imply one, because the plaintiff expressly agrees to do something else; that is, \u201c to use his best efforts to sell.\u201d\nExpressum facit cessare taciturn. \u201c Where parties have entered into written engagements with express stipulations, it is manifestly not desirable to extend them by implication; the presumption is, that having expressed some, they have expressed all the conditions by which they intend to be bound: \u201d Broom\u2019s Leg. Max., 653. Perhaps the idea of treating the agreement in question as a contract of sale, would never have suggested itself but for the clause obligating the defendants to convey the real estate to the plaintiff if desired. But that clause is entirely consistent with the theory which we consider the true one, that the only effect of the agreement was to constitute the plaintiff the defendant\u2019s agent; for a purchaser, when found, might not care to appear as such, or ho might prefer to take title through the plaintiff to obtain the benefit of his covenants.\nIf we are right in our conclusions, then the plaintiff, having declared on a contract which has no existence, ought not to be heard to complain that the verdict has gone against him. It is unnecessary to inquire how the ease would have stood if this had been a suit to recover commissions as agent, for that would be introducing, not only an entirely new, but an inconsistent cause of action which cannot be considered here.\nRule discharged.\n\u2014Judgment on the verdict having been entered, the plaintiff took this appeal, specifying, inter alia, that the court erred in directing a verdict for the defendants.\nMr Edward J. Fox and Mr. W. S. Kirkpatrick (with them Mr. J. O. Merrill), for the appellant.\nThat the contract was an option, with no want of mutuality, counsel cited: Boston etc. R. Co. v.
