Shreve, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20Pa.%20138" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="86 Pa. 138">86 Pa. 138</a>, such compensation is often ordered “ to the counsel of a losing party who is decreed to have no interest, on the equitable ground that, being a necessary party, he was compelled to litigate, or had sufficient reason. It is a charge which the fund ought in equity and good conscience to bear.” See also Daniell’s Ch. Pr., 1415; Hicks v. Wrench, 6 Mad. 93; Collins v.

The investigation was pre-eminently proper, and all parties, accountants as well as beneficiaries, will be benefited by it. Some of the exceptions relate to the preservation of the principal of the estate; and, by reason of the litigation, information has been obtained and put upon the record which might otherwise have been lost or at least made very difficult to secure. In view of the length of time that the trust may continue, this is a matter of great importance.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[256,487,1178,1323]]]'>The subject of the exceptions has been so carefully considered by the auditing judge, that it is unnecessary to add anything to what is so well said by him. We think the equitable principle which governs the conclusion reached by him cannot well be disputed, and its application in the present instance seems to us to be entirely proper. There is no danger of its being considered a precedent attended with prejudice to parties interested in estates, for that is always a subject -within the control of the court. The parties now complaining are not and cannot be prejudiced by the conclusion reached, for the reason that the account, as prepared under the direction of the auditing judge, furnishes them with that information of the condition and assets of the estate to which they are entitled and which they would not otherwise have been able to gather from the account as originally filed. It is now a matter of record as well for their present as future guidance. It has been obtained through the efforts of one of the parties interested, the exceptant. The correctness of the account and the benefit they have thus realized through her action, and the skill and services rendered by her counsel being a matter of mutual advantage and interest, in equity should be compensated for by them in proportion to their respective interests. If this did not appear, there would be no occasion to charge the general fund with the allowance made by the auditing judge. For the reasons mentioned, we think the exceptions should be dismissed and adjudication confirmed.</p>

In a reply to this letter, the exceptant was referred to the actuary of the estate. She wrote to the actuary on June 8th, stating very specifically the subject upon which she desired information. The actuary replied, on June 10th, as follows: “ I do not consider that I have any authority to furnish you with the list for which you ask, and hence I am obliged to decline to do so.” Other correspondence followed before the account was filed.</p>

It involves merely a fee of fifty dollars to the counsel for the exceptant, and a charge of §15.25 for a copy of the account. Both were allowed by the court below, and under the peculiar circumstances of the case we have concluded to affirm the decree. The court held that the investigation was proper, if not necessary, and that it was for the benefit of all the beneficiaries, and not of the appellee alone. The request for information contained in the letter of the appellee to one of the trustees, dated June 8,1889, was proper in substance and courteous in form. The trustee referred her to the actuary of the estate. A proper letter, addressed to him for the information, was met with a flat refusal. This proceeding naturally followed, and, for anything that appears upon the record, was the only means by which the information could have been obtained as to the condition of the estate.</p>

At the same time it must not be drawn into a precedent for the broad doctrine that, where exceptions are filed to the account of an executor, administrator, or trustee, in the Orphans’ Court, the exceptant is entitled to an allowance for counsel fees out of the fund. The rule in such cases is that the exceptant must pay his own counsel. That it was not regarded as a precedent by the court below, appears by the following well-considered language of the learned judge who delivered the opinion:</p>
