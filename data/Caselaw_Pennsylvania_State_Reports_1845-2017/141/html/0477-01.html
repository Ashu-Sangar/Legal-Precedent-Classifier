The defendants adduced testimony that the contract of employment was by the month, and could be terminated at the end of any month by either party. It was shown that about April 15, 1887, the plaintiff was notified by the defendants that after May 1,1887, he would not be required to do hauling for them, as their nephew was going into the business. On May 1st, the plaintiff ceased hauling for the defendants, was paid for the time he had served, and thereafter had six teams at all times during the year, and could have done all the defendants’ hauling</p>
