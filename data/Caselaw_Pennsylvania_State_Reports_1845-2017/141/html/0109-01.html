Guldin, who was a partner of Simon P. Guldin, whose death occurred March 28, 1873. It may be that the evidence that has been given before you in this case is to be regarded as establishing the fact that John P. Guldin became possessed of certain assets belonging to that partnership.. It may be, also, that a surviving partner ought not to be sued, cannot be sued within one year after the death of his co-partner for a settlement of any partnership affairs. Still, I say to you that the failure of the plaintiff to bring this suit until after more' than seven years from the date of Simon P. Guldin’s death, deprives her of the right to recovery in this case. [It may be a hardship that the plaintiff in this case must lose what might have been recovered if she had brought this action sooner, but I will read to you what the Supreme Court says about matters of that kind, in a case which I have before me: “ And in reason and justice, why should not the statute close upon partners, who, for six years after dissolution, take no steps to ascertain the balance between them ? On what principle should such an account remain open for all time ? As soon as dissolution takes place, they stand no longer in any relation of trust or confidence to each other: the implied authority given by each to the other ceases, and they are no longer agents one for the <em>other; </em>and the objects of their association having come to an end, the time for a settlement has arrived. Six years is a fair time to allow for closing their affairs, and is a reasonable time for demanding a settlement as in an analogous case: ” McKelvy’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=72%20Pa.%20413" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="72 Pa. 413">72 Pa. 413</a>. I therefore take upon myself the responsibility of instructing you to render a verdict for the defendants. I have less hesitation in doing so, since, if this is an error on my part, that error may be corrected by a further application <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>to this court; and since the evidence, which has been produced before you in this case, is of such a character that whatever verdict you will arrive at, or could arrive at, would be practically a mere guess. A party ought to be protected, of course, in the assertion of any right which he has, but he is bound to assert that right within the time allowed by the law; and he is also bound to establish it by evidence which makes out his right with a reasonable degree of certainty. If a party has allowed so long a time to elapse that it is impossible formina to produce evidence which will establish his right with such reasonable certainty, he is not entitled to much pity if he is told he cannot recover. You will, therefore, render a verdict for the defendants.] 1</p>
