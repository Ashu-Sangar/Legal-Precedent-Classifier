Hincken, leased said premises from the plaintiff for the term of five years from the date <em>thereof; </em>and that for the true and faithful performance of the contracts, covenants and agreements on the part of the said lessee, therein contained, the defendant became surety.

Gf. Murphy, agent for the plaintiff, that the estate to be granted to the said lessee by means of the lease then about to be executed was a term of five years, and, at the time deponent signed the said agreement of suretyship, the said lease was drawn, as it now reads, declaring the estate to be such a term; that deponent signed the agreement of suretyship upon the faith of his understanding and expectation that the term about to be created was a term of five years, and from no other motive and for no other consideration; that the lease, as appears by an inspection of it, was never signed by the lessor or by any person on her behalf, wherefore the estate thereby created was not a term of five years, but only a tenancy at will; and that deponent was not informed at any time or by any person that the said lease was not to be signed by or on behalf of the lessor. The deponent is advised and therefore suggests to the court, that he is not liable in this action, because (1) the contract between the lessor and lessee is different from that which the lessor’s agent led the deponent to believe it would be, at the time the deponent agreed to become surety; and (2) the deponent having entered into his alleged contract of suretyship solely in consideration of a term of five years to be granted to the lessee, which has not been done, the consideration for the alleged contract of suretyship has failed.”</p>

So long as he remains in possession the surety is liable.
