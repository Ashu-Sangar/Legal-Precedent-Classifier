      <em>(a) </em>If the commissioners and auditors have not the power to fix two different rates of compensation. In support of this position or contention, we are referred to § 41, act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 544, which reads: “ Each county treasurer shall receive in full compensation for his services on behalf of the county, a certain amount per cent on all moneys received and paid by him, which rate shall be settled from time to time by the county commissioners, with the approbation of the county auditors.” The contention is, that the rate per cent must be uniform on all moneys received and paid out; that the words “a certain amount per cent on all moneys,” mean that the rate shall be one and the same on all moneys, without regard to the source from which they are derived. We do not so understand the statute. If this be so, then if an emergency should arise in which the county would be under the necessity of making a temporary loan of thousands of dollars, the receiving and paying out of which would be of much less trouble and labor to the treasurer than in receiving and paying out the ordinary revenues, and upon the estimated annual amount of which the compensation, by a per centum, is usually fixed, the rate of compensation vrould be the same. We understand the act to mean that the compensation shall be certain; that is, fixed, on all moneys; but, in fixing it, the commissioners may make one uniform rate, or different rates, as in their judgment is fair and reasonable, in view of the trouble and labor imposed <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>upon the treasurer in receiving the money, as it may be in large or small amounts, or for extraordinary work which necessitates a large increase, by loan, of the receipts and expenditures. The commissioners could reach the same result by fixing a uniform per cent less than the usual rate on the ordinary revenues, upon the aggregate of ordinary and extraordinary receipts and disbursements.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b191-4" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[183,715,1167,658]]]'>(5) That the commissioners should not fix two rates. Having the power, it is a matter entirely in the discretion of the commissioners and auditors, whether they should or should not exercise it. The fact that when building a new jail, no distinction was made between the ordinary and extraordinary receipts and disbursements, in fixing the treasurer’s compensation, presents no bar to the exercise of the power now, to make a distinction. The same argument may be made against any alteration or change of compensation from what former treasurers received on the ordinary receipts and disbursements. True, the present treasurer may complain that he has not been as liberally dealt with as the treasurer who happened to be in office when the jail was built.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.6",191,[177,1382,1170,1013]],["BL_192.1",192,[282,339,1168,186]]]'>(e) That the commissioners and auditors cannot or should not change the rate of compensation of the treasurer during his term, after the same has been once fixed. The statute says the rate of compensation shall be fixed from time to time. It does not say it shall be fixed at the incoming of each new treasurer, and continued during his term, but from time to time; and it seems to us that fixing the compensation each year is a judicious exercise of this power. The commissioners are better able to judge, at the beginning of each year, what will be a fair compensation for that year, than to fix it for a term of three years; though the fact is that there has been no change made during the present incumbent’s term. That they have this power is expressly held in Crawford Co. v. Nash, <a href="/pa/99/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="99 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="446150" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0253-01">99 Pa. 253</a>. The fact that prior to 1879 the rate of compensation had been uniform for the entire term of each treasurer, without regard to the source whence the money came, or the purpose for which it was disbursed, is not a legal reason why the commissioners should not change the rate. In 1879 they made the change, evidently in view of the erection of a new court house, and have continued the compensation ever since upon <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>the basis then fixed. It follows, from these views of the court, that the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment, and what we have said leads to the conclusion that judgment must be entered for the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[276,544,1173,402]]]'>The question, though not raised by the case stated, of the power of the court to review the action of the commissioners and auditors in fixing the compensation of the treasurer, is suggested. At the argument, both counsel seemed to think there was no doubt of our power, and that on the appeal from the report of the auditors of the settlement of the treasurer’s account, the power could be exercised. With all due respect to opinion of counsel, we cannot agree with them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.6",192,[255,952,1186,1368]]]'>The forty-eighth section of the act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 545, declares that the county auditors “ shall audit, settle and adjust the accounts of the commissioners, treasurer, and sheriff and coroner of the county, and make report thereof to the Court of Common Pleas of such county, together with a statement of the balance due from or to such commissioners, treasurer, sheriff or coroner.” The auditors are to settle the account of the treasurer, and make report thereof to the court; that is, a report of their settlement of the treasurer’s account. The fifty-sixth section of the same act, provides that an appeal may be taken by the officer or the county, from such report, to the Court of Common Pleas. The appeal is not from the action of the commissioners and auditors in fixing the compensation of the treasurer. The appeal is from the auditors’ report of the settlement of the treasurer’s account. The auditors’ settlement and report do not fix the treasurer’s compensation. The settlement, so far as that item is concerned, is simply an allowance of the amount fixed bjr the joint action of the commissioners and auditors. The auditors cannot alone fix the compensation, nor can the commissioners. It requires their joint action, and from that the act of 1834 gives no appeal. It is said, if an officer cannot appeal, then the commissioners and auditors have it in their power to fix an entirely inadequate compensation. This may be a good argument to the law■making power, but can have no force in determining the law as it now stands. All ultimate power is more or less despotic and may be abused.</p>

When the commissioners and auditors <em>fail </em>to fix the compensation, an appeal lies; not, when they have fixed it. A case may arise in which the commissioners and auditors disagree as to the amount of compensation, and it is for such a case the appeal is given.</p>
