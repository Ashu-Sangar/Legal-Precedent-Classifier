Once a year Isaac Jeanes &amp; Co. balanced their books against Selser <em>&amp; </em>Brother, added interest charged, and brought down a new principal against the latter. In .July, 1885, a settlement was made between the two firms, when Selser &amp; Brother gave to Isaac Jeanes &amp; Go. certain promissory notes aggregating $87,200, which included the charges of interest, in the accounts, some of which charges were alleged to be usurious.

Any .one can do that with the aid of a dictionary. The offer was to show that the paper did not contain the whole agreement of the parties, and the decision of the learned auditor shows how necessary it was to do that; for, he has, in effect, added words to the agreement other than those found in it. He ruled that .the‘meaning of the words, in lieu of, is plain, and in that we agree with him. But how, in lieu of the claim, was the assignment intended?

In that event, to hold to the letter of the assignment and decide upon that alone, without hearing evidence to show what the agreement really was, would permit a fraudulent use to be made of the assignment, and that has always been deprecated by the courts: Phillips v.

If a loss had not been sustained, or if the loss had turned out to be SI,002.25, and the pledge $6,617.34, the assignment having been made by a failing debtor, we presume there would not have been so much difficulty for the assignee for the benefit of creditors to show the facts, and in recovering the excess. Why there should be so much difficulty in the present case, is hard to understand.....</p>

    <p id="b560-6" data-blocks='[["BL_560.7",560,[249,1394,1175,1011]]]'>The appellant assigns error to the allowance of the claims of Isaac Jeanes &amp; Co. and Coon Brothers &amp; Co. Neither requires an extended discussion. That of Isaac Jeanes &amp; Co. is objected to principally upon the ground that it is usurious. The alleged usury consists mainly in adding interest to principal in the accounts as furnished from time to time, the effect of ■which, the appellant contended, was to allow interest upon interest ; and it was alleged that some of the loans were at a higher rate of interest than six per cent. On the other hand, it was conceded that some were at a less rate than six per cent. It does not appear very clearly what the average rate would be; nor is it material, as yearly settlements were made between Isaac Jeanes &amp; Co. and Selser &amp; Brother, and no objection made by the latter. The appellant is an unsecured creditor of Selser &amp; Brother, and has no standing to object to these settlements. It is not now unlawful for a debtor to pay more than six per cent; and a creditor has no right to attack such a transaction, unless the agreement to pay a higher rate was part of a scheme to cheat and defraud creditors. There was nothing in the case from which such an inference could be fairly drawn.</p>

      <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>Nor do we see any reason why Coon Brothers &amp; Co. should not have been awarded a dividend out of the assigned estate. It is true, the auditor found that the agreement of May 1,1886, by wbicb Selser &amp; Brother authorized Coon Brothers &amp; Co. to retain all dividends to be paid by tlie assignees of J. H. Larzallere &amp; Co., was in full satisfaction of the claim of the former for tbe loss on the tomatoes bought on the joint account. The learned judge below, however, reversed this finding of tbe auditor, and, for reasons which we think sufficient, beld that the assignment of tbe Larzellere dividend was made by Selser &amp; Brother to Coon Brothers &amp; Co. merely on account of any such loss, not in satisfaction thereof. The evidence fully justified this finding.</p>
