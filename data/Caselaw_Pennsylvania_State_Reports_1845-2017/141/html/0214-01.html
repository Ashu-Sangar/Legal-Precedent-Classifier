Lambert, Lambert paid the amount of the loan made by him to J. H. Maguire, the secretary and treasurer of the soap company, who handed the money over to Hunter ; that at that time all the moneys of the company were kept by Hunter, who deposited them in his individual bank account, and checked against that account when it was necessary to pay out money on behalf of the company, and that the proceeds of each of the loans mentioned were so deposited by him, and subsequently paid out for the use of the company. The notes above mentioned were renewed from time to time, payments of interest being made by the individual checks of Hunter, until some time in 1887, when both Hunter and the soap company became insolvent, and made assignments for the benefit of their creditors.

    <p class="summary" id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[272,520,1174,809]]]'>Let us take the Lambert case first. [The auditor here gave a copy of the last renewal note to Lambert.] It will be noticed that the name of the Van Haagen soap company, the proceeds of whose assigned estate are now being distributed, appears nowhere on this paper. The note itself is a renewal of another note of like amount, drawn precisely in the same form, which matured about the time this note was given. That note was itself also a renewal note. Indeed, the original note, executed and delivered to Mr. Lambert at the time he loaned his $5,000, was dated on or about the fifteenth day of May, 1885. Of this note there were altogether five or six renewals, and in none of them, as far as the testimony shows, did the name of the Van Haagen company appear either as maker or indorser. The auditor is of the opinion, therefore, that the relation of debtor and creditor was not created, and at no time existed between Mr. Lambert and the soap company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.6",240,[271,1337,1176,1115]]]'>There was some testimony given to show that Mr. Lambert was told by his father-in-law, Mr. Van Haagen, who negotiated the loan, that the $5,000 was wanted for the soap company, but it also appears that Mr. Van Haagen told Mr. Lambert that the soap company was so badly in. need of the money that he was afraid that unless they could get it they would have to stop. Such information was not calculated to inspire Mr. Lambert with perfect confidence in the return of his money, should -he lend it to the soap company; but we can readily understand how he might be actuated by a friendly feeling toward the company which bore his father-in-law’s name and of which he was general manager, while at the same time he would see to it that the person to whom he advanced the money would be able to repay it when it became due, whether the soap company stopped or not. This is what your auditor thinks Mr. Lambert did; and assurance that he did this is made doubly sure by the testimony of Mr. Hunter, to whom the money was paid by Mr. Lambert and who says that Mr. Lambert asked him whether, in case anything should happen to him (Mr. Hunter), he, Mr. Hunter, would be able to take care of the loan, to which Mr. Hunter replied “ that, although he owed a great deal of money, he had enough to pay everybody, and have plenty left.”</p>

Such transactions as this was are of daily occurrence. A man who lends money to another may or may not approve of the use to which his debtor intends to devote the money, but he has the right to say, before he parts with the cash, and he generally does say, upon what terms and on what security he will make the loan. When he stipulates and exacts terms and security, clearly and distinctly expressed in writing, it would be taking a great liberty with him and his contract to say that he did not mean what he had caused to be written, but he meant something else of an entirely different character.</p>

The collateral security for the payment of the note at maturity was 150 shares of stock, of the Van Haagen Soap Manufacturing Company, of the par value of $7,500, which was John Hunter’s individual property. The proceeds went into Mr. Hunter’s individual bank account, and was checked against by Mr. Hunter for the benefit and business of the soap company, or whatever other object and purpose he pleased.</p>

It is very certain that at the time indicated he had not the slightest premonition of the financial and family calamity by which he was subsequently overwhelmed. It was quite natural, therefore, that individuals and banks could be found who would be willing to lend their money upon the faith and credit of John Hunter’s paper, while they would be unwilling to advance it to a corporation which was admittedly hanging on the ragged edge of a stoppage of its operations.</p>

Hunter, who was the only person of financial ability connected with the concern, showed by his own testimony, and it also appears by the testimony of Van Haagen, that there was a constant demand on him for money, which he found it difficult to supply; Hunter had even authorized Van Haagen to borrow money upon his “big farm,” as it is called. Hunter says : “ Practically I owned all <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>the stock of the corporation; I was advancing money to it myself as stockholder and practical owner; it was needing money for its business; it was very much in need of money, always needing money; I don’t remember especially that it was short of stock and material; it was a chronic complaint; Mr. Van Haagen had often urged upon me the importance of getting money to meet these demands.” This is most strongly confirmatory of Van Haagen’s testimony in relation to his interviews with Hunter preliminary to the obtaining each of these two loans, and that it was to meet an urgent necessity that he obtained the consent of Hunter to borrow each of these amounts for the use of the factory.</p>

He says: “ In the early part of 1885 the company was sadly in need of money; I called on the president of the National Security Bank, stating the ease of the company to him; asked him whether he thought his bank would be willing to discount a note of $5,000 for the company1; he said they would; to send him my note with Mr. Hunter’s indorsement; the note was sent and discounted, and Hunter sent Mr. Maguire, who was the secretary and treasurer of the corporation, to receive the proceeds of the note.” He says that, before he called on the president of the bank, Mr. Gelbach, he called on Hunter, and got his consent to the transaction ; afterwards, he said he thought he had spoken to Mr. Gelbach first; that this loan was solicited for neither his own nor for Mr. Hunter’s private purposes ; simply for the welfare of the company. Now, here is testimony of a witness whose integrity lias in no way been impeached or questioned, who, as the chief actor in the borrowing of this money, in tlie most positive manner testifies that this was a loan to the company, <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>for the use of the company, and that it was not for the individual use of himself or Hunter, who were the parties to the note.</p>

To the perfectly plain question, varied in form seven or eight times, as to whether Van Haagen had not called on him in June, 1885, stating the need of the company to obtain tallow and other materials, and asked witness’s consent to an endeavor on his part to obtain a loan of $5,000 from the bank with which to purchase materials, an answer, yes or no, was steadily refused. In each instance the reply was not responsive to the question, but wholly irrelevant and irresponsive to the inquiry. To the further question, repeated in substance five times, whether, after the failure of the company, he had not said to Mr. Van Haagen and to John H. Connellan that the money received from the bank was raised to buy materials for the soap factory, and that it ought to have been made a preferred creditor, as this was borrowed money, there was the like refusal to answer yes or no, or, indeed, to make any direct answers. There is, we think, but one proper inference to be drawn from this refusal to make proper answers to the questions propounded; and that is, that if the witness had answered according to his knowledge he would have given in each instance an affirmative reply, as the special object of the inquiries was to elicit an affirmative response ; but, for a reason not disclosed, he refused to make airy other than evasive statements which had no direct bearing on the several matters to which the questions pointed.....</p>

Cox, the cashier of the bank, which is, that in February, 1887, John H. Maguire, the salaried treasurer of the company, presented the note for the last renewal.

He did not use the word parties. Under examination by the auditor, he is reported as saying, without objection, that the president of the bank had said to him that he had loaned Van Haagen $5,000 for the benefit of the company; that Hunter and Van Haagen were the company. This is all the testimony which has any material bearing on the contract of loan made by the bank, for what purpose, for whose benefit, and under what circumstances it was made, except the testimony of John Hunter.

But this statement by Hunter, though strictly in accordance with the facts as they actually occurred, does not imply, nor does he say, that the loan was not to the company; that it was not made to meet its then urgent exigencies ; and that his indorsement of the note was not given to the bank to secure the debt contracted for the use and benefit of the company, as testified to by Van Haagen, when he swore that he called on Mr. Gelbach, the president of the bank, stating the case of the company to him, and then asked him whether he thought his bank -would be willing to discount a note for $5,000 for the company, and that he said they would, “ to send him my note with Hunter’s indorsement.” This is so, because John Hunter was in fact the company. He owned all its capital stock, and had furnished every dollar of money that was put into the enterprise. When he said the proceeds of the note went into his individual account, to him personally, he said what was strictly true. But John Hunter was at the time not only the president of the company, he was its acting treasurer; the money of the company was paid to him, and by him deposited in his individual bank account, and out of that <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>account all money was drawn which, up to this time, June, 1885, was paid by Hunter to the company.</p>

That, of course, gave him the control of the money, against which he could check as he pleased; but, as between himself and the company, it was the money of the company, which, both in morals and in law, he would be bound to hold for the objects for which it was obtained.

Both of the witnesses to the circumstances under which the loan was made have testified that it was a loan to the company. Van Haagen, who was Lambert’s father-in-law, made known to Lambert that the company was short of stock; that unless money could be raised they would probably be obliged to shut down. Lambert then, according to his testimony, offered to loan them $5,000. He says, “I told Van Haagen that I would loan the company the money.” Van Haagen says that, having tried to borrow money in several places, he presented the matter to Mr. Lambert and asked him if he could help “by loaning us some money; ” to which Lambert replied he had $5,000 on hand which he could loan. Lambert says: “ Before I saw Mr. Hunter about this loan, I told Van Haagen that I would loan the company the money.” There was a subsequent interview between Van Haagen, Lambert, and Hunter at the tax office, when the matter was definitely agreed on, Hunter agreeing to give his note to Lambert for the amount. Hunter’s testimony shows that at this interview, which was the consummation of the agreement previously entered into between Lambert and Van Haagen to borrow for and to loan the $5,000 to the company, he, Hunter, proposed to Lambert that he should take Van Haagen’s note, or the note of the company, which Lambert refused to do. Hunter finally giving to Lambert the assurance that he was abundantly able to make the loan secure to him, under any circumstances, out of his individual estate, the money was paid to Maguire, the treasurer of the <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>Company. If this was a loan to Hunter individually, and not to the company, it is difficult to find a reason for Hunter’s proposal that the note of the company should be accepted by Lambert in return for the individual debt of Hunter. This, of itself, would seem almost, if not altogether, conclusive of the understanding which Hunter at the time had of the nature and character of the contract of the loan previously agreed on b}r Lambert and Van Haagen.</p>

Connellan, assignee for creditors, in the Common Pleas No. 1 of Philadelphia. At the hearing before the auditor, the National. Security Bank of Philadelphia presented a claim for $5,000, the amount of a loan alleged to have been made to the company in June, 1885, for which the bank at the time of the loan took the note of Anthony Van Haagen, payable to the order of John Hunter, and by him indorsed. William H. Lambert also presented a claim of $5,000, a loan alleged to have been made on May 15, 1885, for which he took the note of John Hunter. Both of these notes were from time to time renewed until February, 1887, the in<a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>terest thereon being paid by John Hunter. Both claims were objected to on the ground that they were loans, not to the Van Haagen soap company, but to Anthony Van Haagen and John Hunter, respectively, and that there was no liability on part ■of the soap company to pay them. The appellees’ contention, however, is that the respective loans were in fact negotiated for and on behalf of the company; and, although the notes of Van Haagen and Hunter were, for supposed prudential reasons, taken as a security for payment thereof, the company actually incurred the debt and is liable therefor; and that the claims should therefore be allowed in this distribution.</p>

This he thinks Lambert did. “At the date of these transactions,” he says, “ Mr. John Hunter’s name and credit in the commercial world was without blemish. He occupied the ■position of receiver of taxes of Philadelphia, was in receipt of a large annual salary, and was otherwise supposed to be a man •of great influence and large wealth. It is very certain that at •the time indicated he had not the slightest premonition of the financial and family calamity by which he was subsequently overwhelmed. It is quite natural, therefore, that individuals and banks could be found who would be willing to lend their money upon the faith and credit of John Hunter’s paper, whilst they would be unwilling to advance it to a corporation which was admittedly hanging on the ragged edge of a stoppage of ■•its operations.....A man who lends his money to another may or may not approve of the use to which his debtor intends to devote the money, but he has the right to say before he. <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>parts with the cash, and he generally does say, upon what terms and on what security he will make the loan. When he stipulates and exacts terms and security, clearly and distinctly expressed in writing, it would be taking great liberty with him and his contract to say that he did not mean what he had caused to be written, but he meant something else of an entirely different character.” This is substantially the view taken by the auditor. He fails to find, in any explicit form, what is the controlling fact in the cause, whether the loan of the money in each case was in fact to the company, or to the parties on the note; that is to say, whether the notes were received as a consideration for the money or as a security merely.</p>

Hitchman, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20W.%20454" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="5 W. 454">5 <em>W. </em>454</a>. “ It is entirely competent for one partner to borrow money, or to buy goods, or to enter into contracts on his sole and exclusive credit with third persons; and, on the other hand, it is equally competent for them to rely on that exclusive credit, and either to refuse to contract with the firm, or to exonerate the firm from all liability'- upon any contract which would otherwise bind the firm as being for their account or benefit: ” Story on Partnership, 134-136.

It is not disputed that Van Haagen and Hunter had the power to bind the company for borrowed money. It was competent, therefore, for the National Security Bank to show that the money was, in fact, loaned to the company for the company’s use; that the transaction was not the discount of a note, but a loan of money to the company, the note being ip the nature of a collateral security for the repayment thereof: Maffet v. Leuckel, <a href="/pa/93/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="93 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="442041" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0468-01">93 Pa. 468</a>. In the case cited, the facts found by the referee were as, follows: Maffet &amp; Rhoads, the defendants, during the year 1866 were partners, engaged in building a section of the Lehigh &amp; Susquehanna railroad. Rhoads applied to the plaintiff, Leuckel, for $200, representing that he wished the same for the purpose of paying the men in the defendants’ employ, and thereupon the said amount was advanced by the plaintiff, and the sum was used by Rhoads for the purpose mentioned, he giving the plaintiff his own individual note for the amount. Suit was brought, not upon the note, but for the recovery of the money advanced, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff. When the cause came here, this court, in a per Curiam said: “ There was nothing in the form of the note produced in evidence to preclude the plaintiff from showing that it was given for a partnership debt; that it was <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>not accepted in satisfaction, but merely as a collateral security. It matters not that the making of the note was contemporaneous with the partnership debt. On the facts found by the referee we are of opinion that the judgment was right.”</p>
    <p id="b255-4" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[182,554,1210,1471]]]'>There can be no doubt but that the money in both cases at bar was borrowed for the use of the company. Both loans were solicited in the first instance by V an Haagen, to provide means for the purchase of stock and materials for the company. It is of no consequence that the money was put to the credit of John Hunter, for John Hunter was the company’s banker: he owned practically all of the stock, and the company’s funds were, up to that time at least, supplied from and deposited in his private account. The testimony of Van Haagen, Lambert, and Connellan, in the one case, and of Van Ilaagon, Maguire, Connellan, and Cox, the cashier, in the other, is clear and convincing on this point. The only contradiction is by John Hunter, whose answers to questions put to him are so manifestly equivocating and evasive as to render his testimony very unsatisfactory. But, from the tenor of the testimony as a whole, there can be no conclusion of fact more clear than that both these loans were effected for the use and benefit of the Van Haagen Soap Manufacturing Company. It is equally clear, not only from what occurred at the time, but before and after, that this was the understanding of all the parties concerned; not only of Van Haagen, Hunter, and the soap manufacturing company on the one side, but of the bank and Lambert on the other; and also that the money ultimately went into the company, and was used in the business. It is unnecessary for us to refer in detail to the evidence. In so doing, we would be obliged to extend the bounds of this opinion to an undue extent. What we have said is the result »f a careful study of the testimony, and it is only required that we should state our conclusions.</p>

As to the contemplated liability of the company to repay the debt, we may, in addition to what has already <em>been </em>said, refer briefly to the testimony. The bank officers regarded Van Haagen and <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>Hunter as the company. Mr. Gelbach, at the time of the loan, when Cox, the cashier, expressed surprise that the company’s name was not on the paper, replied that the parties to the note were the whole company. When Maguire came to renew the note, the last time, he asked Cox if the bank would be willing to renew it. Mr. Cox inquired how the soap manufacturing company was getting along. Maguire replied that they were getting along very well, and that the “company” would not want the note renewed again; that this was the last. Mr. Connellan, the assignee, testifies that shortly after his appointment as assignee, in June, 1889, he had a conversation with Mr. Hunter in the president’s room of the Keystone National Bank, and that Hunter said he was very sorry for the National Security Bank; that they had been very kind to him, and the note which they discounted at the request of Mr. Van Haagen was really for the benefit of the Van Haagen Soap Manufacturing Company, and should be a claim on the fund in his hands as assignee. . “ He also told me,” says Mr. Connellan, “ there was another note, which had been given to Mr. Van Haagen’s son-in-law, Mr. William H. Lambert, and that that should also be a claim on this fund. I told him that I had been over the books of the company, and that, on the face of the matter at least, the company was not liable for this loan. He said that Mr. Lambert, at the time he took this note, thought that he, Mr. Hunter, was stronger than the company, and that that was why the note was signed that way instead of the company’s note being given.”</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[270,1676,1201,400]]]'>That the notes were taken- for greater security than if signed by the company cannot be questioned, but if the contract was with and for the company the notes would stand as a collateral security for the company’s debt. The learned judge of the court below was of opinion that the testimony was sufficient to rebut the presumption that the notes were taken as a consideration for or in payment of the debt, and we are satisfied that he was right.</p>
