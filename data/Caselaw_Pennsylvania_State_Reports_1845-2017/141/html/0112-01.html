Harrison, and the right to said balance afterwards vested in said trustee. During the hearing, the balance sought to be proved was reduced by credits admitted to $477.45, and the right to claim upon the reduced balance was supported for the claimant by the testimony of Samuel M. Harrison, the original payee of the order. As to this claim, the master found and reported that Mr. Harrison had received the balance due,' to wit $477.45, and had surrendered the order to the treasurer of the association, “who made the following indorsement thereon: ‘ Received, May 28, 1881, balance due on the within order.’ ”</p>

Samuel Harrison, placed upon the stand, attempts to controvert the effect of its surrender to the association, and denies the receipt of $477.45. The master did not believe him. Of his credibility the master was a competent judge, and we see nothing either in the facts or circumstances of the case to show error on his part. The appearance of the witness, the manner of his testifying, coupled with what he said and what he did not recollect, were probably of such a nature as to justify discrediting him. In this he did not exceed his authority, as will be perceived by reading the case.....</p>

On the one hand, there was the receipt for the balance due on order No. 275, indorsed on the back thereof in the handwriting of the treasurer, the order itself being in the possession of the association. This was prima facie evidence of payment. There was nothing to contradict this except the explanation of Samuel M. Harrison, and the master did not believe him.
