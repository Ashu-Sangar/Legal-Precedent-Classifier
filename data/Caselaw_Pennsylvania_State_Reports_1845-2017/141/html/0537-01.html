The law permits men to affix any condition to the transfer of property that is not expressly prohibited by statute or by public policy; and it is open to any contributor to a charitable corporation to provide, in the instrument of donation, for a return to him of the property contributed, in the event of the suspension or dissolution of the corporation.

Now, why is that? Why, because those shareholders own the property, the interest of each individual consisting of the number of his shares and being represented by his certificates of stock. For preeisefy the same reason there can be no distribution of the property of a charitable corporation among its members, contributors or managers, upon its dissolution. They do not own the property.

The Pauline Temporary Home is a trustee. The cessation of its active existence can give the contributors to it no right to divide among themselves, or transfer to other objects, however worthy, property charged with a trust.

Its contention was that their wishes and recommendation should have weight with the court in determining the question of its future application. Conceding much force to this position, we have nothing before us to show that the court below did not give proper regard to their suggestions. It is true the fund was not awarded to the appellant. It was claimed by a number of charitable institutions. They are all meritorious, and deserving of aid, but we cannot say the court erred in awarding the fund to the Children’s Aid Society. The object of said society appears to be nearer in accord with that of the Pauline Temporary Home than that of any other of the societies named. The matter was very much in the discretion <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>of <em>the </em>court below, and we would not reverse, unless for a clear abuse of discretion.
