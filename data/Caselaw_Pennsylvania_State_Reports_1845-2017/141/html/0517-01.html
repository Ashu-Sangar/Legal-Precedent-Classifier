R. Pemberton. Separate answers having been filed, and issue joined, the cause was referred to <em>Mr. Isaac D. </em>Yocum, as examiner and master, who on June 2,1890, filed a report showing a contention between the parties, in brief as follows:</p>

The prunes were stored in certain New York warehouses, and the plaintiff held the warehouse receipts. The defendant company, of which defendant Pemberton was president, was interested in certain prunes held by another warehouse company, by reason of having guaranteed loans made by the latter to the same persons whose notes had been discounted by the plaintiff bank. By arrangement between officials of the plaintiff bank and Pemberton, on behalf of the defendant company, the latter agreed to take charge of the plaintiff’s prunes, to pay the duties, to weigh them, to attend to the releasing of attachments upon them, and in general to assume the entire care and custody of them and to prepare them for sale. On <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>July 22, 1887, an auction sale in New York, made to feel the state of the market, disclosed the fact that a loss on the prunes was likely to be had. On the next day, Pemberton as president of the defendant company, wrote a letter to the plaintiff bank presenting the necessity for prompt action, and proposing that his company would “ continue to render its services and take the entire charge of all matters appertaining to the sale, and to guarantee all sales, for a commission of five per cent upon any sum realized.” The proposition was duly received by the plaintiff bank, and at a meeting on July 25th, the bank board by resolution “ authorized the employment of the said company for this purpose.” So far, the facts were undisputed. It was claimed by the plaintiff that,the acceptance of the proposition was at once communicated to Pemberton verbally. On the part of the latter, it was denied that any communication of the acceptance of the proposition was ever made. It was not disputed, however, that the bank turned over to Pemberton all the warehouse receipts and papers of every description, relating to the prunes, and that the latter thereafter conducted all the correspondence, and paid all bills and traveling expenses while attending to the business.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[242,1462,1176,961]],["BL_543.1",543,[170,391,1170,955]]]'>In the spring of 1888, it became necessary for the plaintiff bank to dispose of the prunes before the heat of summer should come. The plaintiff alleged that Pemberton then asked that one Jansen, a larg’e wholesale dealer in New York be allowed to make a bid for them. On the other hand, Pemberton testified that the plaintiff bank asked him to obtain a bid from Jansen. At all events, Jansen came on from New York, but before seeing the bank officials, he asked Pemberton if the latter would take a one half interest in the prunes, if the former should buy them from the bank. Pemberton agreed to do so. Jansen and Pemberton then called together on the bank, and Jansen made an offer for the prunes that was declined. Negotiations continued, however, and on May 1, 1888, a sale of the prunes to Jansen was concluded. At this time, the plaintiff did not know that Pemberton was interested with Jansen in the purchase. There was no evidence that he had anything to do with fixing the prices offered by Jansen before the sale was made; and no bad faith, mismanagement, or fraud of any kind was charged .or imputed to him in the care and custody of the goods. It <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>was admitted that in the negotiations which finally culminated in the sale, the bank officials retired from Pemberton’s presence to consult as to the propriety of accepting the bid presented for Jansen. After the sale, Pemberton attended to the reweighing and re-coopering of the prunes, when necessary, and to all other necessary details. Jansen paid for the prunes by his own notes, drawn to his own order and indorsed by himself. On July 31, 1888, Pemberton, as “president,” submitted his expense account, etc., and asked for payment thereof and for services rendered. Payment in full was made by the plaintiff bank on August 14, 1888. Jansen was successful in handling and selling the prunes bought from the plaintiff, and prior to October 6, 1888, had sold them all so as to realize a profit of $15,553.38, of which Pemberton received one half, to wit, $7,776.69, less the sum of $408.61 about which there was an unsettled dispute. In February, 1889, the plaintiff bank learn ed for the first time that Pemberton was interested with Jansen in the purchase of the prunes, and filed this bill for discovery of the amount received and for an account.</p>

Pemberton, notified of the action of the board of directors of the complainant on July 25, 1887, in which they authorized the acceptance of his offer to act as sales-agent, contained in his letter of July 23, 1887 ; and did he afterwards act as sales-agent.</p>

He was not possessed of any information that his principal did not possess. When the bank officials decided to sell, they conducted the negotiations themselves. They said to Mr. Pemberton, “We are going to sell,” “We are going to attend to this matter ourselves,” and they did. Whatever confidential relations, if any, existed or had existed were terminated then, and in their dealings with Mr. Pemberton, touching the sale, they dealt with him at arms’ length and as a stranger. As appears from the testimony, Mr. Pemberton had nothing to do with fixing the price which Jansen bid, and when he changed the terms of Jansen’s bid [as to time of payment] it was certainly enough to put the bank officials upon inquiry. Was it not notice to them that he had an interest in the bid ? If the law goes as far as the learned counsel for the complainant says it does, the janitor of a building could not have a secret interest in its purchase.</p>

It is, however, the fact, that the answer of the defendant corporation does say that it did act as sales-agent and did make the sale in question, and is therefore entitled to the full commission which it earned.

Did the president act within the line of his authority in this case, in making the purchase in question? The master is of opinion that he did not. The act of Pemberton, the president of the corporation defendant, in writing the letter of July 23, 1887, was undoubtedly without authority from the board of directors, although afterwards ratified by the board. It certainly never authorized the taking of a secret interest in the purchase, by its president, and admittedly never received any portion of the profit realized. Had its president seen fit to enter into other private speculations for his own benefit, it certainly will not be contended that the corporation would have been liable for his acts.</p>

But, although what the secretary stated related to matters about which he was authorized to give answers, he did not make the statements for the defendants, but for himself. He had a friend whom he desired to assist and could assist by making the false statements, and as he made them in his own interest or to assist his friend, he was not acting for the defendants. The rule has often been expressed in the terms, that to bind the principal the agent must be acting for the benefit of the principal. That, in my opinion, is equivalent to saying that he must be acting for the principal.
