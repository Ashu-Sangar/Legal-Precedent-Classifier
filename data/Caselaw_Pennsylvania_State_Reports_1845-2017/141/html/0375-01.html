On July 7, 1888, a writ of venditioni exponas for the sale of the real estate so condemned was issued, and on July 19, 1888, Elvira L.

The pleadings in that action were not printed in the paper-books, but it was stated that the plaintiffs’ declaration claimed mesne profits from the date of the disseisin in 1880, and that by a notice given under act of May 2, 1876, P. L. 95, mesne profits subsequent to the commencement of the action and down to the date when the plaintiffs obtained possession in 1888, were claimed. In the appellants’ paper-book it was alleged that the official stenographer’s notes of the trial showed that the plaintiffs withdrew all evidence relating to matters prior to May 1, 1883.</p>

In her petition she contended for the use of this amount as a set-off and an extinguishment of the decree. It was apparently an equitable contention. It seemed unjust and oppressive to take in execution for the payment of the decree the very lands out of which she was entitled to the rents, issues and profits •claimed to have been illegally taken by Henry Miller. Her wishes can now be gratified. If Henry Miller will, within five days from date, make actual lawful tender, as contemplated in his offer, with proper costs, the proper order for staying the ■execution will be made with all proper and necessary relief. If the proper tender is not so made, execution process may proceed.</p>

It is true that by the terms of the decree of this court, entered April 14, 1888, it was provided that the effect thereof should not be to create any personal responsibility as to Elvira L. Miller; that the decree should be enforceable only against the land. But it appears that Elvira L. Miller afterwards, in relief of the land, went into the Common Pleas and obtained a stay of execution, claiming practically that the decree was satisfied ; that Henry Miller had moneys in his hands realized from the rents, issues, and profits of the lands in dispute, sufficient and more than sufficient to pay the decree. Her claim was then not only unliquidated, it was actually in litigation; but the stay of execution was nevertheless ordered, and the same has since been continued until the true amount of her claim could be legally ascertained. This was afterwards done, and judgment was entered for $2,653.55; and now the defendant complains of the court for doing what she herself prayed the court might be done. The <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>order was made, practically, upon the petition of both parties in interest, and it is difficult to see how either can complain. The execution was stayed in order that the rents, issues and profits might be ascertained, and applied in payment of the decree ; and now, having had the benefit of a stay of proceedings for this particular purpose, she will not be permitted, when her claim is adjusted, to repudiate the mode of settlement she herself proposed, and upon the faith of which the stay was granted. We are of opinion that the court was right in making the order of June 2,1890, and the same is affirmed.</p>
