Schwartz, executor and trustee, the court put an interpretation upon the will. The executor and trustee appealed from the findings and construction placed upon the will. The court was affirmed. It then found, among other things, that the testator intended to treat his five children alike, in so far as his $5,000 legacies to them were concerned. <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>It also found that said legacies were all conditioned. It further found that the accountant did not have sufficient funds in hand to meet the payment of said legacies in full, and that if the unsold property available to the appropriation to said legacies be added to the funds in hand for that purpose, they might amount to $3,250 to each of said legatees, and directed $3,000 to said Adam H. Schwartz, to invest for the use of said John Moyer. It also distributed a like sum to Ella Lewis.</p>

At the former adjudication, none of his numerous counsel thought of raising this point, nor did they or either of them object to the distribution of the court, or take an appeal thereform. If the court, as is alleged, erred upon this point, it cannot now correct the error.</p>

It acted for him and for the interest of his family. It is not in my power to alter the report under said proceedings and findings then had. They were recognized to be correct by his then counsel, and are now SO' held. The claim must be dismissed.</p>
