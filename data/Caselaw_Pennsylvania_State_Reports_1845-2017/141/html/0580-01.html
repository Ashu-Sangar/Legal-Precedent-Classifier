Norris Emlen and J. Dickinson Sergeant, while both were alive and down to the year 1872, collected the income of said estate through an agent appointed by them, viz., Benjamin Ritter. They reserved to themselves all collections and re-investments of capital, and J. Norris Emlen, one of the trustees, kept a set of books in which were entered as well all income returned by Mr. Ritter as also all principal sums belonging to the estate, the re-investments of the latter, and the accounts of the distribution of the income among the parties interested.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.6",606,[253,1190,1169,403]]]'>Mr. Ritter died in the beginning of the year 1872. He had in his employment a young man named John Ruhl who assisted him in his business. Mr. Ritter, for some time before his death, was disqualified from attending to business, and for a short time before his death and down to the employment of the defendant as Mr. Ritter’s successor, this John Ruhl, in his own name, collected and made return of the income to the trustees for a period covering a few months.</p>

Norris Emlen and was a member of the bar, was appointed by the trustees to take the place of Mr. Ritter as the collector of the income of this estate. His employment began about June, 1872. At the time of defendant’s said employment, Joseph M. Pile, Esq., was the general counsel for the trustees in regard to the trust property, and he and the defendant had adjoining offices in the building No. 512 Walnut street. It is a notable feature that no written delegation of authority appears ever to have been executed by the trustees, or either of them, to any party who in their behalf transacted the business of the estate, or any part of such business, as the agent or attorney of them or the survivor of them. Whatever power or authority was vested in any part in their agent or agents, was by parol only or grew up by the conduct and usage of the parties.</p>

Ruhl, as has already been said, had been assisting Mr. Ritter in his lifetime; and being active and intelligent and having already acquired from his connection with the business considerable knowledge of the estate, and, from his residence in the neighborhood, knowing the names and residences of the tenants and debtors, it was very natural that his being placed as an assistant to the defendant should be considered.</p>

But after the trustees surrendered their office at 319 Walnut street, a change appears to have been introduced in the method of handling and accounting for the principal sums of the estate. The most of these principal sums were derived by the redemption or extinguishment of ground-rents. Mr. Pile, as the counsel for the trustees, would have the examination of the papers, and after their execution they would be left with him for delivery to the grantees upon payment of the principal. This principal so received was always returned by him to the trustees, so long as they had their office at 319 Walnut street. After they surrendered that, and having no separate office of their own, the practice and usage grew up of passing this principal through the accounts of the defendant. It appears that no additional compensation was allowed to the defendant for collection of any principal, nor does it appear that he had made any stipulation with the trustees or the survivor of them to collect for them such principal moneys ; and yet, in point of fact, his books and his returns show that from 1875 down to the termination of the defendant’s agency in December, 1887, many sums of principal passed through the accounts <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>of the defendant and were reported and paid over to the trustees. And the trustees must be presumed to have directed or sanctioned this course, because they accepted the returns and the defendant’s cheeks without any objection or denial of his power to collect the principal. It is easy to see how the habit or usage grew up. The three offices of Mr. Pile, George Emlen and John Ruhl were all adjoining'; and, practically, all the business of the estate, except the distribution of the income among the parties interested, was carried on at 512 Walnut street; so it was most convenient to adopt the course which was adopted for collecting and disposing of the principal. . . .</p>

As to this subject, the referee reported:</p>

In consequence of the defendant conceiving that the sums he drew from the estate were within the amount of his share of the proceeds to be derived therefrom, and that his interest in the proceeds of the estate would be ample for the protection of the trustees, I acquit him from any participation in the criminal acts of Mr. Ruhl which I will hereafter more particularly define, though I cannot say he was free from blame in not reporting to the trustees or the survivor of them, the extent to which he had carried on this system of taking moneys for his own account.</p>

These checks and slips amounted in the aggregate to $17,142.45; and I ascertain and report the same at that sum, in order that if the court shall deem my charge of the same against the defendant improper, it may have the data by which to correct my report in this respect.”</p>

In cases of this sort, the agent would not ordinarily be responsible, if he used due diligence in the choice of selecting such sub-agent.

They not only approved his employment, but, according to the facts found by Mr. Clay, the auditor of the seventh account of the trustees of this estate, his employment as an assistant of the defendant was first suggested by J. Norris Emlen, one of the trustees, and the trustees stipulated to become responsible for one third of the amount of his salary. The fact that he enjojmd the confidence of the trustee himself, was further shown by the fact that Mr. Sergeant consulted him often about making investments of moneys that he held as trustee or agent for other estates, and remitted him checks for such investments, and also became a loser to a large amount by the confidence he reposed in Ruhl, who abused it and appropriated to his own use sums paid into his hands by Mr. Sergeant for investment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">*</a> In addition to which, I cannot hold Mr. Sergeant as having exercised due care and diligence in regard to the capital funds of this estate. By keeping a simple memorandum of the moneys which must have been paid off on the rents and securities of which he signed releases, and deducting therefrom the amount of cash and securities reported to him, Mr. Sergeant® could have easily discovei’ed he was getting no proper returns for the securities he so discharged, and he ought earlier to have been led to an investigation on that account. Mr. Pile was asked to explain how it happened that if the deeds of release went through his hands so much of this capital appeared to have reached Ruhl’s hands, without being charged on the books and without being paid in the bank. He did not appear to be able to explain this, except upon the theory <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>that after the deeds were executed they were left in the fireproof, where Ruhl had access to them, and that he delivered them and obtained the money on them without entering the proceeds upon the cash book.</p>

And, while referring to this matter, as it is one of the subjects I am directed by the agreement of reference to report upon, I report that up to this date it appears that Mr. Sergeant has derived nothing from this conveyed real estate, which has furnished him anything in hand to appropriate in reduction of Ruhl’s indebtedness to this estate or to himself. He has made some sales, but the proceeds of what have been sold have been applied in reduction of certain encumbrances on the unsold portions of the property so conveyed to him, and no balance is at present left in his hands from that source.

John Ruhl had been employed by him to assist him. When Mr. Ritter died, the defendant was appointed agent in his stead to collect the <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>income, and Ruhl was appointed assistant. His appointment had been suggested by one of the trustees. The matter was discussed and considered by them, and his appointment to the position must, according to the uncontradicted evidence, be taken to have been made not only with their consent, but by their authority; and the learned referee so finds and reports. He was therefore a fellow-agent with the defendant, appointed to assist in attending to the collections of the estate. He robbed the estate and ran away. It is not alleged by anybody that the defendant had any knowledge of his peculations. So far as the functions performed by Ruhl for the estate, and his participation in the receipt of moneys belonging to it, are concerned, they were facts which appear to have been perfectly well known to the trustees and their counsel. Indeed, he had been appointed for that very purpose.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[263,1141,1166,792]]]'>Ruhl was not Emien’s agent, but the agent of the trustees, although, by the arrangement made when he was appointed, a portion of the salary which he was paid was deducted from the defendant’s salary, the residue being paid by the trustees. It appears that, although originally the trustees themselves had attended to the receipt of the principal sums belonging to the estate, after a time this function, also, was delegated to the agent and the assistant agent. Sometimes the money was handed to Emlen, sometimes to Ruhl, sometimes to the counsel for the trustees, who would hand it sometimes to Ruhl, sometimes to the defendant, and entries thereof would be made on the cash book. Sometimes these entries were made by the defendant, sometimes by Ruhl, and sometimes by the attorney for the trustees; for their offices were all adjoining, and all the business was carried on there between them at No. 512 Walnut street.</p>

Why, then, should he be charged with the moneys fraudulently appropriated by Ruhl ? The learned referee expressly acquits him of any participation in the misconduct of Ruhl, but, while <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>agreeing that, inasmuch as Ruhl was a fellow-agent with the defendant, and was appointed to that position by the trustees themselves, the defendant is not, by the well-settled rule of law upon this subject, responsible for the misconduct of his fellow-agent, he thinks, notwithstanding, that the defendant should be charged with that portion of Ruhl’s embezzlements which were entered upon the cash book as receipts of the estate. He considers that the agent ought not to be held responsible for the misconduct of his fellow-agent, but is of opinion that, so far as relates to such collections as were made by Ruhl and entered upon the cash book of the estate, the defendant ought to be held responsible for them in consequence of his negligence in not being more watchful of Ruhl.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[195,1038,1163,542]]]'>In this part of the conclusion reached by the learned referee, we are unable to concur. We think that such serious consequences should not be visited upon the defendant, by reason of the simple fact that these sums collected by Ruhl were entered upon the cash book. The defendant’s function was that of a mere collecting agent. The responsibility of the general management and supervision of the estate was not upon him, but upon the trustees. It was their duty to watch Ruhl, if he needed watching, and to examine his settlements. They cannot lay the results of their own negligence at the defendant’s door.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.6",615,[198,1600,1165,806]],["BL_616.1",616,[260,379,1167,134]]]'>The cash book is called by the plaintiffs’ counsel the defendant’s cash book. It is true he made entries in it of such transactions as came under his own notice, but it is also true, and is reported as a fact found by the referee, that entries were made therein both by Ruhl and by the counsel for the trustees. It seems to us, from all the evidence, not to have been, properly speaking, the defendant’s book, but the cash book of the estate, in which collections were entered by whoever made them. Had the trustees done their duty and exercised some personal supervision, or had the accounts and books been kept by an accountant employed by them, or at least periodically examined by such a person, Ruhl’s defalcations would have been discovered long before. It is very hard on the defendant, who appears to have had little knowledge of accounts, to charge him with Ruhl’s defalcations, simply because the sums misappropriated by Ruhl were entered by Ruhl or some one else on the cash book of the <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>estate, and to argue that he ought, on that account, to have had constructive notice of Ruhl’s misconduct and be made responsible for it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AXPX" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[256,532,1170,908]]]'>Waiving the technical objection that such a state of facts does not by any means sustain the claim made against the defendant by the plaintiffs in their statement filed for money had and received by him, it appears to us that/ considering the fact that Ruhl was not the defendant’s agent, but the agent of the trustees who appointed him, and that the defendant was not the general agent of the estate, but only a clerk employed to collect its dues, — the general management of the estate remaining in the hands of the trustees, — it would be unjust, under the circumstances developed by the evidence in this case, to add to the heavy liability already properly imposed upon the defendant, a further responsibility for the misconduct of his fellow-employee, for whose acts he ought not to be held responsible. We think, therefore, that the referee’s report should be corrected in this respect, and that the sum which represents the amount embezzled by Ruhl should be deducted from the amount with which the defendant is charged by the referee, together with any interest charged thereon.</p>
