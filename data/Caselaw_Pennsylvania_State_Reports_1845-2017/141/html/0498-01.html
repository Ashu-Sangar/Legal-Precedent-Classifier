Indeed, no object is apparent for issuing the scire facias upon the mortgage, except to create a plausible pretext for a charge of attorneys’ commissions. Under the statement furnished by the plaintiff company to tbe defendants, on August 80th, the latter were entitled, under any fair and reasonable construction thereof, to pay tbe money at any time on or before September 11th. The issuing of a scire facias between, those dates, so far as we can gather from the record, was unnecessary, as well as a breach of faitb.
