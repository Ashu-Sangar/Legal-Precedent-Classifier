      <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>On June 22, 1889, the petition of citizens praying for the division of the borough of Lansford into wards, under the provisions of the act of May 14, 1874, P. L. 159, and its supplements, was presented, whereupon three persons were appointed commissioners to inquire as to the propriety of such division and to make report, etc. On October 21, 1889, two of the commissioners filed a report recommending a division of said borough into three wards; confirmed nisi. This report set out that the three commissioners met at the borough council chamber, in said borough, on Saturday, September 21, 1889, at 10 o’clock A. M., “and, after all were severally sworn, proceeded to examine the territory of said borough and hear the testimony of parties interested, and then adjourned to meet at Mauch Chunk, Pa., on the 28th day of September, 1889, at five o’clock p. m., at which time all the commissioners, being present, heard further testimony from the parties interested, and then adjourned to meet at Mauch Chunk on Saturday, the 12th day of October, 1889, at one o’clock P. M. After hearing all the testimony and giving the matter due consideration, we have concluded that it would suit the convenience of the citizens to have the said borough of Lansford divided into three wards, and are of the opinion that the prayer of the petitioners should be granted.</p>

The report should certify specifically what notice was given, so that it may appear on the face of the proceeding that the order of the court has been complied with. The powers conferred by the act are of a public and an important character, and all parties interested ought to have an opportunity to be heard, and such opportunity can be best obtained by an adequate notice so given as to reach most effectively the various parties to be affected.” In that case, the report failed to show what the notice was and how it was given.</p>

If there were no doubts surrounding the regularity of the proceedings, particularly, that there was no posted notice of the adjournment of the commissioners from Lansford to Mauch Chunk, a distance of some nine miles, where additional evidence was heard by them, I would not feel disposed to disturb the majority report, but, under all the circumstances, I would favor a review^ The associate judges, however, differ from me, and think that, as the defective draft may be perfected by referring the report back to the commissioners to make and return a complete draft, the report will be relegated to the commissioners for that sole purpose.</p>

The presumption is that the adjournment was public, and that the appellent had notice of it. A public adjournment is sufficient notice of the adjourned meeting: Peach Bottom Tp.
