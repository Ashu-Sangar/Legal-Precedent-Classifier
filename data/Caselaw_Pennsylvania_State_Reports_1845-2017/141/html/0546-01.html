There was testimony showing the noise and stench coming from the defendants’ stable, the noise and vibrations and dust proceeding from the cleaning of carpets on the second floor, and the noise from the escaping stream on the tliird floor. Among other witnesses, the plaintiff’s wife testified as follows :</p>

I am annoyed very much. It comes through our windows, closed or not, very often. It’s only about a week ago I was sweeping the parlor, when the dust came right in, — it just runs and comes down with volumes of dirt; it flies about when they are cleaning the carpet, comes out like smoke — just like fire, both front and back. I have to keep both of my windows closed..... The moths are terrible ; I never saw anything so terrible; everything is eaten up by the moths. I had to take all my carpets up this fall, and they have not' been laid a year; they were new carpets, but on account of the moths I had to take them up..... It goes out the front of Cravens’ just as bad as it does in the back, if not worse; it pours out. It conies out front because they have the doors open — a big sliding door that is open; when they open the machine to examine the carpet, there is a slapping, and while they are doing that, the dust seems to sift through the house each side..... If I don’t get it front, I get it back. You can see it coming out of the stack; sprinkles down like little fine rain.”</p>

    <p id="b573-7" data-blocks='[["BL_573.8",573,[201,966,1192,869]]]'>The evidence fully justified the finding of the master that defendants’ stable and carpet-cleaning establishment were nuisances. While such establishments are not necessarily nuisances, or nuisances per se, they may become so by reason of their location, and the manner in which the business is conducted. It is necessary to have carpets cleaned, and this involves a place where such work may be done; but care should be exercised to locate such establishments where they will cause the least annoyance to others. In this case, the defendants selected a neighborhood devoted to private residences, and immediately adjoining the complainant’s house. The natural result followed,” and his home was rendered uncomfortable by the dust and moths from the carpets in the process of cleaning. This was not an imaginary grievance; it was a reality ; a nuisance of a very <em>serious </em>character. Nor was the stable less so, by reason of its location. The appellants might have avoided this difficulty by selecting a different neighborhood for their operations.</p>
