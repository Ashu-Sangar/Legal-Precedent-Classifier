Accordingly, the plaintiff went with Creary to Henry Jory, one of the defendants, and demanded a conveyance under the terms of the contract. Mr. <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>Jory replied, that the defendants refused to convey. At the time of this refusal, the defendants had entered into a contract to sell the property to one Miller for $80,000, and a short time afterward executed a conveyance to Miller for that amount as a consideration.

The plaintiff, having found a purchaser, in the person of one D. B. Creary, demanded a conveyance to Mr. Creary, which was refused. The price agreed to be paid by Mr. Creary was far in excess of the $60,000. Upon the refusal of the defendants to convey, the present suit was instituted to recover, not compensation for the plaintiff’s services in affecting the sale, but damages for the loss of <em>“ </em>the gains and profits which the plaintiff might and would otherwise have made and acquired, if the said defendants had performed their contract, amounting to $30,000.” A verdict was directed for the defendants.</p>

Does the contract in suit come up to this requirement? We think not. True, the defendants agree to sell, but such an agreement without a corresponding agreement, either express or implied, to buy, would be void for want of mutuality. There is no express agreement to buy, and we are not permitted to imply one, because the plaintiff expressly <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>agrees to do something else; that is, “ to use his best efforts to sell.”</p>

Perhaps the idea of treating the agreement in question as a contract of sale, would never have suggested itself but for the clause obligating the defendants to convey the real estate to the plaintiff if desired. But that clause is entirely consistent with the theory which we consider the true one, that the only effect of the agreement was to constitute the plaintiff the defendant’s agent; for a purchaser, when found, might not care to appear as such, or ho might prefer to take title through the plaintiff to obtain the benefit of his covenants.</p>

It was something more than an authority to sell. It was an option, by means of which the owners of the land were bound to convey the property to the plaintiff or his appointee at the price agreed upon, whenever called upon to do so; in the meantime, the appellees were to remain in possession. The plaintiff did not exercise his option for about four years, and not until the appellees had an offer for the property at a largely increased price. He then called upon one of the appellees, and demanded a conveyance to one Creary, as his appointee. But neither the plaintiff nor his appointee made a tender of the money, and for anything that appears, neither of them had the money to pay for the property.
