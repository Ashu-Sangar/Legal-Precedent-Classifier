    <p class="summary" id="b154-10" data-blocks='[["BL_154.11",154,[287,1058,1174,811]]]'>The goods in controversy originally belonged to J. R. Uberroth. To show title in himself, the plaintiff gave in evidence a judgment and execution in his own favor against Uberroth, which was followed by proof of a sheriff’s sale of the goods under the execution, and of their purchase by the plaintiff. He then rested his case. The theory of the defendant was that plaintiff’s judgment had been confessed for more than was due, and that it was the result of a conspiracy between the plaintiff and Uberroth to defraud the latter’s creditors. In the hope of establishing the truth of this theory, the defendant placed Uberroth on the stand as a witness, and subjected him to a rigid cross-examination. Some suspicious ' circumstances were developed, but in spite of them the witness emphatically denied that the judgment was confessed for more than was due, and gave figures to show that it was confessed for really less than was due. He also denied the charge of conspiracy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b154-11" data-blocks='[["BL_154.12",154,[289,1876,1174,554]],["BL_155.1",155,[196,381,1173,445]]]'>It will thus be seen that the testimony of Uberroth, instead of helping, was exceedingly damaging to the defendant’s theory. The defendant then offered to prove declarations by Uberroth inconsistent with his statements on the witness stand; the offer was objected to and the objection sustained. Several of the reasons for a new trial are directed against this ruling, but we think the ruling was correct. We did commit error, but that was against the plaintiff, by allowing the defendant, under objection, to cross-examine Uberroth, as being “ a person whose interest was adverse” to the defendant, within the seventh section of the act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, relating to the <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>competency of witnesses. He had no interest: Sheetz v. Hanbest, <a href="/pa/81/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="81 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1044147" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0100-01">81 Pa. 100</a>. When, therefore, the defendant called him as a witness, he called him the same as any other witness having no interest and with the same legal consequences. One of these consequences was that the defendant might not contradict him. The reason for this is, that by calling Uberroth as a witness, the defendant avouched his credibility and is es-topped from averring the contrary: Stockton v. Demuth, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%2039" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 W. 39">7 W. 39</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b155-4" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[200,846,1170,606]]]'>If the suspicious circumstances testified to by Uberroth stood out alone, they might furnish sufficient evidence of collusion to open the door for the admission of his declarations, but they do not stand alone. Uberroth’s attention was called to them more than once, but he persisted in saying that notwithstanding appearances to the contrary the transaction was honest. The defendant cannot escape from this. He will not be heard to assert that so much of Uberroth’s testimony as tells against the plaintiff is true, and that what tells in his favor is false. “ It would give a party an unjust advantage to let him pick out particular parts of a witness’s testimony and reject the rest: ” Seip v. Storch, <a href="/pa/52/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="52 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="1002239" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0211-01">52 Pa. 211</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.6",155,[201,1462,1168,709]]]'>After the close of the defendant’s testimony, the plaintiff went upon the witness stand and swore substantially to the same state of facts as Uberroth had done. There were no other witnesses of any importance. The case then stood in this way: The title of the plaintiff being “ honest and lawful on its face, must be treated as such until it is shown to be otherwise by evidence of some kind, either positive or circumstantial: ” Kaine v. Weigley, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Pa.%20183" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="22 Pa. 183">22 Pa. 183</a>. There is no such evidence here. On the contrary, the defendant’s only witness, examined on the subject, affirmed that the title is honest, and his testimony is unimpeached and uncontradicted. Conceding that the burden had been shifted to the plaintiff to prove full consideration, the defendant having relieved him of that duty, there was nothing further for him to do.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.7",155,[199,2179,1170,250]],["BL_156.1",156,[271,379,1171,500]]]'>On the foregoing facts we directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and notwithstanding the ingenious argument of the learned counsel for the defendant, we fail to see how we could have done otherwise without committing plain error: Cover v. Manaway, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20Pa.%20346" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="115 Pa. 346">115 Pa. 346</a>. “ Fraud is not to be presumed without <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>proof, nor upon proof which is slight; it must be established upon satisfactorjj- evidence; it must be sufficiently explicit in its character to fairly rebut the presumption” of innocence: Idem, 345. There is this to be said in favor of Mr. Uberroth’s testimony. He was called to prove himself a conspirator. Had he been a conspirator in fact, he might have declined to answer the questions put to him. Instead of claiming his privilege, which would have left the defendant virtually without any evidence, he voluntarily subjected himself to a searching examination, with the result above mentioned.</p>

    <p class="author" id="Ava" data-blocks='[["BL_157.6",157,[409,536,561,34]]]'>Me. Chief Justice Paxson :</p>
    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.7",157,[175,588,1160,196]]]'>This case was heard at the last term in the Eastern District, and the judgment affirmed. A re-argument was granted, and it was heard again at the present term. We are not convinced that our former judgment was erroneous.</p>
    <p id="b157-6" data-blocks='[["BL_157.8",157,[168,792,1165,806]]]'>The case below was a feigned issue to try the validity of a judgment confessed by J. B. Uberroth in favor of Eugene P. Unangst, for $7,000. The allegation of the appellant was that the judgment had been given to hinder and delay the creditors of Uberroth. Upon the trial below, the defendant called the latter as a witness as upon cross-examination, and he was asked as to a conversation with a person named Van Court. The court excluded the evidence, and this forms the subject of the second assignment of error. The questions were objected to as incompetent, irrelevant, and res inter alios acta. We think the objection well taken. Granted, for the sake of the argument, that Uberroth was a knave, and that his purpose was to cheat his creditors, his declarations would not be evidence to defeat the judgment he had given to Unangst, without previous proof that the latter was a party to the fraud. There was no such proof in the case.</p>
    <p id="b157-7" data-blocks='[["BL_157.9",157,[163,1606,1162,194]]]'>Nor was the defendant entitled to examine Uberroth as upon cross-examination. He was not a party to the issue, and was a competent witness. Moreover, he was testifying against his interest, in a legal sense.</p>
    <p id="b157-8" data-blocks='[["BL_157.10",157,[156,1810,1167,550]]]'>We do not think the court erred in excluding the testimony referred to in the third assignment. It rests upon the same principle as the testimony of Uberroth, above referred to. It consisted entirely, of his declarations, not made in the presence of the plaintiff. Prom the bill of exceptions we learn: “ This question is offered as a declaration of Mr. Uberroth, who is alleged to have been in collusion with the plaintiff, for the purpose of defrauding Mr. Uberroth’s creditors.” Unfortunately for the offer, it was a mere allegation, wholly unsupported by proof that the plaintiff was in collusion with Uberroth for the purpose of cheating the creditors of the latter.</p>
    <p id="b157-9" data-blocks='[["BL_157.11",157,[201,2369,1120,42]],["BL_158.1",158,[300,402,1166,908]]]'>The first assignment alleges that the court erred in affirm<a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>ing the plaintiff’s third point; the fourth assignment, that the court erred in not affirming the defendant’s point. The effect of both rulings was the same, to withdraw the case from the jury in favor of the plaintiff. In this the court was clearly right. There was not a scintilla of evidence to show any fraud on the part of the plaintiff. The defendant obtained this issue for the purpose of showing that the judgment was fraudulent. The plaintiff had a right to rest upon his judgment until the fraud was shown, a fraud to which he was a party. He did not rest upon it, however. He proceeded to show the consideration. He testified that the whole amount was for borrowed money, or indorsements for which he was liable. The defendant then called Uberroth, and he sustained the plaintiff’s testimony. This is all the evidence there was of any importance. The defendant’s case had failed; there was nothing to impeach the judgment, and the learned judge could not have done otherwise than give a binding instruction in favor of the plaintiff. The judgment heretofore entered must stand.</p>
