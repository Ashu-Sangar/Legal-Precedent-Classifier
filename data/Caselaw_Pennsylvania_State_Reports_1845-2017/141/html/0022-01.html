Defendant is the surviving partner of a heretofore-existing copartnership consisting of F. C. Dininny and N. Cow-an, and doing business under the name of Dininny &amp; Cowan, and also under the name of the Butler Colliery Company. In August, 1879, a lease, perpetual until all the coal was taken out, for the coal under plaintiffs’ tract of land, was made and entered into between plaintiffs of one part and W. W. Watkins and D. Williams, copartners, trading as Watkins &amp; Williams, of the other part, by the terms of which WTatkins &amp; Williams were to mine the said coal and pay plaintiffs thirty cents per ton therefor. Watkins &amp; Williams mined some coal under this lease.</p>

In March, 1883, the breaker on plaintiffs’ land, which was being operated by Watkins &amp; Williams, was destroyed by fire, and Watkins and Williams ceased all operations under their lease, and both entered the employ of Dininny &amp; Cowan. Conferences were then had between plaintiffs and Dininny &amp; Cowan, concerning a new lease to Dininny &amp; Cowan for the whole property. Pending the execution of a new lease, Dininny &amp; Cowan, with the permission of the plaintiffs and of Watkins &amp; Williams, mined coal from the whole property according to the terms of the Watkins &amp; Williams lease, only varied in that Dininny &amp; Cowan were to mine 20,000 tons of coal per year from the property. By the Watkins &amp; Williams lease there was either no stipulated amount to be mined, or such stipulated amount was less than 20,000 tons per annum.] 4</p>

The first month, a check or draft was sent by Dininny &amp; Cowan direct to plaintiffs, payable to plaintiffs’ order, but at plaintiffs’ request this was changed so as to be payable to Watkins &amp; Williams; and, thereafter, all checks or drafts were drawn payable to Watkins &amp; Williams, but sent direct to plaintiffs, who procured the indorsement of Watkins &amp; Williams to be placed upon such checks and drafts.</p>
