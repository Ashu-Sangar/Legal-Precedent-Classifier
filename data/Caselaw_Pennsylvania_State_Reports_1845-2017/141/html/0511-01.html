Deponent paid the sum of two hundred dollars, but did not receive the eight shares of stock. Instead thereof, a meeting was called at the instance of the promoters, and the stockholders informed that it was the intention of the company to establish at once offices in New York and Chicago, and for this purpose it was necessary to increase the stock subscriptions; and if additional stock was subscribed, offices would be immediately established in New York and Chicago. This was about June, 1889. Upon the faith of these representations, deponent was induced to sign the paper, subscribing for fifty shares of stock in said company. And deponent further says that no offices have been established in New York <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>or Chicago, nor any of the conditions performed upon which he was induced to sign.

All of which deponent will prove in the trial of the cause.”</p>
