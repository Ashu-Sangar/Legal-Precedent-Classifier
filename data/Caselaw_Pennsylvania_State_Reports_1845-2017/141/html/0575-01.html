They are called partnership associations, limited, in the statute authorizing their formation, the act of June 2, 1874, P. L. 271. Mr. Brightly in his Digest, designates them as joint-stock companies. Chief Justice Mebcub, in the case of Oak Ridge Coal Co. v. Rogers, <a href="/pa/108/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="108 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="539251" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0147-01">108 Pa. 147</a>, says it may hot be improper to call such an association a quasi corporation; and Justice Williams, in Hill v. Stetler, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20Pa.%20161" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="127 Pa. 161">127 Pa. 161</a>, calls them joint-stock associations, having some of the characteristics of a partnership and some of a corporation. When properly formed, the promoters cease to act as individuals or partners, but through and in the name and upon the credit of the “ joint-stock association.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[264,1201,1172,957]]]'>We now have in this state, partnerships pure and simple, in which each partner is liable for all the indebtedness of the firm; special partnerships under the act of March 21,1836, P. L. 143, having general partners with unlimited liability, and special partners with limited liability; partnership associations, limited, composed of members, unincorporated associations, also composed of members for beneficial purposes; and corporations composed of stockholders. The points of similarity between partnership associations, limited, and corporations, are that both are permitted to have and attest some of their acts by a seal; are governed by managers or directors; may sue and be sued by their association or corporation name; and the members or stockholders are not liable individually for the debts of the concern as general partners are. The chief point of difference between them is that, while a corporation cannot refuse to permit-a transfer on its books of shares of its stock to any purchaser thereof, a partnership association, limited, can except according to its rules: § 4, act of June 2, 1874, P.

L. 3, and the right to sue and be sued in their association name, by §3, act of May 1, 1876, P. L. 89. This last cited act removed all the objections which were urged in argument <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>against a partner suing the partnership association, limited, of which he is a member, or suing himself, as it is said. But after all, that objection is more technical than substantial. A member of two firms may appear in an action between them, as plaintiff and defendant: Act of April 14, 1888, P. L, 457. So a husband, joined with his wife in her suit (prior to the Married Persons’ Property Act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332), could sue a firm of which ho is a member, thus making a suit by a partner against his copartners, and by a wife against her husband : Freiler v. Kear, <a href="/pa/126/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="126 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="968863" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0470-01">126 Pa. 470</a>. The reason is that a firm, partnership, or association is one entity, and each partner or member is another entity. Suits by individual members of unincorporated beneficial associations against the officers and members thereof, are numerous and frequent, although the individual liability of the members was abolished by the act of April 28, 1876, P. L. 53, and the funds of the association alone made liable for the benefits.</p>

The plaintiff sues, not as a partner for dividends or profits, but as a creditor for a debt due by the association, just as he can sue a corporation in which he is a stockholder. If suits such as this will enable one partner to sell out the concern, so will suits by a stranger.</p>
