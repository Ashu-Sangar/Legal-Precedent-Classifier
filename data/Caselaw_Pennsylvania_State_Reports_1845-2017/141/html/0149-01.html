In the case at bar, the pleadings, instead of performing this function, have proved actually misleading, not only to the confusion of counsel, but to the embarrassment of the court, both in its rulings on points of evidence and in making up its judgment. The action is based on § 1, act of April 20, 1869, P. L. 78, taken in connection with § 1, act of March 28, 1876, P. L. 8, in relation to the placing of insane persons in a hospital for the insane, on the certificate of two or more reputable physicians. The summons is in case, but the declaration is in trespass and contains two counts. The first count charges the defendants, as graduated physicians, with having falsely and negligently certified that they had made a personal examination of the plaintiff within one week from the date of certificate and that they believed him to be insane and a proper patient for an insane asylum, and that “ upon said certificate and by virtue thereof ” they caused the plaintiff to be arrested and placed in the State Hospital for the Insane at Danville.</p>

It does not appear how the making of a false certificate, in this case, affected the personal liberty of the plaintiff. The declaration discloses nothing which shows that the loss of liberty was the necessary consequence of the wrongful act imputed to the defendants. There is no averment that the defendants unlawfully caused or procured the arrest of the plaintiff. They could not have caused the arrest by the mere making of a false certificate. The certificate was not an order for her arrest, nor did it cot&gt; tain any request to any other person to deprive her of her liberty. The person upon whose petition she was admitted to the asylum might have made use of this certificate to effectuate his purpose, but the certificate of all the doctors in the land would not of themselves have restrained her freedom in the slightest degree.”</p>

This count is correct in form, but unfortunately for the plaintiff there is not a tittle of evidence to support it. Indeed, it is not protended that the defendants had anything to do with the arrest and subsequent ill-treatment of the plaintiff, outside of the simple act of signing the certificate. That this is not enough to support a count in trespass, is plainly indicated by the reasoning of the court in Force v.

It is not that a. medical man is bound to form a right judgment, so as to be liable to an action if he does not. There are cases of insanity which are very difficult to deal with or to understand. But what he is required to do is to make an examination, and if it be nécessary, to make such inquiries as may be required.

One can hardly say precisely what that degree of care may be. It is said that one man may be satisfied with a quicker examination than another. We, for instance, would take a long time, before we should be able to form a judgment in a matter of this kind. A person experienced in such matters might decide more quickly, while an ordinary medical practitioner might require a longer time.

Semple appears, are as a rule accessible only to persons living in the neighborhood of large libraries, and because careful and extended search has disclosed no other reported case in which the civil liability of physicians for consequential injuries, in cases like the present, is ruled upon or even discussed. And here let me say, that the criticisms of the pleadings made in a former part of this opinion were not made in a spirit of fault finding. On the contrary, I cheerfully certify to the care and conspicuous ability exhibited by the learned counsel on both sides during this entire trial. The mistakes in the pleadings were very natural ones. In Force v. Probasco, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20N.J.L.%20539" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="48 N.J.L. 539">supra,</a> the form of action was trespass, and even in Hall v.

I shall have to find that the certificate is false, in so far as it certifies that at its date the plaintiff was insane. The evidence is somewhat conflicting on that point, but the weight of the evidence seems to be with the plaintiff. 1 cannot find, however, that the defendants did not make a personal examination of the plaintiff. The presumption is that the certificate speaks the truth in this <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>particular, and this presumption must stand until overcome by proof to the contrary. It is not pretended that Dr. Shull did not make the examination, nor is there any evidence that Dr. LeBar did not. On the contrary, he positively testifies that he did make it, and explained how and when. It is true, he did not visit the plaintiff for that purpose, but the act of assembly does not require that; wherein it differs from the act 9 Geo. IV., c. 41, § 80, which requires a certificate that the physicians both “visited and personally examined” the patient.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b180-4" data-blocks='[["BL_180.5",180,[260,844,1176,1115]]]'>We come, now, to the main question in the case; that is, whether or not the certificate was the result of negligence on the part of the defendants. Here again the burden is on the plaintiff, the presumption being that the defendants did their duty. Nor is the burden shifted by the mere fact that the certificate as to the insanity is false, as that is consistent with an honest mistake of judgment after the most careful examination and inquiries. Moreover, the certificate was a privileged communication ; and where a communication is privileged, plaintiff must show not only that it was not true, but that the defendants had no reasonable grounds to believe that it was true: Briggs v. Garrett, <a href="/citations/?q=111%20Pa.%20415" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="111 Pa. 415">111 Pa. 415</a>. No attempt was made to show that Dr. Shull had been derelict in his duty, so that he at least must stand acquitted of any negligence. As to Dr. LeBar, we have seen that he made a personal examination of the plaintiff. He had known the plaintiff intimately for many years, and met him frequently down to the date of the certificate. At these meetings, during the week prior to the date of the certificate and after his attention had been called to the subject, he observed the plaintiff’s appearance, manner and conversation. This I think was a compliance with the requirement of the act of assembly, as far as the examination was concerned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.6",180,[258,1968,1176,451]],["BL_181.1",181,[201,370,1174,609]]]'>Moreover, as bearing on the question of probable cause, there was insanity in plaintiff’s family, and Dr. LeBar knew that fact. He also knew that the plaintiff himself had been twice before in an insane asylum, the second time in 1874, when he was unquestionably insane, and Dr. LeBar was one of the certifying physicians to his insanity. Dr. Shull, to whom no negligence is imputed, was the first to sign the certificate in controversy. Dr. LeBar signed it at the request of the plaintiff’s father, whose motives are not impugned, although an at<a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>tempt was made to show that he did not understand his son. There is absolutely nothing in the evidence to show negligence on the part of Dr. LeBar, beyond the solitary fact that as to the insanity of the plaintiff the certificate was false. Thus differs the case at bar from Hall v. Semple, where there was also a personal examination, but the defendant expressed himself as unable from this examination to say whether the plaintiff was sane or not, and yet without any further examination and without injury from others, he signed a certificate that the plaintiff was insane. In conclusion, I think that the plaintiff has entirely failed to show negligence or want of probable cause on the part of either of the defendants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b181-4" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[203,988,1174,299]]]'>It is made the duty of the court where, as here, the cause is tried by the court without a jury, to make a finding of the ultimate facts on which the law must determine the rights of the parties, separately and distinctly from the rest of the decision. In obedience to this requirement, somewhat at the expense of repetition, I find the following facts :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.6",181,[203,1296,1174,341]]]'>1. On the twenty-first day of November, A. D. 1876, the defendants, two reputable physicians of this county, signed a certificate in which they certified that they had, within one week prior to the date of the certificate, made a personal examination of the plaintiff, and that they believed him to be insane and a proper patient to be sent to the State Hospital for the Insane at Danville.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b181-6" data-blocks='[["BL_181.7",181,[205,1657,1173,236]]]'>2. On the same day, the father of the plaintiff, armed with the foregoing certificate, caused the plaintiff to be arrested and placed in said hospital, where he was detained for the period of one month. Neither of the defendants advised or assisted in said arrest or confinement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b181-7" data-blocks='[["BL_181.8",181,[205,1913,1173,248]]]'>3. As stated in the certificate, both of the defendants personally examined the plaintiff within one week prior to the date of the certificate, but the plaintiff was not at that date insane or a proper patient for an insane asylum. The certificate of insanity was not given negligently.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b181-8" data-blocks='[["BL_181.9",181,[206,2170,1173,248]],["BL_182.1",182,[247,376,1176,146]]]'>4. In May last, Dr. Shull, one of the defendants, confessed judgment in this suit to the plaintiff for $500, with the understanding that the plaintiff should satisfy the judgment without the payment of any money by Dr. Shull, and it was so satisfied. Subsequently the judgment was opened by the court on the <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>petition of the plaintiff and with Dr. Shull’s consent. In consideration of this consent, the plaintiff agreed to enter a nonsuit as to Dr. Shull in the present action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b182-4" data-blocks='[["BL_182.5",182,[246,528,1177,99]]]'>And now November 8,1890, the decision of the court is, that judgment should be entered in favor of the defendants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b182-5" data-blocks='[["BL_182.6",182,[245,633,1180,404]]]'>—On December 4, 1890, the plaintiff filed fourteen exceptions to the findings of fact, and thirty-two exceptions to the conclusions of law in the foregoing decision. After argument, the court, Schuyler, P. J., entered an order dismissing all the exceptions and directing judgment to be entered in favor of the defendants. Thereupon the plaintiff took this appeal, filing twenty-five assignments, specifying the dismissal of certain of the plaintiff’s exceptions to the decision, for error.</p>

But upon the other question, the negligence, he found against the plaintiff. He very properly held that no presumption of negligence arose from the mere fact that the defendants were mistaken as to the fact of insanity. He further found that they had made an examination of the plaintiff, and that the onus of showing negligence was upon him. The most the case discloses is an error of judgment, to which the most careful and skilful physician is liable in a mysterious disease like insanity. We do not think it necessary to discuss the numerous assignments of error. None of them is sustained.</p>
