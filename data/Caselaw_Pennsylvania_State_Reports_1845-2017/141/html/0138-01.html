This, however, is not important, as the evidence clearly shows the construction placed upon the contract by the parties themselves. The plaintiff’s family were provided with food by the defendants, and his horses with fodder, until this difficulty commenced. We may safely assume that this was what they understood the contract to mean. We are spared any discussion of this question, by the fact that if the ruling of the court, as set forth in the fifteenth assignment, was erroneous, it did the defendants no harm. The jury evidently found for the plaintiff only the amount of the year’s wages, excluding therefrom the claim for board for the plaintiff’s family and the keep of his horses.</p>
