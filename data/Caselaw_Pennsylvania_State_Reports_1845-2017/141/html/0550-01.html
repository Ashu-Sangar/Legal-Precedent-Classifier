In cases of claims against corporations for outlays and services to the preliminary organization, the services must be rendered at the instance and request of a majority of the promoters; a minority cannot bind the organization: Bell’s Gap R.

Here the services were rendered at the request of only one person. The contract to be ratified must be one within the scope of the business of the corporation; for it can no more ratify an illegal act than it can do such an act in the first instance: Supervisors v. Schenck, <a href="/us/72/0772-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Wall. 772" data-case-ids="3459654" data-case-paths="/us/72/0772-01">supra.</a> It is very doubtful whether a bank can ratify a contract of its promoters to pay for obtaining subscribers to its capital stock: Taylor on Corp., § 86. <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>If the value of such services is to be settled by a jury, the capital of the bank might be impaired at the outset. But, if it could ratify such a contract, the proof of ratification must be more positive than was offered in this case. Mere silence of the board of directors, or failure to object when the claim was mentioned, is not such an act of ratification as will bind the bank.</p>
