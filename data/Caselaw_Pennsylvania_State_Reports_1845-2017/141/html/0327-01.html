Fourth Avenue intersects Main street, and as I understand it, passes along the southern line of these 200 feet. The 140 feet left after this street had been dedicated, which street was 60 feet wide, belonging to the Whitaker estate, all lay south of this avenue. This was the condition of things when the borough dedicated this street to the use of the public; and, in the opinion of the court, you will consider the condition, or you will consider Mr. Whitaker’s rights as of that time. It is intimated here that he is entitled to be paid for the ground occupied by this street, inasmuch as he owns no other ground appurtenant to the street. It is undoubtedly a principle of law that where a gentleman is the owner of a lot of groxmd in a town like Phoenixville, say 60 feet in width facing on a principal street, and, by reason of the opening of a cross street, the borough thinks it its duty to the public to take that whole lot thus belonging to the gentleman, as you will see his lot is blotted out; there are no advantages to be computed, he has nothing left; they have dedicated to the public all the ground that he owned, and he is entitled to be paid for that ground just what it is worth. You will see that there cannot be any advantages estimated in such a case. But, in the opinion of the court, that is not the principle applicable to this case. At the time this street was dedicated to the public, Mr. Whitaker was the owner of 200 feet of land adjoining and appurtenant to the street thus laid out by the borough; and you are to take into consideration whether or not this street, thus dedicated to the public, has been of any advantage to him so far as the 200 feet are concerned, or, in other words, so far as the remaining 140 feet may be concerned.

The advantages accruing to the lot owned by the plaintiff, situated on Main Street and separated from said Fourth Avenue by 98 feet, cannot be taken into consideration; regard is only to be had to the tract of land through which Fourth Avenue runs, and not to the person of the owner.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[263,743,1179,452]]]'>Answer: That would be true and correct, if, in the estimation of the court it was applicable to this case; that is, you could only take into consideration and assess the damages for properties abutting on Fourth Avenue. But, as you see, in the estimation of the court we regard Mr. Whitaker’s property as all abutting on Fourth Avenue, the 140 feet, and not exclusive of the balance, I think it is some 47 feet, that is left.

The petition of the borough, to have damages assessed for opening Fourth Avenue, was presented in August, 1889. In the meantime, in July, 1888, Mr. Whitaker, the plaintiff, sold to Miss Caswell two lots, measuring together on Main street ninety-three feet, and extending along Fourth Avenue the whole depth of the lot. At the time, therefore, the proceedings to open were commenced, the plaintiff owned only the ground which was actually covered by the street, along the line of the street. <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> He had no land left which abutted on the street. There is no doubt that where a person owns all the <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>ground which the street takes, he is entitled to the full value of the land taken; and there is no question of advantages and disadvantages to be considered. The only question that is raised on the present record is, at what time is the assessment to be made ? If at the time of the ordaining of the street, the case was properly tried in the court below, and the judgment should be affirmed; but if at the time of the opening or of the commencement of the proceedings to open, the case was wrongly tried, and the judgment should be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[259,833,1172,657]]]'>We did decide in Philadelphia v.

The act of 1856, under which the present proceedings are instituted, contains no such provision, and hence that case is no authority for this. But in Volkmar St., <a href="/pa/124/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="124 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="563080" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0320-01">124 Pa. 320</a>, we decided that the right of action to have damages assessed to the owner did not commence until the opening of the street or the doing of some unequivocal act by the city which indicated that the possession of the owner was about to be disturbed.

Rinek, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20Pa.%207" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="116 Pa. 7">116 Pa. 7</a>, we held that no damages were sustained until the street was opened.</p>

But does that circumstance change the rule of law as to the time at which the damages are ascertained ? We think not. The rule remains the same, and if the owner has obtained an advantage by the delay of the borough in opening the street, we see no reason why he should be deprived of the benefit of the rule on that account. It is simply an advantage which he has acquired by force of the circumstances^ At,, the time of the proceedings to open, he did, in fact, own only the land taken, for the street, and that land was not a part of any other and larger tract owned by him. It is difficult to understand upon what principle we can go back to an anterior time when he held other land in connection with this, in order to deprive him of the value of the land now taken. If we can go back one year for that purpose, there is no reason why we cannot do so <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>for live, ten, or twenty years. Yet to do this would seem strangely unreasonable, when we consider all the changes of title and improvements which may have taken place on the intervening land in the meantime.</p>
    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.5",357,[221,578,1170,1464]]]'>It is a very common occurrence in the boroughs and smaller towns of the interior of the state, that streets are plotted upon duly authorized maps and formally adopted by the authorities, upon adjacent farm lands lying within the municipal limits, many years before they are opened. The damages for opening these streets cannot be asessed until the land covered by the streets is actually taken. If an owner still continues to own adjoining land, he, of course, must submit to the application of the doctrine that his damages for the part taken must be estimated with reference to the effect of the opening of the street upon the value of his entire holding. But if he has, in perfect good faith, years before the opening, sold off all his land except that which is taken for the street, why shall he not have the value of the land taken as the measure of his damage? We see no reason why. The time of the opening is the legal time for assessing the damage to the owner. At that time he has no land but the land taken, and he is entitled to its value. Rules of law do not shift and vary according to changing circumstances. When an owner who has no land but that which is taken, invokes the law as it is, with reference to all other citizens, he cannot be told that at some more or less remote time he owned other contiguous land, and therefore he cannot have the protection of the law as other citizens can. There cannot be two different and conflicting rules applicable to the same state of facts. Wo are of opinion that the allowance for advantages, on the ground that the land taken is part of a larger tract belonging to a common owner of the whole, cannot be made against the plaintiff, because he is not such an owner at the time his land is taken.</p>

If this difference in the character of his ownership, after the con<a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>veyance of the lot, affected the value of the remaining ground covered by the street, the plaintiff could only recover the value of that land as affected by the conveyance of the adjoining ground. The question whether the value of the ground was thus affected, and to what extent, should be left to the jury, with instructions that it is only the value of the land, subject to the right of the grantee of the adjoining lot to have a clear front on the avenue, that should be allowed as damages.</p>
