This, then, „was the mischief to be remedied by the enactment, —the want of any proceeding by which remainder-men could, during the continuance of the life-estate, have their shares defined in severalty. The providing of the means appropriate to this end was the immediate object of the act of 1835 and its only object. Nevertheless, it is claimed by plaintiff’s counsel that the phrase “ parties interested,” in the clause giving authority to institute suits for partition, is, by reason of its broad generality, indicative of a plain intent to give to any person who has an interest in the real estate, no matter, so far as possession is concerned, whether jointly and concurrently with <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>another, or exclusively and in severalty, the right to compel partition among those in remainder.</p>

That no such use of the enactment was in the view of its framers is clear from its language, which, in the enacting part, refers only to life-estates in “ part or parts ” of the property. Indeed, there can be no manner of doubt that the phrase “ parties interested ” is simply used as nomen generalissimum, to cover all such classes of persons, in respect to their estates, as were, under the existing law, in a situation to become parties to a suit for partition except for the obstacle of intervening life-estates, which obstacle this <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>statute removed; i. e., all such persons as were, legally or equitably, tenants in fee-simple, for life or for a term of years, in possession or remainder, together with others as parceners, joint tenants or tenants in common.

There is no reference, in this case, by court or counsel, to the act of 1835. The fact that it did not cover the ease seems, therefore, to have been conceded on all sides. Thereupon followed the act of June 3, 1840, P.

VIII. and the passage of the act of 1840, making or recognizing the extension of the writ to tenants of more limited estates.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b124-4" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[289,681,1179,1730]],["BL_125.1",125,[178,386,1169,300]]]'>To give to this proviso so sweeping an effect would be to carry the doctrine .of implied repeal to an unheard-of length. Granting even, contrary to the principle above stated, that the legislature of 1840 may have supposed the right to demand partition in any case to be confined to tenants in fee-simple, that would not make it so. “ An act of parliament does not alter the law by merely betraying an erroneous opinion of it: ” Maxwell on Interp. of St., 376, and cases there cited. Moreover, to give the proviso the force suggested would be in direct conflict with that canon of interpretation which declares that a proviso is to be construed (except in extraordinary cases, every feature of which is here lacking,) with reference to the immediately preceding parts of the clause to which it is attached, and as limiting only the passage to which it is appended: "Wilberforce on Stat. Law, 302; Spring v. Collector, 78 111. 101; or, at most, only the section with which it is incorporated: Lehigh Co. v. Meyer, <a href="/pa/102/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="102 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="502700" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0479-01">102 Pa. 479</a>. Whilst it would, therefore, be against reason to suppose and against principle to hold that the legislature of 3 840 intended to relegate the remedy of partition back to what it was under the statute 31 Hen. VIII., c. 1, and wipe out all the additional scope which the wisdom of intervening centuries had given it, it is altogether likely that, in extending it to cases in which the entire interest could not be represented by parties to the action (which was expressly required by the act of 1835), because there might be a limitation to persons not in esse at the issuance of the writ, it was deemed proper to confine, in such cases, the right to ask for partition to such concurrent holders of property as had an indefeasible fee-simple estate not subject to be defeated by any subsequent event. The requirement applied, therefore, only to proceedings brought under the statute which ordained it, and in cases falling within its especial purview. But it is to be observed, that, again in this statute, as in that of 1835, the necessity of the demandant and respondents having concurrent holdings <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>is clearly recognized. The requirement is that he have a fee-simple in the purpart claimed by him. A purpart is “ that part of an estate, which, having been held in common..... is by partition allotted to any ” one of the parties to it: 2 Bouv. L. D., 395. The use of the word implies a common, concurrent holding, whether in possession or remainder.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b125-6" data-blocks='[["BL_125.5",125,[181,695,1171,1786]]]'>The reason, however, whatever it may have been, which commended the restriction of the right to demand partition, under the act of 1840, to holders of fee-simple interests, to the legislature of that year, was rejected by that of 1842, which passed “ An Act to authorize the construction of a toll bridge over the river Schuylkill, at or near Windsor Haven, in Berks county, and for other purposes.” Section 9 of this act, April 5, 1842, P. L. 234, repeals so much of the act of June 3, 1840, “as declares that the defendant’s estate must be in fee-simple,” and enacts that “ proceedings in partition, in the manner and form and with the effect in said act, may be instituted by persons having legal or equitable life-estates in any real estate.” The requirement itself being limited to the cases to which the remedy was extended by the act of 1840, it necessarily follows that the repeal of that requirement has reference to none other. Nor does the succeeding affirmative declaration go any further; for it relates only to “ proceedings in partition in the manner and form and with the effect in said act ” of 1840. When the seventy-fifth section of the general road law of 1836 gave the remedy for the recovery of penalties incurred under the act “in the same manner” as debts of like amount are recovered under the act of March 20, 1810, the Supreme Court said that it thereby adopted the provisions of the latter statute for the form of the action and mode of procedure: Commonwealth v. Betts, <a href="/pa/76/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="76 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1038919" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0465-01">76 Pa. 465</a>, 471. Applying that rule here, it is obvious that the proceeding in no other case can be “in the same manner ” as that pointed out by the act of 1840, for the particular emergency there provided for. Much less, in any other case, can it have the “ same effect.” That is the very point decided in Gest v. Way, <a href="/whart/2/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="2 Whart. 445" data-case-ids="1830447" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0445-01">supra,</a> and was the reason for the passage of the act of 1840. In other words, the result of the act of 1842, § 9, is simply to destroy the limitation placed by the proviso of the act of 1840 upon the phrase “ parties interested,” and to restore to it the meaning which it had in the act of 1835, and which has already been discussed.</p>

      <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>But here again, plaintiff’s counsel contends that the plain meaning of the direction that “ proceedings in partition .... may be instituted by persons having legal or equitable life-estates in any real estate ” is to destroy, as to them, the requirement of joint or concurrent possession; to make him competent as a demandant of partition, who, by reason of his sole and exclusive possession of the whole property, has nothing to partition and no one to partition with. To countenance this claim would be, not only to ignore the manifest and single purpose of the enactment, but to strike out of it the words qualifying that direction and limiting its application to cases under the act of 1840, as well as to do violence to the essential character, design and incidents of the proceeding known as partition. As well might it be declared, that, since the act of 1842 gives the right to maintain partition to persons having legal or equitable life-estates in “ any real estate,” it is not any longer necessary that the demandant have any interest whatever in the particular property in suit, so that he be a life-tenant, legally or equitably, in <em>any </em>real estate.</p>

Of the lot in question, he cannot get more complete or exclusive possession than he has. But a conversion of it into money, to be placed at interest for him during life, would yield him a better revenue, and relieve him from the payment of taxes. If a sale were, at the same time, an advantage to those interested in remainder, there would be no need for any adversary proceedings. But the purpose of the action of partition is to divide property, not to sell it. A sale may become an incident, but is not the objective point of it. How utterly repugnant to the entire theory and practice, of our partition system this proceeding is, is apparent from the proviso to the act of February 5,1821, § 1, 7 Sm. L. 353, which gives the defendants the right to demand that their interests in the premises remain undivided, in which case the plaintiff’s purpart alone shall be set out. The effect of such a demand in a case like the present, supposing it to be otherwise maintainable, would be .to put an end to the entire proceeding, without the opportunity or possibility of judgment of any kind. True, the defendants have not made it in this case. Neither were they obliged <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>to recognize the plaintiff’s standing by making it. The very fact that a theory contended for is capable of leading to such an absurdity is decisive against it. The demurrer must be sustained.</p>

VIII., c. 32, are in force here, and were substantially the law upon this subject prior to 1835. Under those statutes the action lies in cases where there are joint tenants, or tenants in common, one or some of whom have an estate for life: Duke v. Hague, <a href="/pa/107/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="107 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="8856267" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0057-01">107 Pa. 57</a>; and a tenant by the curtesy is within the reason and spirit of the statutes, although he was neither a joint tenant nor a tenant in common: Co. Litt., Thomas’s ed., 544. However, it was considered doubtful, prior to the act of April 11, 1835, P. L. 199, whether a life-tenant could be the demandant in partition: Walker v. Dilworth, 2 Dali. 257.</p>

L. 593, have made marked changes in the law, and under them, in cases where life-estates are limited, partition may be had at the suit of “ parties interested in real estate.” These words, in their accepted legal sense, include all parties having a freehold estate: Abbott’s L. Diet., 635; 2 Bl. Com., Sharsw. ed., 14, note 1; Westervelt v. People, <a href="/wend/20/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="20 Wend. 416" data-case-ids="2150265" data-case-paths="/wend/20/0416-01">20 Wend. 416</a>. This construction, being the plain and literal meaning of the words, is the proper one : Pittsburgh v.

Under this construction, a tenant for life in sole possession could become the demandant, except when an estate is limited to persons not in being, in which instance the act of 1840 confined the remedy to the holder of an indefeasible estate. But, whatever construction be placed upon the acts of 1835 and 1840, the case at bar falls within the provisions of § 9, act of April 5, 1842, P. L. 234, which expressly authorize persons having legal or equitable life-estates to institute the action. The acts of 1835, 1840 and 1842, being in pari materia, form one act and must be construed together: Ehrenzeller v. Canal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20R.%20181" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="1 R. 181">1 R. 181</a>; and the act of 1835 expressly recognizes the case in which the tenant for life is entitled to the sole possession.</p>

In this case, the life-tenant evidences his willingness to give up the possession to the remainder-men, not only by bringing the suit, but also by his express consent. The case exemplifies the reasons which induced the legislation referred to. The premises described in the writ consist of an unimproved but valuable building lot. The defendants refuse either to take and improve it, or to allow the plaintiff the value of such improvements as he may place thereon; and, unless the law provides a remedy, it must remain unimproved during his entire life, a burden instead óf a benefit to him, and an obstruction to the growth and progress of the city. The remedy, we submit, is provided by our statutory system of partition.</p>
