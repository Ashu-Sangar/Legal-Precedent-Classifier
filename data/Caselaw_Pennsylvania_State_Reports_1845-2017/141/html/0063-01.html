S. Pierce, the defendant; that at; the time of said sale the coupons for interest due July 1, 1884, were unpaid ; that, a few days after the sale, the default of ninety days having almost expired, the plaintiff notified the defendant that after a short time necessary to complete a reorganization the interest due defendant would be paid; that the defendant replied that if plaintiff would send him a certified check for the amount of the coupons, with three months interest on the amount, before October 1st, he would send the coupons; that on October 24th, the July coupons remaining unpaid, the defendant gave notice of the ninety day default, to the trustee, who began judicial proceedings to foreclose the mortgage; that negotiations then took place to have the mortgage proceedings stayed, and, after some correspondence, the plaintiff, on December 11th, 1884, sent to the defendant a check for $1,710, to pay the July coupons and interest on the same, asking for instructions to the trustee to stay the proceedings, a final order of sale having been made on November 25th; that the defendant, acknowledging the receipt of the check on December 13th, stated that he had sent the check forward for payment, and when paid he would send the coupons canceled, or return the money, stating, also, that on January 1st the plaintiff would want to pay the coupons then due; that the plaintiff soon afterward arranged to lease the iron works to the Danville Furnace Co., and notified the defendant of that fact and of her intention to provide for the payment of the interest coupons, etc., but there was a failure to effect a stay of the proceedings, and this suit was brought to recover back the $1,710 paid, with interest.</p>

The witness put the date of this interview as in November ox December 1884. On cross-examination, the defendant offered to hand to the witness a letter from the plaintiff’s husband and agent to the defendant, dated January 9, 1885, the witness being familiar with the handwriting, for the purpose of refreshing his recollection from the contents, so as to determine whether the agreement, as to which he testified, was made in November,'December, or January. The offer was objected to, on the ground that it was not shown that the witness was present when the letter was written, authorized the writing of it, or was connected with it in any way at the time it was written.</p>

He was so examined, and we now permit the plaintiff to cross-examine him. Courts do occasionally allow witnesses to be cross-examined under such circumstances; but here it seems that he only spoke of matters from the light of papers that you put in evidence. It shows that you were not ready for cross-examining him, at the time you called him.</p>
