The testimony upon which the note in this case was allowed to be declared void, did not meet the requirements of the rule, as may be conclusively demonstrated by supposing that the testimony of the defendant and his wife, who together make but one witness, were eliminated; it will then be seen that there is nothing left beyond a conversation in the cornfield in the presence of Hartline, the substance of which was a request by the defendant’s son that the father sign an agreement for $100 and the father’s refusal to do so, and the remaining fact that a subscribing witness did not see the note signed by the defendant. The conversation in the cornfield is in no wise connected, either as to time or place, with the signing of the note; and the fact in regard to the subscribing witness has no bearing on the question of fraud in procuring the signature.

His own testimony was contradictory and was directly at variance with the theory that a larger paper had been pasted over the note, as, if this had been done, it would have been impossible for Mm to sign the note by writing his name about half way down a larger sheet of paper. Hartline’s testimony is contradicted both by the statement in the defendant’s deposition, that no one was present in the cornfield, and by his own admission that he had told other people he had heard nothing. Altogether, the testimony is so contradictory that a chancellor should have refused to submit it to the jury. The testimony as to the occurrence in the cornfield should have been rejected, as it was no part of the res geste. The testimony of Ellen Mensch was irrelevant, or, if it did tend to show the commission of a fraud by her husband, she was incompetent as a witness. And the fifth specification should be sustained. In the circumstances shown to the court, there was a presumption that the lost letter was written by the defendant’s authority.</p>

The testimony for the defendant met all the requirements of the rule relating to the measure of proof, as stated in Thomas v. Loose, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20Pa.%2085" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="114 Pa. 85">114 Pa. 85</a>. In addition to the testimony of the defendant, his wife and Hartline, there was the corroborative proof furnished by the note itself, which had upon it mucilage marks, indicating that when A. B. Mensch procured his aged and unlettered father to sign it, he attached it to a larger piece of paper, partly printed and partly written, and thus misled and deceived the defendant. The rule requiring the testimony of two witnesses, or of one with corroborating circumstances equal to that of another, is based upon the practice of chancery, which requires it to overcome a responsive answer to a bill. It is difficult to establish an unbending rule, and make it apply to every case at law in which an equitable <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>defence is set up. It may be tbat the defendant does not always furnish the requisite proof, but the plaintiff may by his testimony, or his failure or refusal to testify, supply the proof which the defendant otherwise would lack. The rule is rigidly enforced only when the testimony of the defendant is contradicted by that of the plaintiff, which is supposed to counterbalance it, leaving the evidence supplied by the written instrument unaffected: Phillips v.

It may be that in such a case as this the testimony of ' husband and wife counts as that of but one witness, but if so, the rule is in antagonism to the tendency of modern jurisprudence, in thus annihilating the wife as a witness. The cases, however, do not support such a rule. In Sower v. Weaver, <a href="/pa/78/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="78 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="1040364" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0448-01">78 Pa. 448</a>, the husband and wife did not testify to the same facts, and neither of them testified, alone, to enough distinct facts to make out the defence. It is this state of the testimony that is referred to in the remark of Mr. Justice Shabs'WOOD, as to their together amounting to “ one sufficient witness.” Bitner v. Boone, <a href="/pa/128/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="128 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="567088" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0567-01">128 Pa. 567</a>, does not bear upon the question. On the other hand, in Monroe v. Monroe, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20Pa.%20520" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="98 Pa. 520">98 Pa. 520</a>, the case was submitted to the jury on the testimony of the defendant and his wife. That case is on all fours with the one at bar, except that the proof of fraud was not so strong. Although Ellen Mensch’s name was subscribed as that of a witness to the note, she was not in fact and law a subscribing witness: Huston v. Tieknor, <a href="/pa/99/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="99 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="446067" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0231-01">99 Pa. 231</a>, and it was entirely proper to show this. It was proper, also, to show by her the absence of A. B. Mensch, so as to account for the defendant’s not calling him as a witness. The reasons given by the court for excluding proof of the contents of the letter written by Milton Mensch, fully vindicate the ruling.</p>

The answer to the rule was in these words: “ The plaintiff above named, for answer to the rule granted upon the petition of the defendant, Jacob Gf.

Throwing out of view, for the present, the question of the weight to be given to the testimony of the wife, under such circumstances, and treating the husband and wife as but a single witness, we have in addition the significant fact that the oath of the defendant is uncoutradicted. The answer, as already stated, is general, is not under oath, was not made by the plaintiffs, and does not deny a single specific allegation of fraud charged in the petition. Nor does the plaintiffs’ deposition deny the specific charges. It is not the case, therefore, of oath against oath, in which case the paper itself inclines the scale in favor of the party asserting it.

We must assume that he was satisfied with its sufficiency. We cannot say he was wrong. The question of the effect of the wife’s testimony did not arise upon the trial, as a second, independent witness was called to corroborate the defendant. The weight to be attached to his evidence was for the jury and the court below. It would inaugurate a dangerous precedent for us to say they ought not to have believed him.

In the present condition of the law of evidence, it is especially important; and we defer its decision until the question is squarely and necessarily raised, and we are aided by a further discussion. It is proper to say, however, that, in Sower v. Weaver, the husband and wife to some extent testified to independent facts necessary to sustain the defendant’s case, and that the testimony of the wife was not wholly in corroboration of the facts testified to by the husband. As to such facts, there was therefore but the testimony of a single witness, even if we regard them as two witnesses. This may have induced the remark of Justice Shabswood that, “admitting Weaver and his wife to amount together to one <em>sufficient </em>witness, where is the remaining witness, or that which is equivalent thereto ? ” It would be difficult to explain this remark <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>except upon the theory I have indicated. It will be noticed that no authority was cited by Justice Sharswood for the position assumed. The remark of our Brother Clark, in Bitner v. Boone, was based wholly upon what was said in Sower y.
