The contract was a verbal one, but Coffin at the time made a memorandum of the terms in his note book. The defendant on that day paid $500 on account of the purchase money. A map of the company’s properties, kept in their office, showed a ten-foot alley in the rear of this lot, in continuation of a similar alley at the bank lot, the right to the use of which had been conveyed to the bank by the plaintiffs along with the latter lot. In the negotiations between the defendant and Coffin, that map was not produced or referred to.</p>

Coffin thereupon went upon the ground and proceeded to mark the lines in the defendant’s presence. Upon measuring the frontage of the lot, he found that the distance between the bank’s property line and the fence of the Shaffer lot was about 51 feet. This he was unable to understand, as the iron company’s map of its properties represented the width of the lot in question to be only 50 feet. He supposed, however, that the plaintiffs had title to the entire 51 <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>feet, and proposed to the defendant that the latter take the whole at a proportionate increase of price, but the defendant said he wanted only 50 feet, and left it to Coffin to locate the 50 feet to be sold.</p>

In measuring the depth of the lot, Coffin measured off a distance of 100 feet from Main street, and then, seeing that this distance would carry the lot past the end of the bank lot, came back five feet, and marked the rear line of the defendant’s lot 95 feet from Main street.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.6",323,[225,1049,1169,911]]]'>The defendant then proceeded to erect his building. His plan was to occupy 44 feet with the double building, leaving at each side of the lot a passage way three feet in width, as a means of access from the street to the rear; and his foundation walls were located in accordance with this design. After the building had been commenced, it was discovered that the Shaffer lot extended one foot north of the fence above mentioned, and that the plaintiffs had title to only 49 feet of the ground staked off by Coffin as sold to the defendant. At this time, the foundation walls had been built. The plaintiff's endeavored to purchase the one foot of ground from the executors of Shaffer, but were unable to do so. Testimony on their behalf tended to show that they then proposed to the defendant that they would convey to him the 50 feet to which they had title, and at their expense would move his foundation walls one foot to the north, but he said he could not wait to have this done and went on with his building. The defendant denied that any offer to move the walls was made.</p>

He declined the offer and insisted that he was entitled by his contract to a conveyance of a lot with a frontage of 50 feet and bounded at the sides by the lines which had been marked by Coffin, and that if title were not conveyed to him accordingly, he would be greatly damaged by reason of the want of an alley of the contemplated width on the southern side of his building. On April 28, 1889, the plaintiffs tendered to the defendant the deed afterwards put on file in this case, and demanded payment or security for the balance of purchase money. That deed described the property conveyed thereby as having a frontage of 50 feet and a depth of 95 feet, and as bounded on the north by the bank lot and on the south by the Shaffer lot.

Yery little question, if any, can be made about this. Mr. Coffin staked off the ground, marked the centre line of the building, and the excavation for the cellar was changed to comply with the measurements of Mr. Coffin. The walls were erected according to them. At this point it was discovered that a mistake had been made in these measurements and the building had been located one foot too far south. Was <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>this a mistake made by the agent of these plaintiffs ? Had this defendant anything to do with the location of this building ? His architect did locate it, but this location was changed to correspond with the lines given by Mr. Coffin. [Has the defendant been injured by this mistake ? He proceeded to locate his building in the centre of the lot, so as to have a thrée-feet alley on each side; the lot was to be 50 feet in front, the building was to be 44 feet in front, thus allowing him six feet to be used for the two alleys, or, in other words, give him three feet for each. As the true lines were subsequently ascertained to be, he has four feet of an alley on the north and one of two feet on the south, or nine inches, according to what may be held to be the true line between this lot and the Shaffer property. The line, as conceded by Mr. Coffin, would make this alley two feet; as claimed by Mr. Shaffer it would make it only nine inches. Mr. Eyrick claims that a two-feet alley will not give him the proper access to the rear of his property and will materially affect his enjoyment of the buildings.

We say to you that in our opinion the true standard is, what would it have cost to correct the mistake at the time it was discovered and notice was given to this defendant, if it could have been then corrected ?

That the plaintiffs contracted to convey a lot, 50 by ,100 feet, bounded at the sides by certain well defined lines, is settled by the verdict. After the defendant had taken possession, the plaintiffs voluntarily interfered and established new lines.

Browarsky, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20Pa.%20379" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="130 Pa. 379">130 Pa. 379</a>. The erection of this brick building, occupying 44 feet of the lot, was an essential part of the contract of sale; and one of the chief inducements moving the defendant to make the purchase was that the lot, according to the plaintiffs’ representations, was suitable for the purpose. By the mistake of the plaintiffs’ agent in locating the lines, the southern half of the building has been seriously damaged in value, as it is without access at the side or from the rear.

The contract was made with the defendant on the first day of September, 1888, through one Armory Coffin, the chief engineer of the company. The terms of the contract are stated in a memorandum contained in the .chief engineer’s note-book, as follows: “9 — 1, 88; Mr. James R. Eyrick agrees to take the 50-foot lot on Main street, south of Farmers and Mechanics’ Bank, for the price of, $6,000; viz., $2,000 cash, and the balance on mortgage, payable at will; $500 check, and $1,500 when papers are prepared.” The hand <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>money was paid at the time to the treasurer of the company, and Mr. Eyrick shortly afterwards entered into the possession.</p>
    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[214,474,1170,910]]]'>The company actually did have a lot fifty feet in front, situate as described, and if the matter had so remained there would probably have been no difficulty. But when Coffin came, a month or more later at .Eyrick’s request, to measure and stake it off, he by mistake embraced a foot of ground on one side of the lot which did not belong to the company, and excluded a foot on the other side which did, and this gives rise to the whole controversy. The plaintiffs tendered a deed for the fifty feet they own and can convejq but the defendant demands a conveyance of the fifty feet of ground that was staked off to him, assigning as a reason that otherwise he cannot have the convenient use of one of the buildings which he has since erected. He alleges that, relying upon the location of the centre line of the lot by Coffin, he erected a three-story brick double dwelling, on each side of which he had designed a threo-foot passageway, and that, by reason of the mistake, one passageway is but two feet wide, and is inconvenient and unsuitable for the purpose intended.</p>
    <p id="b333-6" data-blocks='[["BL_333.6",333,[210,1394,1172,1014]],["BL_334.1",334,[281,442,1179,1310]]]'>The sale and the subsequent designation of the boundaries, although distinct in time, were, we think, component parts of the contract, and Eyrick had a right to insist upon a title in conformity therewith. The lot was staked off fifty feet in front, and ninety-five feet in depth. Mr. Eyrick says, in speaking of “this: “He (Coffin) measured back one hundred feet,, and he looked across, and he said that it ran beyond the bank line, and he said it was one hundred feet, more or less, and he gave me five feet less.” The lot was staked off to the same depth as the bank lot; it is not pretended that the lot was to extend farther back. The complaint is that the officers of the company told him the lot was fifty by one hundred feet, but, when it was discovered upon actual measurement that it was only ninety-five feet in depth, Eyrick made no objection; he accepted the lot according to the lines measured and staked off, and now insists that the conveyance shall be made accordingly. Nor was anything said, at or prior to this time, as to an alley in the rear. If the measurement and designation of the front line of the lot is binding upon the parties, the designation of the line in the rear is equally binding, and we can see no ground <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>for this feature of the controversy. It is true that a private map in the office of the Phoenix Iron Company shows an alley in the rear of this lot in question, but it does not appear that this or any other of the company’s lots, excepting only the bank lot, was sold with reference to this plot, and we cannot see that the defendant has any claim to the alley, or to more ground than was actually staked off to him. If he has a right to hold the company to the side lines of the lot as staked off, he is certainly bound by the lines in the front and rear, marked off and designated at the same time. He cannot play fast and loose in this respect; his claim must be consistent. If he wanted the use of an alley in the rear, he should have bargained for it, and there is no evidence whatever of any understanding or agreement to that effect. On the contrary, it appears that when a deed was tendered as a compromise, containing a grant of the alley, Eyrick treated it as of little consequence, for the reason, as he says, that “a blind alley is a nuisance.” It was not until much later, in their negotiations for settlement, that he asked them to extend the allejr in an L shape to Jackson street. The court erred in submitting to the jury any question of damages as to a deficiency in the depth of the lot. There was no evidence to justify such a submission. This part of the defendant’s claim is, in our opinion, wholly inconsistent with the only theory of the case upon which the defendant is entitled to anything by way of damages, and should have been excluded.</p>

That the mistake was an honest one, that the plaintiffs acted throughout the transaction in good faith, is beyond question; there is no proof to any other effect. There is evidence, on the contrary, tending to show that they were willing and offered to do what they could to remedy the wrong which had been done to the defendant. Upon discovery .of their mistake, they were prompt in their efforts to make amends; they tried to purchase one foot off the Shaffer lot, covering the interference; failing in this, they offered to convey the fifty feet they had title for, and to embrace the alley in the rear. There is evidence, also, that immediately after the <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>discovery of the mistake, and when they failed to get one foot off the Shaffer lot, they offered to move the walls of the building then under construction one foot nearer to the line of the bank lot, at their own expense; but this is denied. All this testimony, with that of a more direct character, bears upon the question of good faith; and, whilst there is much proof to this effect, there is none to the contrary.</p>

In McNair v. Compton, <a href="/pa/35/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="35 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="990493" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0023-01">35 Pa. 23</a>, it was held that for breach, without fraud, of a real contract in writing, the measure of damages is to be determined by the consideration that passed between the parties: whether the contract be executed or execute<a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>ry, this is the rule. If the consideration consist of services rendered, they are to be computed according to their value; if money received, it is to be returned with interest. So, also, in Hertzog v. Hertzog, <a href="/pa/34/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="34 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="417991" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0418-01">34 Pa. 418</a>, an action for the breach of a parol contract for the conveyance of land in consideration of money paid and services rendered, it was held, overruling Jack v.

To the same effect are Dumars v. Miller, <a href="/pa/34/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="34 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="417981" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0319-01">34 Pa. 319</a>; Graham v.

The damages cannot be measured either according to the value of the contract, or the increased value of the land by reason of buildings erected or improvements made. Where the eviction complained of is partial, the recovery is proportioned to the value of the part of the premises to which the title has failed. It is competent to show that the part to which the title has failed was inferior or superior in quality to the other portion conveyed, and the true measure of damages is the value of that part taken in proportion to the price of the whole, the computation being upon the basis of the consideration money: Lee v.

The plaintiffs are not able to convey but forty-nine feet of the fifty they agreed to sell. Their inability arises out of no bad faith or fraud on their part; their <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>contract, for anything that appears, was made honestly, but through mistake as to the lines of their lot. The title to the specific subject of sale is to this extent defective. The defendant, upon discovery of this defect, made no offer to rescind; on the contrary, after he knew the plaintiffs were unable to comply with their contract, he continued to pay the purchase money and to proceed with his improvements. He is entitled, therefore, merely to an allowance for the proportionate value of the one foot of ground, to be computed upon the basis of the consideration of his contract. He cannot be allowed damages for the misplacement of his building; it was his duty, before expending his money upon valuable improvements, to ascertain and know his lines, and to locate his buildings accordingly. The Phoenix Iron Company, or its trustees, are responsible, upon the footing of their contract, for the title to the lot as it was when they sold it, to the extent of the purchase money; but the defendant, upon the principle of caveat emptor, took the risk of the title as to the improvements which he put upon it. If this were not so, the vendor in very many cases would be ruined by the purchaser’s improvements. If it seem hard that a purchaser, acting in good faith, should lose his improvements, it is equally hard that a vendor, also acting in good faith, should have to pay for them: Itawle on Cov., §§ 166,168.</p>
