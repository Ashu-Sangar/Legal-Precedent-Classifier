It belonged to her, for her use, ownership, enjoyment and possession. The jury will therefore start out with that admitted fact, that the property concerning which this dispute arises, was, previous to the death of Mrs. Brown, her property. Being her property, under the act of 1848, relative to the property of married women, she could not, however, dispose of it without the consent of her husband. Although she was the owner, she could not make a gift of it to any one without the consent of her husband. The law expressly forbids a married woman giving title to her personal property unless the consent of her husband is shown.

Whatever may be the law now, since the passage of another act in 1887, this branch of the case must be tested as of the time when the alleged right of the defendant was acquired.

The pretended gift of the furniture, etc., in controversy, was not accompanied by a transfer of possession, and therefore did not pass the title. Being unexecuted by delivery, it was revoked by Mrs. Brown’s death. A gift of personal property, to be executed by delivery after death, is a bequest, and requires the formalities prescribed for a testament, to make it effectual. But, says the defendant, the attempted gift was perfected by the assent of the husband, given after the wife’s death. This is totally inconsistent with the position of the defendant in the former action. Being the sole heir of his wife, the husband, on the authority of Moyer’s App., <a href="/pa/16/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="16 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="410199" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0405-01">16 Pa. 405</a>, assumed that he could take her personal estate without administration, and therefore brought replevin for the goods; but this court held that the goods or their value could be recovered onty by an administrator. Having, then, no power to take them for himself, the husband clearly could not give them to another, and his want of power to dispose of something he did not possess, is an insurmountable obstacle in the way of the defence set up here.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b144-10" data-blocks='[["BL_144.11",144,[286,2294,1168,100]],["BL_145.1",145,[208,370,1174,866]]]'>2. Moreover, the evidence of the husband’s consent was wholly inadequate to make out a transfer of the title to prop<a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>erty. He is alleged to have said, in answer to a narration of the ineffectual undertaking of his wife to dispose of this furniture, “ All right; I am satisfied.” This vague and uncertain response was not made to his wife’s donee, but to a stranger. If any property right reposed in him, the law will not divest him of it, without clear and explicit evidence of his intention to part with it. Again ; no transfer of possession accompanied his alleged consent. We have not been able to find any decision or dictum of this court, to the effect that a man’s declaration of his purpose or consent, made to a stranger without consideration, will effect a transfer of his property to an alleged donee; but the court has had occasion to adopt the maxim of the civil law, per oxtraneam personam nihil nobis acquiri potest, holding that an acknowledgment of indebtedness made to a stranger, will not bar the statute of limitations: Kyle v. Wells, <a href="/pa/17/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="17 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="967640" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0286-01">17 Pa. 286</a>; and, a fortiori, an acknowledgment to a stranger should not work a transfer of title.</p>

The goods were actually in the custody and possession of the Niethammers at the time of the gift, and therefore no further delivery was necessary; nor was any further taking of possession required to complete the gift. The declaration of the husband, giving his consent, was not made “ to a stranger.” It was made to Nellie Niethammer, in the presence of Miss Fox. Nellie was a common recipient, with her mother, of jewelry and other articles given by Mrs. Brown at one and the same time, and was not only herself a party to the transaction, but was the daughter and more than an agent of Mrs. Niethammer. She and Miss Fox were witnesses of the very act of giving, and were present for the very purpose of telling of it and doing whatever, under the law, they could do to make it binding. Knowledge of the gift was conveyed to the plaintiff by one having a deep interest in the subject matter, and he assented to it. His delay in bringing suit for the goods was a sufficient affirmance of his intention and meaning, at the time he said, “All right; I am satisfied.” Can it be that he could revoke his assent after all parties had “settled to their interests,” and the property in question had been used and destroyed, without even notice from him of a claim to it ?</p>

The furniture was not given to him, and he is in no way connected with the transaction. How, then, can these proceedings stand against his estate ? The furniture was given to the mother, and it was really in payment of a debt that the title was transferred to her. There is no doubt that Mrs. Brown owed her mother for care and <em>nursing; </em>and, while the parent might not have been able to collect a claim for it, it cannot be gainsaid that when a debt of this kind is once voluntarily paid, the money cannot be recovered back, although there might have been no legal liability to enforce its payment. And it is immaterial whether payment is made in money or money’s worth. These goods were the property of Mrs. Brown. The boarding and nursing were necessaries furnished at her request, and it is immaterial whether they were intended to be charged for by the parents or not. Mrs. Brown having voluntarily given these goods in compensation for them, saying, “ This is the only way I can pay you,” the husband has no legal, to say nothing of moral right, to recover them.</p>

She left no will, and the little personal property she possessed consisted of some trifling trinkets and a few articles of furniture, all of which were the gifts of her own family; no portion of it came from her husband. <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>Shortly before she died, and in the extremity of her last sickness, she divided her jewelry between her sister and other members of her family. I do not understand the jewelry to be claimed in this suit, although it is difficult to speak accurately, as the narr is not printed. In any event, it was abandoned upon the argument at bar. The furniture she gave to her mother. The witness, Miss Nora Fox, testified that a few days before Mrs. Brown died she called her mother to her, and said: “ Mother, you have been so good to me, and I want to repay you, and I want you to send right away for my goods; you shall have them all; I give them to you all; that is the only way I can repay you for the kindness you did, and you have done so much for Samuel” — meaning her husband — “ and myself, and it is the only way I can repay you ; send for them as soon as you can, so the Browns do not get them, for they have been treating me very badly.” The furniture referred to was at this time on storage, where it had been placed by Mrs. Brown’s father. As it was therefore in the control of the donee’s husband, no other delivery of possession was necessary. The plaintiff was in New York when his wife died, and had been for some time previous thereto. He had been recalled by repeated telegrams to see his dying wife, without avail, and when the last urgent message was received his reply was, “ Impossible to come; furnace in a critical condition.” He appears to have been employed at some iron establishment as a furnace hand. He came shortly after his wife’s death, in time to attend her funeral. Upon the day he returned, a conversation occurred between his wife’s sister and himself, in which she informed him of the disposition his wife had made of her jewelry and furniture, to which he replied, “Well, that is all right.” The furniture was taken possession of by her father, and over four years thereafter this suit of trover and conversion was commenced to recover its value, and an administration was raised up, apparently for no other purpose than to sustain the action, there being no allegation the decedent owed any one a dollar. It was alleged in the counter-statement, and in the argument at bar, and not denied, that in the meantime the plaintiff had married another woman. While the bearing of this fact upon the law of the case is not apparent, it is interesting as a part of its history.</p>

      <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>The plaintiff contended that the gift was ídcomplete; that, under the act of 1848, and the decisions of this court, she could not dispose of this property without the consent of her husband, the plaintiff; and that his consent, as proved by the witness, was not binding upon him, for the reason that the donee was not present at the conversation. These are the questions presented by the respective assignments of error.</p>
    <p id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[257,750,1177,903]]]'>The furniture was ’the undisputed property of the wife. Moreover, it had been taken into possession under the gift, used, and some of it possibly worn out or scattered. Under the circumstances, the jury would have a right to infer the consent of the husband, and we think the learned judge of the court below was fully justified in saying to them: “ If it (the testimony) satisfies you that the consent of the husband was given knowingly, deliberately, and that he intended by the language he used to give his consent, — and his intention is to be gathered from what was said and done by him on that occasion, — then we say to you that, although the consent did not appear in the lifetime of the wife, yet if with full knowledge of the facts he did give his consent subsequent to her death, and if Mrs. Niethammer was informed of that fact, and, acting upon it, took possession of the property, it would confer title; and if she had title to this property, there would be a defence in this case, and the defendant would be entitled to a verdict.”</p>
    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.6",148,[258,1672,1175,248]]]'>We find no error in this instruction, and the verdict for the defendant naturally followed. It would be difficult to get any jury to find for the plaintiff under the circumstances developed in this case, unless twelve men could be found similarly situated, which is hardly possible in this commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b148-6" data-blocks='[["BL_148.7",148,[1019,1929,364,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
