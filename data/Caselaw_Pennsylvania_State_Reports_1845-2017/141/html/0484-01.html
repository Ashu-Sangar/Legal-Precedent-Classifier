The first count averred that the defendant was a common carrier for hire, from certain places in the Schuylkill coal region of Pennsylvania to Port Richmond, in Philadelphia, and the owner and operator of a railroad between those places and Port Richmond; and that on divers days and times during the year 1869 the plaintiffs tendered to the defendant a large quantity of coal to be carried to Port Richmond and there delivered to the plaintiffs, or their order or consignees, to be thence shipped to points east of New Brunswick, and were ready and willing, and offered to pay them such sums of money as they were legally entitled to receive for the receipt, carriage,' and delivery of said coal, being no higher rate than was then required by de<a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>fendant to be paid by any other customers of defendant for the same service, under like circumstances. It was alleged that the defendant, not regarding its duty as such carrier, although it did at the said times receive and carry coal for certain other persons from said places to Port Richmond, to be thence shipped to points east of New Brunswick, under like circumstances, fox the same price which it required the plaintiffs to pay and which they did pay, yet repaid to such other persons, out of the price so paid by them, a certain drawback, to wit: $1.65 per ton for steamer coal, $1.50 per ton for broken coal, $1.15 per ton for egg coal, and $1 per ton for stove coal, which drawbacks it did not allow or pay to the plaintiffs for their coal of the same kinds; whereby, to the amount of the said drawbacks, the plaintiffs were obliged to and did pay to the defendant an excessive, illegal, and unreasonable charge for the receipt, carriage, and delivery of their coal. The count concluded with an averment that the defendant wilfully made the said unreasonable and illegal preference and discrimination of charges in favor of such other persons and against the plaintiffs, well knowing and intending that such other persons would be thereby enabled, and they were thereby enabled, largely to increase their business in the sale of said coal in the markets east of New Brunswick, at the expense of and to the great injury of the plaintiffs’ business in the same markets, which had theretofore been very large.</p>

Such is the general rule, and it is vastly important to the general public that there be no undue relaxation of this rule; for, exercising, as they practically do, a monopoly of transportation on their roads, railway managers have in their hands a tremendous power, by discrimination, to enrich one man and ruin another. The equality, however, which is thus prescribed, is not a strict and literal equality under all circumstances however varying and different. It is rather an equality in the sense of freedom from unreasonable discrimination. It is only unjust, undue, or unreasonable discrimination, against which the law has set its canon.</p>

In order to render lawful an inequality of charge, the goods must be carried under different circumstances, and the question whether the difference is material or essential arises in each particular case.</p>

The company was incorporated as a railroad and transportation company, and it was provided that the toll should not exceed four cents per ton per mile. But no special privileges were granted to them as transporters. The privilege of putting cars and motive power upon the road was conceded to them, but to no greater extent than to the public generally.</p>

L. 234, the privileges conferred on the Schuylkill Navigation Company, by act of April 5, 1859, P. L. 872, were extended to the Reading railroad company. By this act, the Schuylkill Navigation Company were empowered to contract for the transportation of anthracite coal and other articles, and to include the charge for such transportation in their charge for tolls. It was argued for the defendant, that the risk of unreasonable or unequal charges was guarded' against by transportation being thrown open to public competition, and that no legal wrong was done to the plain tifls when the company charged them for toll and transportation both, less than they had a right to charge them for <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>tolls alone.

The court below had granted an injunction restraining the company from charging more for toll and transportation, or motive power, on freight carried in the cars belonging to individuals, than on freight carried in the company’s cars, or the cars of any other company. The Supreme Court held this decree to be ultra the bill, which contained no charge to justify it. Judge Thompson, delivering the opinion of the court, does say that, even if it had been charged in the bill that more was demanded for transportation in the plaintiff’s cars than in the company’s, yet as the excess was not greater than the charter allowed, it was not wrong to demand it. If the learned judge had said that the company could charge one private transporter more than another private transporter, his opinion would have been in point; but no such complaint was made, and the question of inequality of rates between individuals of the same class of transporters did not arise. The company had a right to discriminate between rates-of freight of private transporters who used their own cars, and rates of freight carried in the cars of the company.</p>

In support of this he referred to Hall v.

The State Freight Tax Case, <a href="/us/82/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="15 Wall. 282" data-case-ids="3424314" data-case-paths="/us/82/0282-01">15 Wall. 282</a>, was also referred to in support of this proposition.</p>

The provision of this section is that every railroad company in the United States, whose road is operated by steam, is authorized to carry upon and over its road all passengers, freight, and property, on their way from any state to another state, and to receive compensation therefor, and to connect with roads of other states, so as to form continuous lines for the transportation of the same to the places of destination.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[173,1241,1170,1168]]]'>It will be observed that congress has thus far made no provision on the subject of discrimination by railroad companies. A bill is now pending before it to regulate inter-state commerce, and to prohibit unjust discrimination by common carriers, which makes it unlawful for any person or persons engaged in the transportation of property bjr railroad, from one state or territory to or through one or more other states or territories of the United States, or to or from any foreign country, directly or indirectly to charge to or receive from any person or persons any greater or less rate or amount of freight, compensation, or reward than is charged to or received from any other person or persons for like and contemporary service, in the carrying, receiving, delivering, storing, or handling of the same. But congress has not yet legislated on the subject, and I apprehend that the rule is correctly stated by C. J. Waite, in the case referred to, Hall v. De Cuir, that, “ by refraining from action, congress in effect adopts as its own regulations those which the common law, or the civil law where that prevails, has provided for the government of such business.” No one surely would contend that the Reading railroad, as a carrier, is not subject to the common-law responsibility for all cases except by the act of God and the public enemy, by reason of the existing legislation of congress above referred to.</p>

J. Waite, “ that the statute complained of is void because it amounts to a regulation of commerce among the states, has been sufficiently considered in the case of Munn v. Illinois. This road, like the warehouse in that case, is situated within the limits of a single state. Its business is carried on there, and its regulation is a matter of domestic concern. It is emplojmd in state as well as interstate commerce; and, until congress acts, the state must be permitted to adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary for the promotion of the general welfare of the people within its own jurisdiction, even though in so doing those without may be indirectly affected.” See also Munn v.

The reason assigned is, that it would be found impracticable to give a civil remedy for each individual, the object being to avoid multiplicity of actions, for if any one man might have an action, all men might have the like. But the law for this .common nuisance has provided an apt remedy b}r indictment; unless a man has sustained a particular damage, in which case he has his action on the case: Co. Litt., 56 a. Thus, in Payne v. Partridge, 1 Salk. 12, the case of a common ferry for all persons paying toll, except the inhabitants of Littleport, who were toll free, an inhabitant of Littleport was held entitled to bring his action for taking toll, but not for keeping up the ferry, the former being a private, the latter a public right.

The word “ wilful ” in this connection is not surplusage. It means a great deal. Wilful discrimination in my judgment means a great deal more than mere discrimination.

But, until the legislature shall cut up by the roots all special agreements and special rates, I apprehend it cannot be safely affirmed that all such agreements are per se unlawful although discriminating. The true question in each particular case as it arises is, whether the special agreement is reasonable under all the circumstances, and honestly made with a single eye to the interest of the railway company. If it be so, then the only responsibility resting on the company is that they be willing to make the same agreement with every other person under the like circumstances.</p>

In the present case, although there existed no rule or regulation of the company authorizing the agreement which Mr. Smith authorized to be made with Audenried &amp; Co., I do not think the board of managers could have successfully denied his authority to make such agreement.

In point of fact, no notice of such agreement with Audenried was given to any other shipper. But, in point of law, I do not think that the duty of giving notice to the world of every special rate rests upon the carrier, under penality of being guilty of unlawful discrimination by his omission to give such notice. How, and to whom, is such notice to be given ? All that could reasonably be required of the defendant was that it be ready and willing to transport for all others, under the like circumstances, at the same rate as for Audenried &amp; Co. There is no evidence of its not being willing to do so. Its willingness was not put to the test by the plaintiffs. Had they made contracts for the sale of coal early in the season, at fixed prices, and then been refused the drawbacks allowed to Audenried &amp; Co., the ease would have been very different.

I regard the question as still an open one; and my opinion is, that the price at which the article transported is sold, is a reasonable element in fixing the rate of transportation. Practically, it cannot be ignored in fixing rates.
