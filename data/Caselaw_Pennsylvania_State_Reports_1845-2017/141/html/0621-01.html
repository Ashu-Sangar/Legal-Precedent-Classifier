I say to you, then, as a matter of law, under these undisputed facts, there was an actual taking of the plaintiff’s land, and for such taking, under the constitutional provision which was read to you, the city is bound to make compensation, not only for the land taken, but also for the property which may have been injured or destroyed by such taking.</p>

You cannot split it up into sections and say a section here is worth so much, and then allow the plaintiff damages for that, but you must consider how the whole property has been affected by this taking. And, in order to determine that, the rule has been laid down to be the difference between the fair market value of the property before any of it was taken, and the fair market value of the property as it was affected by the taking.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[164,940,1191,765]]]'>Now, how was the fair market value of this property affected by the taking of part thereof? It is perhaps necessary to ascertain and determine, to some extent, what the respective rights of the parties are over this particular strip. And it is also important to ascertain what the actual condition of the property was at the time it was taken, so that you may from that determine how it -was affected. So far as the rights of the parties are concerned, I am not able to agree with counsel for the defendant. The right which the city acquires was the right to construct and keep in operation a sewer over and along the strip of land in question, and that includes the right to alter and repair whenever necessary. The sewer is the property of the city, and the city has the right to do whatever is necessary to guard and protect it, and the city has the right to that whenever it finds it necessary to do so.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b649-6" data-blocks='[["BL_649.6",649,[156,1704,1195,465]]]'>The title to the land itself is still in the plaintiff, but the city has acquired a right in the nature of an easement over it. The city can use the land, on which the sewer is constructed, for any purpose consistent with sewer purposes and for no other. It was acquired for sewer purposes, and whenever that is abandoned, that is, whenever the sewer is abandoned, and the city gives up that sewer, then the title to the land will revert back again to Mr. Wilson, and you have the right to consider the probability of that sewer ever being abandoned.</p>

They may wall it up or fence it in, or put anything upon it to prevent Mr. Wilson or anybody else from entering upon it which may be necessary, because, in order that the city may make its repairs, and take proper care of the sewer, it must necessarily have the right to go there whenever it pleases, whenever, in the judgment and discretion of the city, it is found to be necessary to do so. If Mr. Wilson has the right to go there, or to erect buildings upon it, why, you see that right of the city would be interfered with at once, and in case the city found it necessary to make repairs, they would find a house on top of the sewer. Such a state of affairs - cannot be adopted, and such a construction of the law is not known to the law of eminent domain in this state.</p>

Not one of these requirements of the act of 1874 was complied with, and the illegal board of viewers appointed never obtained jurisdiction and bad no power to bind anybody. It necessarily follows that the court had no jurisdiction on appeal. There can be no valid appeal from a void proceeding. Want of jurisdiction can be taken advantage of at any stage of the proceeding: Collins v. Collins, <a href="/pa/37/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="37 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="418858" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0387-01">37 Pa. 387</a>; Bergman v.

It should be borne i.n mind that this is not a suit at law, and the case is not analogous to that of an appeal from an award of arbitrators. If a board of arbitrators is illegal, the award may be treated as a nullity and the original suit go on, just as if it had not been ruled out. But here there was no original suit, and no issue can be made except on appeal from a report of viewers.</p>

What is actually taken is not the laud itself, but only the use of it for the particular purpose for which it is needed. In some cases the use involves almost the entire possession of the land, as where it is taken for a railroad station; yet even there the owner may tunnel beneath it or stretch wires over it, so long as he does not interfere with the use for which it was taken. The extent of the taking varies with its object, and is limited by the public necessity: Lyon v. Gormley, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20Pa.%20264" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="53 Pa. 264">53 Pa. 264</a>; Sanderson v.

In the present case, all that the city took was the right to use the channel of a stream for-sewer purposes. Aside from this particular use, the plaintiff has full control of his property, and he is actually using the surface over the sewer. In order to estimate the damages, it was necessary for the jury to determine the extent of the use taken and required. In refusing to permit them to do so, the court took from them the decision of a vital question of fact, within their province: Lewis on Em. Dom., § 502; Dodson v. Cincinnati, <a href="/ohio-st/34/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="34 Ohio St. 276" data-case-ids="904803" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/34/0276-01">34 Ohio St. 276</a>.

The court below says that the damage must be measured by the right to use, and not by the actual present use. But the right of the city is limited by the necessity of the use. The answer to the defendant’s third point was equivalent to saying that the city may not only use the channel of this stream as a sewer, but may also fence in the surface and use it for a highway or rent it for business purposes.</p>

But there was no defect of jurisdiction in the initiation of the proceeding, which was by a petition filed by the plaintiff asking the assessment of the damages to his property by the city’s action in building the sewer. Of this subject the court had general jurisdiction under the act of 1874, and was the proper place for the filing of the petition. The plaintiff, therefore, was in court upon a valid application to its unquestionable powers. The appointment of three viewers, under the void act of 1887, instead of seven, as required by the act of 1874, was an irregularity for which the appointment would undoubtedly have been vacated had the objection been made in time, but it did not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the parties or the subject-matter. The viewers thus appointed having gone on and made their report, the city appealed, an issue was framed, and the jury sworn, and then for the first time the objection was made. It was too late. The parties were properly in court; the appeal had started the proceedings de novo according to the course of the common law, and the previous irregularity had become immaterial. The learned judge was right in overruling the motion.</p>

A fundamental error runs through the trial, in assuming that the city had taken the ground occupied by the sewer, absolutely, and was therefore liable for its full value. The city might have done so, and perhaps the fair presumption would be that it had; but it was not obliged, nor in strictness was it authorized, to take more than was actually necessary for its purpose. The limit of the public right is the public necessity, and the residue, as <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>it may be called, of the use of the land, remains unaffected in the owner. The extent of such residue depends on the nature of the public use, and that may vary all the way from the exclusive occupation for a school-house or public building to the easement of running a gas pipe underneath or a telegraph wire overhead. The city was therefore entitled to show the extent of its actual taking. This, however, could only be shown by corporate action. The city would not be bound by the opinions of experts, even of the city engineer, as to the amount of interest in the land that should be taken. That was within its own discretion, provided, of course, it did not exceed the limits of necessity for its purpose. The plaintiff was entitled to have its intention shown by action binding on the corporation, and put on the record in such form as to give him a cause of action in case the city officials 'should at any future time attempt to do anything in excess-of their privileges actually acquired and paid for. This, however, being properly shown, the extent to which the rights so acquired would interfere with the plaintiff’s enjoyment and use of his land, and the consequent effect on its value, could be shown by experts as in other cases.</p>

It was objected to as irrelevant, immaterial, and incompetent. The argument of appellee specifies the further objection that it was not proved, identified, or certified as required by the act of 1874. As this matter does not appear on the record, we do not pass upon it, but the resolution, if properly proved, was competent. And, the limits of the city’s exercise of the right of taking the property being thus shown, the questions to the plaintiff and others, as to the actual state of things on the land and the effect on its value, should have been admitted.</p>
