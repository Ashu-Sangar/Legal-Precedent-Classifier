The courts, both of England and this country, including this court, have carried it into the equity practice and followed the law in all analogous cases, upon principles of the soundest public policy.” He describes it as “ a perfectly lawful and proper defence.” In Ellinger’s Appeal, it is said that under recent decisions it is a good cause for opening a judgment and letting a defendant into a defence that prima facie at the time of entry of judgment the claim was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

The latter case says: “ At a time when the statute of limitations was viewed with disfavor, it was held that an executor or administrator was not bound to plead it. This rule was only applicable to actions in which the personal representative of the decedent was intrusted with the management of the defence and in which the pleading was necessarily regulated by Ms own discretion. It has no place in a proceeding before the Orphans’ Court, where the parties lawfully entitled to the <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>fund are recognized as having a standing in court, and must, as a consequence of that condition, be permitted to protect their respective interests in their own way. It follows, that where the fund is not sufficient to pay all, each creditor has a right to oppose any other claimant, by showing payment of the debt, that it is barred by the statute of limitations, that the lien has expired (if the claim be upon the fund arising from the sale of real estate), or any other defence exists against it, and these rights do not depend upon the will of the personal representative of the decedent.”</p>

Yet it is elsewhere said that there is a distinction between a judgment obtained in due course of law and one obtained by consent of the debtor. The law presmnes the former to be founded upon a valuable consideration and rendered for a just debt, but indulges no such presumption in favor of the latter: Bump on Fraud. Conv., 539. But, notwithstanding the positive assertion of the rule of law that a judgment cannot be attacked by creditors except for fraud or collusion, we are made to doubt whether such is the law, without qualification; for the same cases which assert this rule, do so with a degree of reservation.</p>

Nor will I say that if he were to refuse to move for the benefit of his creditors, they would not be permitted to move in his name. An insolvent man is not suffered to give away his property by means of a judgment which, though proper at first, has become a security for less than the amount of it.” In Clark v. Douglass, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%20416" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="62 Pa. 416">62 Pa. 416</a>, Justice Shabswood said: “ No doubt creditors might show that a debtor, who had a good defence and ground for opening a judgment confessed or by default, pertinaciously and wilfully refused to make application or allow his name to be used for that purpose, for it would be very cogent evidence that if the original judgment was not collusive, it was kept on foot for the purpose of defrauding them. Indeed, I am not sure that a court in the exercise of their equitable powers would not in such a case allow the creditors to come in, open the judgment and take defence in the name of the defendant; such appears to have been the opinion of Chief Justice Gibson.” After quoting Lewis v. Rogers, supra, he proceeds: “Nothing can be more just, consistent and symmetrical than the system of administering the law here indicated; for, while it gives a remedy for every wrong, it saves the records of the court from the strange anomaly of a judgment found by the verdict of a jury to be a fraud upon the defendant, yet standing as a perfectly valid security which can be enforced against him.”</p>

If such be the law, is it applicable to the facts of this case ? They do not present exactly the case put by Justice Shabswood, of a pertinacious and wilful refusal to apply to open a judgment, but in our opinion a state of facts equally as objectionable upon the part of one, who, as the'trustee and agent of creditors, should give them a fair opportunity to be heard in contesting rival claims, and who should not take positive steps to obstruct an investigation. After a settlement had been filed showing a balance for distribution, and the appointment of an auditor by the Orphans’ Court, this claim, which, singularly enough, it is now alleged had already been legally established in the Or<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>phans’ Court, was put in suit in the Common Pleas, and the executrix confessed judgment under circumstances that point to a degree of haste not required for any apparent purpose.</p>

So far as the record shows, although the claim was presented before a former auditor in the same estate, it does not clearly appear that the creditors had an opportunity to object to it, the auditor’s report being very unsatisfactory, if not worthless, for the purpose of showing what occurred before him. It seems that the only fund then for distribution was the proceeds of realty, which by agreement was awarded to a single creditor, and consequently no further account was taken of the other claims. Had there been a request, no doubt an auditor’s meeting could have been held before the claim was disposed of in the Common Pleas. Shortly after the judgment was confessed, and long before the suit could have been prosecuted to judgment by the ordinary course of law, a meeting was had, when the claim could if unobjectionable have been readily established. In the meantime, the costs would have been trifling. The successive and rapid steps to obtain a result easier of accomplishment, and actually asserted to have been accomplished in the Orphans’ Court, unobstructed, in fact facilitated by the executrix, whose present attitude shows a decided disinclination to take any step to relieve the creditors from the predicament her act has placed them in, would appear to be at least as cogent evidence as that which Justice Shauswood in Clark v. Douglass thought showed either collusion or fraud.</p>

But in an inquiry into legal fraud, the intent is immaterial. The entire innocence of the act may be conceded; what are the consequences ? is the inquiry. Fraud in law consists in acts which, though not fraudulently intended, yet as their tendency is to defraud creditors, if they vest the property of the debtor in his grantee (or beneficiary), are void for legal fraud: McKibbin v.

Equity ought to require this. When she voluntarily and, as we think, hastily confessed the judgment, it was a violation of that confidence which the creditors had a right to repose in and expect from her, in her official character as executrix. In England, it is said that in all cases of this nature where the consideration is a pre-existing debt, the whole transaction must be free from doubt: May on Fraud. Conv., 110.</p>

Such a question is within the province of a jury and the court cannot dispose of it. At the argument, the counsel for plaintiff stated that had the statute been pleaded before the first auditor, the plaintiff was prepared to show payments on account to toll the running of the statute. The record shows that the judgment was confessed for the full amount claimed in the declaration. Subsequently, counsel explained this statement by saying that it was not intended to be understood as referring to payments which would reduce the amount of the judgment as it appears of record, but that it referred to payments of interest not included in the judgment. Counsel for the petitioners have frankly accepted this explanation as embracing what was meant to be said. The omission at the argument to qualify the statement was evidently an inadvertent mistake. Thus qualified, the statement made at the argument becomes unimportant as an admission to affect (as it otherwise would) the merits of the controversy in this case.</p>

The practice is to try collusion by a collateral issue, but matter of defence which the defendant has a right to set up, by an issue in the cause: Gallup v.

The petitioners did not ask for an issue to determine whether the judgment was collusive, so that they might avoid its effect as to them while it would remain valid as to the defendant, the executrix and devisee of the decedent; but, strangers to the judgment, they asked that it be opened to determine whether the defendant by asserting a statutory defence could escape payment of the demand. The judge below, perceiving the difficulty in their way, attempted to avoid it by introducing a new practice: he opened the judgment and awarded an issue framed upon the original declaration, with pleas of nonassumpsit infra sex annos and payment with leave. To justify this course, the court held that there is a distinction between a judgment obtained in due course of law and one obtained by the consent of the debtor.

It is within the discretion of the court to open a judgment to permit the statute of limitations to be pleaded: Herman v. Pinker, <a href="/pa/106/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="106 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="455693" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0121-01">106 Pa. 121</a>; Sossong v. Rosar, <a href="/pa/112/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="112 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="546543" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0197-01">112 Pa. 197</a>; Ellinger’s App., <a href="/pa/114/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="114 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="550033" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0505-01">114 Pa. 505</a>. That defence is a meritorious one: Sossong v. Rosar, <a href="/pa/112/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="112 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="546543" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0197-01">112 Pa. 197</a> ; and creditors have the right to plead it: Ritter’s App., <a href="/pa/23/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="23 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="974055" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0095-01">23 Pa. 95</a>; Kittera’s Est., <a href="/pa/17/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="17 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="967627" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0416-01">17 Pa. 416</a>. It is not the law that the executor of an insolvent testator, by confessing a judgment in the circumstances of this case, can make that which, the law declares to be no claim, good against the other creditors and render them powerless to prevent its allowance : Lewis v. Rogers, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Pa.%2021" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="16 Pa. 21">16 Pa. 21</a>; Ritter’s App., <a href="/pa/23/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="23 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="974055" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0095-01">23 Pa. 95</a>. As was held in the cases cited, creditors can move if the executor refuses to do so. What stronger refusal to protect them can there be than a hasty confession of judgment upon a barred claim, in order that it may be used in another court where its validity cannot be questioned? The appellants have argued the case as if it were necessary to establish collusion or fraud by actual proof. But this is unnecessary, for fraud in law is just as obnoxious and hurtful as fraud in fact: McKibbin v. Martin, <a href="/pa/64/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="64 Pa. 352" data-case-ids="1021257" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0352-01">64 Pa. 352</a>; 1 Story Eq. Jur., c. 7.</p>

There was a petition setting out certain facts on which petitioners asked to have the judgment opened, to which the plaintiff filed an answer, denying some of the facts alleged and demanding proof of the others. No depositions appear to <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>have been taken nor any other evidence presented, so far as the record discloses, and the arguments seem to concede that the court acted on the petition and answer alone. It may be that this was done by general consent, but if so the fact does not appear on the record. We notice the matter so as to avoid any implication of approval of such a course, unless by consent. The discretion of courts to open judgments is very extensive, but it must rest on a foundation of competent evidence.</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[215,801,1169,810]]]'>But a much deeper objection is that the court was without jurisdiction in tbe proceeding. There was no one before if asking for its action who bad any standing. Neither plaintiffs nor defendant desired tbe judgment opened, and the court had no right to do it on motion of a stranger not alleging fraud or collusion. True, the petitioners were creditors of tbe decedent’s estate, and tbe judgment tended to diminish the fund for their payment. But this of itself gave them no right to interfere. It has long been settled that a judgment can only be attacked by creditors or other strangers for fraud or collusion, and as already said neither is alleged in the present case. The fact of there being a fund in the Orphans’ Court which will be affected by the present judgment does not alter tbe general rule. Mere diminution of the fund gives no standing in that court, more than in any other. See Law’s Est., <a href="/pa/140/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="140 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="972545" data-case-paths="/pa/140/0444-01">140 Pa. 444</a>, opinion filed at present term.</p>

But this contention is not tenable. A debt barred by the statute of limitations is still a debt, though the remedy upon it he suspended or gone. Its force as an existing obligation, even though only moral, is such that a promise to pay is binding without other consideration. And tbe debtor may make such promise without regard to its effect upon other parties, even though eredi tors. In Clark v. Douglass, <a href="/pa/62/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="62 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1017228" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0408-01">62 Pa. 408</a>, this court, through Shabswood, J., said that it was now fortunately well settled that creditors have no right to impeach a judgment on any other ground than collusion; and in Meckley’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=102%20Pa.%20542" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="102 Pa. 542">102 Pa. 542</a>, it was held that a, judgment honestly confessed to a wife by an insolvent was good against creditors. If not for more than was due, it was not fraudulent, either in fact or in law, <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>though there had been no agreement for interest on the money advanced by the wife, and such1 interest had been included in the judgment. In Keen v. Kleckner, <a href="/pa/42/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="42 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="481494" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0529-01">42 Pa. 529</a>, it was expressly held that a debtor, even though insolvent, was not bound to interpose the defence of the statute of limitations (or the statute of frauds) and might confess judgment for a claim so barred if the claim were honest, even though other creditors were defeated thereby. See, also, Brown’s App., <a href="/pa/86/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="86 Pa. 524" data-case-ids="1056611" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0524-01">86 Pa. 524</a>, and the analogous case of the defence of usury in Second N. Bank’s App., <a href="/pa/96/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="96 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="494668" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0460-01">96 Pa. 460</a>.</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[272,903,1174,654]]]'>These cases establish beyond controversion that if Ninian Irwin, the debtor, had been alive in 1886, he could have confessed this judgment, and no creditor could have impeached it as a fraud in law. It is equally well settled that his executrix stands so far in his shoes that if satisfied the claim is honest she is not bound to plead the statute of limitations. As there was no other defence, it follows that her confession of judgment was a prudent and proper course. She was doing no more than the testator might lawfully have done had he been alive. The debt was a moral obligation which either the debtor, or his executrix, acting in his place after his death, could convert into a legal one, and creditors have no more standing to complain in the one case than in the other.</p>
    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.6",318,[271,1566,1177,860]],["BL_319.1",319,[206,382,1167,94]]]'>It is true that in Lewis v. Rogers, <a href="/pa/16/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="16 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="410218" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0018-01">16 Pa. 18</a>, Gibson, C. J., says : “ Nor will I say that if he (the debtor) were to refuse to move for the benefit of his creditors, they would not be permitted to move in his name; ” but he was speaking of fraud, as the next sentence shows: “ An insolvent man is not suffered to give away his property by means of a judgment which, though proper at first, has become a security for less than the amount of it; ” and his remark referred more to the form of the creditor’s proceeding than to his right, i. e., an attack on the judgment directly in the debtor’s name, and not collaterally in his own. So, also, Justice Sharswood remarks in Clark v. Douglass, <a href="/pa/62/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="62 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1017228" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0408-01">62 Pa. 408</a>, 415, 416, that the creditors of an insolvent could even against a judgment set up anything that the debtor could, had reference to fraud, as is apparent from the context and from the facts of the case he had in hand. Even as dicta, these remarks were not intended to trench in any way on the settled rule, expressly reiterated in both those <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>cases, that creditors can only interfere for fraud or collusion against them.</p>
    <p id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[201,485,1170,550]]]'>This result is not at all affected by the fact that the creditors in the Orphans’ Court will have the fund diminished by the judgment. There is nothing in the doctrine of Yorks’ App., <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>, which is relevant. The right of the executrix to plead the statute of limitations in the Orphans’ Court was established in that case. She has that right there and here. Creditors have no such right here, and she is not bound to assert hers for their benefit. As already shown, the debtor himself might confess judgment, no matter how much it diminished the creditor’s chance of payment, and his representative stands in this respect in his place.</p>
    <p id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.6",319,[195,1045,1174,1369]],["BL_320.1",320,[281,421,1178,647]]]'>As these views upon the status of the petitioners are decisive of the case, it is perhaps not necessary to consider the ruling of the court below on the question of opening the judgment to let in the defence of the statute of limitations, but it may be well to do so briefly, to avoid misconstruction. The learned judge, in saying that it is no longer matter of dispute that a judgment should be opened for that purpose alone, went a step beyond any of the cases. The most advanced case that we have been referred to does not decide that the court should, but only that it <em>may </em>do so. The plea of the statute, though no longer an object of animadversion, is not yet the object of favor. As a matter of public policy, recognizing that in the ordinary course of business life just debts are pursued with diligence, and that witnesses die and papers are lost, the statute is one of repose and protection. But, speaking for myself, I cannot regard the statute, unaided by any equitable conditions or circumstances, as other than a dishonest defence, for which alone a judgment should never be opened. But, however that may be as a matter of discretion with the court in each case as it arises, no case certainly has been brought to our attention in which a judgment has been opened for this purpose only, for a defendant who has had his day in court. The cases specially relied on by the court below and by appellees, Herman v. Rinker, <a href="/pa/106/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="106 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="455693" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0121-01">106 Pa. 121</a>; Sossong v. Rosar, <a href="/pa/112/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="112 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="546543" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0197-01">112 Pa. 197</a>; and Ellinger’s App., <a href="/pa/114/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="114 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="550033" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0505-01">114 Pa. 505</a>, were judgments entered on warrants of attorney, fourteen, ten and eleven years old, respectively, and in all of them there were other circum<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>stances besides the mere lapse of time set out as grounds of the application. But the action of the court was based, as is very clearly set out; by our Brother Green, in Sossong v. Rosar, on the fact that the defendant had had no hearing. If, on a suit in the usual course, the defendant comes in and confesses judgment, he could hardly be heard afterwards to say the debt was barred by the statute. He has made an acknowledgment of record that the debt is due, and that he will pay it. As already shown, what the debtor might have done his executrix may do in his place; and even if she had thereafter asked for the opening of the judgment, it could not have been granted without some equitable grounds to aid it. It is unnecessary to consider the offers of evidence at the trial.</p>
