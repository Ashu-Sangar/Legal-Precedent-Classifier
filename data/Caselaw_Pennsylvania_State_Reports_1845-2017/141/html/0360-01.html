Miller; the Klopp judgment and the proceedings thereon for subrogation; the issuing upon said judgment of an execution in favor of Henry H. Miller, and a levy by virtue of said execution upon Charles H. Miller’s interest in the land devised as aforesaid. It averred, further, that letters testamentary on the estate of Henry Miller, deceased, were issued to Henry H.

It was further alleged that in the spring of 1871 Charles H. Miller was indebted to his wife Elvira to an amount exceeding $2,000 for moneys advanced and paid for him, and owed about $2,000 to other persons; that the latter indebtedness was paid by money borrowed from one Michael Haak upon a judgment, and that then, to prevent Charles H.

The Court of Common Pleas refused to enter a decree in Henry’s favor for the balance thus ascertained, and entered a decree against the plaintiffs for costs only. On appeal to the Supreme Court by Henry H. Miller, the decree of the court below was reversed and a decree entered against the plaintiffs for the payment of $1,391.20, with interest from February 2, 1881; with the proviso that the decree should not create any personal responsibility as to Elvira L.

But it is objected that Mrs. Miller alleged in her bill in equity that the conveyance to her was in trust for her husband and his family and to prevent his squandering the estate, and that she is therefore estopped from proving the truth in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[227,810,1171,909]]]'>1. It is not true that the bill in equity alleges that the conveyance was in trust for Charles and his family. A fair construction of the language used is that it was made in consideration of the $2,000 which he owed to his wife, and $2,000 additional raised to pay other creditors. If the bill is fairly capable of this construction, then any other construction, even though it seem to the court a more reasonable one, is not sufficiently certain for the basis of an estoppel. But, assuming that the words “in consideration of the premises ” refer, not to the indebtedness mentioned, but to the motive of the parties stated, the utmost that can fairly be contended is that the language imports a voluntary conveyance for the benefit of the wife, and Mr. Justice Clajrk seems so to have construed it in Miller’s App., <a href="/pa/119/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="119 Pa. 620" data-case-ids="558109" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0620-01">119 Pa. 620</a>. If that construction be adopted, still, as the Klopp debt was thought to be amply provided for by Charles’s share of the estate in Henry’s hands, and no fraud was intended against Henry, the conveyance was good: Mateer v. Hissim, <a href="/pen-w/3/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 160" data-case-ids="1827608" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0160-01">3 P. &amp; W. 160</a>; Wilson v.

Charles had assigned to her two things: his undivided half of this land, and his interest in the estate in the hands of Henry as executor. To obtain the latter, the bill prayed for an account and a decree for payment. Whether she claimed it as a purchaser or as a volunteer, she was entitled to the relief prayed, and if by mistake the bill did describe the conveyance as voluntary or in trust, such averment was immaterial. An immaterial averment in a pleading is evidence as an admission, but not as an estoppel. Moreover, we proposed to show that Henry acquiesced in the conveyance. If there were any basis for an estoppel in the language of the bill, the jury should have been asked to find whether the plaintiff acted upon it. There is no merit in the objection that in her bill Elvira proposed that <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>the Klopp judgment should be deducted from the estate conveyed to her by Charles, and thus admitted it to be a charge on the land. She was bound to permit the deduction from the personal estate, inasnjuch as the arrangement between Charles and Henry was substantially an equitable assignment thereof, as security for that liability, and she did not thereby admit a charge on the land.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b394-4" data-blocks='[["BL_394.5",394,[260,750,1177,1115]]]'>8. The first ejectment between the same parties, on the same title, resulting in a verdict and judgment for Elvira, was a conclusive answer to the plaintiff’s theory of an equitable estoppel against the defendant. The verdict and judgment were conclusive, because the ejectment was equitable. The legal title was conveyed by Charles to his wife, through Bechtel, and nothing remained if the conveyance was fraudulent, except an equitable right of creditors to avoid the deed, by having the voluntary grantee declared a trustee for them. Such an ejectment as this is not the ordinary legal possessory action, but is a substitute for a bill in equity: Peterman v. Huling, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20Pa.%20433" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="31 Pa. 433">31 Pa. 433</a>.

Hartman, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%2025" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 W. 25">7 W. 25</a>. Finally, how does Henry stand? He endeavors to have Elvira estopped by a slip of her counsel in pleading an immaterial averment. What, then, shall be said of his position in denying her title, while proceeding to collect a lien against her property under the decree in Miller’s App., <a href="/pa/119/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="119 Pa. 620" data-case-ids="558109" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0620-01">119 Pa. 620</a> ?

It is to be borne in mind that the sheriff’s sale, on which the plaintiff’s title rests, was held after Mrs. Miller had spread upon the record in her bill in equity, a description of her title admitting that she held the estate by a voluntary conveyance for the benefit of her husband and his family. The only thing which her <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>bill offered as an objection to the execution and sale, was the statement found, prior to the sale, by the master’s report and decree, to be false, that the Klopp judgment was paid, or rather that the execution creditor had in his hands the means of payment. The purchaser at the sheriff’s sale took the property with the record before him that Mrs. Miller made. What was there in it to deter him from buying? Was not her bill an admission, by solemn and indisputable record, that the judgment in execution was a valid lien upon the land, and that a sheriff’s sale thereof would divest her title ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[217,890,1178,814]]]'>2. The averments of the bill as to the nature of the title held, were not immaterial, but were essential to the jurisdiction of the court to grant the relief sought. If the estate was held by Mrs. Miller in her own right, for a valid consideration, a sheriff’s sale on the judgment against her husband, would not affect her title and she could on no ground demand an injunction. But by setting up a trust in herself for her husband’s benefit, and alleging that the judgment was equitably paid, she laid sufficient grounds for the injunction, which was granted and continued in operation for over two years, subjecting the execution creditor to long delay and thereby manifestly altering his position, to say nothing of the fact that his purchase at the sale was in reliance upon her admissions. This constitutes an estoppel by the record: Garber v.

It is not disputed that the record of a former judgment in ejectment may be given in evidence ; that it may be offered as persuasive evidence, is clear enough: Koons v.

But nowhere is it held to be evidence, sufficient in itself and without more to carry a case. Unless the court is prepared to say that the former verdict and judgment were sufficient, without other evidence, to sustain a verdict, their rejection in this case did the defendants no injury. The whole strength of the defendants’ position depends upon the assumption that our suit is an equitable ejectment. But neither of the cases cited to support this assumption is like ours.

We must assume, therefore, that the deed of April 5, 1871, from Charles H. Miller and Elvira, his wife, through Bechtel, as a trustee, to the said Elvira L. Miller, although upon a merely nominal consideration, was a transaction in good faith, founded upon a (full consideration paid at or prior to the execution thereof; that the consideration advanced was taken out of her separate estate by Elvira L. Miller and was used in relief of her husband, and that this was an adequate and full price for the land ; that at the time of this conveyance Charles H. Miller and his wife were under the belief that Henry H. Miller, who was the executor of Henry Miller, deceased, had funds in his hands belonging to Charles, sufficient to pay the Klopp judgment in relief of his obligation as surety, according to their agreement to that effect; and that there was no purpose in the mind of Charles or of his wife to hinder, delay, or defraud Henry H. Miller to whom the judgment had been assigned, or any other creditor of Charles H. Miller.

It was a bill for an account, merely. The accounting resulted in a balance of $1,391.20 against Charles, exclusive of the Klopp judgment.

The title of the land was not brought in issue by the bill or by the pleadings : what was said on that subject was doubtless upon the assumption that the conveyance, which was made upon a merely nominal consideration, was <em>voluntary; </em>it was intended merely to illustrate the want of equity in Elvira, as a purchaser of the land, to complain that she was held for the amount of the decree. There was no adjudication upon the title of the land: the thing adjudicated was the account, and in the adjudication of the account the title to the land was in no way involved. What reference was made to the title was merely incidental: it was, as we have said, unimportant for the purposes of that case whether the deed was voluntary or for value', for, in any event, the lands owned by Charles and which he conveyed to his wife, were bound by the prior lien of the legacy, to which Henry had been subrogated.</p>
