It is only where a judgment is entered upon a warrant of attorney, or judgment note, that the act of April 4, 1877, P.

If no other facts appeared in the case than those alleged in the petition, it would be very doubtful whether the judgment or the claim of the plaintiff against Jackson township could be sustained. We are satisfied that the officers of a municipal corporation cannot confess a judgment against such municipality for any debt which they had no authority to contract; and we are of opinion, that as a general rule, they cannot make the municipality liable for borrowed money. But the plaintiff in this case has filed an answer to which he has attached and made a part thereof the affidavits of the supervisors themselves. In the absence of any <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>evidence to the contrary, or any counter affidavits, we feel bound to regard the facts as stated in the answer to be admitted in this case.</p>

We concede that there is no express authority for them to do so. Our statutes seem to contemplate that the expense of the ■ordinary municipal powers shall be met by the revenues derived year by year from taxation. But they cannot in any one year lay an assessment exceeding one cent on the dollar for the purpose of meeting these expenses, and they cannot lay an additional assessment, except for the purpose of paying any just debt due a former overseer or supervisor. Yet our statute enjoins and requires them to open, and constantly keep in repair, all public highways, making sufficient causeways on marshy and swampy ground, and bridges over small creeks and rivulets.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b453-8" data-blocks='[["BL_453.8",453,[224,1459,1173,705]]]'>True, it gives them the right to purchase, at the expense of the township, all necessary materials, and employ and direct a ■sufficient number of laborers. Ordinarily the power to pledge the credit of the township, for the purposes aforesaid, is sufficient, and in ordinary cases the supervisors should not be permitted to go beyond the express power given by the statutes. But what is to be done in an emergency such as arose in the case now before us, where the supervisors could not procure the labor in the ordinary way, and could not possibly perform the duties required of them by statute, and yet were under arrest and liable to be fined and imprisoned for neglecting to perform such duties? Surely, in such case, the power to borrow money for the purpose seems to us to be necessarily implied.</p>

The power to do so under the circumstances is necessarily implied, and passes as an incident to the execution of the general powers given and the performance of the duties required of the supervisors by our statutes. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin in the case of Mills v. Gleason, <a href="/wis/11/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="11 Wis. 470" data-case-ids="8709436" data-case-paths="/wis/11/0470-01">11 Wis. 470</a> (<a href="/citations/?q=78%20Am.%20Dec.%20721" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="78 Am.

L. 538, to make a defence if one exists.</p>

It has been held repeatedly that an action will not lie on such an order, as it is “ neither a bill, note, check, nor contract, nor a satisfaction of the original indebtedness ; ” that suit should be brought upon the original indebtedness, and that the plaintiff cannot recover unless there is a valid indebtedness to him aside from and independent of the order: Port Royal Bor. v.

The order here in question, it is true, sets forth the fact that it was given for borrowed money, but the statement of claim avers not a single fact to show that there existed such a contract of borrowing as the supervisors had the power to make; and such facts should be averred. The power of supervisors to bind a township for borrowed money, is certainly more limited than that of a married woman to contract, and it is held that a judgment against a married woman must be self-supporting: Baker v. Singer Mfg. Co., <a href="/pa/122/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="122 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1948386" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0363-01">122 Pa. 363</a>; McKinney v.

In his answer to the petition to strike off the judgment, the plaintiff forsakes the order and goes back to his original claim. It is conceded that supervisors have no express power to bind the township for borrowed money, pure and simple, unless it is conferred by act of Ap’»:l 20, 1874, P. L. 65, not a single provision of which ' •&gt;- parried out in this case.

    <p class="summary" id="b456-4" data-blocks='[["BL_456.5",456,[261,789,1170,551]]]'>4. A township is merely a quasi corporation, and the law and decisions applying to municipal corporations proper have no applicability to the former. The doctrine enunciated in Gibson v. Poor Dist., supra, properly interpreted, must mean that townships and poor districts have no implied power to borrow money, and it can mean nothing else. But an attempt is made, in the present case, to establish the strange doctrine that this power is born of extreme emergency. The effect of such a doctrine would be to produce untold litigation; for each case would stand alone upon its own peculiar circumstances, and could be no precedent for any other.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b456-5" data-blocks='[["BL_456.6",456,[263,1349,1173,756]]]'>5. Even in the case of municipal corporations proper, the necessity from which the power may be implied means, not unforeseen circumstances, but a necessary implication for the purpose of carrying out, in their ordinary exercise and to their natural limits, the powers expressly granted. No power to borrow money can thus be implied from the powers expressly granted to townships. Again; the answer avers that this money was borrowed to make future local improvements, paying laborers who were thereafter to work upon the roads, and it is well established that a power to borrow for such a purpose can never be implied: 1 Dillon, Mun. Corp., § 125. In conclusion, all that the township asks is that the plaintiff be required to establish his claim in the usual way, and it is no more than justice to the township that it should have the right of trial by jury.</p>

The order states that it is for borrowed money bearing interest,’ and it is under the hands of both supervisors of the township, at<a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>tested, by the clerk. It has, therefore, all the essential elements of a contract to refund money lent, and is a sufficient instrument upon which to base an action at law: Port Royal Bor. v. Graham, <a href="/pa/84/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="84 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1053503" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0429-01">84 Pa. 429</a>. It is undisputed that a previous demand for payment is a condition precedent to the bringing of the action, but the record need not aver it: it may be established at the trial, like any other fact. No objection on this ground was set up in the appellant’s petition as a defence to the judgment. Besides, the demand may be waived by the supervisors. And the analogy attempted to be drawn between the judgment in this case and a judgment against a married woman does not hold, for a married woman’s power to contract is purely statutory, and under no possible contingency is she invested with implied powers ; whereas this action was based, not upon statutory, but upon implied authority.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b457-4" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[187,1145,1167,1051]]]'>2. The proposition advanced by the appellant, that supervisors have no authority either express or implied to borrow money, can scarcely be said to be an open question. The conclusion arrived at by the court below is justified by the case of Hopewell Tp. v. Putt, 2 W. N. 46, referred to approvingly in Somerset Tp. v. Parson, <a href="/pa/105/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="105 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="454242" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0360-01">105 Pa. 360</a>. The case at bar, however, is much stronger than Hopewell Tp. v. Putt. The correctness of the court’s conclusion is sustained, also, by Gibson v. Poor Dist., <a href="/pa/122/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="122 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1948421" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0557-01">122 Pa. 557</a>, in which this court say that, in cases of necessity, overseers of the poor may borrow money. If ever a necessity could exist for borrowing money by a township, such necessity existed in the case now at bar. In Union Tp. v. Gibboney, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20Pa.%20537" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="94 Pa. 537">94 Pa. 537</a>, the power of townships to borrow money was recognized as arising “ by necessary implication, for carrying on the duties imposed upon them,” and it is upon that principle that the decision of the court below in this case was based. From the fact that the duty to repair roads and bridges is absolute, and does not cease when all the money that could be raised by taxation has been expended, it logically follows that there is an implied authority to borrow money when it is necessary so to do.</p>

The proposition that the supervisors had not the authority to confess the judgment in this case is supported neither by authority nor by reason. In Bennett v. Fulmer,, <a href="/pa/49/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="49 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="998553" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0155-01">49 Pa. 155</a>, the court say : “ Nobody can doubt but that an administrator can <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>confess judgment; ” and Freeman on Judgments, § 545, is authority for the confession of judgments by public officers for amounts justly due. Judgments are always under the control of the courts, and since no injury can be done to any one, but costs can be saved to the townships, it is not only reasonable but just that supervisors should have this authority after suit is brought. If county commissioners can advance money for the discharge of a prisoner, upon the ground that such an act will save money to the county, as it was held they may do in Schwamble v. The Sheriff, 22 Fa. 18, surely supervisors, who have the same corporate powers as county commissioners: Cooper v. Lampeter Tp., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%20125" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="8 W. 125">8 W. 125</a>, should be allowed to confess a judgment for money actually due from the township, to save costs.</p>

It is only where the judgment is entered upon a warrant of attorney or judgment note, that the act of assembly gives the right to an appeal from a refusal to open it. The case was argued at bar, however, as though the rule was to strike off the judgment, and, as that was the prayer of the petition upon which the rule was granted, we will treat it as such.</p>

Subsequently, one Henry Antis, a taxpayer of the township, presented his petition to the court below, asking to have the judgment stricken from the record for the reason that the supervisors had no authority to give said order, or to borrow the money which it is alleged to represent. The prayer of the petition is that “ said judgment be stricken off, so that the said township of Jackson, through your petitioner, may come in to defend against the said claim,” etc.</p>

It was contended for the petitioner that the judgment was void upon its face; that a supervisor has no authority to borrow money, and that a suit will not lie upon an order of this description. It may be conceded that, if it appear upon the face of the record that the judgment was unlawfully entered, it may be stricken off. If the plaintiff was seeking to recover upon the order, and the township were resisting it, we would have an entirely different question before us. The township is not resisting the claim; it confessed judgment therefor by its recognized officers. We do not assent to the proposition that the supervisors, knowing a claim to be just,, may not confess judgment. They are not bound to subject the township to costs, in a case in which they have no defence. Under such circumstances, we would not strike off a judgment for a mere technicality, even upon the petition of a taxpayer.</p>
    <p id="b459-4" data-blocks='[["BL_459.5",459,[198,1203,1173,912]]]'>The allegation that a suit cannot be sustained upon a township order is a technicality. The township is as much protected by the judgment as though the plaintiff had brought suit upon the original indebtedness, and had offered the order merely as evidence of the debt. It has been said in some cases that an action does not lie on such paper; that it is neither a bill, note, check, nor contract, nor is it a satisfaction of the original indebtedness: Dyer v. Covington Tp., <a href="/pa/19/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="19 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="970693" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0200-01">19 Pa. 200</a>; Allison v.

In each of those cases, however, the point decided was that interest could not be recovered upon such warrants. It has been expressly held that they are not negotiable, and that suit cannot be brought in the name of a subsequent holder thereof: First N. Bank v.

In such cases, their duty requires them to place both bridges and roads in a safe condition for travel.
