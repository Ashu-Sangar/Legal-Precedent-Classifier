One of the defendants, the general contractor, filed preliminary objections to the complaint challenging, inter alia, the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas Court to entertain the action. The general contractor contends that exclusive jurisdiction is under The Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a71 et seq. The lower court overruled the preliminary objections and this appeal followed. We quash.\nThe order appealed from is interlocutory and does not involve a jurisdictional question within the meaning of the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, \u00a71, 12 P.S. \u00a7672. See Repyneck v. Tarantino, 403 Pa. 300, 169 A. 2d 527 (1961).\nAppeal quashed.",
