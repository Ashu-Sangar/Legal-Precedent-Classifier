        "text": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThe Redevelopment Authority of Altoona condemned appellants\u2019 properties upon which the Authority filed an open-end bond. Appellants filed preliminary objections contending that, since the Authority had no power of taxation and that its financial resources were questionable, the bond filed was of \u201cinsufficient security.\u201d The trial judge dismissed the preliminary objections without requiring an answer or holding a hearing. In so doing we feel that the lower court abused its discretion since a question of fact was raised by the preliminary objections as to the sufficiency of the security. In order to make a determination on the merits of that contention, an adequate record should have been made. Hence we remand the case for proceedings upon which this determination cari be based.\nAppellants\u2019 contentions with respect to notice, negotiations, and statement of \u201cneed and purpose\u201d have been examined and found to be without merit, and the determination of the lower court on these issues is affirmed.\nOrder modified and as modified affirmed; and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.",
