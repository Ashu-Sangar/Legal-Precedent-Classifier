On August 20, 1968, a hearing was held pursuant to our remand; on November 13, 1968, the hearing judge filed an opinion holding that the Commonwealth proved by “overwhelming” evidence that appellant did know of his right to free counsel for his appeal. Appellant then appealed to this Court. We need not, however, reach the question of whether the hearing court’s findings are supported by the evidence, because on the authority of <em>Commonwealth v. Littlejohn, </em><a href="/pa/433/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="433 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1921080" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0336-01">433 Pa. 336</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=250%20A.2d%20811" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="250 A.2d 811">250 A. 2d 811</a> (1969), we must reverse the judgment and allow the appeal as though timely filed.</p>

      <em>Littlejohn, </em>filed on January 24, 1969, held that where a defendant was originally sentenced to life imprisonment, the Commonwealth was precluded from seeking the death penalty if a new trial was granted. The Commonwealth could not constitutionally threaten a defendant on retrial “with more harsh punishment than that of Ms original conviction,” <em>Littlejohn, </em>supra at 348, <a href="/citations/?q=250%20A.2d%20811" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="250 A.2d 811">250 A. 2d at 817</a>, nor could it single out, for a possible greater punishment, only those who succeed in getting a new trial on appeal, <em>id. </em>at 345, <a href="/citations/?q=250%20A.2d%20811" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="250 A.2d 811">250 A. 2d at 815</a>.

The first PCHA hearing was concerned with whether defendant decided against an appeal because of fear of the death penalty, or because he did not know of his right to appeal. Thus this hearing contains a full record on the question of why appellant’s original defense lawyers felt an appeal would be ill-advised. The only question at the second PCHA hearing pursuant to our remand, was whether appellant knew of his right to free counsel; hence, there was no reason for counsel to re-question appellant’s original lawyers as to their reasons for not appealing, particularly since <em>Littlejohn </em>had not yet been decided. In light of the need for judicial economy, and in all fairness to both the Commonwealth and appellant, there is little reason to remand for another hearing which will cover the same ground as was covered at the first PCHA hearing.

But I do not understand <em>Douglas </em>or the cases which follow it to require retroactive application of all newly enunciated rules of law which might have influenced a particular defendant’s decision as to whether an appeal should be taken. Specifically, I do not regard those cases as support for the majority’s present conclusion that appellant cannot be deemed to have waived his <em>“Douglas </em>rights” if he failed to prosecute an appeal because of fear of the death penalty. Indeed, in view of the Court’s treatment of this case I do not see that appellant’s putative waiver of his <em>Douglas </em>rights is at issue.
