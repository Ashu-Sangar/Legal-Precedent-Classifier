The Condemnees’ land is located in close proximity to Pinchot State Park, a resort attracting large numbers of patrons to its water and park facilities. Along the road boundaries of the Condemnees’ property, a small number of lots have been sold, on which modest homes are erected. Although the tract is otherwise unimproved and essentially agricultural in nature, a grass airplane landing strip had been created on it by the York County Sky Divers Association in 1965 by virtue of a written lease to it from the Condemnees. The lease was dated December 14, 1964, and ran for a period of 20 years, at a rental of $1.00 for the first year; $2,400.00 for the second year; $3,600.00 for the third year; $4,800.00 for the fourth year; and $5000.00 for the fifth and each succeeding year. The strip was used by members of the lessee in the summer and fall of 1965 for the taking off and landing of airplanes in pursuit of their sport of sky diving. The lease also reserved the joint use of the landing strip to the lessors and anyone else who might erect homes on the remaining portion of their property. The right of way in question was taken by the Condemnor by a resolution adopted on March 12, 1965, effective as of November 22, 1965. It (the right of way) contained 2.94 acres, and consisted of a strip 200 feet wide running for a distance of approximately 639 feet roughly across the center of the Condemnees’ land and almost directly bisecting the landing strip.</p>

The Condemnees’ experts testified that the highest and best use of the property was as a sky park or sky port development because of the uniqueness of the terrain and the advantage of its location near Pinchot State Park between York and Harrisburg. A sky park was described as a type of residential building development on which substantial homes are erected from and to which the residents may fly their own planes, using the adjacent landing strip communally.</p>

The testimony of the Condemnor’s experts was that the highest and best use of the property both' before and after the condemnation was as a site for mobile homes or a trailer park with the possibility of the sale of lots for cottage-type homes.

Both of the Condemnees’ experts testified that they took the gross income of some $90,000 receivable over the twenty-year period of the lease which had been terminated because of the imminence of condemnation and applied thereto a 40% discount rate to reduce the gross income figure to its present value and thereby assigned a specific value of $54,000 to the leased portion of the premises, which $54,000 was included as a constituent element of their before-condemnation market value of the premises as a whole. The thrust of the Condemnor’s contention is that the effect of such testimony was to treat the rentals reserved in the lease as a separate, recoverable item of damage and that the jury should have been instructed that while the rent reserved in the lease was a proper factor to be considered in arriving at the fair market value of the property, it was not to consider this tes<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>timony of the Condemnees’ witnesses as evidence of a separate item of value which was lost by virtue of the condemnation.</p>

The formula used in arriving at the market value of property by the method of capitalization of income is to divide the <em>net </em>rental return by a capitalization rate. The capitalization rate is that rate which will attract buyers or investors and which is commensurate with the risk inherent in the particular property and the going rate in the market for comparable property. For example, if a property produced a net rental return of $6,000 per year and the reasonable capitalization rate is found to be 6%, the market value would be $100,000. Clearly the method employed by the Condemnees’ experts was at variance with the proper method of capitalizing rental income.

In the cross-examination of one of the Condemnees’ valuation experts, counsel for the Condemnor asked the following question: “Did you take into consideration the fact that the lease was entered into by Mr. Boring after he had been contacted by the Metropolitan Edison Company about a right of way?” Upon objection made on the ground there was no evidence such was the fact, the court sustained the objection. There being no evidence in the record that the Condemnee had been so contacted, the objection was properly sustained since it assumed the existence of a fact not established by the evidence. <em>Hoffman v.

In a further attempt to show that the Condemnees had knowledge of the imminence of condemnation when the lease was entered into, the Condemnor as part of its case offered to call as a witness one who had under his direction the “field right-of-way men and all of the records made by them in connection with the securing of this line.” The offer failed to state what testimony would be offered or that the records made by the field right-of-way men would show that the Condemnor communicated to the Condemnees the fact that it intended to run its right of way precisely across the center of the <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>aircraft landing strip so that the premises could no longer be used as a landing strip. Nor did the offer indicate that the records would qualify for admission under the Business Records Act. There was nothing in the offer to indicate that the proffered records were made at or near the time of the alleged “contact” with the Condemnees or that such records were kept in the regular course of business. In short, the Condemnor never offered to present any testimony by anyone who could or would say that the Condemnees were informed of the impending condemnation prior to the execution of the lease with the Sky Divers Club, much less that they knew that the power line would be of the type and at a location on the premises that would make impossible the use of the premises as an airstrip.

Moreover, an appellate court will interfere with the judgment of the lower court in a condemnation case only if it feels that the verdict was so excessive or inadequate that the refusal of the court below to grant a new trial was a clear and manifest abuse of discretion or was unconscionable and shocking to the court’s sense of justice. <em>Vaughan v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/407/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="407 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1307335" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0189-01">407 Pa. 189</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%2012" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="180 A.2d 12">180 A. 2d 12</a> (1962). The discrepancy between the valuations of the various experts who testified in this case was a question for the jury to resolve. It is clear that the jury failed to accept in full either <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>the Coudemnees’ testimony of damages in the amount of $86,000 or the Condemnor’s testimony of damages in the amount of $3,600. This was within its province under the circumstances. We find no clear and manifest abuse of discretion in the lower court’s refusal to grant a new trial on the ground of excessiveness.</p>
