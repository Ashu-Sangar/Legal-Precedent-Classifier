      <em>Miranda v.

There is no question, of course, that commitment under these circumstances is an adjunct to a criminal proceeding; therefore, the requirement that the accused post bail before being allowed to leave State custody is appropriate.

He is sent to an institution for the criminally insane, he has the sword of indictment hanging over his head the entire time, and the means of proving his innocence may be irretrievably lost. Prosecution evidence may also be lost, but this is considerably less likely, for the prosecution is much more likely to have facilities for gathering and preserving evidence than is a committed person. In any event, the fact that the prosecution may in some cases be prejudiced in no way assures each particular defendant against prejudice. Certainly cases exist where an incompetent defendant, despite his incompetence, would not be convicted. One of the most flagrant examples is <em>United States v. Barnes, </em><a href="/f-supp/175/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="175 F. Supp. 60" data-case-ids="421950" data-case-paths="/f-supp/175/0060-01">175 F. Supp. 60</a> (S.D. Cal. 1959). The facts in that case were summarized in Foote, <em>Pre-Trial Commitment, </em>supra, at page 832: “In 1949 four military prisoners killed a fellow prisoner in a California disciplinary barracks and were convicted of murder by a military court martial. Ten years later the Supreme Court sustained the defendants’ contention under section 92 of the Articles of War that the military court had had no jurisdiction over a case of murder committed within the continental United States in time of peace, [footnote omitted] Thereafter on March 4, 1959, defendants were indicted in the civil federal district court. As to three of the defendants, the court, relying principally upon United States v. Provoo, [<a href="/frd/17/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="17 F.R.D. 183" data-case-ids="3748741" data-case-paths="/frd/17/0183-01">17 F.R.D. 183</a> (D.

However, the indictment against the fourth defendant, Coons, was not dismissed; he was recommitted to the custody of the Attorney General. Coons had been brought to court from Springfield, Missouri, where he had been serving his military life sentence in the federal institution for the criminally insane. This fact together with his conduct in court caused the judge to order a psychiatric examination pursuant to the 1949 federal statute governing determination of mental competence to stand trial, [footnote omitted] After examination and hearing, Coons was found to be ‘presently insane and so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him,’ and he was returned to Springfield until, presumably, he should be sufficiently recovered to ‘participate’ in the dismissal of the indictment against him.” Here is a man, obviously not convictable, who, as Foote laments, is forced to submit to a commitment procedure which is part of the criminal process and which will result in confinement with the criminally insane. No finding of dangerousness was made in <em>Barnes, </em>nor, as pointed out above, in footnote 9, is such a finding required in Pennsylvania. There are even worse cases than this. Barnes’ defense was based solely on a point of law; if he ever recovered his sanity, he would be freed if tried. But what of the defendant who has an affirmative defense that depends on witnesses who may not be available or who may not remember when he is finally tried?</p>

Devlin, J., cogently stated: “Counsel for the defense cannot he forced to accept [an institution for the criminally insane] for his client, if on a true view of the facts, he is of the opinion that he can properly obtain for his client a verdict of not guilty. Nor can he be forced to elect. He must be entitled to retain his rights to say that the accused is not in a position to instruct him and therefore he cannot put the accused in the witness-box to tell his own story. He cannot be forced to say to himself: ‘Shall I play for safety and obtain a verdict whereby this man is detained as a criminal lunatic, or shall I, in effect, gamble on the chance of my being able to get him off altogether with the knowledge that if my gamble fails he will be convicted of murder.’ . . . There must, in my view, be a procedure which would enable counsel for the defense to have the advantage of taking both points, and if there were no such procedure I think it would be necessary to invent it, because to insist on the issue of fitness to plead being tried [first] might result in the grave injustice of detaining as a criminal lunatic a man who was quite innocent; indeed, it might result in the public mischief that a person so detained would be assumed, in the eyes of the police and of the authorities, to have been the person responsible for the crime—whether he was or was not—and investigations which might have led to the apprehension of the true criminal would not take place.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_13" id="ref_footnote_4_13">13</a>

Ct. 1758</a> (1964), can nonetheless be used in a proceeding the result of which is to institutionalize appellant against his will because he is “incompetent to stand trial.” I also believe that the Commonwealth cannot force a competency hearing on an accused who wishes to go to trial.</p>
    <p id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.8",253,[197,1167,1149,872]],["BL_254.1",254,[184,363,1153,368]]]'>Although in general a claim of incompetency to stand trial will come from an accused, here it must be remembered that appellant has continued to resist the Commonwealth’s efforts to not try him. His psychiatric condition has been raised, not by him, but by the Commonwealth. Cf. <em>State v. Obstein, </em><a href="/nj/52/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="52 N.J. 516" data-case-ids="1915315" data-case-paths="/nj/52/0516-01">52 N.J. 516</a> (1968). As a result, the Commonwealth now claims that it can use evidence to deprive appellant of his freedom through commitment that could not be used to deprive him of his liberty at a trial on the merits of the case. It should be quite clear then that the majority’s statement that “the evidentiary restrictions advocated by the appellant . . . would unnecessarily impede a diagnosis . . . which would be of detriment to the accused as frequently as it would be a detriment to the prosecution” is illogical. Appellant <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>here does not <em>want </em>an adjudication of his competency. If he did, he would suffer no detriment, for he would not raise any <em>Miranda </em>or <em>Escobedo </em>claims to prevent the use of evidence which <em>he </em>wanted to introduce and would not object to the Commonwealth’s use of such evidence in the unlikely event that it was favorable to him.</p>
    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[183,751,1154,928]]]'>In the main, the majority rejects appellant’s claim because it finds that the competency hearing is not a “criminal proceeding.” I would have thought that <em>Application of Gault, </em><a href="/us/387/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="387 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="11333627" data-case-paths="/us/387/0001-01">387 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/387/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="387 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="11333627" data-case-paths="/us/387/0001-01">87 S. Ct. 1428</a> (1967), would have put to rest once and for all the simplistic notion that deprivation of constitutionally proscribed rights could be achieved by labelling, or rather mislabelling, a proceeding as “non-criminal,” but the majority here proves that the ghost still walks the land. In <em>Gault, </em>of course, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the characterization of juvenile proceedings as being aimed only at the child’s best interests was insufficient to overcome the realities of the situation. An examination of the institution involved here reveals a striking similarity between it and the institution which <em>Gault </em>held could not be considered noncriminal for constitutional purposes.</p>
    <p id="b254-5" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[181,1692,1154,654]],["BL_255.1",255,[171,351,1145,157]]]'>The Court in <em>Gault, </em>quoting the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Musmanno in <em>Holmes’ Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/379/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="379 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1253624" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0599-01">379 Pa. 599</a>, 616, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.2d%20523" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="109 A.2d 523">109 A. 2d 523</a>, 530 (1954), stated that the juvenile is placed in “a building with whitewashed walls, regimented routine and institutional hours. . . .” <a href="/us/387/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="387 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="11333627" data-case-paths="/us/387/0001-01">387 U.S. at 27</a>, <a href="/us/387/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="387 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="11333627" data-case-paths="/us/387/0001-01">87 S. Ct. at 1443</a>. We need not argue with the majority’s determination that Farview, where appellant was sent, is not “equivalent to a prison” to find that it is close enough to be as objectionable as the institutions involved in <em>Gault </em>and <em>Holmes. </em>Staff members at Farview not only have recognized that “bars, guards, and routine” are a significant part of <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>the atmosphere of the institution; they have claimed that these factors are helpful in rehabilitation! <a href="/citations/?q=110%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%2078" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="110 U.

    <p id="b255-3" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[171,519,1147,369]]]'>The Supreme Court in <em>Gault </em>did not require as does the majority here that the institution to which juveniles were sent be “tantamount to a prison sentence.” It was sufficient that the institution had the characteristics that are present at Farview. Once this was the case, constitutional guarantees attached just as if there had been the usual trial.</p>
    <p id="b255-4" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[169,909,1148,433]]]'>Even apart from <em>Gault, </em>it is sheer fantasy to suggest that appellant is not now locked in Farview as a result of a criminal proceeding. Appellant was charged with and indicted for crimes. He was before the court which instituted competency proceedings as a direct result of those charges. Obviously competency to stand trial is not at issue unless there is contemplated a trial for which the accused may have to stand.</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.6",255,[166,1354,1149,703]]]'>The fact of the crime and the type of crime is relevant to the way appellant may be handled once institutionalized. For example, one study of Farview indicates that “public fear and outrage” resulting from “atrocious acts” influences the hospital staff, perhaps creating “more stringent release standards to certain patients, in order to satisfy public vengeance. . . .” <a href="/citations/?q=110%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%2078" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="110 U. Pa. L. Rev. 78">110 U. Pa. L. Rev. 78</a>, 94 (1961). Furthermore, the time which an individual spends in Farview will be thought of as “punishment” and frequently neither prosecuting authorities nor the public will press for further incarceration if the accused is released. <em><a href="/citations/?q=110%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%2078" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="110 U.

    <p id="b255-6" data-blocks='[["BL_255.7",255,[166,2075,1147,260]],["BL_256.1",256,[224,357,1155,1038]]]'>The fact that appellant has been deprived of his liberty and incarcerated as a result of a competency hearing which is an adjunct of a criminal proceeding causes him to be treated differently than civil committees under the Commonwealth’s mental health stat<a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>utes. Under prior law, civil committees were allowed to readjust to the outside world through prerelease trial visits, but this procedure was not available to the “criminally insane” at Farview. <em><a href="/citations/?q=110%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%2078" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="110 U.

Under the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966 the distinction is even more striking. A person, like appellant here, who is charged with a crime, detained in a penal institution and then committed can receive outpatient care under “conditions as the court [to whom application for the treatment is made], may direct, including <em>the entry of bail. . . </em>.” Act of October 20, 1966, P. L. 96, §408, 50 P.S. §4408 (Emphasis added.) In contrast, under §4406, there is no provision for court imposed conditions or the imposition of bail where persons under civil commitment are concerned. To conclude that a hearing which results in a situation where an individual cannot receive certain mental treatment without posting bail is not a “criminal” proceeding is completely unrealistic.</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[219,1408,1156,804]]]'>It is perfectly clear that appellant is being sent to an institution that has the trappings of a prison. The time he spends there, his potential for release, and the possibility of further incarceration are all influenced by the widely held opinion that his tenure in the institution is at least to some extent “punishment.” To receive outpatient care, he may have to post bail, a procedure unique to the criminal process. And he has been committed under a procedure <em>which applies only to those who are m the criminal process because they are charged with a crime. </em>I believe that appellant’s competency hearing was indeed part of a “criminal proceeding” and as a result he was entitled to the constitutional protections and evidentiary rules established in <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[219,2232,1152,102]],["BL_257.1",257,[191,358,1147,591]]]'>Turning to appellant’s next claim, while I am not prepared to go as far as Mr. Justice O’Bbien, who be<a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>lieves that it is violative of due process to require an accused to choose between competency proceedings and a trial, I nonetheless do not believe that the Commonwealth may do what it has done in this case by imposing competency proceedings on appellant against his will. It must be remembered that this is not the usual case, where an accused himself raises his own incompetency, in an attempt to postpone or eliminate his trial. Here appellant has requested a trial, but the Commonwealth has forced the competency proceeding on him.</p>
    <p id="b257-3" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[188,970,1148,536]]]'>Certainly there is considerable substance in the fear that a prisoner may be greatly prejudiced by the trial delay engendered by his institutionalization. This danger is of course one of the main thrusts of the sixth amendment’s speedy trial requirement. Furthermore, the accused must live under the threat of the indictment that continues to hang over him. As justification for this, the Commonwealth argues in effect that the competency proceeding is in appellant’s own best interests.</p>
    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[186,1526,1148,709]]]'>This claim, I believe, misses the point of the competency hearing. In practically all cases, a competency hearing will be used to test the validity of an accused’s claim that he should not stand trial. It is a sanity hearing, and cannot completely answer the question of the extent to which an accused is capable of proceeding with his case. “. . . [A] claim of trial incapacity brings into question the ability of the accused to consult effectively with his lawyer and to supply him with information relevant to the matter charged and his involvement, if any, in it. Dusky v. United States, 1960, <a href="/us/362/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="362 U.S. 402" data-case-ids="6164747" data-case-paths="/us/362/0402-01">362 U.S. 402</a>.” <em>United States ex rel. Roberts v. Yeager, </em><a href="/f2d/402/0918-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="402 F.2d 918" data-case-ids="2132264" data-case-paths="/f2d/402/0918-01">402 F. 2d 918</a>, 919 (1968).</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.6",257,[188,2246,1146,100]],["BL_258.1",258,[211,361,1157,876]]]'>Here however the determination that appellant <em>could </em>stand trial has been made by his own attorney <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>who has spent considerable time with appellant preparing a case. I agree with Mr. Justice O’Brien’s conclusion that whatever infirmity from which a defendant may suffer does not also affect his counsel, and that where there is a competency question, the court can always appoint an amicus counsel to protect a defendant who refuses an attorney. I would much prefer that an accused be protected by the opinion of his own attorney, or one appointed to protect him, than by the rather surprising solicitude of the prosecution in this case. Allowing the prosecution to raise appellant’s competency to deprive appellant of his right to an immediate trial places the Commonwealth in the position of being an advocate, opposed to appellant, who can affect appellant’s trial position by masquerading as appellant’s benefactor.</p>
    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[207,1248,1157,761]]]'>The prosecution’s actions here raise, in my opinion, a general due process problem, in addition to the speedy trial violation. The prosecution has taken a position contrary to the position it would normally be expected to take. Having charged appellant with a crime, it is now in effect telling him how to conduct his defense while continuing to act as advocate for the Commonwealth. Once appellant has been charged with a crime, it is no longer the Commonwealth’s concern how he conducts his trial, cf. <em>State v. Obstein, </em><a href="/nj/52/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="52 N.J. 516" data-case-ids="1915315" data-case-paths="/nj/52/0516-01">supra;</a> it is grossly unfair for the Commonwealth to skewer appellant on the point of one of his own potentially available defenses, and in my view this cannot be permitted under our theories of due process.</p>
    <p id="b258-5" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[205,2024,1153,319]],["BL_259.1",259,[177,357,1148,821]]]'>It is no answer that appellant may be dangerous to society should he be acquitted and not institutionalized. There is still ample opportunity to have appellant civilly committed. See 50 P.S. §4406 (commitment proceeding can be brought by “any responsible person,” as well as by certain government agencies). <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>Under those circumstances he would not be committed subject to the criminal commitment limitations and restrictions discussed earlier. This is exactly to what appellant should be entitled if he goes to trial and is not convicted. (If appellant is acquitted by reason of insanity, the new Mental Health Act dictates that this commitment, if any, be under the civil commitment procedures of §4406, 50 P.S. §4413.) I do not believe that an accused should be stigmatized as a criminal and subjected to procedures for treating the criminally insane when he, on advice of <em>Ms own </em>counsel, would be willing to proceed to trial despite any infirmity from which he may be suffering. It is not for the Commonwealth to interfere with his desires as to the conduct of his legal affairs.</p>
    <p id="b259-4" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[174,1192,1148,477]]]'>Accordingly I dissent from the majority’s determination. Since I believe that the competency hearing was impermissible when appellant wished to go to trial, I would vacate and remand for a trial on the merits of the alleged offenses. And even were the competency hearing permissible under these circumstances, I believe that its determination here was invalid if it utilized evidence in violation of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo.</em>
