L. 236, §2, 12 P.S. §34), plaintiff commenced this action by filing a praecipe for summons. The praecipe (which was not part of the printed record) named as defendants Suburban, Raff and Valley. Summons in trespass was duly served on Suburban and Raff, but was never served on Valley. According to the opinion of the court below (although not otherwise shown in the printed record) the summons to Valley was “held” on order from the attorney for the plaintiff.

On December 28, 1965, Raff filed its third party complaint against Valley, alleging sole liability to plaintiff, liability over to the defendants, or joint or several liability with the defendants with respect to any recovery by the plaintiff. To this complaint Valley timely filed preliminary objections based on noneompliance with Pa. R.C.P. 2253.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

One sought to have the original suit discontinued as to it as a defendant; the other sought leave to file an answer nunc pro tunc to the third party complaint of Raff, and stated its willingness to withdraw its still pending preliminary objections.

Having caused the original writ to be held and not served, and having failed to reissue it within the time allowed by our decisions, there was no right in the plaintiff to keep Valley on the record as a named defendant. It seems clear that the plaintiff delayed unreasonably in the prosecution of the case against Valley. Exit its action, or failure to act, invested appellant with no rights <em>vis a vis </em>Valley. Appellant had, and it exercised, the right to bring Valley into the case as a third party defendant. Valley is now in the case as such.</p>

Appellant ai’gues that Valley did that by joining in the stipulation amending the plaintiff’s complaint. We disagree. At the time this was done, the third party complaint against Valley had already been filed and served, and Valley’s preliminary objections were pending. Until they were disposed of, Valley was a party to the litigation, as it still is. Its joinder in the stipulation was proper, and in no way inconsistent with its desire to clear up an ambiguous record by being eliminated as a named original defendant.</p>

Raff is attempting to appeal the order granting Valley’s petition that it (Valley) be discontinued as a party defendant. While the <em>plaintiff </em>Peterson might properly have appealed this order, I fail to see what <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>right the <em>defendant </em>Raff has to appeal it. <em>Thirkell v.

Gas </em>Co., <a href="/pa/307/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="307 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="1138148" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0377-01">307 Pa. 377</a>, 380, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.%20313" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="161 A. 313">161 Atl. 313</a> (1932). The only possible interest Raff could be seeking to protect would be the right to litigate its claim against Valley in the same suit as its obligations to the plaintiff Peterson were determined. However, as a defendant, Raff has available to it the procedure for joinder of additional defendants provided for in Rules 2251-2275 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. Raff did indeed take steps to join Valley as an additional defendant. Since at the present time Valley is still in the case as an additional defendant, Raff has in no way been harmed by the Court’s allowing Valley to be discontinued as a party defendant. The appeal is, at the least, premature.</p>
    <p id="b274-4" data-blocks='[["BL_274.4",274,[192,1181,1154,588]]]'>However, rather than quash the appeal as premature, I would dismiss it because I do not believe that Raff can ever be in the position whereby it has a right to complain about the instant order. Apparently, Raff fears that its third-party complaint against Valley may have run afoul of the Statute of Limitations, a subject on which no decision is now necessary, and thus it wants to keep Valley in the case as a party defendant. Raff’s rights against Valley must arise through Valley’s being joined as an additional defendant, or through a separate suit.</p>
