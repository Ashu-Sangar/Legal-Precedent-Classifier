Carter. At the audit of this trust account, a petition for a declaratory judgment was filed by and on behalf of <em>the executor of a deceased trust beneficiary, </em>Alfred V. Leaman, 3rd. Alfred V. Leaman, 3rd, was the son of one of the daughters of the original testator who created this trust. In its adjudication sur the trustee’s account, the Orphans’ Court rejected the claim of said executor (1) for <em>income </em>after the death of Alfred V. Leaman, 3rd, and (2) also ruled in the declaratory judgment claim that Alfred’s estate would have no interest in the <em>principal </em>of the trust upon its termination. Alfred’s executor has appealed from this combined final decree.</p>

L. 305, 12 P.S. §831 et seq., appear to make the issue regarding principal presently justiciable. If Alfred Y. Leaman, 3rd, had a vested interest in the principal of the trust created by his grandfather, it will be necessary (a) to include the value of this interest as part of his gross estate for Federal Estate Tax purposes, and (b) of course <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>to pay additional estate taxes as a result.
