    <p id="b77-8" data-blocks='[["BL_77.10",77,[170,949,1148,371]]]'>On December 10, 1957, appellant was found guilty of first degree murder after a jury trial at which he was represented by court-appointed counsel. The jury fixed a penalty of life imprisonment, and after motions for new trial and arrest of judgment were filed and withdrawn by appellant’s counsel, sentence of life imprisonment was imposed.</p>

The first petition was filed with the Chester County Court of Common Pleas; the writ was denied, and we affirmed, <em>per curiam, </em>at <a href="/pa/398/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="398 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="1289139" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0442-01">398 Pa. 442</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20212" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="159 A.2d 212">159 A. 2d 212</a> (1960), on the opinion of President Judge Harvey, reported as <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

D. &amp; C. 2d 267</a> (1959). The second petition was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. In that case, the court remanded the record to the court below to allow opportunity for a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing as to the voluntariness of a confession admitted into evidence at petitioner’s trial. <em>U. S. ex rel. Butler v.

On appeal, the action of the District Court was affirmed, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit holding that the issue of the voluntariness of petitioner’s confession had been fully litigated and correctly determined in the state courts and in the District Court: <em>United States ex rel.

The petition was dismissed by the court below, and we affirm the order of dismissal.</p>
    <p id="b78-5" data-blocks='[["BL_78.5",78,[207,1289,1154,317]]]'>It is clear that appellant’s first argument was considered and rejected by this court in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v.

Appellant argues that such withdrawal was not knowingly or intentionally made and that in consequence of that withdrawal he was denied his right to appeal. We note that Judge Harvby in passing on appellant’s first writ of habeas corpus noted that prior to withdrawal <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>of the motions, appellant’s counsel stated in open court, in the presence of appellant, that the question had been discussed between them on numerous occasions and that the withdrawal was the appellant’s desire. Appellant confirmed his awareness of the effect of withdrawing the motions in response to an on-record inquiry by the sentencing judge. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v.
