The use of this drug was discontinued on April 28th, upon which date Stukes was given one dose of cogentin <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>to combat drowsiness, one of the side effects of thorazine.

It must, however, be remembered that it was not the district attorney who applied to the court for Stukes’ psychiatric examination. Rather it was Dr. Guy, the prison psychiatrist, <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>who made the application.

However, there is no evidence in the record that Stukes was at all influenced by drugs at his trial. Major tranquilizers were given to Stukes for the span of three days, from April 26 to April 28, 1967. Thereafter librium, a minor tranquilizer which has no general depressing effect on the mind, but merely relieves anxiety, was given to Stukes in 10-milligram doses three times daily until June 13th. At that time, as noted before, the quantity of librium given to Stukes was reduced to one 10-milligram dose per day before bedtime. The jury was not sworn until June 20th. Dr. Guy testified that the effects of librium continue for four or five hours. It is thus apparent that throughout his trial (and indeed for the entire period of his <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>incarceration except, of course, for the three days in late April when Stukes was given thorazine and eongentin), Stukes was entirely unaffected by drugs, as far as his ability to confer with counsel is concerned. In respect to this, it should also be noted that trial counsel of extensive experience and recognized ability admittedly were “in constant communication” with Stukes during his confinement, and never once complained of his lack of competency to stand trial or inability to confer with them until June 14, 1967, after they learned of the tests ordered by Judge Carroll.</p>

On May 10th, Lena Alexandroff, the victim, died, and the charge of murder was added to the previous charges. The grand jury returned the murder indictments against Stukes and the two others who participated in the crimes, Burgess and Dessus, on the same day, May 10th.

United States, </em><a href="/us/360/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="360 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="8890" data-case-paths="/us/360/0001-01">360 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/360/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="360 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="8890" data-case-paths="/us/360/0001-01">79 S. Ct. 991</a> (1959). The guarantee of a speedy trial “is an important safeguard to prevent undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial, to minimize anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation and to limit the possibilities that long delay will impair the. ability of an accused to defend himself. However, in large measure because of the many procedural safeguards provided an accused, the ordinary procedures for cxdminal prosecution are designed to move at a deliberate pace. A requirement of unreasonable speed would have a deleterious effect both upon the rights of the accused and upon the ability of society to protect itself.” <em>United States v. Ewell, </em><a href="/us/383/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="383 U.S. 116" data-case-ids="6168414" data-case-paths="/us/383/0116-01">383 U.S. 116</a>, 120; <a href="/us/383/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="383 U.S. 116" data-case-ids="6168414" data-case-paths="/us/383/0116-01">86 S.

It does not preclude the rights of public justice.” <em>Beavers v.

We said at page 601: “Because approximately thirty-three months elapsed between petitioner’s arrest and his trial, he now claims that he was denied his right to a speedy trial under both the federal and state constitutions. We cannot agree. In the first place, the delay was not the result of improper prosecutorial tactics, but rather because petitioner’s co-conspirators were tried first and because of the complexity of issues involved in the prosecution’s case. Under the circumstances the delay cannot be categorized as unreasonable. Secondly, petitioner knew about his impending trial during the entire period of his incarceration and has not alleged how, if at all, the delay prejudiced his own trial preparation.”</p>
    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[216,1345,1154,858]]]'>A quick perusal of the procedural chronology of this case, outlined above, reveals that the Commonwealth acted expeditiously, considering all of the circumstances, in bringing Stukes to trial. Fourteen months elapsed between his arrest and his trial. We can say here, as we did in <em>DeMoss, </em>supra, that “the delay was not the result of improper prosecutorial tactics but rather because [Stukes’] co-conspirators were tried first and because of the complexity of the issues involved in the prosecution’s case.” We agree with the lower court that the fourteen-month delay permitted Stukes’ counsel to investigate the facts of the case quite thoroughly; it gave them the opportunity to observe the trials of Burgess and Dessus, and to prepare a defense with the knowledge of what the Commonwealth presented in those trials.</p>

The district attorney has the discretion to schedule prosecutions as and when he deems appropriate, and no abuse of that discretion is evident here. Stukes asserts that the delay prejudiced his case because of the interim unfavorable publicity referring to him as the “third man” of a trio of bandits; the lower court answered this argument by saying that “the delay caused the heat of this publicity to pass”; we agree with the lower court.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[155,1018,1151,807]]]'>Additionally, Stukes argues that severe prejudice resulted to him at his trial by the damaging testimony of Paula Tuchar and her mother, Natalie, to the effect that Stukes was an accomplice of Burgess and Dessus, that he molested Paula, and actually raped Natalie. This testimony was not completely consistent with the statements of Paula and Natalie given to the police shortly after the occurrence, nor with their testimony before the committing magistrate, nor with the testimony of Natalie at the trials of Burgess and Dessus. Stukes argues that if his motions for an immediate trial had been granted with dispatch, he would have been tided and acquitted, because at that time, neither Paula nor Natalie had implicated him in the crimes committed against them.</p>

We must assume that any change <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>in the testimony of the Tuchars was voluntary since Stukes has not demonstrated that such change resulted from improper prosecutorial tactics. Stukes’ counsel very effectively cross-examined the Tuchars about their testimonial inconsistency, and the jury evidently believed the witnesses. Certainly, an accused does not have a constitutional right to be tried at the very moment when the evidence seems to be most favorable to him, unless, of course, he can demonstrate that some constitutional right of his would be impaired by the delay.</p>

Rules of Criminal Procedure 304-307 was excused by the fact that the examination was not instigated by the district attorney. I do not find that fact to be in the least bit relevant, and I see nothing in the Rules to support the distinction which the majority sees between an examination requested by the district attorney and one requested by a prison psychiatrist. What the majority has done, in reality, is to provide a convenient mechanism for the Commonwealth to consistently and completely circumvent the notice requirements of the Criminal Rules. As long as the district attorney makes sure he “knows nothing,” no notice need be given to counsel under the majority’s theory.</p>

      <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>In my view, appellant’s counsel could have successfully moved to suppress the psychiatric report obtained in violation of the Criminal Rules had he chosen to do so. This, however, was not the strategy utilized. Instead, counsel requested and received a hearing at which the psychiatrists who prepared the report testified and were cross-examined. At the conclusion of the testimony, counsel did not dispute the findings of the doctors, but instead made their testimony the basis for his argument. Counsel at that point argued to the trial court that “if there existed any doubt in your mind concerning the mental ability of the defendant to cooperate with his counsel in the past or to presently cooperate with his counsel, such doubt has been firmly resolved after hearing his [this?] testimony. I think that it would do little purpose for me to repeat what the doctors have to say.” Under these facts, I do not see how appellant was prejudiced by the failure of his attorney to receive notice of the psychiatric examination, and although I strongly disapprove of the violation of our Criminal Rules, I do not think that a reversal is warranted in this case.

It is possible, of course, that the examination can also result in the eliciting of incriminatory statements, in <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>which case, it' <em>is </em>a critical stage and counsel is necessary.

    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[232,696,1158,961]]]'>■ I cannot accept the majority’s facile statement that counsel was not necessary at the psychiatric examination because in an inquiry into competency, appellant had “nothing to lose.” Were we dealing with a competency <em>hearing, </em>at which both sides were entitled to produce psychiatric evidence to support their positions, I have no- doubt that counsel should be required, even though the-accused would there too have “nothing to lose.” Obviously if a result is reached contrary to the one the-accused favors, he has “lost” something. Here however, there was no competency hearing. The hearing that was held, at which appellant’s counsel accepted the psychiatric report, was in actuality a hearing on appellant’s request for bail and a continuance. Counsel was present at that hearing in any case. Since counsel was not necessary at the psychiatric examination under <em>Wade, </em>I do net believe that appellant has any grounds for relief on this claim either.</p>
