In <em>Swedloff, </em>the plaintiffs, B. Barry Swedloff (the driver) and Edward Robinson (the passenger), sued the PTC. PTC severed B. Barry Swedloff as plaintiff and joined him and his brother, Jack G. Swedloff, the owner, as additional defendants. Jack G. Swedloff was insured by the American Surety Company. At the direction of the Surety Company, the law firm of White &amp; Williams entered an appearance for the additional defendants. White &amp; Williams addressed interrogatories to Robinson and filed an answer to the complaint of the PTC. Two months after the filing of the answer, White &amp; Williams filed a petition for a rule to show cause why they should not be permitted to withdraw their appearance. The court discharged the rule, and we reversed. We there stated: “We believe that sometimes too little consideration is given to the rights and privileges of an attorney at law to represent clients of his choice and to determine a lawyer-client representation when he desires, provided it will not unjustly prejudice the rights of his client. Permitting counsel’s withdrawal at the direction <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>of the Surety Company in no way prejudices the insured (Swedloff) with regard to the question of coverage: Kelly v.

Swedloff because of the latter’s alleged failure for over fourteen months to notify the Company of the accident. However, all parties agree that this question and this defense are not presently before this Court and were not before the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
    <p id="b118-5" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[210,1198,1156,376]]]'>“In Kelly v. Kass, 154 Pa.

We think it puts him in an embarrassing situation.’ . . .</p>

Under these facts and circumstances we conclude (1) that an attorney has a lawful right to represent in his sole discretion (a) only a client of his choice and (b) only if he is satisfied with the compensation arrangement for his services, and that right <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>is entitled to be protected by the Courts, and (2) that no harm can result to any of the parties if an Order is entered making the rule absolute, without prejudice to any rights any party may have against the American Surety Company.”</p>
    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[175,646,1150,820]]]'>Although it is not entirely clear, apparently appellee seeks to distinguish <em>Swedloff </em>on the ground that here the duty to provide coverage and the duty to provide a defense are not necessarily congruent. It urges that even if the carrier has no duty to provide coverage, it nonetheless has a duty to provide a defense. What it ignores, however, is that <em>Swedloff </em>makes no distinction between the two duties. In fact, the duty to defend, while it may at times be broader than the duty of coverage, is certainly encompassed within it. Thus we could state at page 386 in <em>Swedlpff, </em>quoting from <em>Cohen Appeal, </em>supra: “We should not confuse the right of counsel to withdraw, with the obligation of his client, the insurance company, to <em>defend </em>his other client, the defendant.” (Emphasis ours)</p>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[174,1479,1148,763]]]'>Appellee also urges that here, unlike Swedloff, the insured will be prejudiced by an order permitting withdrawal. We cannot agree. Here, as in <em>Swedloff, </em>the question of coverage is in no way decided by the instant decision, nor is the question of defense. We emphasize that we are not determining that the carrier has not breached its duty to defend the insured and is not liable in damages therefor, but merely that Attorney Lovitz need not be compelled to represent the insured. The factors which appellee asserts have prejudiced it—i.e., Lovitz’ allegedly inadequate defense— will hardly be cured by an order compelling Lovitz to continue as counsel. Permitting Lovitz to withdraw will not prejudice appellee at all in the future.</p>

      <p id="b117-6" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[141,1898,1150,451]]]'> The order dismissing appellant’s petitions and rules is appealable. We so treated the order denying leave to withdraw as counsel in <em>Swedloff v. Phila. Trans. Co., </em><a href="/pa/409/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="409 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1883224" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0382-01">409 Pa. 382</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.2d%20152" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="187 A.2d 152">187 A. 2d 152</a> (1963), although the issue was neither raised nor discussed there. Even though the often-used rationale for appealability that appellant has been put “out-of-court” is particularly inapt in the instant situation where appellant has actually been forced into court, it is apparent that as to him, the order is an absolute denial of the relief sought, and could never be raised at any other time if it were not appealable now.</p>
