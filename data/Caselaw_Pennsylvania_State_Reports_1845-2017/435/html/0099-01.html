    <p id="b130-9" data-blocks='[["BL_130.14",130,[204,1462,1153,583]]]'>At issue in this case is the constitutionality of a provision in the Philadelphia Zoning Code of 1962 prohibiting an increase in the number of units of certain non-conforming multiple dwellings. Section 14-104(3) (b) Of the Code states: “Any non-conforming multiple dwelling subject to the provisions of Subsection (1)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> shall be deemed non-conforming as to the specific number of dwelling .units contained therein, and nothing herein shall be construed to permit the addition of further dwelling units not in conformity to the regulations of the district in which it is located.”</p>

It became a valid and legal non-conforming use when Philadelphia’s first comprehensive zoning code was adopted in 1933. When the present zoning code was adopted in 1962 the building contained 46 units. In April of 1965 Silver applied for a use permit to increase the number of units to 50. This increase would be accomplished solely by subdividing larger apartments; no changes would be made in the height or bulk of the building. When the use permit was refused, Silver appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, which treated the appeal as a request for a variance and denied relief. On appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, the controversy focused on the constitutionality of the zoning code provision. The Court (per Waters, P. J.) upheld the constitutionality of the statute and denied relief. Silver took an appeal to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b131-4" data-blocks='[["BL_131.4",131,[170,1348,1150,752]]]'>The doctrine of natural expansion was promulgated by this Court some forty years ago: “Petitioner’s business had been established at its present location long before the passing of the zoning ordinance and was actively conducted at the time the ordinance went into effect; accordingly, as the property was then used for lawful purposes, the city was without power to compel a change in the nature of the use, or prevent the owner from making such necessary additions to the existing structure as were needed to provide for its natural expansion and the accommodation of increased trade, so long as such additions would not be detrimental to the public welfare, safety and health.” Gil<em>fillan’s </em>Permit, <a href="/pa/291/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="291 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1107249" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0358-01">291 Pa. 358</a>, 362, <a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.%20136" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="140 A. 136">140 A. 136</a> (1927).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

An obvious example is an owner of a non-conforming apartment building who finds that there is no longer a market for multi-bedroom units and desires to subdivide some of his larger apartments. Although our opinions have apparently never explicitly so held, we must conclude from the tenor of these decisions that the right of natural expansion is a constitutional right protected by the due process clause.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Our research indicates that this section represents the first effort by a municipality to forbid any and all natural expansion of a non-conforming use.
