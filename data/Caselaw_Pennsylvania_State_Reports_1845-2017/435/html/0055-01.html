Appellants filed preliminary objections contending that, since the Authority had no power of taxation and that its financial resources were questionable, the bond filed was of “insufficient security.” The trial judge dismissed the preliminary objections without requiring an answer or holding a hearing. In so doing we feel that the lower court abused its discretion since a question of fact was raised by the preliminary objections as to the sufficiency of the security. In order to make a determination on the merits of that contention, an adequate <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>record should have been made. Hence we remand the case for proceedings upon which this determination cari be based.</p>
