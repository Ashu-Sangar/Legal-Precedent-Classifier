Such fraud necessarily had to be centered around an event which allegedly took place on July 26, 1965—approxi-mately a month after decedent’s death—and shortly after the probate of the will. This event concerns a remark allegedly made in the courthouse at that time by Mr. Schamban concerning the will. On the morning of the first day of the hearing, the widow testified as follows: “Well, just me signed, that’s all, and signed Register of Will, that’s all, it’s nothing, just Mr. Schamban said to me, ‘Anything your name, all belongs to you,’ That’s all, and I didn’t say nothing.”</p>

After her first testimony, the widow’s counsel indicated that he would like to have an interpreter present and consent to obtain such interpreter was given by the court. However, no interpreter appeared and counsel elected to proceed to further question the widow without the assistance of an interpreter. It is further to be noted that the testimony of Mrs. Donatoni distinctly labeled the alleged statement as <em>her recollection </em>of Mr. Schamban’s statement.</p>

From the testimony the court concluded that Mr. Schamban had told the widow that “everything was her’s” and that, in making such a statement, fraud was committed on the widow. In evaluating the alleged statement it must be borne in mind that the will was made by decedent and his widow when both were present, that it was a joint will and that it was in the possession of the widow for almost a month subsequent to decedent’s death and prior to the time of probate. We fail to find, under the clear, precise and convincing rule as to the standard of requisite proof, that this statement constituted the “actual fraud” which would give to the widow the right to file an election after expiration of the statutory period.</p>

Mr. Eichman in his letter pointed out that Mr. Bauer’s request for information was limited to a request for “copies of documents” and that the copy of the important pages of the federal estate tax return, the only document then in existence, complied with Mr. Bauer’s request.

The <em>Davies </em>decision, upholding the lower court in removing the administrator, rested upon the obvious failure to notify decedent’s widow and children of any of the proceedings or to take steps to protect their interest and the failure to file the inventory was characterized by the Court “as not very important” in that case. <em>Sharpless </em>is also inapposite to the instant factual situation. The executors, whose removal was upheld, were largely indebted to the estate, were insolvent and had disposed of their business in which a considerable part of their mother’s estate was invested for a consideration, the disposition of which they refused to disclose to their coexecutor and had refused to furnish a statement of the condition of the accounts between the estate and their insolvent firm at the time of their mother’s death and the court below found that the personal interests of the removed executors were antagonistic to their duties as executors and that their conduct had been motivated more by their personal interests than by the interests of the estate.</p>

The point is that the court below found the widow had been misled, and in reliance on the misleading information, failed to make her election at the proper time.
