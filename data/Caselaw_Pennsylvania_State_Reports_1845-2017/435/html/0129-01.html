The coal companies offered in evidence, inter alia, the following: (1) Testimony of their chief engineer that there is no feasible way to support a surface structure other than to leave in place 40% to 45% of the coal within a specified area of the coal beneath each structure; (2) A calculation of the number of acres of support coal necessary to be left to support structures which on April 27, 1966, existed on the surface above the coal companies’ coal which was allocable to each municipality in Washington County; and (3) Testimony of a mining engineer that coal left for support of surface structures has no actual or market value, either directly or indirectly, to either of the appellant coal companies. Significantly, no evidence of value whatsoever was offered by appellants to controvert the complete, total assessment valuations as fixed by the Board in each of the 19 assessments.</p>

As a corollary thereto, the appellants argue that, inasmuch as the uncontradicted, credible testimony of their expert on coal valuation is that such support coal has no actual or market value to them, the total assessment in each case as it now stands is improper and invalid. Appellants deny they are seeking an “exemption” from taxation of the support coal. In fact, they concede that it is assessable at its market value but hasten to add that its market value is zero.</p>

At most, the property right affected by the Subsidence Statute is not ownership but the use of the thing owned. The Act does not destroy the ownership of the coal; instead it merely places a limitation on the right of removal so as to prevent cave-ins which might result in injury or damage not only to the surface but also to the employees and mine properties of the owners themselves. Such a limitation or restriction of use of property is not fundamentally different from the myriad of other statutory restrictions imposed on the use of property for the protection of the health, safety and general welfare.</p>

The owner of coal lands sought a reduction of its assessment as fixed at the last triennial assessment by reason of the mining of coal therefrom in the interim, <em>to the ewtent of the value of the coal so mined </em>which is the very formula which appellants here seek to have applied. We there held that the assessing authority had properly refused to so reduce the assessment since the probable quantity of merchantable coal in the ground is only one of many factors to be considered in determining the market value of coal lands, other factors being the quality of the coal, the difficulty of mining it, the state of the market, location of land and character of its <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>development.

    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[222,416,1156,867]]]'>While I am satisfied with the result ou the merits reached by the majority, I cannot permit that satisfaction to emasculate our rules of jurisdiction. <em>DuBois’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/293/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="293 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="1111100" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0186-01">293 Pa. 186</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=142%20A.%20134" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="142 A. 134">142 Atl. 134</a> (1928), upon which appellant relies to consolidate separate claims to reach our jurisdictional amount, and which the majority sub silentio accepts, has no application to the situation with which we are presently confronted. In <em>DuBois’s Appeal </em>a consolidation of different claims was permitted where the coal acreage was located in contiguous tracts within the same township and owned by one taxpayer. The tracts here are not contiguous, not in one township, and not owned by one taxpayer. Since no individual claim reaches our jurisdictional limit, I would quash this appeal and remit to the Superior Court.</p>
