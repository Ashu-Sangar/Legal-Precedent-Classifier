Rather than referring to other parts of the constitution—such as Article II, §1—we believe that “in accordance with law” merely means that the arbitrators, in conducting their hearings and making an award, may not violate the requirements of due process and must adhere to the mandates of the enabling legislation. Since the amendment to Article III, §31 is designed to permit the type of arbitration procedure overturned in <em>Erie Firefighters </em>“notwithstanding the foregoing limitation [the one in Article III, §31 which was the basis for <em>Erie </em>Firefighters] <em>or any other provision of the Constitution” </em>(emphasis added), it would seem rather odd to rule that the requirement that the arbitrators act “in accordance with law” indeed <em>did </em>require that the procedure adhere to the requirements of another “provision of the Constitution,” namely, Article II, §1.</p>

Although it is true that Article II, §1 technically has not been “amended,” the amendment to Article III, §31 <em>explicitly </em>states that an arbitration statute of the type overturned in <em>Erie Firefighters </em>and under attack in the case now before us is insulated from constitutional overthrow not only under Article III, §31, but also under <em>“any other provision of the Constitution” </em>To <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>hold that the statute before us is invalid because it does not contain the standards necessary under our decisions interpreting A_rticle II, §1 would be to directly contradict the language of the Amendment to Article III, §31, and would violate its obvious intendment as well.</p>

That act contained no greater “standards” to guide arbitrators than the statute in the case before us, but we nonetheless held that “the Legislature has announced its policies and that both the Authority and the Board of Arbitrators have standards sufficient to guide them in executing the legislative will.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20271" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="208 A.2d 271">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20271" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="208 A.2d 271">at 307</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20271" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="208 A.2d 271">208 A. 2d at 275</a>.

The great advantage of arbitration is, after all, the ability of the arbitrators to deal with each case on its own merits in order to arrive at a compromise which is fair to both parties. The arbitrators’ services are particularly valuable where, as the <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>legislative scheme here requires, the parties have been unable to reach an agreement through collective bargaining.

This statement, however, in reality could go only to the validity of the act there in question under unamended Article III, §31 as interpreted in <em>Erie Firefighters. </em>The amendment to Article III, §31, of course, solves any problem created by the fact that the public employer here, unlike the one in <em>Amalgamated Transit, </em>has the power to incur debt and levy taxes and may well be forced to do so in order to carry out the arbitrators’ award. Our holding in <em>Amalgamated Transit </em>that the arbitration provision was valid under Article II, §1 in no way could have relied on the public employer’s inability to incur debt, since this factor is irrelevant to whether the Legislature has improperly delegated its powers.</p>

L. (1965) 1656, No. 581, §1302, 53 P.S. §46302, leave them with insufficient funds to do so. However, as appellees point out, there is no indication on this record that appellants would be <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>unable to permissibly raise the tax millage so as to pay the arbitrators’ award.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Furthermore, if we do hear a case in which the tax millage, as a matter of record, cannot permissibly be raised so as to provide sufficient funds to pay the required benefits to the employees, it will still be open to this Court to rule that the Act of June 24, 1968 impliedly authorizes a court-approved millage ceiling increase to pay the arbitration award where necessary, or to hold that the municipal budget must be adjusted in other places in order to provide resources for policemen’s or firemen’s salaries. Until this issue of statutory construction is presented by an aggrieved party, we of course will not pass on it; suffice it to say here that appellants present no claim on this record that discloses a due process deprivation.</p>

In any event, we can be relatively certain that the constitutional and legislative responses to <em>Erie Firefighters, </em>discussed in the text of this opinion, <em>infra, </em>did not turn on nice questions of which part of the <em>Erie Firefighters </em>decision was holding and which part was dicta.</p>
