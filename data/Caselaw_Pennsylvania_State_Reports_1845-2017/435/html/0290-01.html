He also told the judge that he wished he would “break his neck instead of hurting his back.” He referred to the proceedings as a “kangaroo court.” The court below, pursuant to the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, §23, 17 P.S. §2041, found that this conduct was so offensive to the administration of justice that conviction and sentence were appropriate and justified. We agree.</p>

He relies chiefly upon the case of <em>Bloom v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/391/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="391 U.S. 194" data-case-ids="1767745" data-case-paths="/us/391/0194-01">391 U.

However, in <em>DeStefano v. Woods, </em><a href="/us/392/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="392 U.S. 631" data-case-ids="6173428" data-case-paths="/us/392/0631-01">392 U.

Ct. 2093</a> (1968), the Court held that <em>Bloom </em>need not be applied retroactively. The Court considered the very issues raised by appellant here: “The considerations are somewhat more evenly balanced with regard to the rule announced in Bloom v. State of Illinois. One ground for the Bloom result was the belief that contempt trials, which often occur before the very judge who was the object of the allegedly contemptuous behavior, would be more fairly tried if a jury determined guilt. Unlike the judge, the jurymen will not have witnessed or suffered the alleged contempt nor suggested prosecution for it. However, the tradition of non jury trials for contempts was more firmly established than the view that States could dispense with jury trial in normal criminal prosecutions, and reliance on the cases overturned by Bloom v. State of Illinois was therefore more justified. Also, the adverse effects on the administration of justice of invalidating all serious contempt convictions would likely be substantial. Thus, with regard to the Bloom decision, we also feel that' retroactive application is not warranted.”</p>
