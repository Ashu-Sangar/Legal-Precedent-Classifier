After that, she got up and got some soft drinks. Upon her return, she asked defendant for some money and he gave her $40, which she took and hid. She then returned to their bed, whereupon, according to defendant’s testimony, he “went wild.” He reached for a screwdriver which was on a night stand next to their bed and admitted that he stabbed her three times with the screwdriver—once in the lung, once near her rib, and one superficial wound. When she was dying she said, “Leon, I love you.” He testified that he could not recall when she said that, or whether “it could have been my own mind telling me this.” Although her death was caused by strangulation and not by the stabbing, defendant testified that he does not remember strangling his wife at all.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">*</a>

It is a position that is not even freshly abandoned; writing in 1946, Professor Taylor was able to quote the following, written twenty-three years earlier: “To conceive that an individual is either absolutely responsible or absolutely irresponsible is to fly in the face of perfectly patent facts that are in everybody’s indi<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>vidual experience and is only comparable to such beliefs of the Middle Ages that a person is possessed of a devil or is not possessed of a devil, and therefore is or is not a free moral agent.” White, Insanity and the Criminal Law 89 (1923). Yet by holding that appellant must be (wholly) insane within M’Naghten, or we will not consider his mental state as bearing on his criminal responsibility, the other opinion here has reinforced exactly that medieval and “abandoned” theory and has turned its back on years of psychiatric progress.

The most obvious answer to this is that psychiatric evidence is no less reliable here than it is when used to make the initial M’Naghten determination. See <em>State v. DiPaolo, </em>supra; 71 Dick. L. Rev. at 113 (relying also on the fact that psychiatric evidence has been legislatively determined in this Commonwealth to be relevant in setting sentence under 18 P.S. §4701).</p>

I do not think it is necessary to argue that psychiatric testimony will <em>always </em>be absolutely accurate in order to reach this conclusion. Psychiatry is a science that is inherently less exact than chemistry or physics, but that hardly means that psychiatrists engage in nothing more than guesswork. Additionally, it is safe to say that there is a growing appreciation among psychiatrists of the difficulties involved in giving useful courtroom testimony, and attempts are being made to develop a procedure by which psychiatric testimony can be even more useful to the trier of facts. <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>See, e.g., Guttmacher, Why Psychiatrists Do Not Like to Testify in Court, 20 Bull. of The Menninger Clinic 300, 306 (1956).</p>

There appears to be substantial psychiatric evidence that “the insane do not lie—they expose the truth with alarming candor.” Roche, Truth Telling, Psychiatric Expert Testimony and the Impeachment of Witnesses, 22 Pa. B.Q. 140, 146 (1951). Although a psychiatrist may not be able to establish the truth or falsity of any given statement, this is not really his aim; rather he is trained to “evaluate the whole of the individual’s mental processes from the clinical standpoint.” He is thus capable of identifying “ The suggestibility and unreliability of the intellectually defective and the demented, the hallucinations and the delusions of the psychotic, [and] the irresponsibility of the true psychopath’ and from his conclusions he renders his expert opinion.” 28 U. Pitt. L. Rev. at 685, quoting Guttmacher and Weihofen, Psychiatry and the Law 365 (1952).</p>

This is of course the rule that this Court has followed in intoxication cases. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v.

It has been argued that allowing “diminished responsibility” testimony to reduce the degree of crime will result in shorter sentences and hence earlier freedom for dangerous persons. One proposed solution is to require the jury to return a verdict of not guilty of the higher offense by reasons of the defendant’s mental disorder, under which verdict the trial judge could order confinement for care. Weihofen and Overholser, supra at 981. The new Pennsylvania Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act, Act of October 20, 1966 (Spec. Sess.) P. L. 96, §101 et seq., 50 P.S. §4101 et seq., which became effective <em>after </em>the decision of this Court in <em>Ahearn </em>and was thus not available in deciding that case, provides that: “§4413(a) Whenever any person charged with any crime is acquitted on the ground of insanity or having been insane at the time he committed the crime, the jury or the court as the case may be, shall state such <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>reason for acquittal in its verdict, (b) In such event, the court may direct the Attorney for the Commonwealth to act as petitioner to initiate commitment proceedings under section 406.” Section 406, 50 P.S. §4406, is the Act’s civil commitment procedure and allows, inter alia, an officer or agent of a governmental health or welfare organization or agency or “any responsible person” to bring the petition to commit any person in need of care. Thus while we would not need to decide in this case whether §4413 is applicable to a diminished responsibility case, it is clear that under §4406, the Commonwealth will have the option of moving to keep confined any person whom it considers dangerous, or whom it merely considers to be in need of care. The opinion in support of the order then is completely wrong in arguing that the protection and safety of law-abiding citizens would be further greatly jeopardized and the convictions of dangerous criminals substantially reduced if the testimony in question were admissible. Total acquittal is not at issue at all here; that of course is governed by M’Naghten, and the testimony is without doubt admissible. And if a shorter sentence results because of an acquittal of a higher offense, the Mental Health Act provides a simple mechanism for the Commonwealth to keep confined a still dangerous individual.</p>
