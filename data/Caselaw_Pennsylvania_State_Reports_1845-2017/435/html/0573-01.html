Every will shall be construed, with reference to the testator’s real and personal estate, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator.” Assuming, arguendo, that no contrary intent appears in decedent’s will, application of this rule of construction would require that we construe decedent’s will as if it had been executed immediately before her death on March 13, 1963, at which time decedent had no interest—vested or contingent, legal or equitable—in the assets of Miss Goddard’s estate. “It is presumed that a testator intended to dispose only of property which he owned, unless the language of the will, or the circumstances of the case as shown by <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>proper evidence, indicate otherwise.

However, these principles do not apply until it has been demonstrated that the testator at the time of death actually had an interest, recognized in law or in equity, as opposed to an expectancy in the property; absent such an interest, post-mortem disposition of the property cannot be exercised. Moreover, this interest must exist at the time of death rather than at the time of distribution: <em>Brothers Estates, </em><a href="/pa-super/156/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="156 Pa.

The same is true in the case of a prospective heir who predeceases the ancestor from whom he would have inherited.

While these assets were not realized until three years after testatrix’ death, both at the time of the execution of her will and at the time of her death, she did have an interest in these assets, unlike the factual situation in this appeal.

The lack of case law <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>on this subject may well be attributed to a general recognition that a testator cannot dispose of property in which at the time of his death he has neither ownership nor interest of any kind.</p>

It must be noted that the court did not bottom its decision on any intent to be found either in Miss Goddard’s will or that of decedent. As to the latter, the court below stated: “The intention of the testatrix appears clear. She does not qualify the language by restricting her residuary estate only to that part which she owned at the exact moment of her death, nor does she affirmatively indicate that her estate shall include amounts added thereto subsequent to her death. It would be pure fiction and a perversion to contend that her intention had anything to do with creating an intestacy permitting an heir not mentioned in her will to inherit.

In our view, these analogies are unsound. In each instance cited by the court below the testator had <em>at the time of his death </em>an interest or ownership in assets from which flowed these post-mortem benefits. Whether such an interest or ownership arose by reason <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>of stock ownership, by statute as in the ease of recovery in death actions, by contracts—insurance or otherwise—or by operation of law, to treat such post-mortem benefits as estate assets does not contraindicate the soundness of the rule that a testator cannot dispose of property in which he lacks any interest, legal or equitable, at the time of death.</p>

It should be noted that whether one has a transmissible interest or an expectancy depends on whether the contingency of taking rests upon the capacity to take. For instance, if T gives a remainder to A, should B die without issue, such an interest is transmissible by A, even during T’s lifetime because the contingency does not affect A’s capacity to take, the contingency being whether B dies without issue, not whether A is living or dead.

Moreover, every lawyer and layman knows that a testator may lawfully and often does leave in a long testamentary trust, an ultimate gift of principal to grandchildren or issue, some or many or all of whom were unknown to the testator, and can include in such a gift property acquired long after his death which was both unknown or unanticipated. There is and should be no difference in law between those cases and this. Moreover, as Page on Wills well says (§33.50) : “Unless a contrary intention appears from the will, its effect is not limited to property in which testator lias an interest in possession, but <em>includes property in tohich he has interests in expectancy."</em>

Braman, which came from the estate of Mary 0. Goddard and were not owned by Ruth G. Braman at the time of her death, are to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of her last will and testament or are to be distributed to Ruth G. Braman’s heirs because she is deemed to have died intestate with respect to these assets received after death. The majority concludes that because it has not been demonstrated that the testatrix (Ruth G. Braman) at the time of death actually had an interest in this property, it was not possible for her to distribute her expectancy through a residuary clause in her will. It is my view that such a construction is incorrect. I agree with the trial court that “If a will properly controls the disposition of a decedent’s assets, even though they are unknown to a testator, what logical reason can be assigned to hold that after-acquired assets should go to beneficiaries that the decedent did not choose to benefit with any other part of her estate? We believe it to be illogical to so hold.”</p>

Its effect is not limited to property in which testator has a legal estate; but it also includes property in which he has an equitable interest. Unless a contrary intention appears from the will, its effect is not limited to property in which testator has an interest in possession, but includes property in which lie has interests in expectancy.” 3 Page on Wills, §990. Since all parties agree that Ruth Braman’s interest in the Goddard assets was an expectancy and since there clearly is no contrary intent contained in the Braman will, it necessarily follows that these assets should be distributed according to the residuary clause.</p>

Many legal formulations of the breadth of a residuary clause indicate its all inclusive nature, unless in some way restricted by the testator. Thus our Court has said: “A catchall residuary clause carries out testator’s dominant intent to dispose of everything which he still owns or has a dispositive interest in or general power over—■ everything not otherwise specifically or effectually disposed of by will.” <em>Jull Estate, </em><a href="/pa/370/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="370 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="1234534" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0434-01">370 Pa. 434</a>, 438, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%20753" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="88 A.2d 753">88 A. 2d 753</a>, 755 (1952). But the majority seeks to undermine this general applicability by establishing an exception to the effectiveness of the residuary clause: that it cannot dispose of after-acquired property. In my judgment such an exception is artificial and, in <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>the absence of a contrary intent expressed by the testator, such after-acquired items should be distributed through the residuary clause.</p>
