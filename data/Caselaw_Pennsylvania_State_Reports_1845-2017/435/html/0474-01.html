A plethora of Pennsylvania case authority bears witness to the nature of a sanity commission hearing; those cases unhesitatingly characterize such hearings as civil in nature, not criminal or even adversary. As was stated by Mr. Justice Chidsey: “The rights of the defendant as an offender on trial for an offense are not here involved. The inquiry is not an adversary proceeding to determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant but a collateral proceeding entirely apart therefrom to inform the conscience of the court as to the appellant’s mental condition—not merely whether defendant had a mental illness or disorder in the opinion of psychiatrists or medical witnesses but, assuming that some mental illness existed, whether it so lessened his capacity to use his customary self-control, judgment and discretion in the conduct of his affairs and social relations as to make it necessary or <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>advisable for him to be under care.” <em>Commonwealth v.

In writing for the majority of this Court, Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Bell said: “This petition for a commission to determine petitioner’s mental health and the proceedings thereunder is not a criminal prosecution but a collateral proceeding to determine the mental health of the person involved for his benefit or for the benefit of the public or both.”</p>

In <em>Gault, </em>the Supreme Court held that a juvenile had a constitutional right to counsel at his juvenile hearing. The obvious reason for that conclusion was that a juvenile hearing determines the juvenile’s guilt of a particular offense. Though not technically criminal, the essential nature and function of a juvenile court is to determine culpability. For that reason, it could not reasonably be maintained that the court could act in a role of parens patriae to protect the rights of the juvenile. In short, a juvenile hearing is adversary in nature. As was stated by Mr. Justice Foktas in Gault: “There is no material difference in this respect between adult and juvenile proceedings of the sort here involved. In adult proceedings, this contention has been foreclosed by decisions of this Court. A proceeding where the issue is whether the child <em>will he found to he *delinquent’ </em>and subjected to the loss of his liberty for years is comparable in seriousness to a felony prosecution.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

On that theory, perhaps others similarly situated will not fare as well, if the majority concludes that its grace should not be continued. That is a decision which I do not believe this Court would be entitled to make. In my view, the long overdue relief granted today is not revocable as a matter of judicial policy, grace or discretion, but rather is predicated on a fundamental and absolute constitutional right.

This is particularly important where his client is inarticulate, frightened, or both. Even absent this difficulty, counsel is still necessary to present a coherent picture of the <em>legally relevant </em>facts in the case. Closely related to this is the potential need for counsel to cross-examine witnesses so as to present a complete picture of his client’s condition. Sanity hearings and determinations present legal as well as medical problems, Kutner, “The Illusion of Due Process in Commitment Proceedings,” 57 N.W.L. Rev. 383, 386-89 (1962), and legal questions rarely can be decided by one sure answer. An individual needs the assistance of counsel in order to insure that all the evidence in his best interest is presented, and to guarantee that all the evidence will be used toward a determination that is relevant to the proper legal standards for commitment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> The ultimate determination will <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>technically not be whether the individual is “insane” but whether he is able “to adapt to the society of which he is a part. . . .

This failure may result in the inability of the individual to care for himself, or it may be expressed in anti-social conduct directed at others.

See Commonwealth v. Moon, <a href="/pa/383/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="383 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="1261883" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0018-01">383 Pa. 18</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.2d%2096" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="117 A.2d 96">117 A. 2d 96</a> (1955).

Moon, supra, and Commonwealth ex rel. Hilberry v. Maroney, supra, at 544. Or stated another way, did he have sufficient ability at the pertinent time to consult with his lawyers with a reasonable degree of rational understanding, and have a rational as well as a factual understanding of <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>the proceedings against Mm?
