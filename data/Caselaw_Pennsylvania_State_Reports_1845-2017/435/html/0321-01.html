On August 22, 1968, a group of youths burst into a bar. One fired a shotgun and killed a patron. When Rig-gins learned that the police considered him a suspect, he surrendered to them on August 26th, at which time he was formally arrested. He was arraigned on a charge of murder on August 27th, and bail was then fixed at &lt;fl,000.</p>

If the Commonwealth deems itself aggrieved by his decision it may bring the matter again before any other officer empowered to hold preliminary hearings.” It is clear from this statement that the Commonwealth has not been put out of court, and that the instant appeal is interlocutory.</p>

Yet it urges that where the committing magistrate who has discharged the defendant is a Common Pleas Court judge,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> it would be <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>unseemly for the Commonwealth to take the defendant before another Common Pleas Court judge and ask the second judge to reach a different decision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[217,523,1159,1042]]]'>What the Commonwealth is asking us to do, in essence, is to overturn our long-established rule of interlocutoriness with one of unseemliness. This we will not do, particularly where we are unconvinced that the situation is as unseemly as the Commonwealth would indicate. In the first place, the Commonwealth will almost always have additional evidence to present the second time around. If the first judge feels that not even a prima facie case has been made out, even if a second judge were to disagree as to that, the Commonwealth is still well short of a conviction, and it is highly unlikely that it would rearrest with such a weak case. And even if the Commonwealth presented exactly the same evidence to the second judge, we do not envision the same dire consequences that the Commonwealth forecasts. We are confident that the judges of the Commonwealth will be faithful to their oaths of office and will be moved only by the evidence, and not by any feeling for their fellow judges.</p>

He and his companion entered the tavern, each of them carrying a gun. The Judge discharged the defendant, in spite of the fact that there was an eyewitness, namely, the bartender, who was shot and wounded by Riggins just after Riggins’s companion had shot and killed a man named Posey, who was a patron in the tavern. The Commonwealth’s appeal was quashed by the majority because it was interlocutory, in spite of the fact that a prima facie case of <em>murder by Riggms and Ms partner </em>was made out by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has the option to appeal or to rearrest Riggins and take him before another Judge, seeking to have him held for the grand jury, but this, and in some other cases, is impractical.</p>
