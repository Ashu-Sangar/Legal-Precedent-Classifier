In and by that decree, the Orphans’ Court appointed Harry W.

He remained a resident of Allegheny County until July 2, 1945, when he enlisted in the United States Army. At the termination of his service, he returned to Pittsburgh and lived in that City as a <em>lodger </em>with a married couple until March 29, 1952, when he re-enlisted in the Army. So far as the record shows, he had never resided in Pittsburgh after that date. On January 31, 1957, he married Maria Anna Fossleitner at Weyer, Austria. Mrs. Huck became a naturalized citizen of the United States on February 12, 1960.</p>

Huck, while in the military service and stationed at Nuremberg, Germany, killed his wife with a knife. Thereafter, the United States military authorities took the minor children into custody, contacted Berta Fossleitner, their maternal grandmother, at her home in Austria, and had her come to West Germany where the Army delivered into her custody the Hucks’ two minor children. <em>Ever since that time, the children have resided with their grandmother in Austria. </em>Their father, Herbert E. Huck, is mentally ill and incompetent, and since June 29, 1962, has been in the custody of the United States military authorities.

Shortly thereafter, Berta Fossleitner, the maternal grandmother of the children, filed an action in the County Court of Weyer, Austria, seeking the permanent custody of the children. That Court entered an interlocutory order granting custody of the children to their grandmother, subject to a determination of the American law of the domicile of the children, with the further provision that if the Court of the domicile of the children failed to assume jurisdiction of the children and of their custody, the Court would enter a permanent order granting custody to the children’s grandmother.</p>

Neither the children nor their grandmother, Berta Fossleitner, were made parties to this proceeding, nor does it appear that any notice whatsoever was given to them concerning the matter.

The order fixed the time and place for a hearing on the petition, and also provided that at least ten days’ written notice of the hearing should be given to Berta Fossleitner by serving her personally at Hollensteiner Str. 217, Weyer, Austria, by handing to her the citation and a copy of the petition and order of the Court dated July 5, 1967. A copy of the citation together with a copy of the petition and the aforesaid order of the Court were served personally upon Berta Fossleitner on July 26, 1967, in Weyer, Austria, by Dr. Friedrich Grohs, the Austrian attorney who represented appellee in the proceedings before the Austrian Courts.</p>

However, appellee alleged in his petition that the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, had jurisdiction because the children are <em>technically domiciled </em>in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. This averment of jurisdiction was based on the presumption that minor children have the <em>domicile of their father, </em>which was alleged to be Allegheny County because the father was a lodger therein prior to his last enlistment in the military service in 1952.</p>

If it is not correct, and “resides” in the sense of some physical presence in, or connection with the county is what is meant, then clearly no jurisdiction existed in this case. If, on the other hand, domicile is indeed the true test under our Act, I am obliged to find it also lacking under the unique facts of this case. I do so, however, on a rationale somewhat different from that of the majority. Suffice it to say that the situation of the minor children in the case at bar is sufficiently similar to that where both parents are dead or <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>have abandoned their child that the proposed salutary rule of Comment <em>i </em>to §22 of the Proposed Official Draft, Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws, cited approvingly by the majority, should be applicable. This would place the domicile of the children at the home of their grandmother, who has stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to them for most of their lives, and which is manifestly the place to which they are most closely related. Accordingly, I concur in the result here reached.</p>

    <p id="b370-8" data-blocks='[["BL_370.8",370,[205,1478,1157,708]]]'>At the outset, some additional facts should be set out. After the military authorities gave custody of the children to Mrs. Fossleitner, <em>apparently without the consent of the father, </em>the father did consent to having appellee, his brother, appointed as guardian of the children. Appellee <em>and </em>the father then jointly filed a petition in the Austrian courts, requesting an order requiring Mrs. Fossleitner to deliver the children to diplomatic officials for transfer to appellee in the United States. The Austrian courts in effect held that they could take no such action <em>until </em>an American court ruled that appellee was entitled to custody. This action was then brought in Allegheny County.</p>

    <p id="b371-4" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[196,542,1149,656]]]'>The theory of jurisdiction over minor children is essentially based on the domicile of the children, which in turn is tied to the domicile of the parent. The parent’s domicile in a given state is sufficient for that state to retain jurisdiction over a minor child in order to decide exactly the type of case which is now before us. Since the father’s domicile is Allegheny County,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> jurisdiction over the minor children ordinarily would attach in Allegheny County, since the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and more particularly the County of Allegheny, retain an interest in deciding issues concerning the family relationships of the Huck family.</p>

Comment i states that a child acquires the domicile of a grandparent or another person standing in loco parentis to the child “if both parents of a child are <em>dead, </em>or if the child is <em>abandoned </em>by both parents or by a surviving parent, <em>and no guardian </em>of the child’s person is appointed. ” (Emphasis supplied.) Initially it would seem sufficient to say that since the case before us is <em>for </em>the appointment of a guardian, it is rather odd to put a litigant out of court under §22, comment i, which by its terms is inapplicable when a guardian is appointed. But beyond this, §22, comment i speaks only to situations where both parents are <em>dead, </em>or where both or a surviving parent has <em>abandoned </em>the child. Neither is the case here. The father is, of course, <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>quite alive, and rather than abandoning the children, almost since the commencement of their stay with Mrs. Fossleitner, has been endeavoring to have them placed with appellee, his brother.</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[218,595,1163,1314]]]'>The root of the majority’s confusion is in its belief that the fact that the father is incompetent<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a> is the equivalent of his having abandoned the children under §22, comment i. This position is in my view untenable and ignores the rationale of the jurisdictional principle of Restatement §24(1), supra. “Abandonment” is a technical term which applies to only two situations: where the parent <em>deserts </em>the child, or where the parent gives custody of the child to a third party “with the <em>intention of relinquishing </em>his parental rights and obligations.” (Emphasis added.) Restatement §22, comment e. In light of this definition, the policy of §22, comment i is clear. When the child is abandoned, or of course where both parents are dead, the state in which the parent(s) live(d) no longer has an interest in overseeing the family relationship between the parentis) and child. That relationship in effect has been legally dissolved, either by death or by <em>explicit act </em>of the parent(s). The view of the parent(s), if living, is now that the child belongs to another, and as a result the parents’ state no longer retains a sufficient interest to exercise jurisdiction over the child. If both parents are deceased, of course, the same situation prevails.</p>

The father did not desert the children; rather they were taken from him, and given to Mrs. Fossleitner by the military authorities, no doubt as a matter of convenience. Nor did the father relinquish the children to Mrs. Fossleitner with the intention of having her take over his parental rights and responsibilities, but instead he has actively attempted to have the children taken away from Mrs. Fossleitner. Since the interest of the father in his children is continuing, the interest of the Allegheny County court in the relationships of this family likewise is continuing, and that court, in my view, retains jurisdiction.</p>

After appellant’s preliminary objections were dismissed, the court below ordered appellant to answer within fifteen days. Although no answer was filed, a hearing was held as scheduled. The hearing established, in part through the testimony of an eminent Austrian lawyer, that the schools which the children would attend in Austria provided neither the facilities nor the opportunities that would be available to the children if they lived with appellee, and that college training would likely be impossible. Furthermore, Mrs. Fossleitner’s home facilities were described as <em>barely </em>adequate for her, her common-law husband, and the children.</p>
