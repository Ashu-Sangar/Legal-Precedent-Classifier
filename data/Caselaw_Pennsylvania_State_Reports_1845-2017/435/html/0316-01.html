The policy relevantly provided that in case of a disagreement, the matter or matters as to which the parties do not agree shall be settled by arbitration, upon the written demand of either.</p>

Moreover, the arbitrator had been appointed and had fixed a hearing date, although the hearing itself had not begun at the time Harleysville filed its petition for a declaratory judgment.</p>

P.T.C. filed an answer which was in the nature of a demurrer, averring, inter alia, that the extent of Harleysville’s liability under its own insurance policy was already the subject of a pending arbitration proceeding—which, we repeat, was in fact the case—-and that the arbitration proceeding was the more appropriate remedy and is the remedy to which plaintiff agreed to bind itself in the policy. P.T.C. further averred that there was no actual controversy in existence between Harleysville and itself, and that there was no legal relationship between the <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>two, and that there was no imminent and inevitable litigation between Harleysville and P.T.C. which conld be avoided by a decree in the present action, and, finally, that the subject matter of this action is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commission.</p>
