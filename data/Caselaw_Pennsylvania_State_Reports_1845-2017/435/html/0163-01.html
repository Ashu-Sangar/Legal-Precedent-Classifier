The date of condemnation in that action was stipulated as <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>December 10, 1962. ■ In the instant action tbe complaint was filed on March 17, 1964; the Authority was permitted to intervene March 18, 1965; the opinion was entered January 1, 1967; and final judgment was entered November' 15, 1967. An appeal was taken to this Court in which appellant Van Cure contends, contrary to the finding of the Court of- Common Pleas of Allegheny' County, that she did have an insurable interest.</p>
    <p id="b196-4" data-blocks='[["BL_196.4",196,[205,849,1155,594]]]'>• The requirement of an insurable interest is founded upon the public policy against wagering and goes back to <em>Pritchet v.

This is an outgrowth of the statement made by Lord Eldon in an English case “that expectation, though founded on the highest probability, was , not interest.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It was reasoned that a policy on an expectancy was' in the nature of gambling. The proof that an interest was not an expectancy had to be of such a solid nature as to be enforceable in the courts of law or equity. Any other interest might merely exist at the whim of the grantor. In most instances this test has been based upon the possession of title only.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It is quite obvious, however, that the interests of lienors, bailees, lessees and innumerable other in<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>terest holders also qualify under this definition, and it seems that this theory has found its way into Pennsylvania cases primarily by virtue of some misheadnoting and misciting.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b197-4" data-blocks='[["BL_197.4",197,[164,573,1149,650]]]'>The second theory which enjoys greater support from text writers, is termed the “factual expectation” theory. It states that “anyone who has an expectation of economic benefit from the preservation of property or an expectation of loss from its destruction, regardless of his relation to the property, has an insurable interest.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> This is a broad approach which covers not only all legal interests but other interests as well. It is more closely allied to the concept of indemnity for often a man with no legally enforceable interest may suffer more from the destruction of property than a man who holds title.</p>

For example, as early as <em>Farmers and Mechanics’ National Ins. Co. v. Meckes, </em><a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.N.C.%20306" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 W.N.C. 306">10 W.N.C. 306</a>, 311 (1881), this Court said: “It is not necessary that the assured should have either a legal or equitable interest or indeed any property interest in the subject matter insured. It is enough if he holds such relation to the property, that its destruction by <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>the peril insured against- involves pecuniary loss to him or those for whom he acts.” In that case however there - ivas a. clear contract right in the insured who was a vendee of the destroyed property. Thus,, even though: the language would support 'adoption of the theory, the case involved an interest enforceable in the courts.</p>
    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.4",198,[208,739,1159,975]]]'>There have been several cases in Pennsylvania dealing with-destruction of . property after condemnation, yet the governing theory and the law remain in doubt. In <em>Heidisch v. Globe and Republic Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/368/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="368 Pa. 602" data-case-ids="1230363" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0602-01">368 Pa. 602</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20566" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="84 A.2d 566">84 A. 2d 566</a> (1951), the condemnees had not yet been paid for their property when the destruction occurred. The County Code at that time, Act of May 2, 1929, P.L. 1278, §537, required payment prior to the vesting of title. Since the consent verdict had not been entered or judgment paid prior to the fire, condemnees retained title and hence had an insurable interest in the destroyed property. The emphasis on location of legal 'title in the opinion of Chief Justice Drew makes this a clear case of the application of the legally enforceable interest theory and those who in <em>Dursie </em>wished to hold otherwise were forced to find that either title had passed or that a theory that focused on title was inadequate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The condemning resolution was passed and bond filed prior to the fire. The opinion of Judge Watkins for three judges in support of affirming the lower court’s decision in favor of the condemnee pointed to a conflict of authority as to passing of title on condemnation and then said “the decision as to whether legal title, equitable title or both passed at the time of the resolution Or the filing of the bond is not neces<a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>sary to the decision as to whether or not this plaintiff has an insurable interest in the property.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> He further set out the definition of insurable interest in accordance with the factual expectation theory. However, when it came to the application of the theory, he discussed “certain property rights” and hence confused the theories. It is, however, evident that he wished to adopt the factual expectation theory.</p>

Under §408, Act of June 22, 1964 (Spec. Sess.), P.L. 6, §408, 26 P.S. §1-408 (Supp. 1969), “The condemnor, by filing a declaration of relinquishment in court within one year from the filing of the declaration of taking, and before having made the payment provided for in section 407(a) or (b), or as to which the eondemnee has not tendered possession of the condemned property as provided in section 407, <em>may </em>relinquish all or any part of the property condemned that it has not taken actual possession of for use in the improvement, whereupon <em>title shall revest in the eondemnee as of the date of the filing of the declaration of taking, and all mortgages and other liens existing as of such date shall he </em>reinstated-”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> (Emphasis added)</p>

At that point the condemnation sale was at most conditional, <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>and the condemnee in effect held a reversionary interest. The condemnor had absolute discretion to return the property to the condemnee, and the condemnee would get the property with <em>all encumbrances </em>that existed at the time of the filing of the declaration of taking. Under these circumstances, “the title of the Authority is defeasible; . . . Thus for one year <em>the risk of destruction by fire remained with the plaintiff, </em>and, I think, for this reason ... it had an insurable interest in the building at the time of the fire.” <em>Western Pennsylvania National Bank v.

The Commission Comment to §408 makes clear that the type of damages envisioned as collectible under this section are those resulting from the property being “ ‘tied up’; there may have been an entry by the condemnor, etc. ... In Long v. Commonwealth, 37 D. &amp; C. 702 [<a href="/citations/?q=56%20Montg.%20112" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="56 Montg. 112">56 Montg. 112</a>] (1940), the court allowed the condemnee expenses incurred for plans, photographs, real estate experts and attorney’s fees.

Under the majority’s arbitrary result, the insured-condemnee is deprived of the very protection for which he had paid premiums under the insurance policy, and the insurance company is relieved of <em>any obligation </em>to pay for the loss which it had contracted and had been paid <em>to </em>bear. The majority’s result is even more arbitrary in light of the undisputed record that neither the insured nor the Authority acted improperly in any regard, violated any aspect of law, or breached any provision of the insurance contract. Nothing in the record before us compels either as a matter of law or public policy the unfair and unexpected result reached by the majority.</p>
