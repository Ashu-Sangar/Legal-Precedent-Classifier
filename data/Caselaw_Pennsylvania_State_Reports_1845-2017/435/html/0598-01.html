The court ruled that, while it was the accountant’s duty to account for that which the life tenant received under testatrix’s will, nevertheless, it was the remaindermen’s burden to show that the life tenant had not consumed these assets during his lifetime, and, if the life tenant had so consumed the assets, such consumption <em>per se </em>did not amount to a breach of trust. The court further held that the remaindermen had failed to sustain their burden of proof and that the distribution of securities valued at $53,329.50 and of cash totalling $9,770.21 should be suspended pending final determination of the estate tax liabilities of the life tenant’s estate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

First, should this Court apply the law in effect as of the date of testatrix’s will (February 27, 1942) or the law in effect as of the date of death of testatrix (October 18, 1958) ? That the law at the respective times was different is evident. In <em>Powell Estate, </em>supra, where there was a bequest for life with the right during said term to use and expend all of the income from said estate “as [the life tenant] may desire, and further to use, convert and expend so much of the principal of said estate as she may find necessary in order to provide her a comfortable and satisfactory support”, we held that the relationship of the life tenant to the remaindermen was that of debtor for the fund and that the life tenant was responsible to the remaindermen only for the value of the estate at the time of distribution and not for any increase in the value of the fund thereafter, the result being to make the sum received by the life tenant a part of the life tenant’s individual estate. Had the ruling in <em>Powell Estate </em>remained undisturbed there would be no doubt as to the soundness of the position taken by the life tenant’s executor on his appeal. However, the Estates Act of 1947 (April 24, 1947, P. L. <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>100, §13, 20 P.S. §301.13) provides in pertinent part: “A person having a present interest in personal property, or in the proceeds of the conversion of real estate, which is not in trust, and which is subject to a future interest, shall be deemed to be a trustee of such property, and not a debtor to the remainderman, with the ordinary powers and duties of a trustee [with several exceptions not presently pertinent].” Although this statute changed the basic ruling in <em>Powell Estate </em>it did not alter the ruling in <em>Powell Estate </em>that the life tenant was not required to give security if the life tenant had been given a power of consumption or was excused therefrom.</p>
    <p id="b634-5" data-blocks='[["BL_634.4",634,[226,1081,1155,1257]],["BL_635.1",635,[169,370,1147,254]]]'>The instant problem is whether <em>Powell Estate </em>or the Act of 1947 governs in the factual posture of this case. We are of the view that the law as of the date of testatrix’s death must control the construction of her will. The Wills Act of 1917 (Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, §9, 20 P.S. §221) provides: “Every will shall be construed, with reference to the real and personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.” The Wills Act of 1947 (Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, §14, 20 P.S. §180.14) provides that, in the absence of a contrary intention appearing therein, wills shall be construed in accordance with the following rules: “(1) Wills construed as if executed immediately before death. Every will shall be construed, with reference to the testator’s real and personal estate, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator.” In <em>Lusk’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/336/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="336 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1195637" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0465-01">336 Pa. 465</a>, 467, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20363" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 A.2d 363">9 A. 2d 363</a> (1939), we held that a testatrix is presumed to have known that the law provides that “his [her] will would speak as of his [her] death”. In the absence of any contrary intent shown in the in<a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>stant will, we conclude that the law which governs the construction of her will is the law in effect when she died and that the instant life tenant occupied the status of a trustee to the remaindermen under testatrix’s will.</p>
    <p id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[163,645,1153,1638]]]'>Our next question is whether the accretions, such as stock rights to the corpus must be distributed to the remaindermen or to the heirs of the life tenant. We are of the opinion that the increase in value of the corpus since October 18, 1958 (the date of testatrix’ death), as well as the corpus itself should be distributed to the remaindermen. The Estates Act of 1917, applicable as of January 1, 1918, must govern the distribution of this estate. The life tenant held the corpus of that which he received from testatrix’s estate as a trustee for the remaindermen and the remaindermen are now entitled to the corpus plus any increase in the value of the corpus less any amount lawfully consumed by the life tenant-trustee. In <em>Gramm Estate, </em><a href="/citations/?q=120%20Pa.%20510" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="120 Pa. 510">120 Pa. 510</a>, 517, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20342" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="218 A.2d 342">218 A. 2d 342</a> (1966), we said: “The impact of this statutory provision is that: (1) since January 1, 1918—the effective date of this statute—legal future estates cannot be created in personalty and all such estates are now treated as trusts with the life tenant, or another person appointed in his stead by the court, acting in the capacity of trustee; (2) the life tenant is now subjected to all the rights and duties of a trustee except as provided otherwise by the statute; (3) the life tenant or his estate must account for the value of the estate coming into his possession together with any increase in value during the period of the trust.” The corpus of testatrix’ estate with any increase in its value since October 1958 must, under the Estates Act of 1917, supra, be distributed to the remaindermen under testatrix’s will.</p>
    <p id="b635-8" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[162,2303,1146,91]],["BL_636.1",636,[220,380,1162,1701]]]'>Next, is the estate of the life tenant required to account for the sums the life tenant received as cash <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>and in liquidation of certain stock during his lifetime? We are of the view that it is not so required. This question involves an invasion of the corpus by the life tenant, an invasion authorized under testatrix’s will which authorized consumption “in order to provide [the life tenant] a comfortable and satisfactory support”. In their contention in this respect, the remaindermen seek to surcharge the estate of the life tenant on the ground that he had committed a breach of trust. In <em>Bard’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/339/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="339 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1201226" data-case-paths="/pa/339/0433-01">339 Pa. 433</a>, 437, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.2d%20711" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="13 A.2d 711">13 A. 2d 711</a> (1940), we said: “Those who seek to surcharge a fiduciary for a breach of trust must bear the burden of proving the particulars of his wrongful conduct.” Under certain circumstances, such as “a glaring error in overpayment of taxes [by more than $17,200]” the burden may shift to the fiduciary to show that he used “common sense, prudence and due care under the circumstances”. See: <em>Maurice Estate, </em><a href="/pa/433/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="433 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="1921045" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0103-01">433 Pa. 103</a>, 108, <a href="/citations/?q=249%20A.2d%20334" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="249 A.2d 334">249 A. 2d 334</a> (1969). However, in the absence of such circumstances, the burden remains with those who seek “to surcharge a fiduciary for breach of trust”. See: <em>Maurice Estate, </em>supra, at p. 107. The court below found no evidence of any improper conduct on the part of the life tenant and, therefore, the burden was on the remaindermen to prove that the life tenant had breached his trust. The remaindermen have failed to sustain that burden of proof and, as the record stands, we must find that the sums with which the estate of the life tenant is sought to be charged were properly used by the life tenant for his maintenance and support.</p>

T. &amp; T. stock. These rights constituted principal. The Principal and Income Act of 1947, 20 P.S. §3470.5 (2) provides: <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>“All rights to subscribe to the shares or other securities or obligations of a corporation, accruing on account of the ownership of shares or other securities in such corporation, and the proceeds of any sale of such rights shall be deemed principal.” The only limitation placed by the testatrix’s will on the conversion of these rights was that such conversion be only for the “support” of the life tenant and any other use would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty for which the estate of the life tenant-trustee would have to account. See: <em>Gramm Estate, </em>supra, at pp. 519-21.</p>

If the subscriptive rights had been properly exercised in favor of the trust fund, there would now be 454 shares of A.
