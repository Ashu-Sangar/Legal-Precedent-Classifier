The petition to open claimed that the plaintiff’s demand for the payment of additional insurance premiums with respect to the insurance taken out by the plaintiff was unreasonable, and that their nonpayment of this additional premium did not constitute a default. A rule to show cause why the judgment should not be opened and the defendants permitted to interpose a defense was issued by the lower court, execution to stay meanwhile. The plaintiff, in her answer, asserted that the policy obtained by the mortgagors contained a number of errors and that, by reason of their failure “to secure satisfactory insurance by a properly written policy, she did secure and obtain insurance in stock companies to properly protect her interest in the mortgaged premises”, and asserted that she acted in accordance with the terms of the bond in demanding reimbursement. Depositions were taken, and following oral argument, the lower court made absolute the rule granted on the plaintiff-mortgagee. Prom this the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>mortgagee appealed to this Court.

In that case we said, at page 337: “A petition to open'judgment regularly and formally entered in a court of law is an appeal to the equitable powers of the court where the judge sits as chancellor. He is the trier of the facts and he is invested with a wide-discretion in the consideration of conflicting evidence and the determination of the correct conclusions to be reached therefrom. Consequently, the chancellor’s disposition thereof should not be disturbed on appeal unless clear abuse of discretion is shown.” See also <em>Nadolny v. Scoratow, </em><a href="/pa/412/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="412 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1887252" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0488-01">412 Pa. 488</a>, 491, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.2d%2087" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="195 A.2d 87">195 A. 2d 87</a> (1963) ; <em>Liberty National Bank of Pittston v.

Reliance is placed on the fact that the defendants were given fair warning by a letter from the attorney for appellant of the taking out of the additional insurance for the reason that the Conemaugh Valley Mutual policy was “not considered to be as good coverage as can and has been obtained by Mrs. Stark with ‘stock companies’ ”. This letter also <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>returned the Conemaugh Valley certificates of insurance for cancellation or other disposition by the defendants. The appellees, for their part, state that a proper construction of the bond is that there is no default as long as insurance exists which is legally sufficient to protect the interest of the plaintiff, and that the appellant in insisting on “stock companies” was being unreasonable, capricious and arbitrary. The lower court pinpointed the problem as one of proper construction of the language of the bond, and concluded that it did not confer upon the appellant the unlimited and unfettered right which she claimed to purchase insurance and charge the defendants for it.</p>
    <p id="b55-4" data-blocks='[["BL_55.4",55,[180,1132,1149,818]]]'>Without prejudging the case, in which the issues have yet to be formally defined by a defensive answer and hearing is still to be had, it appears to us that the appellees may well have a meritorious defense. The mere idea that the mortgagors here, after paying $10,000 on the mortgage debt, could lose their equity and be obliged to pay almost $4,000 in attorneys’ fees in foreclosure because they declined to pay their mortgagee $141 for insurance premiums that they believed in good faith to be unnecessary and not called for by the mortgage bond, is sufficiently repulsive to have warranted the action of the trial court. That court’s determination to open the judgment and let the appellees into a defense was well within the range of its equitable discretion.</p>
