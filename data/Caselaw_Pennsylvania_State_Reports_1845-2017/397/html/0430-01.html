The Quarter Sessions Court sustained the position of the Commonwealth that these machines were gambling devices <em>per se </em>under the provisions of §60 of the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 382, 18 PS §1445. There was no testimony offered to prove that actual gambling took place on or in connection with these machines,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">*</a> or that money or merchandise, or anything of value, had ever been paid to the winners. So far as the record shows, the only prize or reward which a winner received was <em>the right to play free additional </em>games, and this is not unlawful gambling. Furthermore, although it is easy to believe that the machines were frequently used for unlawful gambling, the evidence in this record does not, in my opinion, justify the majority’s conclusion that these machines were manufactured or used and employed <em>solely </em>for the purpose of unlawful gambling.</p>

A bridge table can be used for pleasure or for gambling; it is common knowledge that it is usually used for gambling. The players play for l/40th of a cent to a penny a point, and ten cents to a few dollars change hands every evening. In each of these games a vast majority of the players are unskillful, and those who are inexperienced or unskillful loudly proclaim to uninterested companions that the winners won by chance, i.e., the roll of the dice or the luck of the draw, and that chance is far more important than skill. Take an extreme example: <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>A golf course is built for recreation, exercise, air, companionship and (when you are playing well) for pleasure.

The Commonwealth expert admitted that in his examination of the machines in custody he did not find anything which would give to the player “any money, coins or tokens, or any other objects that are redeemable in either cash or merchandise.” What, then, can the player win? lie can win the right to play extra games without paying for them. But such an authorization or privilege is not a “valuable thing” within the meaning of the statute. <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>The Superior Court has spoken to this very effect: “Bearing in mind that penal laws must be strictly construed, we are not persuaded that the legislature intended a definition of gambling broad enough to make unlawful, gaming in which the player, in addition to the pleasure of playing, stands to gain nothing but the right to play again without paying for it and the loser to lose nothing but the compulsion to let him play. We hold that the Tree games’ feature does not warrant the destruction of the machines as devices used for the purpose of unlawful gaming.” <em>(Wigton’s Return, </em>supra, page 343.)</p>
    <p id="b468-4" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[246,1010,1158,700]]]'>But, it is argued by the Commonwealth, the machines are equipped with certain “features” which, of themselves, make the machines gambling devices. One of those accused “features” is the so-called knock-down button, the manipulation of which cancels free games won by the player up to that time. The Superior Court has said that such a contrivance is not enough to illegalize the machine: “We hold that the mere fact that these machines are so constructed that it is possible to cancel some of the Tree games’ without playing them is not, by itself, sufficient evidence to support a finding that they were used for the purpose of unlawful gaming.” <em>(Wigton’s </em>Return, supra, p. 346)</p>
    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[243,1729,1155,419]]]'>Although the Commonwealth sees in the knock-down button sinister implications, it cannot be denied that the erasing button can serve perfectly lawful functions. If a player, for any reason, leaves the machines without playing all the games to which he is entitled, the proprietor, by means of the knock-down button, clears the machine so that the succeeding player may start afresh.</p>

The Majority attempts to distinguish <em>Wigton </em>from the present ease, but the attempted contrasting, <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>so far as legal principle is concerned, is like drawing a distinction between peas in the same pod. The Majority says: “In that proceeding [the <em>Wigton </em>case] there was no evidence that the players were ever paid off in money or merchandise or that gambling among the players was permitted on the premises where the machines were seized.” The same situation obtains in the case at bar.</p>
    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[179,796,1151,870]]]'>The Majority says: “What a player could win [in the <em>Wigton </em>case] by playing that type of single coin pinball machine, after the deposit of a coin, was the right to play additional free games and nothing more.” <em>That </em>is all the player can win in the machines which are the subject of this lawsuit, namely, the right to play additional free games; nothing more. The fact that after the games have been played, the score may be used as a basis for the payment of money does not make the machine illegal any more than the exchange of money between players at the end of a golf game metamorphoses golf into illegality. Because gamblers bet on a horse is no excuse for shooting the horse. A horse can be used for purposes other than circling a race track to the accompaniment of cheering and groaning money-betting winners and losers.</p>
    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[177,1682,1148,653]]]'>The grievous fault in the Majority Opinion is that it fails to differentiate between machines which are evil per <em>se </em>and those which may become evil by use. It is to be remembered that these proceedings are in rem. The machines themselves are the subject of the litigation; they are the ones that stand to be annihilated if they are proved to be gambling devices per se. A gambling machine <em>per se </em>is one which, without human intervention, deprives the player of money, or valuable thing, as the result of mere chance, or, worse yet, as the result of mechanical planning, works odds against him.</p>
    <p id="b470-3" data-blocks='[["BL_470.3",470,[244,354,1158,1030]]]'>
      <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>The slot machine notoriously falls within such a category. The person who puts coins in a slot machine looks hopefully for a shower of coins in return. The machine is so contrived, however, that in order to refresh the occasional player with a monetary shower, many others must suffer the Sahara of an unrelieved drought. Thus, the slot machine, well-termed a “one-armed bandit”, is subject to condemnation and execution because it is built for the very purpose of deceiving the innocent, robbing the unwary, and emptying the pockets of the conceited gambler who thinks himself smarter than nuts, bolts, screws and pistons all coordinating to beat him. The slot machine player has but one purpose and that is to gain money. The pinball player may or may not be interested in gaining money. He may actually play merely for entertainment, pastime and enjoyment, just as the Commonwealth expert admitted he had done for some five hundred games.</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[237,1395,1158,1027]]]'>The Commonwealth detects gambling in the meters with which the pinball machines are equipped. There is no doubt that these meters can be utilized for the purpose of determining whether a player should receive money from the proprietor or lessee, but they may also be bookkeeping devices to keep the record straight as to whether the player is paying for his games. Since the machine is, in its nature, a competitive one, (the player seeking to win a score which will entitle him to free games, and the machine itself contesting to prevent such free games), a scorekeeper, mechanical or human, is inevitable. When the proprietor of the machine comes to collect the money in the coin box he must know how many games have been played in order to make certain that the machine has not been tampered with. Thus, a meter or a number of meters, are indispensable in ascertaining how many games have been paid for, and how many became gratuitous through the skill of the player.</p>

      <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>The Majority Opinion says: “More than any other element in the ‘logic’ of these Bally machines, is the multiple-coin feature which, in conjunction with these three meters in operation, stamps all of the machines gambling devices per se.”</p>
    <p id="b471-3" data-blocks='[["BL_471.4",471,[158,624,1151,867]]]'>After this portentuous pronouncement the Majority Opinion moves on to something else. It does not say <em>why </em>the multiple-coin feature makes the pinball machine a gambling device <em>yer se. </em>There is nothing inherently wrong about multiple coins. One deposits multiple coins in a pay telephone, one inserts multiple coins in a phonograph-playing machine, one presses multiple coins into candy and cigarette-vending machines — all legally. Thus, the phrase “multiple-coin” does not conjure up anything sinister, anything hydra-headed and Gorgonian which of itself calls for decapitation. The statement by the Majority on multiple-coins is not judicial, but legislative. But, when the law of Pennsylvania is to categorically condemn multiple-coin devices, that law must be pronounced by the Legislature, not by the Courts.</p>
    <p id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.5",471,[156,1503,1148,483]]]'>The fact that the multiple-coin machines <em>may </em>be used for gambling purposes cannot ipso facto make them unlawful gaming. As Judge Kenwortiiey said: “It may be that the proprietors of the machines involved in this case will use them for unlawful gaming. But even if we were fearful of that development we have no power to make a broad, sweeping, prophylactic rule; <em>the legislature has given us no such authority.” (Wigton’s Return, </em>supra, p. 345) (Emphasis supplied)</p>
    <p id="b471-5" data-blocks='[["BL_471.6",471,[154,1996,1147,374]],["BL_472.1",472,[257,350,1153,645]]]'>The Majority finds no amusement in pinball machines. Neither do I, but I would not condemn them for that reason. There are many games which absorb the attention of mankind which leave me quite indifferent. Pool playing to me is the pedestrianism of a caged bear, card playing is a bore, quoits dull, tug-of-war infantile, ping pong an agitated checkers game. <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>But there was a time when I found all these pastimes interesting and there are many who would rather sit on the edge of their chairs watching the unfoldment of a thrilling card game of solitaire than to follow a shooting, yelling Westerner on television. This is all a matter of taste and inclination, and we have no authority whatsover to interfere with the pastime of the people. All these games may become the media for gambling, but they are not, for that reason, to be thrown against a blank wall and executed like the fateful Cadillacs which drew the fire of Commonwealth’s counsel at the oral argument.</p>
    <p id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.4",472,[254,1007,1153,152]]]'>The Majority says: “There can be no reward in terms of amusement from the mere insertion of coins into an unresponsive machine.”</p>
    <p id="b472-5" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[251,1172,1156,482]]]'>This is about as pla-titudinously dreary a statement as one would not want to encounter in a judicial opinion. Of course, there is no amusement from the “mere insertion of coins into an unresponsive machine.” There is no reward either from dropping coins in a telephone box but there can be a rewarding experience in the conversation which follows. There is no reward in paying money at a box office, but there is a rewarding experience in the theatrical performance which is seen.</p>
    <p id="b472-6" data-blocks='[["BL_472.6",472,[250,1663,1154,703]],["BL_473.1",473,[159,357,1148,317]]]'>The Majority, in signing the death warrant of the 17 pinball machines, says: “They [the pinball machines] are craftily designed, artfully constructed, and ingeniously deceptive in their appeal, and in our opinion clearly are gambling devices per se.” This imparts no enlightenment whatsoever to the pinball machine owner as to what is wrong about the machine. To say that machines are craftily designed and artfully constructed means nothing, so far as deciding the issues in this lawsuit is concerned. Television sets are craftily designed and artfully constructed. Then, to say that the pinball machines are “ingeniously deceptive” is about as informative to the public as to say that sleight-<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>of-hand is ingeniously deceptive. Many innocuous devices in amusement parks, carnivals and on boardwalks at seaside resorts are made up of the most ingeniously deceptive and complicated machinery in order to offer divertisement and delectation to children and grownup juveniles, but this does not make them <em>mala in se.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b473-3" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[158,694,1147,650]]]'>In summing up I would say the following. A pinball machine in itself is not a gambling device. That much must be admitted by the Commonwealth. A normal pinball machine is as innocuous as bingo which, in some ways, it attempts mechanically to reproduce. Of course, the machine, like any other apparatus, device, game, sport, or diversion, may be turned into a gambling instrument. The person who employs that gambling instrument for gaming may be prosecuted under the State gambling laws. The instrument, however, may not be forfeited and destroyed unless it cannot be used for any purpose other than gambling.</p>
    <p id="b473-4" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[157,1363,1146,262]]]'>The Majority says that the pinball machines in this litigation are gambling devices but it fails to specify how and why they are gambling devices, which subjects them to execution. <em>The record utterly fails to show that these machines were ever used for gambling.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[154,1645,1149,700]]]'>We thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the Majority has, after a certain amount of technological discussion, arbitrarily condemned them to destruction. I believe that the owners and lessees of similar machines throughout the Commonwealth are entitled to know wherein the machines are illegal and this explanation should be given, in language which will enable them to make such adjustments as will bring the pinball machines (which are intrinsically harmless) into the realm of legality. The proprietors of five million dollars worth of 'private property are entitled at least to this. Because the Opinion of this Court does not do this, I must dissent.</p>
