    <p id="b658-11" data-blocks='[["BL_658.19",658,[243,1584,1154,645]]]'>Jefferson Memorial Park instituted this action in assumpsit to recover from the defendant, West Jefferson Hills School District, a refund for allegedly over-assessed taxes which the plaintiff paid in full to the defendant school district under timely protest. After the pleadings had been completed, both parties moved for judgment on the pleadings. The court gave judgment for the defendant and the plaintiff has appealed. The questions raised on the appeal are whether the plaintiff’s complaint states a cause of action and, if so, whether judgment on the pleadings should be entered for the plaintiff.</p>

A part of the property is located within the boundaries of the West Jefferson Hills School District while the remainder lies in Baldwin School District. However, all of the plaintiff’s real estate was assessed by the Allegheny County Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review for the triennium (1955-56-57) as located in the West Jefferson Hills School District. The plaintiff avers that it appealed the assessment to the County Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Act of June 21, 1939, P. L. 626, §11, as amended by the Act of May 26, 1943, P. L. 625, §1 (72 PS §5452.11).</p>

The complaint further avers that “As a result of the [plaintiff’s] Appeal so taken and hearings held thereon, official change orders were issued on September 7, 1956, and January 15, 1957, by the said Board of Assessment, Appeals and Review whereby the aforesaid erroneous assessments were corrected.”</p>

The defendant school district received notice of this correction through its receipt of the specified change orders. Also, on January 15, 1957, the County Board issued official change orders exempting from the West Jefferson Hills School District’s assessment of the plaintiff’s real estate for the years 1955 and 1956 the portion of the plaintiff’s property utilized as a cemetery.

L. 510, §1 (72 PS §5452.17), treats with the effect of appeals from triennial county assessments and, in presently material part, provides that “No appeal taken from any assessment made under this act shall prevent the collection of the taxes based upon such assessment, but in case such assessment shall be or shall heretofore have been reduced ... if the taxes based upon such assessment have been paid, the excess taxes collected shall be refunded to the person or persons who shall have paid the same.”</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[139,1284,1147,319]]]'>On the basis of the facts pleaded in the complaint, the plaintiff has set forth a good cause of action under the above-quoted provision of the Act of 1939, as amended, for a refund of the excess taxes which it paid under protest to West Jefferson Hills School District in the circumstances averred in the complaint.</p>
    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.6",661,[135,1614,1149,486]],["BL_662.1",662,[250,364,1159,1032]]]'>In an effort to sustain the judgment, the defendant asserts that, when the respective motions for judgment on the pleadings were argued in the court below, the plaintiff did not rely upon the Act of 1939 as authority for its claim for refund but, instead, cited and relied upon an earlier statute whose requirements the plaintiff’s claim did not satisfy, viz., the Act of May 22, 1933, P. L. 853, Art. V, §518, as amended by the Act of July 15, 1935, P. L. 1007, §1 (72 PS §5020-518).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>
      <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>For present purposes so much may be assumed. However, the rule that, on appeal, we will not consider a matter which the appellant did not raise in the court below or the lower court did not pass upon is not applicable to a question whether the facts pleaded in a complaint state a good cause of action. What we review in such instance on appeal is exactly what the court below had before it, viz., the sufficiency of the complaint under relevant law. If there is a positive statute that, on the basis of the facts pleaded, gives the plaintiff a cause of action, no other course is open to a court than to sustain the complaint. The fact that the plaintiff may have relied in the court below upon an inapplicable statute does not impair or thwart the efficiency of the complaint to set forth a justiciable cause so long as there is a statute conferring the right under the facts pleaded. It follows, therefore, that the court below erred in entering judgment on the pleadings for the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b662-4" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[248,1406,1154,263]]]'>Coming to the plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, it is clear that the defendant’s answer either expressly admits or does not competently traverse, material averments of the complaint, and avers, in addition, incorrect or irrelevant conclusions of law.</p>

The undisputed documentary proofs consisting of exhibits attached to both the complaint and the answer and the provisions of the Act of 1939, as amended, render unnecessary any discussion <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>of the defendant’s above-stated contention. The plaintiff paid timely the overassessed taxes in full and the assessment was thereafter reduced by the County Board. Consequently, appeal or no appeal, the plaintiff, as the party having paid the overassessed taxes, became entitled to a refund for the excess taxes upon entry of the Board’s change orders.</p>
    <p id="b663-3" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[164,722,1145,866]]]'>The Act of 1939, as amended by the Act of May 21, .1943, P. L. 510, §1 (72 PS §5452.17), does not make an appeal to the County Board from an assessment a prerequisite for a determination of a taxpayer’s right to a refund. What the Act provides is that any such appeal shall not prevent the collection of the taxes based upon such assessment but, if such assessment is reduced and the taxes, as originally assessed, have been paid, the party making such payment shall be entitled to a refund of the excess taxes. The facts averred in the complaint bring the plaintiff’s claim within these requirements. In fact, defendant’s Exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 4, attached to its answer (see Supplemental Record at lb to 4b, inclusive, of defendant’s brief) themselves confirm the plaintiff’s right to a refund under the terms of the Act of 1939, as amended.</p>

We there said that “Appellant’s contention that there can be no recovery of the excess, since the payments were admittedly voluntary, is of no merit .... [H]ere the statute . . . declares that in case an assessment of property shall, on appeal, be reduced, Then the excess shall be returned to the person or persons who shall <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>have paid the same.’ . . .
