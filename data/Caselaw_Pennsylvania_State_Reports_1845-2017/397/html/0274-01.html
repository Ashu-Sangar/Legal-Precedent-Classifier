Plaintiff’s theory, which is unsupported by any authority, is that defendants’ filing of an involuntary creditor’s petition in bankruptcy against Lewis Dion when they knew they had no claim against Dion individually caused plaintiff to lose a lien which it obtained one month previously, and thus constituted an intentional <em>abuse of </em>civil process for which damages are recoverable in a State Court.</p>
