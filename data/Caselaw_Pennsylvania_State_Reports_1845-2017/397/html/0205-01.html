    <p id="b235-9" data-blocks='[["BL_235.12",235,[178,1783,1147,310]]]'>The accident happened in broad daylight, about 4:15 p.m. on May 10, 1952, about 3 miles east of the borough of Mahanoy City. The highway is a 2 lane macadam road, 18 feet in width with a 2 to 3 feet berm on each side and running in a generally east-west direction.</p>

They agreed to meet in another cafe in Mahanoy City. Downey and Zemlayage left the cafe, got into Downey’s car with Zemlayage driving, and proceeded westwardly on Route 45 toward Mahanoy City. Rymorowicz followed in his own car. According to the testimony of both Downey<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and Zemlayage<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> they were travelling at about 40 miles per hour. As their car reached a point 80 feet east of the railroad crossing Rymorowicz proceeded to pass them on their left, crossed the railroad and then instead of returning to the right or westbound lane continued westwardly on the eastbound lane with one or both of his left wheels off the improved portion of the highway and on the <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>berm of the road, “bucking” for a distance of 125 feet where it struck a utility pole and came to a stop.</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[176,465,1153,1581]],["BL_238.1",238,[231,356,1155,365]]]'>Plaintiffs testified that as Rymorowicz passed them they saw a motor vehicle approaching from the west in the eastbound lane at about 65 miles an hour. Downey says that this oncoming vehicle was 250 feet away when he first saw it (see R. 132a) and Zemlavage says he could see it from a point 700 feet away (see R. 340a, 341a). When Zemlavage observed the Rymorowicz vehicle “bouncing and bucking along” the edge of the left lane he continued in his own right or westbound lane while the oncoming eastbound vehicle continued speeding toward them. When Rymorowicz’s car struck the utility pole it extended in a southwest direction with its front end off the improved portion of the highway and its rear protruding and partially blocking the eastbound lane of travel. According to the plaintiffs they continued their westward path following Rymorowicz by 2 or 3 car lengths at the same rate of speed, i.e., 35 to 40 miles per hour.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> They observed the erratic behavior of the Rymorowicz car aisd its subsequent collision with the utility pole and the third vehicle approaching at a speed of 65 to 70 miles per hour, without stopping, pulling off on the berm, or even without decreasing speed. Plaintiffs’ vehicle continued to occupy its right or westbound lane following Rymorowicz’s when Zemlavage observed the eastbound car swerve from his right-hand lane to the westbound lane then occupied by plaintiffs’ vehicle. In spite of the obvious danger Zemlavage pulled over to his left side and endeavored to steer the vehicle between the Rymoro<a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>wicz car and the speeding eastbonnd vehicle. The left front of plaintiffs’ car struck the right rear of the Rymorowicz car, then continued westwardly, out of control, and struck another utility pole farther up the highway. According to these facts the contributory negligence of Zemlavage, the driver, is obvious. No other inference is reasonable.</p>

    <p id="b238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[227,1126,1153,318]]]'>This is just such a clear case. When Zemlavage saw Rymorowicz pass him to his left and he observed the vehicle obviously out of control travelling westwardly on the eastbound lane of the highway, with a speeding car approaching from the west, impending-disaster was plainly foreseeable to any reasonable man.</p>
