Route No. 222 about one mile north of Quarry-ville in the Township of Providence, Lancaster County, a truck operated by defendant Weik passed him in the opposite direction and spilled part of a load of stone on the patrol car. The trooper, noticing that the truckload was unusually high, turned his car around and pursued it. A little more than a mile thereafter he halted the truck in Strasburg Township and examined Weik’s weight slip. This showed that the gross weight was unlawful.</p>

IX, §903, as amended, 75 P.

In the case of Muth, the same situation appears except that the fine and costs amounted to $403.50. We therefore treat both cases as if a hearing had been waived. Thereafter both Weik and Muth petitioned the court of quarter sessions for allowance of an appeal which was granted and a hearing was held. At the hearing it was stipulated that the testimony in both cases would be the same except as to weight. The court, after a hearing <em>de </em>novo, found the defendants guilty and sentenced each respectively to pay the aforesaid fines and costs. From these judgments of sentence Weik and Muth appealed to the Superior Court which affirmed. This Court, on petition, allowed an appeal from the decision of the Superior Court. On appeal here, the issues and records of both cases were consolidated for argument and will be disposed of in one opinion.</p>

The Act of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, Art. XII, §1211, as latest amended, 75 P. S. §741, provides <em>inter alia: </em>“Whenever an arrest is made upon view . . . under the provisions of this section,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the officer making the arrest shall forthwith take the defendant before the nearest available magistrate in the city, borough, incorporated town, or township, where the alleged offense occurred.” The arrest, however, does not of itself constitute the commencement of a judicial proceeding. It is necessary after having arrested the accused that the arresting officer file an information. Such informations “shall be brought before the nearest available magistrate within the city, borough, incorporated town, or township, in the county where the alleged violation occurred: . . .” Act of May 1, 1929, P.L. 905, Art.

The real issue is — what is it that The Vehicle Code requires the arresting officer to do? The quarter sessions court and a majority of the Superior Court held that the legislature clothed the arresting officer with discretion to take the offender before the “nearest available magistrate” in either Strasburg or Providence Township without regard to the municipal boundary lines of the place wherein he was arrested. The defendants, supported by the minority opinion of the Superior Court, contend that the legislature commanded the arresting officer to take the accused to the magistrate who is nearest available to the place where the arrest was made.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> There is no other appellate authority directly in point.</p>

(1) the occasion and necessity for the law; ... (3) the mischief to be remedied; (4) the object to be attained; (5) the former law, if any, including other laws upon the same or similar subjects; (6) the consequences of a particular interpretation. . . .”</p>

What does “nearest available” mean? Nearest available to what? There must be some point from which to judge. In the case of a continuing offense as many as a dozen different justices might be the “nearest available” if the officer is permitted to select any point along the journey as being the point of reference. It would de<a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>feat the whole purpose of the legislation and introduce confusion if we were to accept such a view of the situation. That would, permit a peace officer to follow an overloaded truck for many miles and then make the arrest at any place <em>he </em>names as the place where the violation occurred. It is Ms duty to make the arrest as soon as it reasonably may be made and thus prevent further violation. There is an order of primacy in such matters and it is the jurisdiction in which the offender is arrested which has first call upon Mm. Obviously the legislature ordained that at the earliest time consistent with the circumstances of the case the offender be delivered from executive authority into judicial authority so that there he no arbitrary interference with his right to a hearing or the furnishing of bail.</p>

Our conclusion as to <em>arrests on view </em>is in accord with the legislative mandate as to <em>arrests on warrant. </em>In the latter instance where the circumstances justify the issuance of a warrant, it is the duty of the officer who serves such warrant to take the defendant before a magistrate in the municipality where the arrest is made in order to facilitate entry of bail or waiver of hearing.
