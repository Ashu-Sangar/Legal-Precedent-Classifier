    <p id="b30-9" data-blocks='[["BL_30.14",30,[237,1195,1157,707]]]'>Louis J. Grimaldi is the owner of, and the only barber in, a barber shop located at 1138 South 58th Street, Philadelphia. Thus, he has no employees, and at the same time he has no employer. He is a one-man operation, solely and exclusively. He opens his shop when he pleases, he closes it when it suits his will to do so. He has no labor trouble because he employs no labor. He has no dispute with an employer because, obviously, he has no employer. He is as much a one-man operation as a man on a unicycle. He has as much undisputed control over his barber shop as Robinson Crusoe had over his island on the Thursday before Friday arrived.</p>

On that morning, there appeared outside his shop several men wearing sandwich signs calling upon Grimaldi to join Local No. 9, Journeymen Barbers, <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>Hairdressers and Cosmetologists International Union (hereinafter to be referred to as Local No. 9). This union is made up of barbers, hairdressers and cosmetologists who are employees in barber and beauty shops owned by others. Grimaldi is not qualified for membership in this union because he is not an employee. As already stated, and as will be repeated, he is a one-man institution. He works for no one else. He toils only for himself. He cuts hair, shaves faces, administers shampoos, applies lotions and does all that is traditionally expected of a barber. As absolute owner of his place of business, and as master of himself and his work, he would be entirely out of place in a union composed of men who are employees in shops in which they do not have the slightest proprietary interest.</p>
    <p id="b31-4" data-blocks='[["BL_31.4",31,[173,1180,1147,479]]]'>At meetings of Local No. 9, the discussions naturally revolve around such subjects as wages to be asked of employers, working conditions to be requested of employers, vacations to be sought of employers. Grimaldi could not participate in such discussions because it would be grotesque for him to ask himself how much salary he should pay himself, how much vacation he should allow himself, and what working conditions he should demand of himself.</p>

The picketing was effective. Many patrons turned on their heels when they read the signs; men with supplies refused to cross the picket line; deliveries of towels ceased. Stagnation was immediate and decisive. With customers frightened away, supplies cut off, and laundry service severed, it could only be a matter of days until Grimaldi’s business Avould expire like an undersea diver whose oxygen line has knotted. He appealed to the courts. He petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>County to restrain and enjoin Local No. 9, with its officers and members, from picketing Ms shop, from interfering with Ms business, and from intimidating or attempting to intimidate Mm to join Local No. 9.</p>
    <p id="b32-4" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[230,556,1155,535]]]'>After a hearing before Judge Waters, a preliminary injunction issued, and then, on March 20, 1958, a full hearing on the merits of the cause was heard before Judge Weinrott of Court of Common Pleas No. 5 who, on January 8, 1958, entered a final decree wMch granted the plaintiff the full relief prayed for. The defendants filed exceptions which were dismissed by Judge Beimel, speaking for the court en banc. Local No. 9 and its named officers and members appealed to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b32-5" data-blocks='[["BL_32.5",32,[220,1110,1160,875]]]'>The decree must be affirmed. The picketing attempted by Local No. 9 is a flagrant violation of the law and cannot be supported. The picketing of a one-man establishment is an invasion of an American’s freedom to determine his own economic destiny when he stands alone in an enterprise of his own. Labor unions have the right to picket for organizational purposes, that is, to persuade non-union employees of an establishment to join a union. Such peaceful picketing is constitutionally protected and cannot be enjoined <em>(Pappas v. Local Joint Exec. Bd., </em><a href="/pa/374/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="374 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1241479" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0034-01">374 Pa. 34</a>). But the picketing in this case was not for organizational purposes and could not be for that purpose. There are no non-union employees in Grimaldi’s shop. On what basis then, can there be lawful picketing for organizing employees? What is to be organized? Who are to be united?</p>

Because he refused to join something he did not need and which could not help him he was threatened with eco<a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>nomic extinction — and then the means to so extinguish him were put into motion. The action of Local 9 also obviously offended against the recognized policy of organized labor, as announced by responsible labor leaders at legislative bearings and as tbey have been reviewed by the courts in recorded legislation.</p>
    <p id="b33-4" data-blocks='[["BL_33.4",33,[163,687,1151,1321]]]'>In the early part of January, 1956, Vincent Pace, accompanied by three other men of Local 9, called on Louis Grimaldi in his barber shop and endeavored unsuccessfully to persuade him to join the union. Two or three other conferences followed with similar negative results. Then, on April 16, 1956 Vincent Pace, accompanied by five members of Local 9, met with Louis Grimaldi and five other self-employed barbers who were members of a social and educational organization known as the Pennsylvania League of Master Barbers. At this meeting Pace endeavored to induce the self-employed barbers to dissolve the Pennsylvania League of Master Barbers and to join up with Local No. 9. When Grimaldi and his companions stated they were not receptive to this idea, Pace became very abusive. He called the officers of the Pennsylvania League of Master Barbers opprobrious names and used language which wag profane, vicious and obscene. Tie then out-rightly threatened the organization and its members, declaring that if the self-employed barbers did not join his local, he would bestow upon them the “kiss of death.” His threats were all garbed in a vileness of speech that offends the very paper on which it is printed.</p>
    <p id="b33-5" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[163,2017,1147,322]],["BL_34.1",34,[223,352,1151,260]]]'>Grimaldi and his companions refused to be intimidated and returned to their respective barber shops. On the morning of July 31, 1956, when Grimaldi arrived at his establishment to open it for business, he found two of Pace’s men sitting at the curb in a “cream colored Cadillac.” They informed him that it was his <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>“turn to join.” Grimaldi replied, “Look, fellows, how many times must you be told that I can’t join your union? You know my position. I can’t join your union.”, and went into his shop to prepare for the day’s work.</p>
    <p id="b34-4" data-blocks='[["BL_34.4",34,[223,630,1152,260]]]'>Several minutes later one of the Cadillac-borne men knocked at Grimaldi’s door and informed him: “Well, we called up the office and we were told to picket your shop.” Grimaldi replied, “Gentlemen, there’s a big, wide sidewalk. Go ahead.”</p>
    <p id="b34-5" data-blocks='[["BL_34.5",34,[224,910,1153,376]]]'>A few minutes later police arrived in response to a call made by the operator of a beauty shop in the vicinity. Still later the police captain of the district appeared, and when Grimaldi asked him “What can you do about this?” the police captain answered: “I can’t do anything about it. The only thing I can do here is to see that nothing happens.”</p>
    <p id="b34-6" data-blocks='[["BL_34.6",34,[225,1296,1152,212]]]'>The pickets then, as Grimaldi was to testify later, “walked around the shop, you know, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.” And as they walked back and forth, Grimaldi’s customers walked away.</p>
    <p id="b34-7" data-blocks='[["BL_34.7",34,[224,1519,1156,876]]]'>The lower court found that this picketing was coercive and illegal and therefore enjoinable. Local 9, through its attorneys, argue that the court’s injunction was illegal under the Labor Anti-Injunction Act of June 2, 1987, P.L. 1198, 43 P.S. §206(a) et seq., as amended, which provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to issue an injunction “in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute.” But the Act has no application here. The Act specifically states that: “(a) A case shall be held to involve or to grow out of a labor dispute when the case involves <em>persons </em>who are engaged in a single industry, trade, craft or occupation, or have direct or indirect interests therein, or who are <em>employes </em>of the same employer, or who are members of the same or an affiliated organization of employers or employes . . .” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

      <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>It will be noted that the statute uses the plural throughout. It speaks of “persons,” of “employes,” and of “members.” But there are no persons, employes or members in Grimaldi’s shop. There is only one person there — and no employes or members at all.</p>
    <p id="b35-4" data-blocks='[["BL_35.4",35,[196,623,1149,656]]]'>In defining a labor dispute the Act says: “(c) The term Tabor dispute’ includes any controversy concerning terms or <em>conditions of employment, </em>or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to <em>arrange terms </em>or <em>conditions of employment </em>or concerning employment relations or <em>any other controversy arising out of the respective interests of employer and employe, </em>regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employe, and regardless of whether or not the <em>employes </em>are on strike with the employer.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>
    <p id="b35-5" data-blocks='[["BL_35.5",35,[193,1292,1150,872]]]'>The Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act of June 1, 1937, P. L. 1168 (43 P.S. §211.1), which Local 9 also attempts to invoke in its behalf, offers no more legal support to its contention than the Labor Anti-Injunction Act. The Labor Relations Act specifically declares in its title that it is: “An act to protect the right of <em>employes </em>to organize and bargain collectively.” (Emphasis supplied.) Here again we find the plural “employes.” The Act then defines “labor dispute” as any controversy concerning: “(1) Terms, tenure or conditions of employment; or concerning’ (2) The association or representation of persons negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employe.”</p>

There was no controversy over conditions of employment and there was no discord arising out of “respective inter<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>.ests of employer and employee.” Nor could there be, since there was no employer or employee at Grimaldi’s shop. Moreover, the Local did not claim, and does not now claim, that Grimaldi was charging unfair prices or that he was working improper hours, or that he was undermining in any way the working conditions of journeymen barbers — those employed in other shops.</p>
    <p id="b36-4" data-blocks='[["BL_36.4",36,[211,733,1167,1202]]]'>The picketing of Grimaldi’s shop had no bearing on conditions of labor or employment in other shops. In an Illinois case it was held that where the picketing is not designed to improve the conditions of labor of other employees it will be enjoined. In that case, the Appellate Court of Illinois (Second District) said: “There is no contention made by defendant that plaintiffs [self-employer owners of gasoline stations] were failing to meet the standards of wages and employment fixed by unions and thereby jeopardizing the rights of workingmen in the same industry, for the plaintiffs had no employees to whom they could pay wages . . . It is, therefore, the considered judgment of this court that defendant’s conduct was motivated by the illegal purpose of coercing self employed owners and operators of gasoline stations who hired no employees to join the union and sign an agreement, the net effect of which would only stifle competition, and in no way improve the conditions of labor of its members, and that defendant exercised unlawful means to effectuate this purpose.” <em>(Dinoffria v.

Grimaldi, as a one-man, self-employed barber, lives in an economic world entirely different from the one inhabited by the journeyman barber. The journeyman barber receives wages from his employer, he is saddled with no financial burden so far as the shop is <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>concerned, he pays no rent, buys no equipment, he suffers no personal loss in the event of fire or other disaster. The self-employed barber, on the other hand, carries the whole responsibility of the shop on Ms back, he owns or rents the place in which he conducts his business, he purchases the equipment, he pays all expenses in maintaining the shop and keeping it clean. If there is a fire, he personally suffers what is lost. Of course, all profits of the business are his, as all losses are borne by him.</p>

Of this number, 1700 are one-man shops, leaving only 900 which are manned by multiple barbers. Why should 1700 legitimately-owned and legitimately-operated institutions be required to conform to the standards of practically only one-half that number? While, of course, no one can or would object to the multiple-operated barber shop, there are many people who prefer being barbered in a one-man shop, and there is no reason in the law, no custom in society, and no argument in the armory of common sense which militates against the enjoyment of that one-man service.</p>

But until that happens, labor organizations allow these one-man affairs to proceed unhampered, unannoyed, and unpicketed. To picket a one-man job is like sticking pins into a hen that is sitting on eggs, concentrating on the important job of hatching vital forces which will contribute to the preservation of the human race.

Where two or more workers are employed by the same employer, the way is open for them to form an organization for the purpose of discussing and negotiating with the employer on the subjects of wages and working conditions.

The treatment of workmen in those years wrote a blank page in the industrial history of mankind. Fortunately, that melancholy era is behind us.

Moreover, if what Local 9 contended for would become law, it would mean that even a member of Local 9 when he retires would not be permitted to add to a pension or to social security payments. He could not knock together, with hammer and saw, a few little wood novelties to sell to passersby; he could not fashion with his hands some odd toys, souvenirs and knicknacks to vend to tourists in the little retreat to which he had withdrawn to spend the twilight days of his life; he would not be permitted to open a little store or to plant a garden in which to grow roses to bestow, for a consideration, on those who are distant from flower shops; he would be prohibited from roasting peanuts and selling them in little bags to those on the way to a sandlot baseball game.

The Supreme Court of the United States rejected the contention and said: “But when one considers that issues not unlike those that are here have been similarly viewed by other States and by the Con<a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>gress of the United States, we cannot conclude that [the State of] Washington, in holding the picketing in these cases to be for an unlawful object, has struck a balance so inconsistent with rooted traditions of a free people that it must be found an unconstitutional choice. Mindful as we are that a phase of picketing is communication, we cannot find that [the State of] Washington has offended the Constitution.”</p>

While it is true that picketing is in the realm of free speech, it is by no means synonymous with talking. Any person may, so long as he keeps the peace, does not disturb traffic, and offends no specific law, stand on a street corner and express his views on any subject he wishes, but when he substitutes a stick and a placard for his tongue, he leaves speech and takes up a species of communication which is by no means the equivalent of talking. Of course, it is a form of communication which is allowed where collective bargaining is involved, and we have repeatedly so held, but here there is no controversy between management and labor for the simple reason that Grimaldi is not management and he is not labor. Picketing cannot operate in a vacuum.</p>

In the meantime, other similarly situated proprietor-barbers had been joining. At a meeting in April, Vincent Pace, an International Bep<a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>resentative, did speak vulgarly and slightingly of the League and threatened to picket Grimaldi. However, Grimaldi’s witnesses described some of these meetings as “amicable” although undoubtedly Pace was at times angry and contemptuous. Finally, having failed to persuade Grimaldi to join the union, two pickets commenced to walk up and down in front of his place of business carrying a sign containing a true statement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> As a result thereof plaintiff’s business was harmed. The court below found “Picketing was at all times conducted peacefully in an attempt to persuade the plaintiff to join the union and to publicize the fact that he ran a non-union barber shop.” Nevertheless the court below enjoined the local and other named defendants from (a) setting up or maintaining a picket line at plaintiff’s place of business; (b) interfering in any way with the operation of plaintiff’s business; (c) intimidating or attempting to intimidate or coerce any of plaintiff’s customers or suppliers or otherwise interfering with plaintiff or his business. The question which immediately arises is whether this injuction is proscribed by the Labor Anti-Injunction Act of June 2, 1937, P.L. 1198, 43 P.S. §2Q8a et seq. That act withdraws jurisdiction from all courts of the Commonwealth to issue any restraining order or injunction which is “contrary to the public policy declared in this act” as well as any “case included within this act”, Act of June 2, 1937, P.L. 1198, §4 as amended. The public policy provision of the act while guaranteeing to every worker freedom “to decline to associate with his fellows” also guarantees that such workers have the right to engage in “self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>
      <em>other mutual aid or </em>protectionSince this act prevents the issuance of injunctions in <em>labor disputes </em>it is important to remember that the act specifically provides in Section three, “a <em>person </em>or <em>association </em>shall be held to be a <em>person </em>participating or interested in a labor dispute if relief is sought against <em>him </em>or it, and if <em>he </em>or <em>it </em>is engaged in the same industry, craft or occupation in which such dispute occurs or has a direct or indirect interest therein. . The majority opinion bases its conclusion, at least in part, upon the assertion that Grimaldi is neither an employer or an employee; and the word “persons” as used in a separate section of the act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a> is plural. But it is to be noticed at once that in order for a labor dispute to exist it is not necessary that Grimaldi be either an employer or an employee; he need be only a person engaged in the same industry, trade, craft or occupation as the other disputant. The majority says “It will be noted that the statute uses the plural throughout. It speaks of ‘persons,’ of ‘employes,’ and of ‘members.’ But there are no persons, employes or members in Grimaldi’s shop. There is only one person there- — and no employes or members at all.” The majority seems to be of opinion that it requires more than one person on each side of the dispute. This quite clearly is not so. No one would seriously contend that a dispute between one employer and one employee would not constitute a labor dispute. (Bee 43 PS §206e{!&gt;).) It seems to me that there is a labor dispute here within the meaning of the Labor Anti-Injunction Act. Certainly Grimaldi is engaged in <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>the same trade, craft and occupation and has the same indirect interest therein as the journeymen barbers who are members of this union. What happens in this craft or occupation, at least indirectly, affects both Grimaldi and the journeymen barbers. But even if this were not so certainly Grimaldi’s position is identical with the approximately 400 proprietor-barbers who are members of the union. Whatever might be said as to the differences that may exist as between journeymen barbers and proprietor-barbers is not applicable between one proprietor-barber and another proprietor-barber. It must be conceded that Grimaldi performs exactly the same duties and is engaged in the same occupation as any barber in any barber shop anywhere. He must be licensed like all other barbers; he has the same economic interests and belongs to the same economic group as all other barbers. This dispute between Grimaldi and the union has economic repercussions upon the wages, hours of work and working conditions of all individuals in the industry and particularly upon the many journeymen barbers and proprietor barbers who are members of the union. Hence the union has a legitimate economic interest in peacefully persuading Grimaldi to join it and in advertising to the public that he is not a member.</p>

The Court said: “. . . support may be found in the cases for the union’s view that (absent restrictive legislation) there is no general public policy against a requirement that employers, who actually work with the tools of their trade alongside their employees, must become members of the union and support it at least to the extent that their interests coincide.”</p>

      <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>I further believe that the conduct of the union is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It is still the law that a <em>blanket </em>prohibition against all forms of peaceful picketing is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is recognized even in <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 695 v. Vogt, </em><a href="/us/354/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="354 U.S. 284" data-case-ids="6159782" data-case-paths="/us/354/0284-01">354 U.S. 284</a>, the most stringent of all the recent cases. Starting with <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em><a href="/us/310/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="310 U.S. 88" data-case-ids="6137179" data-case-paths="/us/310/0088-01">310 U.S. 88</a>, the Supreme Court of the United States first enunciated the doctrine that picketing is constitutionally protected as an exercise of the right of free speech and this doctrine was further expanded even where a direct employer-employee relationship was not involved. <em>American Federation of Labor v. Swing, </em><a href="/us/312/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="312 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="359055" data-case-paths="/us/312/0321-01">312 U.S. 321</a>.

The common impression, however, is that <em>Thornhill </em>and <em>Swing </em>were rendered virtually innocuous by <em>Vogt. </em>If anything need be said outside of <em>Vogt </em>itself to demonstrate that this is not so it would be found in the recent decision reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of Kansas in <em>Newell v. Chauffeurs Teamsters Local 795, </em><a href="/kan/181/0898-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="181 Kan. 898" data-case-ids="25306" data-case-paths="/kan/181/0898-01">181 Kan. 898</a>, <a href="/kan/181/0898-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="181 Kan. 898" data-case-ids="25306" data-case-paths="/kan/181/0898-01">317 P. 2d 817</a>. There the Supreme Court of Kansas held that the picketing was coercion simply because it was aimed at the strangulation of the employer’s business for the purpose of hastening the employer’s recognition of the union’s demands. The Court said “Coercive picketing is unlawful and contrary to the public policy expressed by the legislature of Kansas”. In reversing, <a href="/us/356/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="356 U.S. 341" data-case-ids="6163303,6163375" data-case-paths="/us/356/0341-01,/us/356/0341-02">356 U.S. 341</a>, the Supreme Court of the United States said “per, curiam— The petition for writ of certiorari is granted and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas is reversed.

      <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>By way of summary, then, it would appear that a state court can, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, enjoin picketing in a particular case if the picketing has an objective which violates the legitimate public policy of a state. However, a state may not issue a blanket injunction against all picketing. Nor may a state constitutionally equate picketing itself with coercion or with a violation of state policy. Organizational purposes are always a proper objective of picketing and hence picketing for such purposes is constitutionally protected and cannot be enjoined by a state.</p>
    <p id="b55-4" data-blocks='[["BL_55.4",55,[178,964,1149,802]]]'>The record more than adequately supports the finding that the picketing here had as its purpose the peaceful inducement of the plaintiff to join the union. The plaintiff testified that the union representative “wanted me to join the Union”. There is absolutely no dispute in this case as to the sole object of the union’s conduct, that of persuading the plaintiff to join the union. The picketing consisted only of two men walking up and down in front of plaintiff’s barber shop. There was admittedly no violence, no threats contemporaneous with the picketing. Yet the chancellor and the court below labeled this picketing “coercive”. The <em>chancellor </em>found that the picketing constituted “coercion” because it was aimed at securing plaintiff’s membership in the defendant union.</p>
    <p id="b55-5" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[177,1796,1148,536]]]'>The <em>court below </em>in its opinion on the defendant’s exceptions conceded that the purpose of the picketing was organizational and in the same breath declared that its purpose was unlawful: “The immediate purpose of this picketing is to organize a self-employed barber who has no employes. The actual purpose, however, appears to be union control of prices and hours of all the City’s barber shops by completely organizing the trade. Such is not a legitimate union objective and constitutes an unlawful purpose.”</p>

I do not believe that Mr. Grimaldi is <em>sui generis. </em>He is not anarchic like Robinson Crusoe before the coming of Friday. For the same reason that the rights of the union and its membership are not absolute neither are Grimaldi’s. A proper accommodation of both, in my view, would require us to reverse this decree.</p>
