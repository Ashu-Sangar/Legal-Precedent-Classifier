He was brought to the receiving ward of Episcopal Hospital between 2 and 3 p.m. The gist of his complaint is that thereafter he became the patient of defendant, Dr. Edgar L. Pennell, Jr., who negligently permitted Ms agents and servants to prescribe penicillin for plaintiff although they knew or should have known that plaintiff was allergic to this drug, as a result of which plaintiff sustained serious <em>permanent </em>injuries. The injuries were clearly proved and there is no contention but that they were caused by the penicillin. The real question is whether the defendant, who denied agency and put negligence in issue under Buie 1045, is responsible.</p>

They alternated, for periods of six weeks, in the duties of attending patients such as plaintiff brought into the hospital for surgery. Surgical Service B was composed of approximately ten persons who were either surgeons, residents or interns. Dr. Pennell, like the other staff <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>surgeons or associates, received his appointment to Surgical Service B from the Board of Managers of Episcopal Hospital. Neither he nor the other associates were paid any compensation by the hospital. Hr. Pennell maintained his principal office at the hospital, for which he paid rent.

An associate surgeon had no power to discharge any resident. No surgical resident could perform operations without the permission of a staff surgeon of his service. Dr. Hatemi regarded Dr. Pennell as being more active than any other one of the associates under whom he served and spoke of him as his “whole boss” and as his “teacher”. Interns were appointed by the Board of Managers, were paid a salary, and were full time employees of the hospital. They could not be discharged by an associate surgeon. Junior interns, including a Mr. Rex, were hired by the assistant to the director of the hospital and were paid by the hospital. These were fourth year medical students who substituted for and performed the duties of interns.</p>

His family physician, Dr. Katzman, had given him one injection of penicillin in treating him for it.

Dr. Hatemi was at that time a graduate of a medical school in Iran; had spent a one year internship in Quonset City Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts; and then had come to Philadelphia and been appointed a surgical resident at Episcopal Hospital. Upon his appointment he had applied, on July 4, 1956, for a license to pursue postgraduate study in general surgery at the Episcopal Hospital. Prior to the grant of such a license an interview is required with a representative of the Board of Medical Licensure of the Commonwealth. That interview took place on August 20, 1956. The application <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>was approved by the Board, in regular session, at a meeting held on October 20, 1956, retroactively for a period commencing July 4, 1956 (the date of the application) to July 3, 1957. Therefore, on September 13, 1956, the date of plaintiff’s accident, Dr. Hatemi’s application had not yet been approved.</p>
    <p id="b63-4" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[164,687,1150,1469]]]'>When he was called to the receiving ward Dr. Hatemi examined plaintiff, took a brief history of the manner in which the accident had happened and ordered x-rays. The x-rays disclosed the fracture and the presence of the nail in the fibula. He took the x-ray plates to Dr. Pennell in his private office in the hospital. Dr. Pennell examined the plates and reviewed with Dr. Hatemi the plan of treatment to be followed in repairing the injury to plaintiff’s leg. This plan included a general discussion of post-operative care in which antibiotics were mentioned but no specific reference to penicillin was made. A witness called by plaintiff, however, testified that during his investigation on behalf of plaintiff’s employer’s compensation insurance carrier Dr. Pennell told him that after the operation he had advised penicillin but at the time had no knowledge of plaintiff’s allergy, and that as soon as he found out about it he stopped the use of that drug. While Dr. Hatemi was discussing the matter with Dr. Pennell the junior intern, Bex, was making a physical examination and taking a history of the case. It was specifically by virtue of Dr. Hatemi’s order that Bex took this history, for otherwise his duties in the receiving ward did not require him to take histories of patients admitted to the hospital for surgery. Part of the history was taken in the receiving ward and part in the corridor outside the operating room.</p>

Plaintiff was then brought into the operating room. At that point Rex, remembering that although he had been informed that plaintiff was allergic to penicillin he had neglected to note this fact in the written history, thereupon went to the door of the operating room. But since he was improperly attired hospital procedures prevented his entering the room. He called the nurse anesthetist to the door and asked her to make a notation on the history that plaintiff was allergic to penicillin. She said she would. Prior to the operation Dr. Hatemi read the history. The history produced at the trial shows the notation “Allergic to Penicillin”. Rex denied that he made it. There is no evidence in the record to show who made it, or when it was made.</p>

Dr. Hatemi personally administered the spinal anesthesia. The nail was extracted and later given to plaintiff in accordance with his request. A cast was placed on the leg and the operation was completed. Dr. Hatemi, as the operation was drawing to a close, dictated the post-operative orders in which he prescribed 600,000 units of penicillin every four hours. After that plaintiff was taken to the ward and prior to the administration of penicillin he advised the nurse on duty that he was allergic to it. Nevertheless, between 8:15 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. she administered penicillin in accordance with the directions contained on the chart. She testified that when the plaintiff arrived in the ward after the operation and as late as 11 o’clock that night there was no notation of a penicillin allergy on the chart. Plaintiff was again given 600,000 units of penicillin at midnight by the succeeding nurse, and again at 4:00 a.m. Plaintiff testified that he told all with whom he came into contact that he was allergic <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>to penicillin, including two other men in the ward, and that on one occasion, when Dr. Hatemi and Dr. Pennell were present, the former said that he was giving plaintiff “oremycin” but Dr. Pennell told Dr. Hatemi to give plaintiff 25,000 units of penicillin. When plaintiff protested to Dr. Pennell that he was allergic to penicillin the latter merely walked away. Plaintiff insisted that he protested so much against the use of penicillin that the nurses considered him a pest, one of them even refusing to look at Dr. Katzman’s note advising against the use of penicillin.</p>

It is clear that the relationship of physician and patient existed between Dr. Pennell and plaintiff commencing September 13 and continuing throughout plaintiff’s first and second admissions. Dr. Lucius Roy Wilson, Director of Episcopal Hospital, testified unequivocally that in accordance with the practice of the hospital plaintiff was Dr. Pennell’s patient. This is supported by the fact that Dr. Pennell signed the chart at the place reserved for the “Chief or Attending M.D.” and later submitted to the compensation carrier his bill, which was paid. In treating plaintiff Dr. Pennell therefore owed him the duty of employing such reasonable skill and diligence as is ordinarily exercised in his profession, giving due regard to the advanced state of the profession at the time of treatment. <em>Powell v.

The problem, of course, is whether the persons who administered to plaintiff may be properly said to be agents of Dr. Pennell or agents only of the hospital.</p>

In his capacity as a resident he was duty-bound to act on behalf of the hospital. In accordance with that duty he was called upon to see plaintiff upon admission. He made an examination or partial examination of plaintiff. However, under the law, in view of the fact that he was not a licensed surgeon, he could not himself undertake operative surgery without first consulting and receiving approval of the chief or an associate of Surgical Service B. He therefore consulted with Dr. Pennell who authorized him to proceed with <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>the operation. At this time, in accordance with the rules of the hospital an'd as demonstrated by Dr. Pennell’s later conduct, the plaintiff became the patient of Dr. Pennell. Dr. Pennell had the choice of operating himself or of designating another qualified person to do it for him. He chose Dr. Hatemi to operate in his stead. But when he did so he did not abandon, in contemplation of law, either the right of control or his own interest and duty in the premises. From this moment onward Dr. Hatemi was the agent of Dr. Pennell. His negligence thereafter, if any, is in the light of the verdict imputable to Dr. Pennell. What did Dr. Hatemi do? He directed Rex, the junior intern, to take a history of the case. The evidence is clear that the general duties of Rex qualified him to take case histories. However, in the normal course of events, since the hospital had assigned him to the receiving ward, he would not have taken this history had he not been selected by Dr. Hatemi to do so. In this sense, therefore, Rex was “borrowed” from the hospital. While remaining a general employee of the hospital he became a sub-agent of Dr. Pennell. See <em>McConnell v. Williams, </em>supra. He took the history and although informed of the plaintiff’s allergy to pencillin, failed to note it on the chart. While defendant’s chosen agent, Dr. Hatemi, was performing the operation and therefore in full command of all persons in the operating room to the exclusion of hosjfital control during that period (see <em>McConnell v. WilUams, </em>supra), Rex informed the nurse anesthetist of the fact that the history was incomplete. Exactly what followed is not known. If the nurse did as Rex asked and noted the allergy on the chart before Dr. Hatemi read it, or told him of it, a jury could find that Dr. Hatemi himself was negligent. If the nurse failed to correct the history or inform Dr. Hatemi her negligence is apparent. If Dr. Pennell had been in charge of the operation in <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>place of Dr. Hatemi would lie have been responsible for disregarding the correction or for Rex’s and the nurse’s failure? If so, then he is equally responsible here since his chosen agent, Dr. Hatemi, was acting for him. The knowledge of Rex and the nurse anesthetist and that imputable to Dr. Hatemi was imputable to Dr. Pennell.</p>

The rules of the hospital, however, required that this be done under the supervision of an associate surgeon, and the latter was required by the hospital to furnish such supervision and instruction to a resident surgeon without compensation by the hospital for the performance of such function. It seems obvious that the right of the associate surgeon to charge a compensation carrier for the services of a resident surgeon was intended to serve as partial compensation for the fulfillment by the associate surgeon of the hospital’s obligation to instruct and advance the surgical education of the resident. It is clear that if the instant plaintiff was anyone’s patient, he was the patient of Dr. Hatemi, and that Dr. Pennell rendered only supervisory control over Dr. Hatemi, as he was required to do by the hospital rules.

In pursuing this inquiry it must be borne in mind that the negligence, if any, which caused the injury to plaintiff arose not from the surgery performed, but rather from the failure to take a proper preoperative history which resulted in the post-operative injection of penicillin into the plaintiff who was allergic to the drug. It is undisputed that there was evidence that the intern was told of plaintiff’s allergy and failed to note such fact on the history of the patient which he took prior to the performance of surgery. On the other hand, there is no evidence that the resident surgeon either had actual knowledge or reason to know of the existence of such an allergy. There was evidence that while the operation was being performed, the intern “informed the nurse anesthetist of the fact that the history was incomplete.” The majority opinion frankly admits that “Exactly what followed is not known”, and then proceeds to substitute conjecture and speculation for proof of what happened. The majority opinion says, <em>if </em>the nurse noted the fact of the allergy on the record, and <em>if </em>it was so noted before Dr. Hatemi read the record, or <em>if </em>the nurse told Dr. Hatemi of it, the jury could have found Dr. Hatemi negligent. On the other hand, <em>if </em>the nurse did not correct the history or <em>if </em>she did not tell Dr. Hatemi, then the nurse would have been negligent. Our review of the record, and a fact tacitly admitted by the majority, shows no evidence whatsoever that Dr. Hatemi had either knowledge or reason to know that the plaintiff was allergic to penicillin at the time that he ordered the administration post-operatively of that drug. The majority’s imposition of liability on Dr. Pennell must therefore originate with the failure of Mr. Rex to properly record plaintiff’s medical history.</p>

The Court noted that the defendant was himself performing the operation, and <em>for this purpose, </em>had complete control over those present and assisting in the operating room; that he had freely chosen the intern who was to assist him in the operation; and that the negligent action was committed pursuant to an express direction given by the defendant to the intern <em>during the course of and as an integral part of the operation. </em>The <em>McConnell </em>rule was again applied by this Court in <em>Benedict v. </em>
      <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>
      <em>Bondi, </em><a href="/pa/384/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="384 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1263094" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0574-01">384 Pa. 574</a>, <em><a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%20209" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="122 A.2d 209">122 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%20209" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="122 A.2d 209">A. 2d 209</a>, where the operating surgeon was held liable for injuries resulting from the application of excessive heat to the feet of the child-patient. This Court again noted that the surgeon was physically present in the operating room and expressly directed the application of the heat to the child’s feet and “that such an application is not a routine matter in all operative procedure but is sometimes employed where the patient is in shock; that it is therefore a decision for the surgeon to make and for him to determine and direct if, when and how heat should be applied” and “that his legal responsibility did not begin merely at the exact moment when he started to make an incision in the child’s body but that the operative process started with, and included, the application to the <em>child </em>— in <em>the operating room and under the eye of the surgeon </em>— of the hot water bottles. . .” (Emphasis supplied). In both cases, however, liability was specifically discounted where it involved pre-operative or post-operative treatment, not directly related to the operation itself, and where the person sought to be held liable was not physically present when the negligent act occurred. In the <em>McConnell </em>case, the reason for this distinction was aptly set forth by Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Stern: “Defendant’s counsel cites several cases from other jurisdictions in an attempt to show that an operating surgeon is not generally held liable for the negligence of hospital internes and nurses. In those cases, however, the negligence on the part of the nurse or interne was in connection with the post-operative care of a patient, <em>not administered in the presence or under the control of the surgeon. </em>Plaintiffs do not contend that a surgeon’s liability should apply, after the operation is concluded, to treatment administered by floor nurses and internes in the regular course of the services ordinarly furnished by a hospital; as <em>to all such care and attention they would clearly be acting </em>
      <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>
      <em>exclusively on behalf of the hospital and not as assistants to the surgeon. </em>But for the period of the operation itself the situation is entirely different, and if operating surgeons were not to be held liable for the negligent performance of the duties of those <em>then </em>working under them, the law would fail in large measure to afford a means of redress <em>for preventable injuries sustained during the course of such operations.” </em>(Emphasis supplied). In <em>Benedict v. </em>Bondi, <a href="/pa/384/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="384 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1263094" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0574-01">384 Pa. 574</a>, 580, supra, this doctrine was again reiterated by this Court when Chief Justice Steen stated: “Dr. Bondi contends that such control does not exist in regard to either pre-operative preparation or post-operative care <em>which is not administered in the operating room in the presence of the surgeon and under his direct charge, and such indeed is the </em>law: McConnell v.

The majority surmounts the first obstacle by ignoring the reason assigned in <em>McGonnell </em>for requiring the presence of the surgeon-defendant in the operating room and by the application of the expanded surgeon-assistant agency relationship previously discussed. The majority attempts to supply the second deficiency in two steps: (1) because Dr. Hatemi had complete control over the persons assisting in the operation, Mr. Bex’s knowledge of the allergy, which he communicated to the <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>nurse anesthetist while in the operating room, is imputed to Dr. Hatemi; (2) because Dr. Hatemi ordered certain post-operative treatment which by the imputation of this knowledge to Dr. Hatemi constituted negligent treatment.

    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[242,755,1157,813]]]'>The majority opinion thus states: “While defendant’s chosen agent, Dr. Hatemi, was performing the operation and therefore in full command of all persons in the operating room to the exclusion of hospital control during that period (see McConnell v. Williams, supra), Bex informed the nurse anesthetist of the fact that the history was incomplete.” From this assumed control, the majority imputes to Dr. Hatemi that which Bex told the nurse who may or may not have recorded it. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the majority’s holding on agency is correct, undoubtedly defendant, through his agent Dr. Hatemi, had control of all persons in the operating room, <em>but only for the purpose of the proper and successful conduct of the operation. </em>See <em>McConnell v.

The subsequent attempt during the operation to rectify his initial negligence in failing to properly record plaintiff’s medical history, a routine pre-operative function performed by hospital employees, was irrelevant both to the operation and to the rationale of <em>McConnell </em>in holding that a surgeon has complete control of the actions of persons in the operating room, <em>but only for the purpose of conducting the operation and “to afford a means of redress for preventable injuries sustained during the course of such operations </em>If Bex had told or failed to tell the anesthetist one-hal f hour before or one-half hour after the operation, would either or both of them have been any more or less negligent in failing to communicate this fact to Dr. Hatemi during the operation? Would this negligence still be imputable to Dr. Hatemi because he had complete control of them while in the operating room, when the fact that the plaintiff was allergic to penicillin was completely irrelevant to the success or failure of the surgery? If a nurse had informed the anesthetist during the operation that certain rooms were not to be used because the previous occupants had a communicable disease, would this knowledge have been imputable to Dr. Hatemi and would Dr. Hatemi be held liable for complications resulting from his sending a patient to that room because “he was performing the operation and therefore in full command of all persons in the operating room?” If an ambulance driver negligently administers an overdose of morphine to a plaintiff en-route to the hospital, will a communication of this fact to a nurse in the operating room impute this knowledge to a surgeon performing the operation who orders additional morphine as post-operative treatment <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>because he “was performing the operation and therefore in full command of all persons in the operating room?” In previous cases, the doctrine of absolute control by a surgeon over those assisting him during an operation was applied solely for the purpose of placing-responsibility on the person who was primarily and directly entrusted with the success or failure of the surgery. Under the majority view, however, this doctrine is now to be used for converting the operating room into a combat information center where information as to and liability for the previous negligent actions of hospital employees — unrelated to the success or failure of the operation — may be transmitted and transferred to the operating surgeon, and for insuring employees of a convenient receptacle where their negligent actions may be discarded whether or not they have any relation to the successful performance of the operation.</p>

See also: <em>Powell v. Risser, </em><a href="/pa/375/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="375 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1244419" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0060-01">375 Pa. 60</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=99%20A.2d%20454" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="99 A.2d 454">99 A. 2d 454</a>; <em>Scacchi v. </em>Montgomery, <a href="/pa/365/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="365 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="1225536" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0377-01">365 Pa. 377</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.2d%20535" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="75 A.2d 535">75 A. 2d 535</a>. The majority distinguishes these cases on the ground that the nurse who administered the penicillin did not do so negligently, but “acted in strict accordance with the post-operative care <em>prescribed </em>by Dr. Hatemi.” No one contends that the nurse negligently administered the penicillin, nor can anyone contend that Dr. Hatemi <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>negligently <em>prescribed </em>penicillin, nor that such a drug constitutes improper post-operative treatment, <em>unless </em>one imputes knowledge to Dr. Hatemi that the plaintiff was allergic to penicillin by the application of the “all inclusive control doctrine” previously discussed. The negligence in the present case consisted of the failure of Mr. Rex to properly record the plaintiff’s medical history, a pre-operative function, while in the <em>Shull </em>case, the negligence consisted of a failure to properly remove the stitches, a post-operative function. Neither <em>McConnell, Shull </em>nor any of the other Pennsylvania cases cited by the majority distinguish between preoperative or post-operative negligence of an intern or nurse. In neither situation has a physician-surgeon been held liable. If the pre-operative and post-operative exclusion from surgeon liability set forth in <em>McConnell </em>and recently reiterated in <em>Benedict </em>is to have any meaning, it must be applied to such a factual situation as herein presented where such negligence as exists can only be traced to the failure of a person or persons employed by the hospital and under its control to properly perform routine pre-operative functions.</p>

Q. You mean you went to Dr. Pennell because he was the only one available? A. Of our Service.” The evidence disclosed that at the time in question Dr. Pennell was assigned to the women’s and children’s side of the service, and in the ordinary course of events would not have been assigned or under a duty to supervise the treatment of the plaintiff. Although the supervision of Dr. Hatemi’s treatment of the plaintiff was not one of the <em>specific </em>duties of Dr. Pennell when assigned to this side of the service, it was one of his <em>general </em>duties under hospital rules to advise any resident surgeon when requested to do so.

However, in the normal course of events, since the hospital had assigned him to the receiving ward, he would not have taken this history had he not been selected by Dr. Hatemi to do so. In this sense, therefore, Rex was ‘borrowed’ from the hospital. While remaining a general employee of the hospital he became a sub-agent of Dr. Pennell.” The only testimony to support this conclusion is the testimony of Mr. Rex himself. Dr. Wilson’s testimony directly contradicted Rex’s statement: “Q. Can you tell, please, who took the admission history? A. Mr. Rex. Q. You say Mr. Rex? A. Yes. Q. Who was he? A. Extern. Q. How did he come to take the admission history? A. He was on duty in the Emergency Room.

His duties were to take histories, consult with the Residents or members of the visiting staff on treatments. . . .” Even assuming, however, that Mr. Rex is correct in that having been assigned to the Receiving Ward, his specific duties at that time did not include the recording of a pre-operative medical history, the majority’s holding1 that he became the sub-agent of Dr. Pennell because “he would not have taken this history had he not been selected by Dr. Hatemi to do so,” is indeed strained. The majority in so holding completely ignore the evidence of record establishing that the taking of a medical history is part of the ordinary and customary pre-operative preparation for which the employees of the hospital are directly responsible; that <em>any </em>intern is qualified to take a medical history; that it involves no unique or unusual skill not possessed by any qualified intern; that it is not ¡he type of action which requires the “selection” of a particular individual; and that at that time Dr. Hatemi had the right to tell Rex to take the history. The evidence clearly discloses that as an intern and employee of the hospital, Rex had the duty of taking medical histories whenever he was reqirested to do so by a doctor, regardless of whether or not his specific duties at that particular moment encompassed such action.</p>
