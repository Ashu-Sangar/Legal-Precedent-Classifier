A comparison of both statutes indicates a common recognition on the part of both the federal and the state governments that the inclusion of phenobarbital as an active ingredient in the drug “Primatene” requires that the users thereof be warned, by an appropriate label on the drug itself, that the use of the drug may become habit forming; to the extent that this labelled caution is efficacious in discouraging the regular and continued use of the drug the health of the public is thereby protected. The state statute and the regulation adopted thereunder proceed a step further than the federal statute; they set forth a policy of this Common<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>wealth, arrived at after investigation, study and consultation with qualified authorities, that any drug which contains phenobarbital as an active ingredient and, thus, under federal legislation requires a cautionary label that it may be habit forming, cannot be sold or dispensed in this Commonwealth without the issuance of a prescription issued by a duly qualified pei'son. Under the policy set forth by the Commonwealth not only is the user of the drug warned of the potentiality of the drug as to habit forming but the user cannot purchase such drug until the propriety of the use of the drug by such individual has been approved by a person duly qualified to judge such propriety and evidenced by the issuance of his prescription.</p>

In this connection the language of the court below is apt: “The Federal law does not require sale of the drug without prescription, but only permits it. The State, then, may in appropriate circumstances as a police measure require sale by prescription, in which event the prescription label would be carried.

A complete answer to this contention was made in the court below which, after pointing out that Whitehall overlooked the application of Section 503 of the “Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act”, supra, 21 U.S.O.A. (pkt. pt.) 353(b)(1) (c)(2) stated that Section 503 . . . “provides that any drug dispensed by filling or refilling a written or oral prescription of a duly licensed practitioner shall be exempt from the requirements of 21 U.S.O.A.

This paragraph . . . shows, inter alia, an intent upon the part of the Congress to permit a prescription label on certain drugs . . . (barbituric acid) when a druggist sells those drugs upon prescription with directions and cautionary statements. It seems to us that this section (Section 503) . . . shows clearly that if ‘Primatene’ were sold on prescription, it would not be in any way defacing a Federal label. It would only be necessary in that event for the drug to bear a label meeting the requirements of this last named section of the Federal Act”.</p>

Whitehall complains because the Secretary of Health chose to regulate the sale of “Primatene” by a regulation issued under Section 2(1) (b), rather than under Section 2(1) (a), of “The Dangerous Drug Act of 1955”, supra. It contends that had the Secretary acted under Section 2(1) (a) he would have been obliged under that Section and Section 3 to have advanced “cogent reasons” for nonconformance with the federal legislation ; since the Secretary, however, elected to act under Section 2(1) (b) — i.e., the Secretary found that “Pri<a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>matene” was a “dangerous drug” because of its “potentiality for harmful effect” and dispensable only upon prescription — he lacked the authority to issue any regulation inasmuch as that Section contains no provision for the issuance of a regulation thereunder. Such a contention completely ignores the authority granted under Section 7(b) of the Act, supra, which empowers the Secretary to make such rules and regulations as are necessary for the enforcement of the Act. Section 3 — dealing with conformity with the federal legislation and the necessity for “cogent reasons” for deviating from the federal legislation — applies only to drugs classified as “dangerous” under Section 2(1) (a) and does not apply to drugs classified as “dangerous” under Section 2(1) (b). Subscription to this theory of Whitehall would result in an anomaly; the legislature would be held to have intended that the Secretary have the authority to classify drugs as “dangerous” under Section 2(1) (b) and yet have no authority to make any rule or regulation concerning the use or dispensing of such drugs. Such a construction is unreasonable, completely ignores the language of Section 7 of the Act and defeats the clear legislative purpose in its passage of the statute. The action of the Secretary in the promulgation of this regulation was well within the authority granted him by the statute.</p>

In passing upon this contention we are mindful that: “It is, by now, hornbook law that <em>findings of fact </em>by a chancellor who saw and heard the witnesses, especially when approved by the court en banc, <em>will not be reversed by an appellate court if there is adequate evidence to sustain them”: </em>

In addition to the fact that phenobarbital was shown to possess a tendency to be habit forming, the drug “Primatene” was shown to contain in full dosage the active ingredient of ephedrine hydrochloride. There was testimony that ephedrine hydrochloride possesses certain potentialities for harm from its use: (1) it tends to increase blood pressure; (2) it tends to increase and stimulate the work of the heart; (3) it increases automation and an abnormal heart beat; (4) it affects the central nervous system and may cause irritability, nervousness and an increase in the response of an individual to outward stimuli; (5) it dilates the bronchial tubes. There was other evidence which indicated that the presence in the drug of ephedrine hydrochloride combined with phenobarbital might create a hazard for users of the drug if afflicted with cardiac, renal or liver conditions. The purpose behind the inclusion of phenobarbital in the drug was to counteract the stimulating effect of the ephedrine hydrochloride; under some of the testimony it was pointed out that the times when phenobarbital and ephedrine hydrochloride take effect are variable so that the effects of the former might take place when the effects of the latter had passed their height and were subsiding. Highly qualified, experienced and reputable physicians and pharmacologists testified that the use of “Primatene” might be hazardous for persons suffering from cardiac, renal or liver conditions, while other qualified, experienced and reputable physicians and pharmacologists <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>testified to the contrary. The chancellor saw and heard all these witnesses and he chose to rely on those witnesses who testified that the use of the drug could be hazardous; for his judgment we do not substitute our own. The findings of the chancellor, approved by the court en banc, are founded upon evidence adequate and sufficient, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Decree affirmed.</p>
