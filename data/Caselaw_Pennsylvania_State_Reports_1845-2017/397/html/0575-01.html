There was <em>no </em>evidence that the defendant was present on any one of the occasions testified to by these witnesses, nor that he had any persona,! knowledge of the sales to them or to other persons on the premises.” We, therefore, must determine the criminal responsibility of a licensee of the Liquor Control Board for acts committed by his employees upon his premises, without his personal knowledge, participation, or presence, which acts violate a valid regulatory statute passed under the Commonwealth’s police power.</p>

Such statutes are generally enforceable by light penalties, and although violations are labelled crimes, the considerations applicable to them are totally different from those applicable to true crimes, which involve moral delinquency and which are punishable by imprisonment or another serious penalty. Such so-called statutory crimes are in reality an attempt to utilize the machinery of criminal administration as an enforcing arm for social regulations of a purely civil nature, with the punishment totally unrelated to questions of moral wrongdoing or guilt. It is here that the social interest in the general well-being and security of the populace has been held to outweigh the individual interest of the particular defendant. The penalty is imposed despite the defendant’s lack of a criminal intent or mens rea.</p>

      <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>In the Liquor Code, Section 493, the legislature has set forth twenty-five specific acts which are condemned as unlawful, and for which penalties are provided in Section 494. Subsections (1) and (14) of Section 493 contain the two offenses charged here. In neither of these subsections is there any language which would require the prohibited acts to have been done either knowingly, wilfully or intentionally, there being a significant absence of such words as “knowingly, wilfully, etc.” That the legislature intended such a requirement in other related sections of the same Code is shown by examining Section 492(15), wherein it is made unlawful to <em>knowingly </em>sell any malt beverages to a person engaged in the business of illegally selling such beverages. The omission of any such word in the subsections of Section 494 is highly significant. It indicates a legislative intent to eliminate both knowledge and criminal intent as necessary ingredients of such offenses. To bolster this conclusion, we refer back to Section 491 wherein the Code states, “It shall be unlawful (1) For any person, by himself, <em>or by an employe or </em>agent, to expose or keep for sale, or directly or <em>indirectly </em>... to sell or offer to sell any liquor within this Commonwealth, except in accordance with the provisions of this act and the regulations of the board.” The Superior Court has long placed such an interpretation on the statute. <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Speer, <a href="/pa-super/157/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="157 Pa.

Such a burden of care is imposed upon the licensee in order to protect the public from the potentially noxious effects of an inherently dangerous business. We, of course, express no opinion as to the <em>wisdom </em>of the legislature’s imposing vicarious responsibility under certain sections of the Liquor Code. There may or may not be an economic-sociological justification for such liability on a theory of deterrence. Such determination is for the legislature to make, so long as the constitutional requirements are met.</p>

Were this the defendant’s first violation of the Code, and the penalty solely a minor fine of from $100-|300, we would have no hesitation in upholding such a judgment. Defendant, by accepting a liquor license, must bear this financial risk. Because of a prior conviction for violations of the Code, however, the trial judge felt compelled under the mandatory language of the statute, Section 494(a), to impose not only an increased fine of five hundred dollars, but also a three month sentence of imprisonment. Such sentence of imprisonment in a case where liability is imposed vicariously cannot be sanctioned by this Court consistently with the law of the land clause of Section 9, Article I of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

We have done so on the theory that the Code established petty misdemeanors involving only light monetary fines. It would be unthinkable to impose vicarious criminal responsibility in cases involving true crimes. Although to hold a principal criminally liable might possibly be an effective means of enforcing law and order, it would do violence to our more sophisticated modern-day concepts of justice. Liability for all true crimes, wherein an offense carries with it a jail sentence, must be based exclusively upon personal causation. It can be readily imagined that even a licensee who is meticulously careful in the choice of his employees cannot supervise every single act of <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>the subordinates.

We impose penal treatment upon those who injure or menace social interests, partly in order to reform, partly to prevent the continuation of the antisocial activity and partly to deter others. If a defendant has personally lived up to the social standards of the criminal law and has not menaced or injured anyone, why impose penal treatment?</p>

This is as unfair as it is contrary to law.</p>
    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[251,732,1160,640]]]'>The defendant John ICoczwara had been previously convicted of a violation of the Liquor Code and, because of that conviction, the Trial Court imposed, in addition to a fine of $500, a sentence of three months’ imprisonment. The Majority Opinion finds the imprisonment part of the sentence contrary to law. Thus, in addition to the other things I have had to say about the Majority Opinion, I find myself compelled to pin on it the bouquet of inconsistency. The Majority says that it cannot permit the sentencing of a man to jail “for acts about which he had no knowledge and over which he had little control.”</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[247,1392,1156,473]]]'>It says: “Such sentence of imprisonment in a case where liability is imposed vicariously cannot be sanctioned by this Court consistently with the law of the land clause of Section 9, Article I of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” But if the Majority cannot sanction the incarceration of a person for acts of which he had no knowledge, how -can it sanction the imposition of a fine? How can it sanction a conviction at all?</p>
    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[242,1884,1157,480]],["BL_623.1",623,[170,339,1146,362]]]'>The Majority enlarges on its inconsistency when it says: “Our own courts have stepped in time and again to protect a defendant from being held criminally responsible for acts about which he had no knowledge and over which he had little control.” If it is wrong to send a person to jail for acts committed by another, is it not wrong to convict him at all? There are those who value their good names to the extent that they see as much harm in a degrading criminal conviction as in <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>a jail sentence. The laceration of a man’s reputation, the blemishing of his good name, the wrecking of his prestige by a criminal court conviction may blast a person’s chances for honorable success in life to such an extent that a jail sentence can hardly add much to the ruin already wrought to him by the conviction alone.</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[165,723,1151,803]]]'>The Majority extends a sympathetic hand to prevent the jail doors from clanging shut behind John Koczwara. It says: “We would be utterly remiss were we not to do so under these facts.” But is it not remiss in refusing to save Koczwara’s constitutional prerogatives? Is it not remiss in not striking down this conviction which engrafts upon the criminal code something which up until this time has been unheard of in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania? Is it not remiss in not reversing a conviction which cannot be based on any written provision of the law? Is it not remiss in giving to a criminal statute a broad interpretation (against the accused) instead of a strict interpretation as our decisions have proclaimed hundreds of times?</p>
    <p id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[164,1556,1148,320]]]'>I conclude by saying that the Majority has been so remiss in affirming the conviction in this case that I myself would be remiss if I did not dissent against a decision which flouts the Constitution, ignores the Bill of Rights and introduces into the temple of the law the Asiatic rite of “vicarious criminal liability.”</p>
