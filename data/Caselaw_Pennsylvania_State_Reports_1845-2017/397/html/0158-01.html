Since the pleadings presented only questions of law, the plaintiffs moved for judgment. The motion was heard 'by the court <em>en banc, </em>with the assent of the parties, as on final hearing. The court in a formal and well-considered opinion held that it was without power to grant the relief sought, even if the members of the General Assembly were joined as parties defendant, and accordingly entered a final decree dismissing the complaint and giving judgment for the defendant.

    <p id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[252,1093,1155,981]]]'>What the plaintiffs seek is a judicial declaration that the Act of 1921, as amended, is unconstitutional. Since the antecedent Apportionment Acts of February 17,1906, P. L. 31, and of May 19,1874, P. L. 197, would, by the same token, be unconstitutional, the Commonwealth would be without a senatorial apportionment act and the General Assembly would thereby be under the immediate necessity of reapportioning the State’s senatorial districts on the basis of the latest decennial census. Equity affords no jurisdiction for judicial intervention in the circumstances pleaded. The General Assembly’s failure to divide the State into senatorial districts since the decennial census of 1950 raises a purely political question and whether the extant Apportionment Act of 1921 divides the State into senatorial districts “as nearly equal in population as may be” is not justiciable but rests alone in the discretion of the General Assembly.</p>

The District Court dismissed the complaint and the United States Supreme Court affirmed. While the ultimate decision was by a closely divided Court, the case has since been frequently cited with approval by the Supreme and other Federal Courts and numerous State Courts. The opinion in conformity with the decision was written by Mr. Justice Frankfurter who was joined by two other Justices. Mr. Justice Black, who filed a dissenting opinion, was also joined by two other Justices. The determining decisional factor was the vote for affirmance by Mr. Justice Rutledge who stated in his concurring opinion that equity should decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of the peculiar circumstances present in the case. The following from Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s opinion has since been widely quoted with approval, — “We are of opinion that the appellants ask of this Court what is beyond its competence to grant. This is one of those demands on judicial power which cannot be met by verbal fencing about ‘jurisdiction.’ It must be resolved by considerations on the basis of which this Court, from time to time, has refused to intervene in controversies. It has refused to do so because due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a <em>peculiarly political nature </em>and therefore not meet for judicial determination.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

Indeed, that is exactly what happened in <em>Shoemaker v. </em>Lawrence, 45 Dauphin 111, and <em>Lyme v. </em>Lawrence, 45 Dauphin 322. There the Apportionment Act of June 30, 1937, P.

In some instances, the Acts left out entirely certain territories and, in others, included non-contiguous territories within the same district and enumerated certain political subdivisions which did not exist. Equity’s jurisdiction to prevent enforcement of an apportionment act, <em>which contains patent factual defects or errors, </em>was unquestioned.</p>

In their opinion they said that “free and honest elections are the very foundation of our republican form of government”; and held that several provisions of the Constitution of the United States were violated by the State act.</p>

It states that to enjoin any election thereunder <em>newt November </em>would invalidate (a) all elections heretofore held under said Act and (b) all laws passed by Senators elected under said Act. This position fortunately is completely untenable! It has been clearly and convincingly answered and refuted in a learned opinion by Mr. Justice Simpson in <em>Armstrong v. King, </em>281 Pa., supra. Where an <em>election </em>of Senators or Representatives has been held and laws or matters of public importance passed upon by legislators <em>elected by the people, </em>it is too late, years thereafter, to question their election or deny the validity of their Acts. This is so obviously in the public interest — indeed it is a public necessity — that it seems astonishing it should be questioned or doubted. The <em>recent segregation </em>decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, as well as recent decisions of Federal Circuit and District Courts, have changed the timorous judicial concept that the <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>actions of a Governor or of a legislature or even of a President are “purely political” and therefore outside and beyond the jurisdiction of the Courts.

Furthermore, when the Courts of Pennsylvania declared prior Apportionment Acts to be unconstitutional, no chaos resulted. If the Legislature which is in session wishes to avoid even the possibility of chaos, it can easily do so by forthwith passing a valid constitutional Reapportionment Act.
