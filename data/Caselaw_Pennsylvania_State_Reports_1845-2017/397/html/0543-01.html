On July 17, 1958, appellant was tried and convicted of giving away drugs in violation of the Drug Act of 1957, P. L. 1013, §1, 35 P.S. §865. Even though this itself is an offense, there was evidence that he was to receive in the future some consideration for the transfer. He was thereafter sentenced to the Eastern State Penitentiary for a term of not less than five years nor more than ten years. The evidence relating to the transaction on which appellant was sentenced was that he shared narcotics he was keeping for his own personal use with a fellow user when the latter, saying that he was sick, pleaded with appellant for some drugs. At the time of sentencing the trial judge said that he believed the sentence to be “quite excessive” and was imposing it only because he believed it was mandatory under §12 of the Act of July 11, 1917, P. L. 758, as last amended by the Act of July 19, 1957, P. L. 1013, §1, 35 P.S. §865.</p>

This interpretation is further borne out by the use of the phrase “and not exceeding ten (10) years”. If we were to interpret this act so that the trial judge must impose a minimum sentence of five years and a maximum sentence of ten years, of what effect would be the words <em>“not exceeding” </em>ten years as applied to the maximum term? The word “sentence” when unmodified by the words “maximum” or “minimum” necessarily refers only to the maximum sentence for that is the legal sentence. The minimum sentence is merely an administrative notice by the court to the parole board that the question of parole might, at its expiration, properly be considered. <em>Commonwealth v. Kalck, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Lycett v. Ashe, </em>supra.</p>

In the Barr-Walker Act, Act of January 8, 1952, P. L. (1951) 1851, 19 P.S. §1166, the court was given the power to sentence certain sex offenders “to a state institution for an indeterminate term having a minimum of one day and a maximum of his natural life.” The words “minimum” and “maximum” are noticeably missing from the sentencing provision of the Drug Act of 1937, supra. The trial court’s opinion was based upon the belief that the Superior Court had decided that a minimum sentence of five years and a maximum sentence of ten years is mandatory in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Bozzi, </em><a href="/pa-super/178/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="178 Pa. Super. 224" data-case-ids="726468" data-case-paths="/pa-super/178/0224-01">178 Pa.

However, in the <em>Bomi </em>case, the question of whether the penalty provisions of the Drug Act indiscriminately required the imposition of a sentence having a five year minimum and a ten year maximum was not raised or passed upon by the Superior Court. Indeed, the Superior Court in <em>Bomi </em>did not have to decide what the term of the minimum or maxi<a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>mum sentence may or must be because the trial judge there said: “Having read the Act very carefully, I conclude that while it is possible that there may be some attempt to restrict the discretionary power of the Judge in sentencing, in this particular case it has not affected my discretion in the slightest, because were I to have full choice my sentence would be the same.”</p>
