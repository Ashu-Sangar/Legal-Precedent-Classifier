    <p id="AZpn" data-blocks='[["BL_326.6",326,[229,399,1169,1759]]]'>This action in equity was instituted by Daniel T. Mistick against the Monroeville Water Authority and its board of directors, Pride Engineering Associates, Inc., A. E. Masten and Go., Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Mellon National Bank and Trust Go. in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County on August 25, 1959. The suit was begun by writ of summons. On August 28, 1959, the Authority appeared and ruled plaintiff to file his complaint. Plaintiff then alleged improper, arbitrary and unreasonable conduct and breach of fiduciary relationship on the part of the Water Authority, its board members, consulting engineer, and financial adviser. On September 24, 1959, the Authority alleging the necessity of speedy final disposition petitioned this Court to take original jurisdiction and at the time of oral argument on the motion, plaintiff joined in the petition. We issued a special certiorari which brought the record here to determine whether the complaint is insufficient and not amendable. Article 5, §3, of the Pennsylvania Constitution expressly grants such power in case of injunction where a corporation is a party defendant, whether it be a private or municipal one. <em>Wentz v.

    <p id="b327-5" data-blocks='[["BL_327.4",327,[206,684,1150,541]]]'>The complaint sets forth specific averments with respect to the conduct of the affairs of the Authority and of the conduct of the board members, their agents and advisers, which, if proved, will show waste, mismanagement or at least ill-conceived or unreasonable plans. Actual fraud is not alleged. The need for expansion of wafer facilities is not attacked but the method pursued to accomplish such expansion as well as the refinancing method and costs are the subject of complaint.</p>
    <p id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[202,1238,1148,422]]]'>As to the Water Authority, plaintiff alleges that the construction of new facilities and the issuance of bonds contemplated by them are grossly and greatly in excess of what is needed to improve, modernize, and repair the existing system.

Masten negotiated “in behalf of the Authority” with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., the original bondholders, for the retirement of the original bonds and purchase by themselves of the new ones. The fact that in their agreement with the Authority, Masten &amp; Co. states they are acting as principals and not as “agents, employee or representative of the Authority” is not controlling. It is the fact of the relationship and not this declaration which is determinative of this question. It is explicitly alleged that on August 12, 1959, Masten &amp; Co., the admitted financial advisers of the Authority, offered to purchase the Authority’s bonds at a private negotiated price, which offer was accepted on the same day, and a printed prospectus dated August 17, 1959, was distributed. Proof of this relationship does not of itself vitiate the transaction but it does cast a burden on the parties standing in such relationship to show the legal propriety of the transaction. <em>McCown v. Fraser, </em><a href="/pa/327/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="327 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1176688" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0561-01">327 Pa. 561</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.%20674" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="192 A. 674">192 A. 674</a>; <em>White v.

It follows that these allegations of confidential relation<a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>ship supported by factual averments coupled with averments of unwarranted increases of both interest payments and rates to users prevent judgment being granted on the pleadings even though actual fraud is not alleged.</p>
    <p id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[204,631,1148,707]]]'>The complaint shows nothing from which the defense of laches would prevail. In <em>West v.

The offer of Masten &amp; Co. to purchase the bonds was accepted by the Authority on August 12, 1959. On August 13, 1959, the Authority executed contracts with the lowest bidders and authorized construction of the project. Until that time, plaintiff would have had no standing to bring any form of action. Thereafter on August 25, 1959, plaintiff commenced his action. These facts show no want of due diligence.</p>
    <p id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[202,1351,1148,654]]]'>This Court is not prepared to say as a matter of law that the allegations of plaintiff are so inconsistent with or fail to meet the requirements of what must be alleged in a complaint to set forth a cognizable cause of action.
