The building which Homestead contracted to demolish was erected between April and October, 1926. It was a three story concrete structure,' the walls of which were about 24 inches thick. It would appear that when originally built the building consisted of only two stories and the third was later added. Each of the first two stories, about 20 feet high, were reinforced by rods and were tied-in together; the third story, about 15 feet high, was reinforced by rods but was not tied-in to the other two, it simply rested on top of them. This condition, however, was not apparent from the outside, and apparently neither the defendant, Homestead, nor the plaintiff, Jemison, knew of it. That fact, however, could have been determined by an examination which would have entailed making an entry into the wall by the use of a drill, air hammer or sledge. Jemison, an experi-. enced crane operator since 1947, had on prior occasions operated his employer’s crane on another demolition <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>project being carried on by defendant. When he came to this particular project he received no instruction from defendant’s foreman except to “ball the building to the ground and see that none of it fell on the railroad tracks nearby.” Jemison began using what is known as a “headache ball”, weighing 2000 lbs., suspended on a cable attached to the crane. By the use of the crane he was directing the force of the headache ball against the east and west sides of the building, 4 to 5 feet from the fop. It was his purpose to knock off four or five feet from the top and then the connecting rods would be cut or burned by torches, by one of Homestead’s employees, and he would continue to operate in this fashion until the building would be razed. This was a proper method of demolition. His crane was in proper position for such use of the headache ball upon the assumption that the third story was actually tied-in to the first two stories. Had he known that it was not tied-in he could have and should have removed his crane back some distance so as to avoid injury to himself. Before any rods had been burned and while Jemison, wanting a drink of water, had stopped the operation of the crane and was on the catwalk preparing to j ump to the ground, he heard someone cry “Look out, it’s coming”. Thereupon the third story toppled off, turned upside down, fell on his crane and seriously injured him. The question with which we are concerned is whether the law imposed any duty upon Homestead to make a reasonable, preliminary inspection to determine problems of the type herein involved, or whether, having contracted for the crane and operator from Allegheny, it was.sufficient to let Allegheny’s crane operator find out for himself whether there were latent defects which would put him in danger.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Neither the jury nor the <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>court below were competent, by virtue of their general knowledge, to ‘determine whether such an inspection should have been made. In such case expert testimony was properly relied upon. As we said in <em>Fox v.

He was acquainted with the customs and practices of the industry with respect to inspection of buildings such as the one here involved. His qualifications were not questioned. The firm for which he worked had sent him to look at this particular building for the purpose of bidding upon the work. He testified as follows: “Q. According to the custom of the trade and the practice, what would have been done with regard to inspection or investigation of that building before wrecking could be started? A. Well, this particular building, when I looked at it, was top-heavy; the bin on the top of the building was top-heavy. Q. That is, you mean the greatest weight was up at the top? A. That’s right. And from the joint, which shows in the picture here, which would be the slab of the floor of the bin, it would have been necessary to find out if that was tied into the balance of the building.” He also testified that according to the practice in the industry, if something unusual or dangerous such as the failure of a tie-in was discovered, it would be the accepted practice to call that to the attention of the workman before he was permitted <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>to operate the crane in demolition and that such an inspection would have required <em>only an hour’s time </em>for two men working with an air hammer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> He had not himself made such an inspection because it was not necessary for the purpose of making a bid although it would have been neces'sary before the actual work started.</p>

It was not equally justified on the part of defendant to make this assumption because it owed the primary duty, not only to its own workmen but to any sub-contractor and the workmen employed by that sub-contractor, to make, in accordance with the custom of the trade, such reasonable inspection as would inform such persons whether the concrete bin was tied-in to the two lower floors of the building. It is obvious, in the light of the verdict, that had there been such a tie-in the bin would not have turned over and fallen on the crane, as it did, since the tie-in would have prevented such a precipitous result. Since the degree of danger which might be anticipated from a collapse of the building was high, a correspondingly high degree of care was called for. In <em>MacDougall v. Penna. Power </em>

But, as we have pointed out above, there was a duty not only in accordance with the custom of the trade but also in accordance with normally safe procedures for the defendant to have made the preliminary examination by any feasible method, which would have demonstrated that the upper bin had not been tied-in to the lowrer part of the building. If would be improper to hold that plaintiff was required to anticipate or assume that defendant had not taken the customary precautions or had not used due care in preparing for the demolition of the building. He was perfectly justified, in the absence of any information to the contrary, in assuming that the concrete building was reinforced and tied-in throughout. What we said in <em>McFadden v. Pennzoil Co., </em><a href="/pa/341/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="341 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1204492" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0433-01">341 Pa. 433</a>, 438, 439, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.2d%20370" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="19 A.2d 370">19 A. 2d 370</a>, is applicable here: “Apt, therefore, is the following, from Wagner v. P. R. T. Co., <a href="/pa/252/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="252 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1021604" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0354-01">252 Pa. 354</a>, 359-60: “The failure to anticipate negligence which results in an injury is not negligence and will not defea/t an action for the injury <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>sustained. A party is not bound to guard against the want of ordinary care on the part of another; he has a right to presume that ordinary care will be used to protect him and his property from injury. No one can complain of want of care in another where care is only rendered necessary by his own wrongful act.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[233,716,1157,602]]]'>It is true that two of defendant’s witnesses gave evidence that plaintiff, despite frequent warnings, demolished the first floor center columns and it was this which caused the building to fall. Even if this had not been challenged by the exhibits which show the lower portion to be not only intact but apparently untouched, it raises at most a question of fact for the jury’s determination and not one of law. The same is true of defendant’s testimony that defendant’s employees warned plaintiff to desist from continuing the use of the headache ball because the building was shaking.</p>
    <p id="b120-6" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[229,1338,1156,709]]]'>The defendant next contends that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. In considering this contention we apply a different rule than is applied in considering a motion for judgment n.o.v. In the latter instance we reject all evidence which does not support the verdict while in the former we consider all the evidence and assess its weight to determine whether the lower court abused its discretion. Our review of the evidence agrees with that of the court below and we agree with its finding that the weight of the evidence did not so preponderate in favor of the defendant so as to require that the jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff be set aside.</p>
    <p id="b120-7" data-blocks='[["BL_120.6",120,[229,2059,1153,321]],["BL_121.1",121,[146,353,1160,1761]]]'>The final contention of the defendant is that the verdict was excessive. It is perfectly clear that this plaintiff was seriously injured. When he was extricated from his position under the wrecked crane he was taken to the hospital, where he was found to have a compound fracture of the right ankle, a comminuted <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>fracture of the pelvis, general body contusions, laceration of the scalp; there was blood in the urine showing that he had. a contusion of the bladder, and he was suffering from shock. The surgeon used normal operative procedures for the compound fracture and dislocation of the ankle, requiring that a screw be put through the internal malleolus; a cast was applied and the patient returned to bed; the comminuted fracture of the pelvis was put into alignment by traction which left a permanent deformity. After leaving the hospital, on crutches, he was required to have physiotherapy. He was in the hospital from March 8, 1953 until June 27, 1953. At the time of trial there was still limitation of motion in the right ankle; the pelvis was still tilted due to the fracture and he was limping because the right heel was still <em>y2 </em>inch to an inch off the floor. There was competent medical testimony that the injury to the pelvis was a definite, permanent disability not likely to improve. His hospital and medical bills totalled $2,778. His average earnings for the three years prior to the accident were $5,520.89 a year. He was absent from work approximately <em>iy2 </em>months and suffered some permanent loss of earning power. Plaintiff was 46 years old at the time of trial. The court below did not believe that the verdict of $35,000 was excessive nor do we. This conclusion is fortified by the fact that none of the medical evidence, or any other evidence of damage, was contradicted or denied in any way by the defendant. The various issues of negligence, proximate cause and contributory negligence were submitted to the jury in a careful, complete and fair charge.</p>
