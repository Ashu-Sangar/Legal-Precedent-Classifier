With regard to the Sunflower District, Section 100 provides, “The Sunflower District is zoned primarily for <em>residential and agricultural uses as now esoist in the District” </em>(Emphasis supplied). Section 201 of the ordinance sets forth more specifically the uses to which land in that district may be put.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[249,694,1155,319]]]'>We are not called upon nor would we attempt to construe the word “religious” in the abstract.

    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.6",156,[241,1026,1161,1033]]]'>It should first be noted that the Sunflower District is zoned primarily for residential and agricultural uses. A cemetery clearly does not come within either of these. It is apparent from a reading of Section 201 in its entirety that those uses permitted therein which are not purely agricultural or purely residential are ancillary to them. These general observations are helpful in delineating the scope to be given to the word “religious.” They are helpful primarily because it is assumed as one of the basic premises of zoning that <em>area homogeneity </em>is one of the ends sought by a zoning ordinance. The above discussion is necessary and helpful because the word “religious” is a word of nebulous bounds and depends for its definition, if construed in the abstract, upon the subjective criteria used by the definer. In order to give the word meaning for the purposes of zoning one must look at the general purposes of zoning and the zoning ordinance in question as a whole.</p>
    <p id="b156-6" data-blocks='[["BL_156.7",156,[242,2078,1151,101]],["BL_157.1",157,[157,350,1158,1989]],["BL_158.1",158,[244,363,1153,210]]]'>If a business corporation had purchased the eighty-eight acres in question for use as a cemetery and as a <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>business venture for profit, there would be no question but that it was not a religious use within the terms of the Rochester Township ordinance. However, appellant contends that a different result obtains because the owner of the land is not a business corporation but a religious group and, therefore, the use to be made of the land is considered a religious use. The appellant supports this position by arguing that the place of burial and burial rites are important elements within the dogma of its religion. We feel that this argument goes too far; for, if accepted, it would mean that a slaughter house owned by a business would not be permitted in the Sunflower District, whereas, the same slaughter house, if owned by a religious sect having as part of its dogma the requirement that animals be slaughtered in a certain way by a certain person and in accord with certain rites, would be permitted. Appellant’s contention goes not to the actual use to be made of the land but to an extraneous aspect taken on by the land depending on the nature of the land’s owner. We do not find that such a distinction is justified within the intendment of the ordinance. We believe that a cemetery is basically a secular use of land and a use which is not incidental to or in support of the primary uses permitted in the Sunflower District, namely, residential and agricultural. We do not believe that the fact that the land will be owned by a religious institution alters the basic secular use to be made thereof, and we would be most reluctant to construe the ordinance so as to make a distinction not found therein based upon the nature of the owner of the land rather than the nature of the use to be made of the land. Any secular use under appellant’s contention can be capable of a religious characterization if a particular sect ascribed religious implications thereto. Were we to accept appellant’s position one of the basic purposes of zoning, <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>namely, <em>area homogeneity </em>and the stated primary use to be made of land in the Sunflower District, namely, residential and agricultural, would be rendered nugatory.</p>

    <p id="b158-8" data-blocks='[["BL_158.9",158,[239,1126,1153,212]]]'>The real question presented is whether the establishment of a cemetery by a Russian Orthodox Church, for burial of only members of that faith from a particular area, constitutes a religious use of land.</p>

That, of course, is quite true. Here, however, at the hearing before the zoning board of adjustment there was testimony that there were four Orthodox Churches in Ambridge whose members could be buried (about 60 a year) in the cemetery; that among the precepts of the church is the duty of burying the dead; that a cemetery set apart by the church for the burial of its dead members is consecrated or sacred ground being blessed for that purpose; that at the time of each burial the particular plot is blessed; that there is a religious rite for the burying of the dead required by ecclesiastical <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>laws and the canons of the church; that no persons of any other than the Orthodox faith may be buried in an Orthodox cemetery; that a church cemetery is a religious use of land in the opinion of the clergymen of the church.</p>
    <p id="b159-4" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[163,635,1147,255]]]'>The evidence of those who protested the cemetery did not attempt in any way to contradict this evidence.

    <p id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[160,911,1149,646]]]'>The position of the commissioners was spoken by one of them at the hearing before the zoning board, as follows: “. . . and now, as a private citizen, I would like to say that a cemetery can be considered a religious function — not just an Orthodox or Catholic cemetery — ■ any cemetery, because it does state in the Bible to bury the dead; but I cannot possibly believe that the men who drew up this zoning ordinance meant that a beautiful home should have a cemetery next door as a religious purpose. If they would have believed a cemetery should be in a residential area, they would have said so.”</p>

Both sides apparently agreed before the board of adjustment that the words “religious use” in the narrow sense did not include a cemetery but that in the broad, sense they did. The zoning board of adjustment made findings of fact, and refused the appeal on the ground that “(1) The requested use is not within those permitted under the Zoning Ordinance.” The board ended its discussion by saying “It is also the opinion of the Board that ■'religious’ uses contemplated in said ordinance would be churches or parochial schools, and not such incidental uses as cemeteries.” Upon appeal the court of common pleas said: “It is contended that a church cemetery is a religious use of land. Undoubtedly as <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>viewed by members- and officers of this Church, establishing a cemetery does constitute a religious use of land. To be a valid interpretation of the ordinance its provisions must apply to all cemeteries alike. Obviously the term religious use could not be applied to a cemetery, not affiliated with a church, and established as a business venture. Consequently, we cannot interpret religious use to permit cemeteries to be established. This is supported particularly in this case by the fact that the record indicates that the commissioners did not so interpret it.”</p>
    <p id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[257,974,1155,153]]]'>With this conclusion I do not agree. Certainly it is true that a cemetery established as a business venture is not a religious use of land.</p>
    <p id="b160-5" data-blocks='[["BL_160.5",160,[254,1140,1156,367]]]'>It is equally true that an ordinance, such as that involved in <em>Catholic Cemeteries Association of the Diocese of Pittsburgh Zoning </em>Case, <a href="/pa/379/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="379 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="1253637" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0516-01">379 Pa. 516</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.2d%20537" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="109 A.2d 537">109 A. 2d 537</a>, which permitted “churches and public schools”, did not authorize cemeteries.

I do not suggest that it is necessary to constitute a religious use that the cemetery itself, or even the particular plot, be consecrated or sacred ground. But it is necessary that there be a religious rite connected with the act of burial according to the ecclesiastical law and precepts of the particular sect.
