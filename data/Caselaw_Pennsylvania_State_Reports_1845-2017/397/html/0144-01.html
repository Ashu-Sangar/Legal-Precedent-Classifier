Evidence sufficient to warrant recovery must describe, picture or visualize what actually happened sufficiently to enable the fact-finding tribunal reasonably to conclude that the defendant was guilty of negligence and that his negligence was the proximate cause of the accident. Tested by this standard it seems to us that a reasonable inference from the facts stated by the court below, particularly No. 4 above, is that Seiger suddenly and abruptly changed course and drove his tractor-trailer out of the right-hand lane of traffic across the three lane highway into the path of the tractor-trailer operated by Lear. Seiger’s vehicle then came to rest on the wrong side of the highway. No evidence or explanation of this fact was offered by defendant nor was the failure to call Seiger as a witness accounted for. It would appear that Seiger had a clear view of Lear’s vehicle for several hundred <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>yards as lie approached it. The collision took place in the center lane of the highway, a lane in which, since there is no showing to the contrary, Lear had a right to be, at least to the extent of not having his being there denominated negligence as a matter of law.

In <em>Ebersole </em>we said “Proof of negligence may be furnished by the circumstances themselves and it is not essential to have eye-witness testimony, but where the circumstantial evidence is offered because direct proof is not available it must provide as the only reasonable inference the conclusion that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant.”</p>

At the time the court below relied upon <em>Ebersole </em>it was entitled to do so. That rule, however, is no longer applicable. The rule as stated in <em>Smith v.

It may be done only where the “only reasonable inference” of the evidence in <em>plaintiff’s own case </em>shows want of due care.

The difficulty with the application of its analysis to the true rule is that such analysis is the function of the jury and not of the court. A plaintiff is entitled to have his case considered by the jury even though he does not show that the only reasonable inference is that defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of the accident. It is enough that he produces evidence which may properly be found by the jury to justify an inference that the defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of the accident because such evidence outweighs even though it does not <em>exclude </em>an inference that the defendant was not negligent or that his negligence was not the proximate cause of the accident.
