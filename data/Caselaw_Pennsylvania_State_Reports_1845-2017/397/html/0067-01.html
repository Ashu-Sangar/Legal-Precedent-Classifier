The record in this case shows that the Grange paid $5,500 for the property; that the church structure cannot reasonably be adapted for dwelling purposes and that the value of the lot alone does not exceed $3,000. It is admitted that if the Grange cannot use the property as. a lodge hall or find a church congregation to purchase it, they will suffer a financial loss. Do these facts constitute the “unnecessary hardship” required for the grant of a variance under the decision of this Court? We think not. This Court has repeatedly held that where all that is shown is that the hardship is economic alone, a variance cannot be granted. <em>Spadaro v.

Also, this hardship was created by the Grange itself. It is admitted by the Grange that they knew that the township had zoning regulations but did not make any investigation to determine whether the property could be used as they contemplated under the applicable zoning ordinance. Where the hardship is, as here, self-inflicted, it is not the fune<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>tion of the court to grant redress in the form of a variance. The Grange cannot now he heard to complain of the economic hardship involved as the same conditions were present when they purchased the property. <em>Best v.

    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.4",100,[216,679,1164,1204]]]'>The Grange also asserted before the board and the court below that their proposed use of the building is substantially similar to the use of the building as a church and therefore it is entitled to the requested variance as a continuation of a prior nonconforming use. This contention must fall for two reasons. First, the use of these premises by the Beadling Presbyterian Church, for approximately 68 years, was not a nonconforming use. The township’s first zoning ordinance, enacted in 1926, authorized the use of land or a building thereon as a church, at locations permitted by the board. The Grange contends that because the board had to give prior approval to such use it is not a permitted use. However, this Court has defined a nonconforming use as the “use of a building or land that does not agree with the regulations of the use district in which it is situated.” <em>Haller Baking Company’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/295/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="295 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1115136" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0257-01">295 Pa. 257</a>, 259, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.%2077" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="145 A. 77">145 Atl. 77</a>. It is clear from the provisions of the township zoning ordinance, and the continued permitted existence of this church since 1926, that the use of this building as a church was a permitted use and not a nonconforming use.</p>

It must be presumed that the township intended to use the word “church” in the zoning ordinance according to its usual and ordinary meaning. <em>Shapiro v. Zoning </em>

Black’s Law Dictionary defines the word as “an organization for religious purposes or for the public 'worship of God.” The ordinary meaning of the term contemplates a place or edifice consecrated to religious worship, where people join together in some form of public worship. The courts of this state have similarly interpreted the word “church” when it has been employed in other statutes. See <em>Laymen’s Week-end Retreat League v. Butler, </em><a href="/pa-super/83/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="83 Pa. Super. 1" data-case-ids="661178" data-case-paths="/pa-super/83/0001-01">83 Pa.

It is admitted by the Grange that the lodge doesn’t meet for the purpose of religious worship or for the purpose of teaching religion. Certainly, therefore, it cannot be contended that the contemplated use of the property as a Grange meeting place will be the same as the prior church use. Significantly, the booklet declaring the purposes of the National Grange nowhere makes any claim or assertion that the object or one of the objects of the Grange is a meeting together of the members for the purpose of religious worship. The character and objects of the Grange are set forth in the booklet as follows: “Not only is the Grange the oldest and one of the strongest farm organizations in America, but it is the only farmers’ fraternity in the world. Bringing together into compact groups the people of the open country, it directs its energies toward four distinct objects: — (1) A more prosperous agriculture <em>; (2) </em>a more practical education; (3) a better community life; (4) higher ideals of manhood, womanhood and citizenship. . . .”</p>

On the contrary, the evidence conclusively establishes that the use which <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>the Grange proposes to make of the building constitutes a club or fraternal organization use. Such a use is not permitted in an R-2 residential district, but is permitted in a commercial district, a lower classification under the township zoning ordinance.</p>

There is evidence that during the final 8 or 9 years during which the church operated they allowed an unaffiliated women’s club to hold monthly business meetings and an occasional social affair in the church. However, this use of the church by the women’s club was an incidental use of the church property which was allowed by the express terms of the ordinance itself and which cannot give rise to nonconforming rights. <em>Yocom Appeal, </em><a href="/pa-super/142/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="142 Pa.

For approximately 40 years before the ordinance, this Church was a lawful building on the premises upon which it was erected. The fact that in 1926 a zoning ordinance was passed which made a Church in this district a “permitted” use, “subject to Township approval of location and site plans” is not only presently irrelevant but highly prejudicial to the Church. That “permission” could not legally transform and restrict this lawfully existing Church into <em>only </em>a “permissive” use, <em>and thereby prohibit its natural ex</em>pansion, increase extension or growth, to which it would be entitled as a matter of <em>right </em>— not a matter of “permission” or grace — under principles governing what the cases have inaptly called a “non-conforming” use.
