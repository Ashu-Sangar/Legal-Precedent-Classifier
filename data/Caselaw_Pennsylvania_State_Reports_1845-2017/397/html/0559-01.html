    <p id="b588-8" data-blocks='[["BL_588.11",588,[222,1158,1154,646]]]'>Edward Swierezewski, appellant, on May 5, 1955 was appointed a police officer of tlie City of New Kensington. On July 11, 1958 appellant was suspended from the police force and charged with conduct unbecoming an officer by the Mayor of the City.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He requested and received a hearing before the City Council and, after such hearing, the City Council dismissed appellant from the police force as of August 11, 1958. Appellant then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County which, after a hearing <em>de novo, </em>dismissed the appeal. From that action of the court below this appeal was taken.</p>

On that date, the appellant, a married man, after meeting one Rose Belli, a woman not his wife, at a New Kensington bar, took her in his car to the County Tavern in Leechburg, Armstrong County. For several <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>hours they stayed at this tavern drinking and then started to return to New Kensington with Bose Belli driving the car. An argument arose over the driving of the car, and while proceeding through Leechburg, Bose Belli stopped the car, alighted and went into the lobby of a hotel for the purpose of calling a taxi to take her home. While in the telephone booth a scuffle took place between Bose Belli and appellant and, during this scuffle, Bose Belli’s head came in contact with the telephone receiver causing her to bleed. Appellant fled from the hotel without rendering assistance to his companion. A Leechburg police officer, called to the scene, located appellant and directed that he follow him to the police station. Instead of doing as directed appellant fled in the opposite direction, struck a parked car, failed to stop but was finally apprehended. Later that same morning appellant was found guilty by a justice of the peace of disorderly conduct, was fined and released upon payment of the fine. While appellant did pay for the damages to the parked car, it was not until just before the City Council hearing that he filed the required accident report with the state.</p>
