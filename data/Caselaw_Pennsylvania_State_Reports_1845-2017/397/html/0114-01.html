Sussman Bros. &amp; </em>Co., <a href="/pa-super/127/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="127 Pa. Super. 104" data-case-ids="999715" data-case-paths="/pa-super/127/0104-01">127 Pa.

The court below recognized that this definition set forth an <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>exclusion to the coverage of the Workmen’s Compensation Act but held: “A cursory reading of this section evidences the legislative intent to exclude from the coverage of the Act injuries inflicted upon an employe by a third party because of personal enmity and <em>in no way connected with the employer’s business.” </em>(Emphasis supplied) The court then went on to say that the allegation of plaintiff that at the time he received the injury he was “pursuing his duties” as an employee of the defendant set forth a “classic case” for proceeding under the provisions of the act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Hence, the court held this injury was not within the exclusion provided in the act because it was incurred while plaintiff says he was “pursuing his duties”. However, if the attack is directed against the employee for personal reasons not connected with his employment, even though the assaulted employee is at that time pursuing the business of his employer, the legislature has stated in specific terms that the resulting injury is not an “injury by an accident in the course of his employment” as that term is used throughout the act. This becomes apparent upon a careful and complete reading of this definition. After specifically excluding an attack by a third person based <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>upon personal animosity from an “injury by an accident in tbe course of Ms employment” tbe act includes within its coverage “all <em>other </em>injuries sustained while the employe is actually engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of the employer, . . . .” (Emphasis supplied) The only “other” injuries referred to are those wMch are other than the result of a personal attack by a third person. Hence, the use of the word “other” necessarily implies that a personal attack may or may not be sustained while in the furtherance of an employer’s business but, nevertheless, it is not to be included within an “injury by an accident in the course of his employment.” To give any meaning at all to the word “other”, as we are required to do,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> this definition must be read so as to exclude a personal attack upon an employee even though it occurs while he is in the scope of his employment. Also, though the term “injury by an accident in the course of his employment” includes “all injuries caused by the condition of the premises or by the operation of the employer’s business or affairs thereon . . .” this does not mean that an injury resulting from an attack for personal reasons even if occurring in “the operation of the employer’s business” is included. TMs interpretation is implicit in the decisions of this court in <em>O’Rourke v. O’Rourke et </em>al., <a href="/pa/278/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="278 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1080595" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0052-01">278 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.%20172" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="122 A. 172">122 Atl. 172</a> and <em>Meucci v. Gallatin Coal </em>Co., <a href="/pa/279/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="279 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1083371" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0184-01">279 Pa. 184</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20766" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="123 A. 766">123 Atl. 766</a>. In both of these cases the Court, in determining if the employee’s injuries came witMn the coverage of the act, started with the premise the employee was acting in the course of his employment at the time he was assaulted <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>and then found it necessary to consider further if the assault was the result of personal enmity. The Court recognized that if personal enmity was the reason for the attack it made no difference if it occurred on the employer’s premises or if the employee was in the course of his employment, it was still not an “injury by an accident in the course of Ms employment” within the meaning of the act, In the <em>O’Rourke </em>case, supra, at page 54, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Fkazer, said: “It is not denied deceased wras acting in the course of his employment at the time he sustained the injury above referred to and the sole question is whether the person intended to inflict the injury because of reasons personal to him and not directed against Min as an employee, or in connection with his employment, as provided in Section 301 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915.” Thus, when an employee accepts the coverage of the act, he does so for all accidental injuries which occur in the course of his employment except those arising from an attack by a third person or fellow employee for personal reasons. This Court, in reviewing the effect of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, said in <em>Zimmer v. Casey, </em><a href="/pa/296/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="296 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1116637" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0529-01">296 Pa. 529</a>, 534, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20A.%20130" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="148 A. 130">148 Atl. 130</a>: “Article III, Section 301, has to do with the compensation and the injuries. When the employer and the employee accept the article by agreement, the employer agrees to pay compensation for injuries without regard to negligence according to a fixed schedule. <em>Compensable injuries include all except those arising from personal ill will.” </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>

At this time, despite constitutional authority to do so, the legislature had not covered occupational diseases. The employer took the position that the action was barred by the Workmen’s Compensation Act contending that an employee who contracted silicosis suffered an “injury in the course of his employment” within the meaning of the release provision in §303. In allowing plaintiff to recover the court held that an “injury” in this section must be read to mean an injury by an accident and that the silicosis here did not result from an accident. Hence, we held that plaintiff’s right to pursue his common law remedy was not affected by the passage of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. In reaching a different result after the inclusion of occupational diseases in the coverage of Workmen’s Compensation in <em>Moffett v.

To read the act so as to deny plaintiff his existing common law remedy without permitting Mm to come within the protective coverage of the Workmen’s Compensation Act might well violate the mandate of Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, which provides: “All courts shall be open; and every man for an injury done him in Ms lands, goods, person or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay. . . .” This provision is not modified by Article 3, Section 21 of the Constitution which enables the General Assembly to enact laws requiring reasonable compensation be paid to employees for injuries arising in the course of their employment without regard to fault. Nowhere in this latter provision<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> is the General <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>Assembly authorized to enact a law which vitiates an existing common law remedy without concurrently providing for some statutory remedy. Of course, the substituted remedy need not be the same, but that is far different from saying that no remedy at all may be substituted. It is only because of Article 3, Section 21, and the agreement of the parties, that the limited recovery in a Workmen’s Compensation case is valid. <em>Anderson v.

For this reason plaintiff’s complaint is deficient. It is our opinion, however, that in the interest of justice plaintiff be allowed leave to amend. If he can so amend to aver that the attack by Boyle was for personal reasons, his complaint will set forth a valid cause of action; if he cannot so amend, preliminary objections to the complaint may then properly be sustained.</p>
