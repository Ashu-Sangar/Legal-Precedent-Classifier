It therefore passed an ordinance rezoning a 1200 acre tract which included plaintiffs’ land to a class known as “limited industrial”.

This Court sustained the constitutionality of both laws and held that blighted areas — as distinguished from slum areas —which had become economically unsound or socially undesirable (a) could be taken by such Authorities for development in the public interest and such a taking would be, in contemplation of law, for public purposes and for public uses, and (b) public money may be spent therefor, and (c) private property may be acquired for such public purposes and uses by the power of eminent domain. The <em>Belovshy </em>case further decided that the property so acquired by eminent domain, could be resold or retransferred to private individuals <em>after the purpose of the talcing was accomplished, </em>and that the original taking did not lose its public character merely because the property was sold to private individuals for private gain.</p>
