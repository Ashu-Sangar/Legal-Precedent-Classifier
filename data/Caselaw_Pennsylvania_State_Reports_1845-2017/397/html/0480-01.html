Later that same date in Florida a written contract was drawn by the Olaughton attorney and an attorney selected by the former to act for Bear Stearns; this contract was executed by Mrs. Olaughton, as the seller, and by an Attorney Keith, as the agent for Bear Stearns. On June 29, Mrs. Olaughton, in her capacity of executrix, petitioned the Dade County Probate Court in Florida for its approval of the sale of the estate stock, setting forth, inter alia, in such petition the price offered, that said price closely approximated the average market price for said stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the past month, that the market for the stock was “thin”, that the stock could not be sold except at private sale without incurring great loss and finally that she, Mrs. Olaughton, believed “said offer represents the best price obtainable for said stock and that it is to the best interests of the estate that said offer be accepted”.

      <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>The thrust of appellant’s argument in this respect is stated in her brief: “There is <em>no credible evidence </em>on the record that prior to July 6, 1955 any disclosure was made directly to Plaintiff Mrs. Claughton that Defendant was also acting as agent for the purchasers who had agreed to compensate Defendant for so doing. There is no <em>evidence whatever </em>that Plaintiff Mrs. Claughton ever either consented to Defendant’s double agency and double commissions or had knowledge thereof. The <em>evidence establishes </em>that the Plaintiff Mrs. Claughton had no knowledge that Defendant was to be among the purchasers until the evening of June 27, after State Street, Pennroad and Bear Stearns had agreed to purchase.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

In making such an examination we were mindful that the contacts made by Lewis on behalf of Bear Stearns were made either directly with Mrs. Claughton, the principal, or with Attorney Sadler, her counsel. Under the circumstances herein portrayed we are satisfied that the authority of Attorney Sadler to act in this transaction was such that notification to him was notice to Mrs. Claughton (Restatement, Agency 2d, §268) and that any knowledge on the part of Attorney Sadler concerning this transaction was such that it was his duty to transmit such knowledge to Mrs. Claughton (Restatement, Agency 2d, §272). It is evident that knowledge was brought both to the principal and her agent to the effect that Lewis was <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>representing both Mrs. Claughton and the purchasers, that Bear Stearns was receiving double commissions and was itself participating with Pennroad and State Street in the purchase of this block of securities. To detail at length the evidence in this respect could serve no useful purpose; it is evident the record fully justifies the result reached in the court below.</p>
    <p id="b521-3" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[125,748,1159,1323]]]'>Appellant next argues that the trial judge by failing to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law and by failing to rule upon objections and motions left the record in a state of confusion. In the course of this opinion we have had occasion to note that, under Buie 270 of the Courts of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, “(b) The decision of the trial judge may consist only of his decision of the case, but he may include also such other matters as he deems desirable”. Such rule relieves a trial judge in Philadelphia County from making specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. However, an examination of both opinions in the court below indicates that certain findings of fact and conclusions of law were made, albeit in general terms ; a failure to enumerate specifically such findings of fact and conclusions of law does not detract from the fact of their presence in the coui't’s opinions as a reading thereof will readily indicate. The opinions of the court below reveal that all the relevant and competent evidence was thoroughly taken into consideration by the court. The technical argument now advanced cannot prevail in the face of a record which indicates that appellant’s case was fairly and thoroughly tried.</p>

The court below in its opinion has fully and adequately <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>disposed of this complaint. “One [complaint] is that she was ■ denied discovery procedure. At first she sought leave to take the oral depositions of Pennroad and State Street officials [Pennroad and State Street were not parties to this litigation] as under cross-examination. This novel request was denied, and plaintiff asked to take their oral depositions directly. Upon assurance from defendant’s counsel that the witnesses would be available and would co-operate, the Court denied the request but gave plaintiff leave to file interrogatories. This was not done. Plaintiff had already filed interrogatories, some sixty-nine of them, and examined many records of defendant and other witnesses. Plaintiff did not demur to the Court’s action but came to trial without asking for a continuance. It was only after she had put on her whole case that her counsel asked for a recess to have discovery by oral depositions.</p>

This moral principle has become embedded in the law. In this case defendant attempted to serve two masters — the seller and the purchasers of 475.000 shares — and also itself (in the capacity of both agent and principal), and to take for itself an agent’s commission from the seller on 525,000 shares of stock (including a commission on 50,000 shares which it purchased as principal), and still another commission from the purchasers of 475,000 shares. The majority agree that this can be lawfully done only if defendant proved such an arrangement by the clearest possible evidence, and the entire transaction was clearly explained to and agreed to by plaintiff. Obviously, the best evidence was not a telephone conversation between defendant’s representative and plaintiff’s lawyer which preceded the written contract and produced oath against oath — the best evidence was the telephoned telegram sent by Bear Stearns &amp; Company, and especially the subsequent written contract entered into between plaintiff and Bear Stearns &amp; Company.</p>
