L. 1333, §1701 et seq., 25 P.S. §3261) makes no provision for contesting or recounting the vote on a referendum. The court below discharged the rule and ordered the recount.

The purpose is to ascertain whether fraud or substantial error has occurred in the computation of the votes or marking of the ballots in a particular precinct. It does not provide for a general investigation of all matters involving the election machinery. If the earlier sections were so construed as to extend the court’s jurisdiction over matters which do not directly relate to correcting fraudulent or erroneous returns, the subject matter dealt with, there would be no need for an election contest”.</p>

There is no mention of “office or offices”, as there is in Section 1701, and although there is provision in both sections that notice of the recount shall be given to candidates, it is obvious that in a vote on a referendum it is not necessarily possible to know who may be interested and hence entitled to notice; theoretically the entire constituency is interested. It would be senseless to distinguish between votes cast by ballot and those cast on a voting machine, and therefore we believe that the desire of the Legislature was to provide recount machinery for all matters voted upon.</p>
