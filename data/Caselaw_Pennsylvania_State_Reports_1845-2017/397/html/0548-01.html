The appellee, Dr. Maffucci, her private physician, was summoned and upon his arrival at the hospital an X-ray examination, at his direction, was made of Mrs. Donaldson’s left wrist and jaw. This examination indicated a “Colics fracture” of the left wrist consisting of a “fracture of the distal radial metaphysis with marked posterior and lateral displacement of the distal fragment which is rotated posteriorly and over-rides the proximal fragment for about 1cm” and a “fracture of the ulnar styloid”.

Later on the same morning Dr. Maffucci removed the cast and manipulated the fracture, without anesthesia. An X-ray examination then made indicated that the overriding of the bones had been corrected, that there was “about 5mm posterior displacement of the distal fragment . . . now rotated posteriorly for only 15 degrees” and that the position was improved over that shown in the previous film. The east was then reapplied. Dr. Sipes, the senior surgeon of the hospital was called into consultation by Dr. Maffucci; on July 22nd Dr. Sipes recommended an “open reduction”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which never took place. Another X-ray examination was made on July 23rd which indi<a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>cated that the improvement of position obtained by the second “closed reduction” had been lost. This examination was not interpreted for Dr. Maffucci until after Mrs. Donaldson had left the hospital on July 24th. At the time Mrs. Donaldson left the hospital her left arm from the elbow to the tips of her fingers was enclosed in a cast. Dr. Maffucci did not treat Mrs. Donaldson subsequent to July 24th.</p>

Mrs. Donaldson was readmitted on July 28th to the hospital Avhere a further examination by X-ray and fluoroscope revealed the existence of the same conditions as noted in the X-ray examination of July 2Srd. Dr. Palin then attempted another “closed reduction” on July 29th. Mrs. Donaldson left the hospital on July 31st and remained thereafter under Dr. Palin’s care. She was readmitted to the hospital on September 20th, it having been discovered that, despite Dr. Palin’s attempt at a “closed reduction”, a non-union of the bones existed. While at the hospital two “open reductions” were performed by Dr. Palin Avhich included the insertion first of wires, then later of a bone plate. At a subsequent time, at Dr. Palin’s suggestion, Mrs. Donaldson consulted a Dr. White in Pittsburgh Avho performed further operations on the wrist.</p>

    <p id="b583-3" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[144,625,1166,1583]],["BL_584.1",584,[242,360,1162,1412]]]'>Appellants initially argue that the <em>expert testimony rule </em>has no present application because of the factual situation. They urge that a “layman is equally competent [equally to an expert] in determining whether a steady hand had been used in approximating the bone fragments and <em>toheiher the bones in this very common type of fracture were properly </em>approximated”. In short, the appellants argue: we have proven a poor result from the treatment for a very common wrist fracture and, since a steady hand on the part of the doctor was all that was required to make a proper “closed reduction” and secure a good result, a jury, particularly with evidence of intoxication before it, would be equally as competent as any expert to find whether the doctor’s hand was or was not unsteady. Such argument entirely ignores the absence of any evidence of record to indicate <em>why </em>Mrs. Donaldson’s wrist was deformed and her fingers stiff and the complete lack of proof of any causal relationship between any act or omission to act on Dr. Maffucci’s part and the condition of the wrist and fingers. The record shows that Dr. Palin performed exactly the same operation on the wrist as did Dr. Maffucci and he, too, was unable to secure a mainvtainable proper bone position. Whether or not Dr. Maffucci exercised skill and diligence in his treatment of Mrs. Donaldson and whether or not the condition of her wrist and fingers was attributable to any failure to exercise skill and diligence on Dr. Maffucci’s part required the production of expert testimony which the <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>appellants failed to furnish. The language of this Court in Robinson, supra (pp. 297, 298) is apposite: “The only exception to this otherwise invariable rule [expert testimony rule] is in cases where the matter under investigation is so simple, and the lack of skill or want of care so obvious, as to be within the range of the ordinary experience and comprehension of even non-professional persons, as, for example, where a gauze pad is left in the body of a patient following an operation (Davis v. Kerr, <a href="/pa/239/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="239 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="995992" data-case-paths="/pa/239/0351-01">239 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20A.%201007" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="86 A. 1007">86 A. 1007</a>), or where a dentist, in working on a tooth, uses a tool with a small rotating emery disc at the end and allows it to slip and to remain revolving in the patient’s mouth, grinding and tearing her tongue (Dux v. Shaver, <a href="/pa-super/105/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="105 Pa. Super. 344" data-case-ids="701622" data-case-paths="/pa-super/105/0344-01">105 Pa.

So, likewise, there might be imagined a case where a surgeon engaged in removing a tumor from a patient’s scalp would let his knife slip and cut off the patient’s ear, or where he undertook to stitch a wound on his patient’s cheek and by an awkward move would thrust his needle into the patient’s eye. It would be a matter of common knowledge and observation that such things do not ordinarily attend the service of one exercising ordinary skill and experience in the work of surgery because they involve ulterior or extraneous acts or omissions the judgment of which would not require scientific opinion.”</p>

The court below well answered this contention: “At no time did [Dr. Palin] state that the defendant deviated from proper practices in his treatment of the plaintiff. In fact, the testimony discloses that when the plaintiff first came to Dr. Palin, he used the same method of treatment used by the defendant, that is, manipulation by closed reduction. Subsequently, he attempted to secure a proper alignment by an open reduction which had been <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>previously advised by Dr. Sipes in the presence of the plaintiff and the defendant. At no time was Dr. Palin asked to give his professional opinion as to the cause of the condition of the plaintiffs wrist and hand when she first came to him for treatment, or when she subsequently returned to him for further treatment, or the cause of the condition of the wrist and hand at the time of trial. ... In any event, the plaintiffs chose to submit their case on the theory of inferred negligence, . . . Our own independent examination of Dr. Palin’s testimony reveals not a single instance in which Dr. Palin, by direction or indirection, indicated that, in his opinion, Dr. Maffucci failed to exercise the requisite skill and knowledge or that, in his opinion, the condition of Mrs. Donaldson’s wrist and fingers resulted from any failure to exercise such skill and knowledge. On the contrary, Dr. Palin’s responses upon cross-examination would indicate that the practices adopted by Dr. Maffucci were appropriate. Even on the subject of the length of the cast, while Dr. Palin indicated that he would have limited the extent of the cast to the knuckles rather than the tips of the fingers, yet he did not indicate that the extent of the cast employed by Dr. Maffucci contributed to the condition of either the fingers or wrist of Mrs. Donaldson. Dr. Palin’s testimony did not satisfy the requirements of the <em>expert testimony rule.</em>

The trial court properly rejected such evidence under the circumstances. Until the appellants first submitted evidence that the condition of Mrs. Donaldson’s wrist and fingers resulted from a lack of exercise of skill and knowledge on Dr. Maffucci’s part any evidence of intoxication was irrelevant. Had the appellants shown that, because of some act or omission <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>to act upon the part of Dr. Maffucci, Mrs. Donaldson’s wrist became deformed or her fingers rendered stiff and immobile, then evidence of Dr. Maffucci’s intoxicated state at the time he acted or omitted to act would have been admissible.

Each of these questions has been examined by us. Each question was a hypothetical question and was addressed to Dr. Palin in the capacity of an expert witness.

Appellants proved only that Mrs. Donaldson’s wrist was deformed and her fingers stiff, a poor result which, however, raises neither a presumption nor an inference of negligent conduct on the part of Dr. Maffucci. Appellants completely failed to prove any negligent conduct which caused the condition of Mrs. Donaldson’s wrist and fingers.</p>
