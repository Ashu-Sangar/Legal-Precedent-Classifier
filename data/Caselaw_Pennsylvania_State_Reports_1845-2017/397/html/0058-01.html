At the time of this accident Jacoby was 18 years of age and a high school student. Defendant had, on previous occasions, given Jacoby the use of his automobile for the purpose of doing errands for himself and his mother. Not long before the accident Jacoby had taken the car to school where he relined its brakes for defendant who supplied the materials and paid for the work. Jacoby had previously washed and waxed the car and had been paid for it. On the day of the accident the defendant was visiting Jacoby’s home and Jacoby asked for permission to clean and wax the car. The permission was granted and defendant gave him the keys. While there were waxing materials in the automobile, Jacoby used his own. He took the car about 1 p.m. and drove to the home of a friend in nearby Allentown. Having picked up his Mend they drove together to Jim Thorpe, a distance of 35 miles, where Jacoby commenced to wax the car. Defendant <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>testified that Jacoby asked permission to do this work at a nearby gas station; that he had not given him permission to go to Jim. Thorpe, nor, on the other hand, had he forbidden it. Jacoby testified that there was no mention of washing the car at the gas station or at any other specific location. He also testified that in going to Jim Thorpe he had originally in mind but abandoned the idea of visiting a girl and other persons whom, he had met at a wedding. Jacoby never told defendant he was going to drive to Jim Thorpe; he never asked permission to go to Jim Thorpe; and he admitted that he. “did not go to Jim Thorpe that day on any business of defendant”.</p>

Gangewere was to take the car to the gas station at Chapel and Emmaus Avenue. The logical and proper place to wash the car was at the gas station, where they had washing facilities available, and <em>the Court does not believe the testimony of Robert Jacoby </em>that he drove his father’s car from 2232 Cypress Avenue, Salisbury Township, to Jim Thorpe, a distance of approximately 35 miles, to a place where there were no facilities to wash . . . and wax it . . . and this testimony does not have the ring of truthfulness to it, and, in the opinion of the Court, is incredible.

Gangewere, <em>and for his own pleasure.</em>

The Majority attempts to bolster its position by quoting at length from the Trial Judge’s opinion which leaves much to be desired in the way of logic and ratiocination.</p>
    <p id="b92-7" data-blocks='[["BL_92.7",92,[231,1901,1154,434]]]'>The Trial Judge said: “The Court does not believe the testimony of Robert Jacoby that he drove his father’s car from 2232 Cypress Avenue, Salisbury Township, to Jim Thorpe, a distance of approximately 35 miles, to a place where there were no facilities to wash . . . and wax it . . . and this testimony does not have the ring of truthfulness to it, and, in the opinion of the Court, is incredible.”</p>

      <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>But it is not for the Trial Judge to say that the testimony is incredible. The credibility of witnesses is for the jury. This is hornbook law. The Trial Judge said that Jacoby’s testimony did not have “the ring of truthfulness,” but twelve impartial persons heard the same testimony and it rang without dissonance or disharmony in their ears. There was nothing inherently incredible in Jacoby’s testimony; it did not oppose common knowledge and common experience. He said nothing which defied the law of physics; he said nothing which could not happen to an 18-year old lad.</p>
    <p id="b93-3" data-blocks='[["BL_93.4",93,[163,973,1149,930]]]'>Jacoby testified that he often drove his father’s car, that on occasion he relined its brakes and performed other chores in connection with the car, that he frequently washed and waxed the car, that his father paid Mm for the work, and that when he worked on the car, his father did not prescribe where he was to accomplish the task assigned to him. On Sunday, December 18, 1955, Jacoby and his father agreed that he was to wax the car and that he was to return it between 5 and 6 o’clock. That was the only condition of the employment. Jacoby took the car and drove it to Jim Thorpe (the town named after the famous Indian athlete). There he started to wax the car, but, before he could complete the task, the lateness of the hour counseled him to start back to Allentown so as to reach that city by 5 or 6 o’clock. It was on this return trip that the accident occurred.</p>
    <p id="b93-4" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[160,1917,1149,431]],["BL_94.1",94,[249,370,1152,377]]]'>The Trial Judge said that Jacoby went to Jim Thorpe to see a girl friend. There is nothing extraordinary about an 18-year old lad having a heart interest. (Even lads of a slightly older age have heart interests). Since Jacoby’s father did not specify where the car was to be waxed, and Jacoby had on previous occasions chosen the place where to work on the car, Jacoby was not breaching any condition of <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>employment when lie drove to the town of Jim Thorpe. The Trial Judge seemed to think that Jacoby’s visit to Jim Thorpe to see a girl friend was inconsistent with the job of waxing the car. But there is no reason why a young man cannot wax a car and wax romantic at the same time. The irony of the situation is that Jacoby never got to see his girl friend after all.</p>
    <p id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[245,758,1155,478]]]'>The jury decided after hearing all the evidence that Jacoby was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred, and I see no reason to disturb their finding.

He said he could not accept the second answer because by observing Jacoby on the witness stand, his demeanor and attitude, he could not believe him. But he did believe him on the matter of the master- and-servant testimony. Jacoby was the only witness for the plaintiff. How could the Trial Judge find Jacoby entirely trustworthy as he related the master- and-servant relationship but find him untrustworthy as he related the matter of the scope of employment?</p>
