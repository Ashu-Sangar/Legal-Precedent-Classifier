The accident occurred on October 22, 1954, in Sharon, Pennsylvania, when a vehicle, being driven by Fred McCoy, in a southivard direction on Flowers Avenue, came in contact Avith the minor plaintiff, Dennis Bosche,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> causing a head injury to him which was permanent in nature. The action was commenced by William Bosche as parent and natural guardian both in his own right and on behalf of Dennis. Prior to the trial the defendant, <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>Fred McCoy, died and Ms executor, Frank C. McCoy, was substituted for Mm on the record. The defendant joined the father and mother of Dennis as additional defendants. On November 8, 1956, the deposition of Fred McCoy was taken to perpetuate Ms testimony and in May, 1957, during the lifetime of Fred McCoy, the deposition of the minor plaintiff, Dennis, was taken. At that time Dennis was 7 years 9 months old. The trial commenced on February 3, 1958 and concluded on February 6, 1958. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the parent, William Eosche, in his own right and also on behalf of the minor child. Defendant filed motions for judgment n.o.v. and for a new trial. These were denied and judgments were entered on the verdict. On appeal the motion for judgment n.o.v. has not been pressed. In any event, the evidence actually received by the court, whether its rulings thereon were right or wrong, must be considered in deciding such a motion. <em>Cherry v.

That was the view originally taken by the trial judge when the question of competency was first raised. Thereafter, however, he applied the rule that no particular age has been held to be conclusive of incapacity and that the question must be judicially ascertained in the light of the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular case. However, the issue is not to be determined merely because of the capacity of the witness at the time he is called to communicate his thoughts in terms of language. There must be (1) such capacity to communicate, including as it does both an ability to understand questions and to frame <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>and express intelligent answers, (2) mental capacity to observe the occurrence itself and the capacity of remembering <em>what it is </em>that she is called to testify about and (3) a consciousness of the duty to speak the truth. These first two considerations are in some instances easily answered where a 7 year old witness is called upon to testify as to a very recent event, particularly where the testimony covers a simple and uncomplicated fact. The situation, however, is not the same where a 7 year old witness is called upon to testify what that witness saw when she was 4 years of age. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Under 14 there must be judicial inquiry as to mental capacity, which must be more searching in proportion to chronological immaturity. In the disposition of such a question the courts are confronted by conflicting policies. One is that a party should not be denied justice because reliance necessarily must be placed upon the testimony of a child of tender years. But, on the other hand, experience has informed us that children are peculiarly susceptible to the world of make-believe and of suggestions. Care must be exercised to keep the balance true as between these conflicting claims. So it is that much must be left to the discretion of the trial judge who hears and sees the witness.</p>

Here her testimony was not to a simple fact, such as that a dog bit her or that it was her father who shot her mother. Her testimony involved the exercise of contemporaneous judgment as to different factors ordinarily beyond the comprehension of a 4 year old child. It was not shown that she was precocious, but, on the other hand, her testimony did not show that she was not an ordinarily intelligent child for her age. The important part of her testimony on direct examination was as follows: “Q. Tell us what happened that day. A. Well, he was on the other side of the street and he walked in the middle of the street and he was calling us names and a car came up from State Street and it came down and it turned and we told him to get out of the way and he didn’t listen and the car came down and hit him and the guy came and he picked him up and he took him in the ear and he took the shoes in there. Q. What side of the street were you on, honey? A. I was on the side 1 live. Q. And on what side was Denny <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>on before he walked into the street? A. He was on Mrs. Moran’s side — the other side of the street.” On cross-examination her essential testimony remained unshaken but she did not remember how long she had been on the sidewalk, nor whether she had her lunch that day before the accident, nor how long Dennis had been in the street, although she later stated he had been standing there about “ten minutes”.</p>

Once the living witness is called the surviving party is competent to testify to the “relevant matter” and not merely a particular facet of it which is covered by the “living witness”. Upon retrial the court below should inquire into the competency of the minor plaintiff in accordance with the principles we have outlined in respect of the testimony of Carolyn Laou, and if satisfied that he is competent and defendant offers in evidence the deposition of his decedent or the testimony of a living witness to the relevant matter, then the testimony of the minor plaintiff is admissible.

These Tables state that “the life tables are based on the 1950 census of population and deaths of the 3-year period 1949-1951 for the entire continental United States . . . Nine detailed life tables are contained in this report. Life tables are given for whites and nonwhites, separately by sex, and for both sexes combined, and also for the total population and for total males and total females . . . Prior to the calculation of the values of the life tables, the more serious errors were examined carefully, and the basic data were adjusted to remove errors when corrections were available or could be derived.” United States Life Tables: 1949-51, page 5. These tables were admissible. The use made of them and the instructions of the court thereon, however, pose a different question.</p>

Tbe rationale of these cases and tbe difference between a charge regarding tbe use of mortality tables in tbe case of a wage earner and that of a child convinces us that tbe charge of tbe trial judge was not inadequate.</p>

This kind of argument has no proper place in tbe trial of a case.

Again, we do not say that tbe trial judge abused bis discretion; but this type of statement also should not be repeated. Despite tbe agreement, if it did exist, defendant was perfectly justified in not making tbe examination and tbe failure to make it was not proper comment <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>to the jury.
