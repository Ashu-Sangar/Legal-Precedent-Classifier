Second, driving “fast” and “stepping on it” is not per se evidence of unlawful speed, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff. Third, there was no evidence that Fred did “Step on it”; and fourth, there is no evidence that “Stepping on it” was the real or proximate or contributing cause of Fred’s losing control of the car and driving off the road.
