      <em>Macbeth-Evans Glass Company v. Schnelbach, </em>supra, rules the instant case. In that case the Court said: “It may now be accepted as settled law, under the authority of English and American cases, that courts of equity if the facts warrant will restrain an employee from making disclosure or use of trade secrets communicated to him in course of a confidential employment. The character of the secrets, if they be peculiar and important to the business, is not material. They may be secrets of trade, or secrets of title, <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>or secret processes of manufacture, or any other secrets important to the business of the employer. They, however, must be the particular secrets of the complaining employer, not general secrets of the trade in which he is engaged, nor even the same secrets as those sought to be protected, if they be discovered by the independent investigation of outside parties. The duty of the servant not to disclose the secrets of the master may arise from an express contract, or it may be implied from their confidential relations. It is likewise true that other persons who induce such disclosures by an employee, knowing of his contract not to disclose, or knowing that the disclosure is in violation of the confidence reposed in him by his employer, will be enjoined from making use of the information so obtained. Where confidence is reposed, and the employee by reason of the confidential relation has acquired knowledge of trade secrets, he will not be permitted to make disclosure of those secrets to others to the prejudice of his employer.”</p>

      <em>Morgan’s Home Equipment Corp. v. Martucci, </em>390 Pa., supra, in principle likewise supports the Chancellor’s decree. While that case contained a restrictive covenant not present in the instant case, the Court’s opinion is equally applicable to the instant case. The Court said (pages 623, 624, 625, and 626) : “In many businesses, permanent and exclusive relationships are established between customers and salesmen. The customer lists and customer information which have been compiled by such firms represent a material investment of employers’ time and money. This information is highly confidential and constitutes a valuable asset. Such data has been held to be property in the nature of a ‘trade secret’ for which an employer is entitled to protection, independent of a non-disclosure contract, either under the law of agency or under the law of <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>unfair trade practices.
