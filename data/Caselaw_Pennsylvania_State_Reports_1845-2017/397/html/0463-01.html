It should have been obvious to appellants that the establishment of the taproom-restaurant in this quiet residential neighborhood would seriously interfere with the residential character of the area and with appellees’ enjoyment of their properties. The practically unanimous opposition of all the residents of this district should have made evident to the appellants at the outset that whatever patronage the taproom-restaurant would enjoy would have to come from other areas. Once the taproom-restaurant began operation it became evident that many of its patrons came from the congested slum area and that the taproom-restaurant had become a magnet of attraction to many persons whose standards of conduct were completely foreign to those of the decent, law abiding residents of the neighborhood.

Until the establishment of this restaurant in the area such offensive public conduct was unknown; it was the establishment of the business within this area which attracted those persons whose conduct so mortified and disgusted the residents of this neighborhood. The factor which introduced this conduct into the area was the establishment of this taproom-business with its attraction for undesirables from other areas; assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that appellants could not control the conduct of their patrons outside the premises, is that any excuse for the continuance in business of this establishment whose existence is solely and primarily responsible for the attraction of those persons into this neighborhood whose conduct so offends the morals of the property owners situated therein? Assuming that appellants could not control the conduct of their patrons, is this business which brings into the area by way of attraction those persons whose conduct is reprehensible to be permitted to be operated simply because it has been given an aura of respectability and legality by the issuance of a liquor license? The conduct which has disturbed the peace and quiet of this residential area and affronted the sensibilities of appellees endeavoring to maintain in this urban area a decent, clean and wholesome environment in which to live and rear their families directly resulted from the operation of this taproom-restaurant.

Appeal No. 101 is by the proprietors of the restaurant from the decree of <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>the court perpetually enjoining them from operating a restaurant despite their having been granted a liquor license by the Liquor Control Board. The second appeal, No. 102, is from the action of the court below refusing to restrain appellees from picketing and boycotting their restaurant.</p>

I do not agree with this disposition. This is a separate appeal and must be passed upon. There does not seem to me to be anything in the record that would justify our dismissal of it as being moot. The picketing and boycotting was going on even during final hearing in the court below.</p>

    <p id="b501-6" data-blocks='[["BL_501.6",501,[155,1467,1151,762]]]'>It would appear that immediately following Brodsky’s application for the transfer of the restaurant liquor license to its present location the neighbors, including plaintiffs, presented their objections to the Liquor Control Board. Those objections were not personal to Brodsky but were based upon the fear that the owner could not control patrons once they got outside the premises. The Liquor Control Board, following our decision in <em>Obradovich Liquor License </em>Case, <a href="/pa/386/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="386 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1268295" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0342-01">386 Pa. 342</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20435" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="126 A.2d 435">126 A. 2d 435</a>, held that it was required by law to grant the transfer and so it was approved. The restaurant opened March 31, 1958 with an approximately |35,000 investment in premises and cost of improvements.</p>

Plaintiff thereafter filed an amended complaint against Brodsky as sole defendant.</p>
    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[237,1232,1155,653]]]'>Shortly after the restaurant opened signs appeared on various porches reciting “We Oppose the Tap Room at 19th &amp; Pacific Sts. Don’t Patronize It. The Block Organization.” Picketing commenced at the same time and continued, without interruption, until the restaurant was forced to close. Brodsky not only had been warned to remove the restaurant but he and his wife received anonymous telephone calls at night at their home. The plaintiffs frankly admitted that the boycott and picketing was for the express purpose of compelling Brodsky to close up his restaurant and to destroy his business.</p>

In any case where that is its purpose the picketing is unlawful. In this case the picketing was not a means of communicating the nature of a dispute to the public. There was no demand for Brodsky to meet. There was nothing he could concede and thereby buy peace and thereafter carry on his business without further interference. The fixed purpose of the neighborhood was to extirpate this lawful business, to destroy it completely.</p>

For that reason alone the Chancellor should have denied them the equitable relief which they sought. That the purpose of the picketing was unlawful is readily apparent from even the most cursory reading of the record.</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[258,732,1154,819]]]'>The appellee Reid was asked, “If the Court decided there was no nuisance would you continue your picketing?”, and she answered “Yes”. The witness Foster was asked, “If the Court should find in this matter that there is no nuisance, you nevertheless intend to continue your picketing?”, and he answered, “I intend to picket until the place leaves, period”. One neighborhood picket told Brodsky, “Jew Punk, we’ll carry you out; we’ll get you out of here one way or another; we’ll bring you out feet first or we’ll get you out, one way or another, feet first if possible.” A second picket told him, “You need a police escort every night, not just one night, to go home.” A third picket cursed him and said, “Brodsky, we’re going to get you out of here by hook or crook.”</p>

Courts cannot say that persons from undesirable neighborhoods may not enter more desirable ones and purchase liquor from duly licensed establishments.<a class="footnotemark">1</a> If this Civic League can prevent the operation of this lawful business simply because they do not like it they can prevent other persons from coming to live in their neighborhood because they do not like them. After they come the question is different. It is this aspect of the case which troubles me.</p>
    <p id="b504-7" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[259,2224,1153,154]],["BL_505.1",505,[171,343,1147,1206]]]'>I feel deeply sympathetic to the efforts of the Civic League in this as well as all other neighborhoods in maintaining their properties and the character of the <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>neighborhood and in their efforts to eliminate or mitigate nuisances as they arise and to work cooperatively with the police. Had they gone to the court below without having first taken the law into their own hands even before the restaurant opened and thus prevented a man with a 24 year old record of good conduct from even having a fair chance to operate his business, the case might stand upon a different footing. However, it seems to me that the neighborhood is infected by a slight touch of anarchy. No matter how laudable their purpose may be the legislature has put control of the liquor traffic, licensing, operating, revocation, suspension of licenses, in the Liquor Control Board. The people of the neighborhood, having failed to make their protest succeed because of the mandatory provision of the Liquor Control Act took the law into their own hands. The violence that subsequently came about may well have been partly due to the resentment of the patrons of the restaurant to the picketing itself. The well recognized equitable principle that he who seeks equity must do equity is peculiarly applicable here.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[169,1562,1147,817]],["BL_506.1",506,[253,356,1158,1250]]]'>As to appeal No. 101: The decree of the lower court rests solely upon what the patrons did before they got to the restaurant and also what they did after they left it. The court beloAV found that the presence of the restaurant, under the circumstances in which it operated, constituted an offensive nuisance. I cannot ignore, however, the fact that it never had a chance to be otherwise. The boycotting and picketing commenced before the occurrence of any misconduct which is said to constitute the nuisance and may Avell have been the cause for such misconduct. While it is clear that a restaurant proprietor may be under a duty not to sell liquor to persons and send them forth into the streets so that they will commit trespasses, nevertheless, he cannot be held to the high degree of policing the streets. <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>
      <em>That </em>is obviously the function <em>oí </em>the police department and as to persons who commit such trespasses before they enter his premises we held in <em>Molony v. Pounds, </em><a href="/pa/361/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="361 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="476373" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0498-01">361 Pa. 498</a>, 504, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.2d%20802" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="64 A.2d 802">64 A. 2d 802</a>, that there is no duty on a tradesman to control the conduct of persons who have not yet entered his establishment. The sale of liquor is not now an outlaw business in Pennsylvania and while the proprietor exercising the privilege of a restaurant liquor license is under a higher decree of care in the conduct of his business than an ordinary merchant, I do not see how equity can step in and exercise what are essentially the duties and prerogatives of the Liquor Control Board. Equitable power is statutory and so is that of the Liquor Control Board. Although the court below describes the persons who entered the restaurant as patrons, there is no evidence that any of the persons guilty of misconduct before entering the restaurant or after leaving it purchased liquor on the premises or that any of this offensive conduct came about from an undue consumption of liquor upon the premises. If such is the case this can, of course, be remedied by recourse to the Liquor Control Board.</p>

Such persons are specified in the Liquor Code of 1951, P. L. 90, §493.</p>

In the present case, all that Brodsky did was to open a restaurant which caused nobody any harm. All the harm was brought about by intervening forces, i.e., the activities of some of the persons who visited this business. Most of the offensive conduct was criminal misconduct on their part, and ordinarily intentionally tortious or criminal acts do operate as superseding causes: Restatement, Torts, §448.</p>

The operation of the restaurant was not in itself negligent, reckless or an ultra-hazardous act, nor do I believe the proprietor intentionally and unreasonably caused the harm to the neighborhood of which it complains. Surely there is no proof that Brodsky intentionally and unreasonably caused wrong-way driving on 19th Street, repeated urination in an alley, and sexual misconduct on a porch a half-block away. Intentional harm occurs only where one acts with the purpose of bringing about the result which follows or where one does an act knowing that certain harm will result from his conduct.</p>
