Ayers, underwent, in the Wilkes-Barre General Hospital, an operation for a marginal jejunal ulcer. He was discharged from the hospital on May 4, 1948, but the operation did not afford him the relief he had anticipated. On the contrary, he experienced pains in his abdomen which continued for several years. On January 3,1957, he returned to the hospital for a series of tests, hoping that science might discover the cause for his unceasing discomfort. It did. At the spot which seemed to him to be the fountainhead of his suffering and misery, there was discovered a foreign substance, that is, a sponge. It had been left there by the surgeon, Dr. Philip J. Morgan, who had performed the operation nine years before.</p>

This he did not learn until January 3, 1957. Was the running of the statute, in view of the circumstances related, tolled until that date? The pertinent feature of the statute reads: “Every suit hereafter brought to recover damages for injury wrongfully done to the person, in case where the injury does not result in death, must be brought within two years from the time when the injury was done and not after-wards. .</p>

In its application to a given set of circumstances, it must not be made to produce something which the Legislature, as a reasonably-minded body, could never have intended. The Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, Article IY, §52, 46 P.S. §552, states that in ascertaining the intention of the Legislature the courts may be guided by the presumption that “The legisla<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>ture does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable.”</p>

That precise situation arose in the case of <em>Byers v. </em>Bacon, <a href="/pa/250/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="250 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="1016929" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0564-01">250 Pa. 564</a>, 566, where the lower court gave binding instructions in favor of the defendant. We reversed, Justice Potter saying for the Court: “The negligence charged was not in the insertion of the tube, but it was in the failure to remove it at the proper time, or in the failure to give notice of its presence, that it might be removed by another, when it had served its proper purpose. It could hardly have been intended to remain permanently in the body of plaintiff, and he should have been allowed to show when and by whom the tube, which was inserted by defendant, should have been removed.”</p>

Surgeons employ all manner of implements in performing their magic of restoring health and well-being to ailing humanity. Able, solicitous and ever-caring as Nature is in rebuilding broken bones, restoring wrecked tissue, and rehabilitating flaccid muscles, the expert hand of the surgeon guides the restorative procedure and, in doing so, he often must use such things as nails, screws, sponges, metallic clips and rubber tubes. If he overlooks removing the nails, unscrewing the screws, taking out the clips, withdrawing the sponges and extracting the tubes, his negligence dates from the time the extrañe<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>ous item was to have been removed and continues throughout the period he fails to perform his obvious duty.

If defendant was at fault in permitting the tube to remain in the wound when it should have been removed, or in failing to give notice of its presence, the time when such dereliction of duty occurred should have been shown, as that would constitute the real injury, and would start the running of the statute of limitations. It may have been coincident with the date of plaintiff’s discharge from the hospital, but not necessarily so. Then too, it should have been a question for careful consideration, as to whether the statute should properly have been regarded as running against plaintiff, until such time as he could reasonably be charged with knowledge of the fact that the tube had been overlooked and left in the wound.”</p>

Foley was killed on October 20, 1944 as the result of a gas tank explosion which had been erected by the defendant company in September, 1943. Foley’s widow filed an action against the defendant company within one year following the date of her husband’s death. The defendant contended that the lawsuit was tardily begun because the statute of limitations became authoritative, not on the date of Foley’s death, but on the date that the defendant completed the operation of erecting the tank, which, as <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>stated, was in September, 1943. Our Court rejected this contention and said: "It would seem elementary, however, that a cause of action cannot accrue until an injury is actually inflicted upon the person bringing the suit, and certainly until October 20, 1944 no action of any kind could have been brought by the present plaintiff; it is inconceivable that she should be barred by lapse of time before the time when she could have instituted a suit.”</p>

The injury became a reality when the sponge began to break down healthful tissue within the body of the plaintiff.

There, the defendant was charged with subterraneously extracting coal from the plaintiff’s land by means and methods which cloaked his pilfering from the plaintiff’s eyes. The plaintiff did not learn that the defendant was robbing Mm of his underground treasure until seven years after the criminal deed was done. In 1892 he brought an action in trespass against the defendant but he was met by the defense that since the coal had been taken in 1884 the statute of limitations barred recov<a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>ery. The trial court agreed and entered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed. Justice Williams, speaking for this Court, said that the mischief which the statute of limitations (the one there involved allowed the injured person six years in which to proceed) “was intended to remedy was delay in the assertion of a legal right which it was practicable to assert. The remedy provided was a denial of process to one who had slumbered for six years during which process was within his reach.”</p>
    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[245,912,1158,927]]]'>But Lewey had not slumbered on his rights. He could not know that his neighbor was undermining him. Justice Williams pointed out that the owner of coal lands cannot be present in the interior of the earth: “No amount of vigilance will enable him to detect the approach of a trespasser who may be working his way through the coal seams underlying adjoining lands. His senses cannot inform him of the encroachment by such trespasser upon the coal that is hidden in the rocks under his feet. He cannot reasonably be held to be constructively present where his presence is in the nature of things impossible. He must learn of such a trespass by other means than such as are within his own control, and until these come within his reach he is necessarily ignorant of his loss. He cannot reasonably be required to act until knowledge that action is needed is possible to him.”</p>

A result so absurd and so unjust ought not to be possible.” He ended his learned Opinion with the statement: “We are disposed to hold therefore that the statute runs against an injury committed in or to a lower stratum from the time of actual discovery, or <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>the time when discovery was reasonably possible . . .

From the time the surgeon opens with his knife the body of his patient until he closes in a proper way the wound thus made, the lav/ imposes upon him the duty of exercising not only due care, but due skill as well.

Even if this is true, still the result reached by the Court is right. It must be conceded that even at the time the injury was inflicted upon Ayers it as well as its cause was not only unknown to him but was unknowable.</p>

They are desirable in that they prevent oppression by forbidding plaintiffs to litigate stale claims and thus compel defense at a time when such defense is no longer practicable and sometimes even impossible. Nevertheless, the restrictions imposed may not be so arbitrary as to preclude a reasonable opportunity for one who has been harmed to make his claim. If the legislature were permitted <em>absolute </em>discretion it would not be merely regulating the remedy but would be abolishing it. Cf. <em>Rodebaugh v. Philadelphia Traction Company, </em><a href="/pa/190/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="190 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="905108" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0358-01">190 Pa. 358</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.%20953" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="42 A. 953">42 A. 953</a>.
