Appellee sells motor vehicles to persons who desire to purchase motor vehicles on an installment plan basis and the financing thereof is arranged for by appellee through the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (herein called finance company). The buyer enters into a conditional sales contract with appellee, the relevant terms of which are: (1) “for the purpose of securing payment of the obligation . . ., the seller reserves title, and shall have a security interest, in said property until said amount is fully paid in cash”; (2) if the “seller” — i.e., motor vehicle dealer — transfers his right in the contract, “seller” then refers to the “subsequent holder” or transferee; (3) the buyer has the option of securing his own insurance on the motor vehicle or of securing such insurance through <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>appellee;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> (4) if appellee obtains insurance for tbe buyer tbe cost of such insurance is paid by the buyer and included in the finance charges. Upon the execution of this contract appellee then assigns its rights thereunder to the finance company which pays the appellee an amount equal to the difference between the cash selling price of the motor vehicle and the buyer’s down payment; the buyer pays the amount of this difference plus the finance charges, in installments, to the finance company. If the buyer indicates that he desires that appellee arrange for the required insurance, the latter acting as agent for Motors Insurance Corporation (herein called insurance company), applies for a policy of insurance which is issued at standard rates and names the buyer and the finance company as the insureds. The finance company pays the amount of the premium to the insurance company and includes the amount thereof in the charges to be paid by the buyer. Appellee is neither named as an insured in the policy nor does it pay any part of the premium. As agent for the insurance company appellee receives and retains the usual commission paid to insurance agents on policies of physical damage insurance issued by the insurance company.</p>

It is obvious that the object of this legislation is to outlaw “unfair treatment of prospective insurants of the same class by offering inducements to one person that are not available to all persons of the same class”: <em>Dare’s Case, </em>13 Dauphin Co., 30, 32.</p>

The court below well stated that “as is universally stated and recognized, a reduction of cost is the test of whether or not the statute is being violated . . . .”. That appellee, as agents for the insurance company, places this insurance is conceded, but the mere placement of such insurance constitutes no violation of the law: the appellee is licensed to sell insurance and the propriety of the seller of a motor vehicle on an installment plan applying for such insurance is expressly recognized under the Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act, supra. That the appellee is unnamed in the insurance policy is likewise conceded, the buyer and the finance company, as their interests appear, being the named insureds. Even though it be conceded, <em>arguendo, </em>that, by reason of the appellee’s guaranty to the finance company to pay the amount of the obligation in the event the buyer defaults, the appellee retains an insurable interest in the motor vehicle, the fact remains that the insurance is written not on this interest but on the interests of the buyer and the finance company therein. The appellee’s brief well covers this situation: “The dealer-agent is neither an insured person or party under the policy issued in conjunction with such conditional sale contract, nor does the dealer have any rights of an insured person or party. Since appellee is not a party to the insurance contract and is not referred to therein in any manner whatsoever, appellee could not recover on the policy: Spires v.

The appellee paid for no insurance, received no insurance nor did it because of any guaranty imposed on it under the terms of the assignment of the conditional sales contract retain any such interest as would enable it to recover upon the policy of insurance issued to the buyer and the finance company. In the absence of any proof in the instant situation that appellee received insurance protection at a cost less than other insurants were able to receive insurance protection there is a violation neither of the letter nor spirit of the anti-rebate law.</p>

After an exhaustive study by the Joint State Government Commission of the sale of motor vehicles within the Commonwealth on an installment basis, the legislature passed the Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act, supra. It is highly significant that, although that statute extensively considered the sale of insurance in connection with the financing of the purchase of motor vehicles, the statute contains no provision which prohibits the installment seller of motor vehicles from acting as a licensed automobile insurance agent or from selling insurance under the present circumstances. Of further significance, at the same session of the legislature, the legislature failed to pass House Bill 980 which proposed to amend the Act of 1921, supra, by providing that it was unlawful for an insurance agent to solicit, negotiate or effect contracts of insurance for the coverage of personal property sold by himself, his employer, employees or members of Ms immediate family.
