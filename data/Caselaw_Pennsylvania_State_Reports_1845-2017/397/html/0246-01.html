At the time of filing this application, in addition to holding other transportation rights not presently material, Young was authorized (1) to transport iron and steel articles by motor vehicles for the Bethlehem Contracting Company in the City of Bethlehem to points in Pennsylvania within fifty miles and (2) to transport, in emergencies, as a Class D carrier iron and steel articles by motor vehicles from the Bethlehem Steel Company in the City of Bethlehem to points in Pennsylvania Avithin one hundred miles.

An appeal was taken to the Superior Court; on motion of the Commission, the record was remanded in order that specific findings might be made by the Commission and a so-called “long form” order entered. On September 3, 1957 the Commission entered a “long form” order which authorized Young: “To transport, as a Class D carrier, fabricated or structural iron and steel articles, on pole, flat-bed or low side trailers, from the City of Bethlehem, situated in Northampton and Lehigh Counties, to points in Pennsylvania, within 100 miles of Bethlehem, excluding the transportation of manufactured iron and steel articles for Bethlehem Steel Company to the City of Johnstown, the Boroughs of Franklin and Conemaugh and the Township of West Taylor, Cambria County.” The present controversy questions the propriety of this order.</p>

There can be no doubt — in fact, appellee admitted it for the most part — that such service was rendered in violation of Young’s certificated rights. The record further discloses that, for the most part, these shippers had not investigated the facilities of other carriers because <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>tlieir shipping requirements were fulfilled, apparently at lower rates, by the illegal service rendered by Young.

When it was called to Young’s attention that, even if such an explanation be accepted, the certificate restricted Ms right to transport such articles <em>only </em>“in emergencies (to apply only in cases of breakdown delivery to a job site off the highway or because of lack of service by another certificated carrier),” Young’s president stated: “I think there is emergency on steel now, even though the war is over ten years, there is still a state of emergency, isn’t there?”.</p>

The record clearly and unmistakably demonstrates that Young operated its transportation service either with a definite knowledge of its lack of authority or with a complete indifference to the extent of its authority — in either event an attitude of deliberate defiance of the law. Even though Young knew that it was operating in violation of its certificated rights at the time of filing the present application, its application certified under oath that it was “not now engaged in any intrastate transportation of property for compensation in Pennsylvania (except as authorized by the certificates of public convenience or permits [which it then held]) Young admitted through its president at the <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>time of the hearings that it was still operating illegally in spite of at least two convictions for such violations within a year of the time of filing the present application.

Under such circumstances, the Commission’s issuance of the certificate cannot be based on the reception of evidence of Young’s illegal and unlawful operation, even if it be assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that such evidence was sufficient to support the authorization. Excluding such testimony as it must be excluded under the circumstances, the record fails to disclose the substantial evidence required to sustain the action of the Commission, and the Commission’s order which granted Young the additional rights and the judgment of the Superior Court affirming such order must be reversed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
