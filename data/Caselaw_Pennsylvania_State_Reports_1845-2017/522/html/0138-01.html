The warrant authorized a search of one James Heidelberg,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the premises, and “all occupants therein.” When John Heidel<a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>berg answered the door, police saw three persons seated around a coffee table on which were a propane tank, commonly used for freebasing cocaine, a razor blade, a marijuana pipe, and a patina of white powder. A search of all persons present revealed a small quantity of hashish on the person of appellant John Heidelberg and a small quantity of cocaine on the person of appellant Douglas Gilliam. Both Heidelberg and Gilliam were charged with possession of a controlled substance. Following a nonjury trial before the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, Criminal Division, Heidelberg was sentenced to a fine, costs and seven to thirty days imprisonment; Gilliam was sentenced to a fine, costs and sixty days to one year imprisonment. Timely post trial motions were filed and denied, and Superior Court affirmed the convictions on direct appeal. We granted allocatur to address a question of first impression: whether a search warrant authorizing the search of all persons at a particular location is constitutionally permissible, under either the Constitution of the United States or the Pennsylvania Constitution, when those persons are unnamed or unidentified in the warrant. The cases are consolidated because they arise out of the same facts and raise the same legal issue.</p>

The first is to invalidate all such warrants on the grounds that they do not meet the specificity requirement of either the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or the parallel requirement of Article 1, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The alternate approach is to analyze each <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>warrant individually to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that any persons present are probably involved in a criminal event. This position is perhaps best articulated by Chief Justice Weintraub, of the New Jersey Supreme Court, in <em>State v. DeSimone:</em>

A showing that lottery slips are sold in a department store or an industrial plant obviously would not justify a warrant to search every person on the premises, for there would be no probable cause to believe that everyone there was participating in the illegal operation. On the other hand, a showing that a dice game is operated in a manhole or in a barn should suffice, for the reason that the place is so limited and the illegal operation so overt that it is likely that everyone present is a party to the offense. Such a setting furnishes not only probable cause but also a designation of the persons to be searched which functionally is as precise as a dimensional portrait of them.</blockquote>

In such a setting, the officer executing the warrant has neither the authority nor the opportunity to search everywhere for anyone violating a law. So long as there is good reason to suspect or believe that anyone present at the anticipated scene will probably be a participant, presence becomes the descriptive fact satisfying the aim of the Fourth Amendment. The evil of the general warrant <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>is thereby negated.

Superior Court adopted the position set out by Chief Justice Weintraub in <em>DeSimone, </em>and because of the fear that an “all persons warrant” might be a general warrant, strictly scrutinized the warrant in this case. That scrutiny led Superior Court to conclude that the warrant was valid for the following reasons: (1) the affidavit supporting the warrant alleged that a “significant amount of cocaine” was seen in the residence within twenty-four hours of issuance of the warrant; <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (2) three informants witnessed drug sales at the residence; (3) the place to be searched was a private residence, not a public place in which innocent business invitees might likely be present; and (4) the subject of the search was contraband which could easily be hidden on the body, which might allow persons who were present to frustrate the warrant by hiding the contraband on their persons before police were admitted into the dwelling.</p>

Still, such warrants must be viewed with disfavor, as they harbor a danger of containing the vice of a general warrant.

    <p id="b271-6" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[193,1031,1148,741]]]'>We agree with Superior Court that although “all persons present” warrants are not favored, it would advance no legitimate constitutional interest to forbid all such warrants. The better approach is to examine each case to see whether, <em>under strict scrutiny, </em>the affidavit in support of the warrant makes out a sufficient nexus between the physical location to be searched and the likelihood that every person present at that location is involved in the criminal activity at issue. The inquiry, in other words, should be whether viewing the affidavit <em>with all ambiguities resolved against the Commonwealth, </em>it is more probably true than not that every person found at the place to be searched will be involved in the criminal activity which is the subject of the search.</p>
    <p id="b271-7" data-blocks='[["BL_271.6",271,[193,1790,1147,581]],["BL_272.1",272,[264,318,1148,674]]]'>We now turn to the application of that rule to the facts of this case. It is clear from the affidavit that there was probable cause to believe that Heidelberg was selling drugs, that his house was the location of at least some drug sales, and that drugs were stored there. What is unclear is whether there was probable cause to believe that <em>everyone </em>found at the Heidelberg house was involved in illicit drug activity. The Commonwealth argues that the “large amount” of cocaine recently seen at the house, the pattern of drug sales recently witnessed, and the time of the of the warrant (12:45 a.m.), lead reasonably to the conclusion that <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>a person present at the house probably would be involved in drug activity. Heidelberg and Gilliam, on the other hand, argue that no specific amount of cocaine is indicated in the affidavit, other than an allegedly “large quantity”; that the home, which traditionally has been specially protected under the Fourth Amendment, was not sufficiently described in the affidavit as to size so that a magistrate could determine whether it was likely that a “large quantity” of drugs might be concealed from an innocent visitor;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and finally, that even if sales were made at the house and even though the contraband in this case is easily concealed, these considerations have nothing to do with whether those present were probably involved in illegal activity.</p>
    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[259,1009,1151,1048]],["BL_273.1",273,[207,318,1148,795]]]'>Resolving all ambiguities in the affidavit against the Commonwealth, as we should in an “all persons warrant,” we begin with the observation that “a large quantity of cocaine” is not specific. What is a large quantity to one informant may be a small quantity to another. Without at least a measure of specificity as to how much cocaine is involved, therefore, the alleged large quantity of cocaine does not establish an adequate nexus between the place to be searched and every person present therein. As to the presence of drugs on the premises and recent drug dealing within the premises, since there is no indication that the premises are such that drugs could not be stored or transactions could not be conducted without the knowledge of all those present, these factors also fail to establish a nexus between the premises to be searched and every person present. Concerning the nighttime search, we agree with the Commonwealth that casual visitors are less likely to be present in a person’s home in the small hours of the morning, but without more, we do not feel that it is sufficiently <em>probable, </em>or even more than possible, that those <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>present at this time were affiliated with illicit drug activity. All we have in this case is a residence where some drug sales have been made, presumably by the owner or lessee, and where some unquantified amount of drugs is probably stored in an unknown manner. It does not follow from this that any person present at the residence, even after midnight, is <em>probably </em>involved in illegal activity. It was certainly reasonable to search the premises, but it was not reasonable to search unnamed persons who might be found on the premises merely because drugs had been recently sold and stored there. It is not enough that persons present <em>might </em>be involved. In order for an “all persons warrant” to be valid under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, it must be shown that all persons present were <em>probably </em>involved in the illegal activity.</p>
    <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[208,1131,1147,625]]]'>The Commonwealth argues, nonetheless, that the search should be upheld because it was conducted in good faith. The United States Supreme Court, the Commonwealth points out, has ruled that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained by police who acted in reasonable reliance upon a search warrant issued by a neutral magistrate, even where the warrant was ultimately found to be unsupported by probable cause.
