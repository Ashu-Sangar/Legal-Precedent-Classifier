Polk, appellant (deceased) was a working man, husband of Benilda Polk, appellant, and the father of a four year old son, Leonard W. Polk Jr. On February 6, 1981, Polk the manager of Sambo’s Restaurant Inc. (appellee) was fatally shot at his place of employment, <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>by Melvin Dill a manager trainee. The history of Dill’s employment with Sambo’s was, at best, tempestuous. Dill’s erratic behavior culminated in an assault on two co-employees for which he was fired by Polk. Dissatisfied with his termination, Dill contacted Sambo’s home office, which reinstated Dill with a two-week suspension.</p>
    <p id="b478-4" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[291,640,1147,348]]]'>On February 5, 1981, Dill failed to report to work and was fired for the second time by Polk. On February 6, 1981, at approximately 8:45 p.m., Dill, who was admittedly suffering from hallucinations, arrived at Sambo’s with a shotgun. He approached Polk and shouted, “why did you do this to me, why did you rape me in that motel room” and then shot and killed him.</p>

At the time of his arrest Dill was mentally incompetent to stand criminal trial and was incarcerated at Fairview Institute for the criminally insane. At the time of the first workmen’s compensation hearing, Dill was not permitted to testify because of his pending criminal trial. After pleading guilty to third degree homicide, and being sentenced to five to twenty years imprisonment, Dill on April 12, 1982, testified at a second workmen’s compensation hearing on Mrs. Polk’s fatal claim petition. He stated that his reason for killing Polk was “personal” and not work related. He alleged that he had two homosexual encounters with Mr. Polk and that the second took place on January 20, 1981 at the Treadway Inn in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, when Mr. Polk allegedly raped him.</p>

Where a presumption in favor of a party exists, it does not merely vanish because the party against whom it operates offers <em>some evidence </em>to rebut the presumption.

Indeed, the evidence upon which the employer relied to show that the killing was personally motivated would not even meet the standard of a preponderance of the evidence. This evidence, consisting primarily of the testimony of Dill, was replete with conflicting and vague answers. The affidavit of a housekeeping employee who cleaned Dill’s room at the inn where the rape allegedly took place, contradicted Dill’s version of the events. The only <em>attempted tenuous </em>link to support the fact that a rape or homosexual tryst took place was a statement in the housekeeper’s affidavit that Polk had been a resident of the Inn near the time that Dill checked into room 307 on January 19, 1981.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

The referee fails to even mention these events in his findings of fact and conclusions of law. Thus, based upon <em>all of the evidence </em>presented, only by guessing could the fact finder conclude that the killing was personally motivated because Polk had an inharmonious homosexual relationship with Dill. As we have recently stated in <em>Lewis v. Civil Service Commission, </em><a href="/pa/518/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="518 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1811604" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0170-01">518 Pa. 170</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="518 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1811604" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0170-01">542 A.2d 519</a> (1988), when competing inferences can be drawn from the same set of circumstances a trier of fact “must not be permitted to guess which inference it will adopt”.</p>

Substantial evidence has been defined as “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion”. <em>Clites v. Township of Upper Yoder, </em><a href="/pa/506/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="506 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1790954" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0349-01">506 Pa. 349</a>, 354, <a href="/pa/506/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="506 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1790954" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0349-01">485 A.2d 724</a>, 726 (1984). “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established.” <em>Pennsylvania State Board of Medical Education and Licensure v. Schireson, </em><a href="/pa/360/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="360 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="475065" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0129-01">360 Pa. 129</a>, 133, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20343" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="61 A.2d 343">61 A.2d 343</a>, 346 (1948). There was not substantial evidence to support the referee’s finding that the killing was “personally motivated” in this case.
