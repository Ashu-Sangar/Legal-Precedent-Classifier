The logical implication of the prosecutor’s remark was that fine parents are capable of producing murderous off-spring, which is not, we are sad to say, a novel proposition. We are satisfied that in the context of this case the statement was an allusion and not a direct comparison. We further decline to adopt the view that a prosecutor’s argument during the penalty stage should be a sterile affair. Many cases are sordid, mordant tales and their very description are librettos for threnodies of death and loss. To tell their story is to inevitably touch human emotions, because they are about human things: sad, terrible, alien human things. They cannot be left undescribed because they are terrible or alien to ordinary human standards of conduct. They are the issue in question and unless one transcends the evidential terms or deliberately calculates to do what the evidence does not support, they must be told and whatever human emotions they may awake are inescapable in the context of the truth of the occasion. <em>See Commonwealth v.

As such he argues this is a denial of equal protection of the law. Appellant takes this argument one step further by hypothesizing that the above constitutional infirmity could have been rectified in the instant action had two separate juries been empaneled, one for the guilt stage and the other for the penalty stage of the proceeding.</p>

Indeed, if one were to plead guilty to murder “generally”, there would be a trial, either by a judge or jury, to establish the degree of guilt, e.g., first degree murder or third degree murder. Secondly, we disagree with petitioner’s contention that one is denied equal protection by requesting a jury, which would be “death qualified,” as opposed to requesting a trial by a judge, who would not be explicitly “death qualified”.</p>

First, there is a requirement that the conviction sought to be introduced must involve dishonesty or false statement, crimen falsi. Second, the conviction date, or the last date of confinement, must be less than ten years from the date of trial. If these requirements are met, the offense is per se admissible. If not, the trial judge must then apply a balancing test and determine whether the value of the evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. <em>Randall, </em><a href="/pa/515/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="515 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="1806048" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0410-01">528 A.2d at 1329</a>.</p>

Unless all crimes are now deemed crimen falsi, or the term is limited to the traditional notions of crimen falsi, i.e. perjury, false swearing and embezzlement, the record of a conviction does not itself provide the underlying factual premise to establish the crimen falsi nature of an offense. In the case before us, however, the Commonwealth failed to present <em>any </em>evidence of the dishonest nature of the offense, and thus, even assuming, arguendo, that the <em>Randall </em>rationale were valid, its requirements were not met.

As I indicated to the Court I think it’s a fair statement to make at this time, a fair assumption <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>on anybody’s part that that is not going to change unless there’s a major miracle and I don’t expect that.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[312,424,1111,685]]]'>THE COURT: All right. I am satisfied on the basis of the record presented to me that the 1975 conviction of this defendant for burglary and larceny of an automobile presents Bighum offenses; and, I am also satisfied that the Commonwealth — or satisfied that the burden, that the probative value of the evidence of those convictions as it bears on the credibility of the defendant as a witness outweighs the prejudicial effect it could have upon the jury and I think that the need for the evidence in this case overcomes any inherent potential it might have to prejudice and, accordingly, the motion to preclude the Commonwealth from using those offenses for impeachment purposes should the defendant testify is denied.</blockquote>

    <p id="b602-7" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[270,1189,1149,409]]]'>No discussion was had to the fifth, extremely important factor, the existence of alternative means of attacking the defendant’s credibility is present. As to the discussion of the fourth factor, the trial court determined that there was a <em>possibility </em>that the case would consist of the conflicting testimony of Appellant and Alexander. As such, the Court weighed what it perceived to be a standoff in favor of the Commonwealth.</p>

The court failed to even recognize the fact that the conviction sought to be introduced was almost <em>nine years old, </em>a factor, I concede, the <em>Randall </em>majority would now also discredit. Nor did it take into account whether other means were available for attacking Appellant’s credibility, an important factor since he was the only one to testify on his own behalf during the trial. Where a defendant’s own testimony is the only means by which he can present his version of the truth before the jury, we have stressed that "... it is more important to the search for truth in a particular case for the jury to hear the defendant’s story than to know of a prior <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>conviction.” <em>Roots, </em><a href="/pa/482/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="482 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1749698" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0033-01">482 Pa. at 41</a>, <a href="/pa/482/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="482 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1749698" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0033-01">393 A.2d at 368</a>, quoting <em>Com. v.

Under the law applicable at the time of trial, the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of showing that the need for that evidence outweighed its inherently prejudicial nature and further because the trial court failed to adequately evaluate and balance the factors set forth in <em>Roots </em>in allowing the evidence to be admitted.</p>
