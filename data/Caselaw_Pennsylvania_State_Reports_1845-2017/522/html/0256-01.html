At approximately 7:00 p.m., on August 9, 1985, St. Clair Holman returned to his room in the victim’s apartment at 5945 Lansdowne Avenue in the City of Philadelphia. Mr. Holman rented this room from the victim and shared these premises with her and her boyfriend, Irving Furlow. Upon arriving, he noticed that the premises had been ransacked and began a search of each room. In his own bedroom he found that his bed had been moved some two feet from its usual resting place and that his television and a can of change totalling about $29.00 were missing.</p>
    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[249,939,1146,583]]]'>When Mr. Holman entered the victim’s bedroom he found that this room had also been ransacked and came upon the victim’s body hanging facedown on a broken box spring. Her lower torso was left dangling down to the floor and was supported by her lifeless knees. The mattresses had been removed from the bed and were placed upright against a wall and paper and clothing were strewn about the room. Mr. Holman testified that the victim’s eyes and face were swollen and her nose and right temple were bleeding. There was a bite mark on her cheek and there were bruises on her arms and thighs.</p>
    <p id="b392-6" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[246,1555,1147,579]]]'>The victim was found with her upper body clothing pulled up over her shoulders and the body was nude from the waist down. There was blood oozing from the victim’s vagina and rectum. Upon discovering the victim in this grizzly state, Mr. Holman called the police. Officer McGrath arrived at the scene by 7:25 p.m. and when he determined that the victim had no pulse, he summoned a rescue squad. Since Mr. Holman indicated to Officer McGrath that the apartment was ransacked and his television and $29.00 had been taken, Officer McGrath also made a report of a burglary over the police radio.</p>

During that interview, the officer testified that Appellant was with the victim. <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>Mr. Holman was able to corroborate that Appellant was with the victim at 5:45 p.m.</p>
    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[209,437,1148,362]]]'>Appellant’s friend, Barney Porter, was able to confirm that he saw Appellant with the victim outside of a bar located across the street from the victim’s apartment during the late afternoon hours on the day of the murder. Porter also testified that he saw Appellant at around 8:00 p.m. on the same evening on his porch counting out what turned out to be $29.00 in change.</p>
    <p id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[210,818,1147,571]]]'>The missing television was found in Appellant’s home shortly after the murder. There was also evidence of sperm found in the victim that was consistent with it having been deposited between 5:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on the day of the murder and evidence that the sperm was deposited by a non-secretor, one who does not secrete traces of his blood in his body fluid emissions. Appellant’s blood was analyzed and was typed to be non-secreting. Blood found on his boxer shorts proved to be human blood. An impression of Appellant’s teeth was cast, which fit exactly with the bite mark left on the victim’s cheek.</p>
    <p id="b393-6" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[209,1415,1147,631]]]'>Finally, the autopsy conducted on the victim’s body revealed, in addition to the injuries already mentioned, three fractured ribs, a massive twenty-three inch tear to the victim’s body, reaching from the vagina and diaphragm up into the chest cavity, and that a shirt had been shoved into the victim’s rectum, through the intestinal wall and into her abdominal cavity. Both of these injuries were caused by the insertion of a blunt instrument into the victim. A blood encrusted crutch was found near the body which no doubt was used to inflict these injuries on victim. Tragically, the medical evidence also indicated that the victim was alive while all these injuries were committed.</p>
    <p id="b393-7" data-blocks='[["BL_393.7",393,[209,2065,1147,308]]]'>Taking all of these circumstances together, a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Linda Johnson’s death was a homicide.

Finally, the jury could determine that Appellant committed the crime since the evidence placed him at the scene of the crime at the time of death, blood was found on his boxer shorts, his bite mark was found on the victim’s cheek, and sperm of a non-secretor, like Appellant, was found in the victim. Accordingly, we are satisfied that sufficient evidence exists in this record to support the jury’s verdict of murder of the first degree.</p>

In anticipation of our policy in reaching waived issues in death penalty cases, the Commonwealth argues that the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support Appellant’s convictions for burglary, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and rape. The Commonwealth also argues that evidence of these crimes was properly presented to the jury during the penalty phase to support the aggravating circumstance that <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>the killing was committed during the commission of a felony.</p>

Nelson, </em><a href="/pa/514/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="514 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1804591" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0262-01">514 Pa. 262</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="514 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1804591" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0262-01">523 A.2d 728</a> (1987).</p>
    <p id="b405-7" data-blocks='[["BL_405.6",405,[221,1541,1146,366]]]'>Here, the trial court defined torture to the jury as “the intentional infliction of a considerable amount of pain and suffering on a victim which is unnecessarily heinous, atrocious or cruel manifesting exceptional depravity”. We see nothing improper with this definition and, in fact, it comports with the definition we approved in <em>Nelson. </em>Appellant’s contrary argument is meritless.</p>
    <p id="b405-8" data-blocks='[["BL_405.7",405,[219,1927,1148,312]]]'>Appellant also argues that the evidence submitted to the jury on torture was insufficient to show that the victim was conscious during the murder and, therefore, the Commonwealth could not show that the victim suffered considerable pain or that Appellant intended to torture his victim. We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b405-9" data-blocks='[["BL_405.8",405,[221,2266,1144,89]],["BL_406.1",406,[234,302,1148,997]]]'>We have held that a jury may determine from the acts themselves whether a defendant intends to use <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>means of torture while killing and that medical evidence can be used to establish whether the victim was alive while being tortured. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Billa, </em><a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">521 Pa. 168</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">555 A.2d 835</a> (1989). How long a victim can withstand the cruel, depraved attacks of her murderer before unconsciousness overtakes the mind is not part of the Commonwealth’s burden nor is such a consideration part of the aggravating circumstance under discussion. The means used by the actor are reviewed to determine whether <em>he </em>intended to use them in such a way as to cause considerable pain and suffering before death. To respond that the victim suffered no such pain or suffering because she was unconscious is only to admit that the pain and suffering was so great that the victim’s mind could no longer stand to be subjected to such atrocities committed on her person and the mind, in showing mercy to the body, turns itself off so that some relief can be had, while the tormentor, undaunted by his victim’s state, continues to inflict blow after blow until his final aim is accomplished.</p>
    <p id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.4",406,[231,1322,1147,677]]]'>We reject the suggestion that the Commonwealth be required to prove how long a victim can withstand an attack or how long the victim was conscious as a measure of how much pain and suffering was experienced. We think the assaults committed upon the victim speak for themselves and we accordingly find that the evidence was more than sufficient to establish that the manner of death was more than mere overcoming of the victim’s resistance. As we recently stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Steele, </em><a href="/pa/522/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="522 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="1818959" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0061-01">522 Pa. 61</a>, <a href="/pa/522/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="522 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="1818959" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0061-01">559 A.2d 904</a> (1989), a jury has the right to “believe that the known infliction of aimed organ smashing blows was deliberate practice in the art of killing, observing with satisfaction both the pain and disability inflicted”.</p>
    <p id="b406-6" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[230,2017,1144,149]]]'>As in <em>Steele, </em>we are satisfied that the jury was justified in finding that the victim was tortured by a deliberate, selected ingredient added to a felonious killing.</p>

The record plainly belies this allegation. Not only did the prosecutor and trial counsel advise Appellant of this right, but the trial court conducted an on-the-record colloquy and specifically asked Appellant if he wished to present any evidence of mitigation. After consultation with trial counsel, the Appellant specifically declined the invitation to proceed with such evidence. In spite of this, the trial court charged the jury that it could consider as mitigating circumstances all of the statutory circumstances (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)) and that, in addition to these circumstances, the jury could consider any other mitigating circumstance it chose to. We see no error and reject Appellant’s contrary allegation.</p>
