Appellee brought suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County against Appellant, Mobil Oil Corporation (“Mobil”) along with one of its employees (who is no longer involved in this appeal). That court granted summary judgment and partial summary judgment against Appellee on Counts I and II of his complaint; and dismissed Count III for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Count III was based on the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (“PMPA”), <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202801-2806" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="15 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2806">15 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2806</a>, and the trial court thought that suit under this Act could be brought only in federal court. The Superior Court, in an opinion by President Judge Cirillo, reversed the summary judgments on Counts I and II, and also reversed the dismissal of Count III for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

By an expressed notice of non-renewal, the franchise agreement was not renewed by Mobil and thereby was terminated at the end of the one year. In not renewing the trial franchise agreement, Mobil asserts that it fully complied with all the requirements of the PMPA applicable to trial franchises. Following this non-renewal, Appellee filed the aforementioned three-count Complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County. Appellee alleged in Count I that Mobil was liable under Pennsylvania law for breach of contract in not renewing the trial franchise agreement. In Count II, he alleged that Mobil was liable under Pennsylvania law for fraud. In Count III, he alleged that Mobil violated the PMPA by failing to renew the trial franchise agreement. <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202802" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2802">15 U.S.C. § 2802</a> provides that no franchisor may terminate any franchise prior to the conclusion of the term or fail to renew any franchise relationship except upon grounds expressly set forth in the statute. The trial court granted summary <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>judgment in Mobil’s favor on Appellee’s state law claims (Counts I and II), finding them to be preempted by the PMPA; and dismissed Count III for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that Congress vested exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts over claims brought under the PMPA. The Superior Court reversed holding that Appellee’s state law claims were not preempted by the PMPA. The Superior Court further held that a state court has concurrent jurisdiction over claims brought directly under the PMPA, like Count III, <a href="/pa-super/364/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="364 Pa.

The express purpose of the PMPA is to create a “uniform set of rules governing the grounds for termination and non-renewal of motor fuel marketing franchises and the notice which franchisors must provide franchisees prior to termination or non-renewal of a franchise relationship.” S.Rep. No. 95-731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 873, 877. The PMPA is a complex statute that provides detailed national standards and procedures for the termination or non-renewal of all franchises for the distribution and sale of gasoline and other petroleum products. There is no adoption of, or referral to, state law principles or doctrines. Concurrent jurisdiction in the state courts would serve only to undermine an express purpose and a most important objective of the PMPA, which is to provide uniformity with respect to the rules and regulations applicable to petroleum franchise relationships. The courts of fifty different states would be interpreting and applying the statute independently of each other. Each state court would be free to disregard the statutory interpretation of another state court or of the federal courts. <em>See, e.g., Breckline v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/406/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="406 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1304910" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0573-01">406 Pa. 573</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.2d%20748" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="178 A.2d 748">178 A.2d 748</a> (1962). Such a system would effectively ensure not “a single, uniform <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>set of rules” governing petroleum franchise relationships but, on the contrary, would encourage substantial variation in the statute’s meaning and application. Such a result was clearly <em>not </em>intended by Congress.</p>
    <p id="b239-4" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[184,575,1147,744]]]'>We think it is abundantly clear, therefore, that Congress intended to give the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over PMPA actions. This imposes no hardship on persons like the Appellee. Section 2805(a) permits suits in federal courts “without regard to the amount in controversy.” In other words, a party situated as Appellee is need have no concern about meeting the burdensome dollar amount in controversy requirement that might have otherwise applied in order to sue in federal court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Moreover, someone like Appellee would not be required to split his state and federal claims arising from the same set of facts.

It is true that state courts in different jurisdictions may interpret the statute differently, but then that is also true of district and circuit courts in the federal system. Presumably, the states will be guided by the federal courts in interpreting the statute, and if there is a conflict between the circuits, that may be resolved by the United States Supreme Court. In any event, I do not agree that the prospect of disagreement among the states is any more of an impediment to implementation of federal interests than is the prospect of disagreement among the federal circuits.</p>

(Emphasis added.) The majority observes that this language is included in the statute because in 1978, when it was drafted, there was a $10,000 amount-in-controversy requirement which § 2805 eliminates. The majority then concludes that such a waiver would not have been necessary if the action were permitted in state courts as well. Quite to the contrary, the language was necessary because without it, only some actions — those exceeding $10,000 — would be able to be brought in federal court. All other actions, those under $10,000, would have to be brought in state court.</p>
