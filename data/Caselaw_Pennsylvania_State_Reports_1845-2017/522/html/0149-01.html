    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[268,485,1150,856]]]'>On December 8, 1983, appellant, the Fraternal Order of Police, Star Lodge No. 20, filed a Petition for Representation with the Pennsylvania Labor. Relations Board (Board), appellee herein, seeking to be certified as the exclusive representative for all of the police officers of the City of Bethlehem (City), including the six police captains who had always been a part of the bargaining unit of police officers (although it is not clear from the record, it appears that the officers had been represented by a different bargaining unit in the past). Following a hearing on the matter, a Board hearing examiner issued an order directing the City to submit to the Board a list of employees eligible to vote, which list would include the names of all full-time police sergeants, detectives and patrolmen, but would exclude the police commissioner and captains, who were found to be “managerial” employees.</p>

Appellant filed exceptions to the Board’s order, alleging that the hearing examiner relied upon inappropriate criteria to rule that the captains should be excluded from the bargaining unit, and that the finding of managerial status was not supported by substantial evidence. The Board dismissed the exceptions, and, on appeal, a Commonwealth Court panel affirmed. On reargument, Commonwealth Court, en banc, again affirmed the Board and set forth a “restatement” of the law regarding the criteria which must be used to determine managerial <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>status. We granted appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal, which petition was unopposed by the Board.</p>
    <p id="b279-4" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[188,424,1148,1249]]]'>Although the Board agrees with the result reached by Commonwealth Court, the Board did not oppose our grant of appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal in that the Board disagrees with certain criteria set forth by Commonwealth Court as determinative of managerial status. Specifically, the Board argues that the authority to hire, discipline, and fire employees and the authority to represent the employer in matters of public relations have always been considered by the Board to be supervisory functions and are thus, not indicative of managerial status. Commonwealth Court held otherwise, determining herein that the “effective involvement in hiring, serious disciplinary actions and dismissals” and the “authority to commit departmental resources in dealing with public groups” do constitute evidence of managerial status. <em>Fraternal Order of Police Star Lodge No. 20 v.

In its per curiam affirmance of Commonwealth Court, the majority of this Court is taking away from the expertise which has been granted to the Board by this Court with regard to the criteria the Board has developed for determining managerial status. <em>See, e.g., Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v.

    <blockquote id="AT6" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[305,937,1107,617]]]'>must be construed to include <em>the widest segment </em>of employes without infringing on the Employer’s reasonable need for effective and faithful operations of its business or enterprise. Thus, we shall include all employes in appropriate bargaining units excepting only those employes whose inclusion would unreasonably interfere with the Employer’s management of its operation. Those limited employes who are an essential or integral part of management are by virtue thereof “public employers” since they are directly involved in the formulation and implementation of managerial programs and policies of the public employer.</blockquote>

Commonwealth Court and the Board gave particular emphasis, in determining that the captains were managerial employees, to the fact that the police commissioner establishes department policy and draws up the department budget with input from and with the consensus of the six police captains. It is clear from the record, however, that the police captains have no independent authority to institute department policy or to countermand orders of the police commissioner (for example, the police commissioner testified that he would not establish a canine unit in the department even if his captains wished to do so because the police commissioner is adamantly opposed to the same, Hearing Transcript at 127 (March 23, 1984)), nor do they take part in negotiations over the proposed department budget with City authorities. Moreover, there was no evidence of record to show that the past participation of the police captains in the bargaining unit caused disruption to their employer’s management of police department operations.</p>
