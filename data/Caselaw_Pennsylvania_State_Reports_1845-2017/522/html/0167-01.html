Jung, Appellants, from an order of the Superior Court which affirmed the Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County denying Appellants’ Petition to Open Judgment of Non Pros. The issues presented are whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to open the judgment, and whether the Superior Court’s affirmance was inconsistent with its own precedent as well as precedent of this Court. For the following reasons we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b296-11" data-blocks='[["BL_296.10",296,[241,1793,1150,475]]]'>The facts underlying this case are as follows. Plaintiffs-Appellants Kyung Ha Jung and Sung M. Jung instituted an action in trespass against St. Paul’s Parish and Archdiocese of Philadelphia on January 24, 1986. The action was instituted to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by Appellant Kyung Ha Jung as the result of a fall on an icy parking lot of Appellee St. Paul’s Parish in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Appellee Archdiocese of Philadelphia was joined in the suit as owner of the realty of St. Paul’s Parish.</p>

O’Dea, Esquire, the Rule itself was neither signed nor stamped by anyone on behalf of the Prothonotary nor was the Rule itself dated. Also, it came in a package along with two discovery requests for documents and interrogatories. Because no date of filing was shown on the Rule and because no date was stated in the accompanying letter, Appellants’ attorney’s secretary could not determine when an answer to the Rule was required. As a consequence she did not enter a due date into the tickler file which counsel utilized to keep track of his work. Appellants’ counsel did not learn of this error until Friday, August 1st, when counsel’s secretary informed him of their receipt of a letter dated July 31, 1986, from Attorney Stephen Harris stating that a Praecipe for Entry of Judgment of Non Pros had been filed with the Prothonotary on July 30, 1986.

On August 1, following receipt of letter enclosing Praecipe for Entry of Judgment of Non Pros, Appellants’ counsel immediately attempted to telephone both John P. O’Dea, Esquire, and Stephen R.

Counsel explained to him how he had not been aware or had knowledge of the Rule to File Complaint and requested that he voluntarily agree by Stipulation to Open the Judgment of Non Pros. Mr. Harris advised Appellants’ counsel that he would review the matter. During this same conversation, Appellants’ counsel asked Appellees’ counsel if he would have granted an extension of time to file the Complaint if Appellants’ counsel had been aware of the Rule. Defense counsel said “yes” he would have agreed.</p>

Attached to the Petition to Open was an affidavit of counsel’s secretary attesting to her confusion and eventual mistake, which was caused by the manner in which the notification was made. Appellants aver that prior to instituting this action by service of a Writ of Summons, they had begun settlement negotiations with Appellees’ insurer; that the Writ of Summons was filed for the sole purpose of tolling the statute of limitations and preserving their rights while continuing to negotiate a settlement, as is the normal course of events in a personal injury case of this nature; and that they were completely cooperative with Appellees and Appellees’ insurer, providing copies of all pertinent medical records. Also, Appellants’ counsel voluntarily submitted Kyung Ha Jung to a Defense Medical Examination by Dr. William H. Simon on June 30, 1985, which date was one and one half years after the accident and six months prior to the running of the statute of limitations and prior to the institution of suit in this matter. Had Appellants' counsel responded to the Rule <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>he would have averred that he thought the case could be settled prior to the filing of the Complaint, and he wished to pursue settlement dialogue before actually filing the Complaint.</p>
