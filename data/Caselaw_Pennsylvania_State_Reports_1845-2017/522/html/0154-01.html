Joseph, Jr. (Claimant). Claimant was performing duties in the course of his employ<a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>ment with the Delphi Company (Delphi), when, on July 9, 1981, he sustained an injury to his left knee. Delphi was a subcontractor performing work for a general contractor, Ross &amp; Kennedy Corp. (R. &amp; K.).</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[267,568,1147,909]]]'>As a result of the injury, claim petitions were filed against Delphi, R. &amp; K., and the workmen’s compensation insurance carrier for Delphi, Rockwood Insurance Company (Rockwood). A referee determined that Claimant was entitled to compensation for total disability from the date of the injury until April 19,1982, and that compensation for partial disability was payable from the latter date through January 12, 1984, i.e., the date of the referee’s order. The referee also determined that the general contractor, R. &amp; K., was liable for payment of Claimant’s medical expenses, compensation, and costs. This was based upon a finding that the insurance policy procured by Delphi from Rockwood was not in effect at the time of the injury, and, thus, that R. &amp; K. was the responsible statutory employer for purposes of compensation. Hence, Rockwood was discharged from all liability, and liability attached to the insurer for R. &amp; K., Bituminous Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. (Bituminous).</p>

Perhaps in the expectation that the referee’s consideration of the memorandum might reveal a need to receive additional testimony or documents <em>related </em>to matters discussed in the memorandum, the Board granted a remand “for further proceedings.”</p>
    <p id="b285-7" data-blocks='[["BL_285.7",285,[169,1204,1147,782]]]'>The referee interpreted the Board’s order remanding “for further proceedings” as allowing him to reopen the hearing not only for the purpose of receiving the memorandum of law but also for the taking of additional testimony. Testimony was received relative to the respective potential liabilities of Rockwood and Bituminous, focusing primarily upon whether the policy issued by Rockwood had been effectively cancelled prior to Claimant’s injury. Essentially no additional testimony was taken with regard to the extent or duration of Claimant’s disability. The referee held, in December, 1984, that Delphi and Rockwood were responsible for payment of compensation, and that Claimant’s disability terminated on January 11, 1983. Both of these findings plainly contradicted findings made by the referee prior to the remand.</p>

    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[260,563,1147,753]]]'>In holding that the remand was not proper, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that a remand of a referee’s decision is proper <em>only </em>when the referee has failed to resolve crucial issues raised by the parties or where the referee’s findings of fact are not supported by the evidence.

Inasmuch as the present case did not in the Commonwealth Court’s view meet those criteria, it was held that the Board should have proceeded to review the referee’s findings without paying heed to notice supplied by the referee that a relevant memorandum of law had erroneously been omitted from consideration as part of the record. We do not agree that the Board’s remand powers are so precisely limited.</p>

It would have been unjust for the Board to proceed with a review of the referee’s decision, after having been informed that a timely memorandum of law from one of the parties had been ignored by the referee.</p>

Where there has not already been a decision rendered by the Board, recognition of the power to remand in the interest of efficient and fair resolution of claims is even more compelling than in cases where a decision has previously been rendered. The Board should not be forced to review an imperfect decision of a referee that can, at that stage, very easily be rectified.</p>

To hold otherwise would be to impose a rigidity upon procedures in this area of law that would be blind to the fairness of the ultimate decision reached.

This was a defect that is intended to be cured by the consideration of all legal issues by the Board on appeal to them from the decision of the referee. The record was complete. Only the proper application of the law was left to consider. The Board abrogated their responsibilities by the remand and caused unwarranted delay to the parties. This was the real cause of injustice. The <em>Cudo </em>case stands for the proposition that a remand for a <em>rehearing </em>is proper to complete a record. Rehearings are for the purpose of receiving evidence — not legal arguments. The Board does not receive new and additional evidence in the appeal process but they must review all legal arguments posed by memoranda of law whether presented to the referee or directly to the Board. That is their statutory duty under 77 P.S. § 855. To remand to the referee to avoid that statutory duty was error, in my view. If the remand was for some other unknown purpose, the Board was obligated to explain their reasons for the remand. See, <em>Pennsylvania Social Services Local 668 v.
