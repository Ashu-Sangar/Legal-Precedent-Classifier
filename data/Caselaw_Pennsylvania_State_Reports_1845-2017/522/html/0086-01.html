It should be noted that, as a general rule, there is no common law cause of action against an employer for termination of an at-will employment relationship. <em>Geary v. United States Steel Corp., </em><a href="/pa/456/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="456 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="584439" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0171-01">456 Pa. 171</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20174" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="319 A.2d 174">319 A.2d 174</a> (1974).

E.g., <em>Reuther v. Fowler &amp; Williams, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/255/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="255 Pa.

Nevertheless, inasmuch as appellees failed to pursue their exclusive statutory remedy for sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace, they are precluded from relief. This result is indicated by express provisions of the PHRA, as well as established judicial interpretations of legislative intent.</p>
    <p id="b218-4" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[277,829,1152,1279]]]'>The PHRA provides that it is an unlawful practice for any employer to discharge from employment or otherwise discriminate against an employee on the basis of sex. 43 P.S. § 955(a). A right to a remedy for discrimination in employment is established by the PHRA, 43 P.S. § 953, where it is provided, “The opportunity for an individual to obtain employment for which he is qualified ... without discrimination because of ... sex ... is hereby recognized as and declared to be a civil right <em>which shall be enforceable as set forth in this act." </em>(Emphasis added). Thus, the PHRA both bestows a right to be free from discrimination based on sex, and prescribes procedures whereby the right “shall” be vindicated. The use by the legislature of the word “shall,” as opposed to “may,” expresses an intent to make administrative procedures under the PHRA a mandatory rather than discretionary means of enforcing the right created thereby. Clearly, too, the right in question is of purely statutory origin, for, as discussed supra, common law rights to be free from termination of at-will employment are not generally recognized, ^nd we have never held that at-will employment terminations arising from sex discrimination are actionable at common law. In short, the remedy that should have been invoked by appellees was the one provided by the PHRA.</p>

Certainly, by requiring initial utilization of administrative remedies, aggrieved parties are not deprived of their <em>ultimate </em>resort to the courts. It is provided in section 962(c) of the PHRA that the rights of a complainant thereunder shall not be foreclosed from being pursued in the courts, if, within one year after the filing of a complaint, the PHRC dismisses the complaint or fails to enter a conciliation agreement to which the complainant is a party. 43 P.S. § 962(c).

The reasons the Legislature chose thus to postpone a complainant’s right to seek redress by an action in court are clear. The PHRC possesses a “particular expertise” in the area of unlawful discrimination not possessed by the courts. By requiring a complainant first to repair to the PHRC, the Legislature ensured maximum use of the PHRC’s expertise, thereby minimizing the inefficient use of judicial resources (and its attendant expense and embarrassment of the parties). In other words, the rationale of the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies, applicable to other areas of administrative law, is also applicable to actions brought under section 962(c) of the PHRÁ.</blockquote>

Although I agree with the result ultimately reached by the majority, I disagree with its reasoning. The premise upon which the majority proceeds appears to be that a common-law cause of action exists against an employer for termination of an at-will employment relationship where such a discharge would implicate a clear mandate of public policy. The majority further holds, however, that where the public policy implicated is the constitutional prohibition of gender-based bias, the exclusive remedy falls under the express provisions of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (“PHRA”). Because I do not believe that there is a common-law cause of action for wrongful discharge, in this instance, I believe that the PHRA is the sole remedy available.</p>

Nevertheless, it is first necessary to respond to the majority's discussion concerning the exclusivity of the PHRA. In its exploration of the exclusivity of the statutory remedy, the majority interprets the language of the PHRA to provide that an aggrieved party is precluded from bringing an action in the courts without first proceeding under the PHRA. In reaching this determination, the majority first relies upon section 962 of the PHRA which provides in pertinent part:</p>

No more clear statement of public policy exists than that of a constitutional amendment. The passage of the Pennsylvania Equal Rights Amendment, Article I, § 28 is the expression of public policy. I will not eliminate the possibility that our developing body of common law would encompass a cause of action for wrongful discharge arising out of sexual discrimination once that issue is before us.</p>
