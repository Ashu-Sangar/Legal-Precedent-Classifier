    <p id="b210-8" data-blocks='[["BL_210.7",210,[248,1019,1149,635]]]'>The present controversy arose from the denial of Appellant Judy Baker’s claim for “theft loss” under her homeowner’s insurance policy issued by Appellee, Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Company (Penn National). The pertinent facts of the case are as follows. Sometime between May 21 and May 24 of 1982, while Baker was visiting friends in Berlin, Pennsylvania, vandals broke into her home located in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The vandals ransacked the home stealing numerous items, including, almost all of Baker’s home appliances, several pieces of furniture and personal belongings such as tools, clothing, and guns.</p>
    <p id="b210-9" data-blocks='[["BL_210.8",210,[243,1673,1149,519]]]'>Baker submitted her claim for “theft loss” with Penn National on August 2, 1982 in accordance with the terms of her homeowner’s insurance policy. After nearly two years of delay in investigating, Penn National denied Baker’s claim on February 15, 1984. The reasons for denial were: that Baker falsely declared that the loss resulted from a theft when in fact she knew that no break-in had occurred; that Baker falsely claimed that certain property was stolen when in fact it was not; and that Baker misrepresented the value of the certain items claimed to be stolen.</p>
    <p id="b210-10" data-blocks='[["BL_210.9",210,[242,2218,1145,151]],["BL_211.1",211,[193,311,1147,316]]]'>Thereafter, on June 15, 1984, Baker filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Cambria County, alleging breach of contract. The complaint was later amended to <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>add a claim for defamation and to request punitive damages. At the beginning of trial, because Baker was seeking punitive damages, she was permitted to introduce evidence of Penn National’s net worth including its assets, reserves and claim procedures. During the course of the trial, however, she abandoned her tort claim for defamation.</p>
    <p id="b211-5" data-blocks='[["BL_211.4",211,[193,655,1149,475]]]'>At the close of all of the evidence, the parties requested points for charge. The trial judge failed to charge the jury as to the elements of a claim for defamation. However, over Penn National’s objection, he did instruct the jury regarding punitive damages. The jury found in favor of Baker in the amount of $11,913.97 in compensatory damages which represented the liquidated amount of her claim for theft loss against Penn National. The jury did not award punitive damages.</p>
    <p id="b211-6" data-blocks='[["BL_211.5",211,[194,1156,1147,368]]]'>Post trial motions were denied by the trial court.

Punitive damages are collateral or ancillary to a tort claim and are only recoverable upon a showing of “outrageous” conduct on the part of the defendant. As distinguished from compensatory damages, “which have as the purpose their desire to make the plaintiff whole,” punitive damages are awarded “to punish the wrongdoers and to deter future conduct”. <em><a href="/pa/512/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="512 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="1800438" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0567-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/512/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="512 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="1800438" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0567-01">512 Pa. at 579</a>, <a href="/pa/512/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="512 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="1800438" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0567-01">517 A.2d 1270</a> (1986).

    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[173,710,1151,811]]]'>In the instant matter, Baker amended her complaint to include a cause of action for defamation. The amended complaint appropriately requested an award of punitive damages. At trial Baker attempted to and was permitted, over Penn National’s objection to introduce the testimony of Kenneth L. Shaffer, Controller of Penn National, to establish the net worth and financial resources of that company. The claim for defamation however, was abandoned at trial leaving no tort claim upon which the jury could base an award of punitive damages. In any event, the trial judge while refusing to instruct the jury as to a cause of action for defamation, went on to instruct the jury on punitive damages. Thus, the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Penn National’s net worth and in instructing the jury on the issue of punitive damages.</p>
    <p id="b213-6" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[175,1552,1148,807]]]'>However, the “drastic” remedy of a new trial, granted by the superior court in this instance, was not warranted. The present case is distinguishable from the <em>Feld </em>case in two respects. First, in <em>Feld </em>the jury awarded compensatory, damages in an <em>unliquidated </em>amount based upon a tort claim for <em>personal injury. </em>Second, the jury in <em>Feld </em>improperly awarded punitive damages. Conversely, in this case the jury awarded compensatory damages in a <em>liquidated </em>amount based upon a tort claim for <em>property loss. </em>The jury properly refused to award punitive damages. The trial judge’s error therefore, did not effect the outcome of the case and can be considered harmless. The actual compensatory damage award in the amount of $11,913.97, representing the liquidated amount of Baker’s claim, dispels the notion of any prejudice inuring to Penn National.</p>
