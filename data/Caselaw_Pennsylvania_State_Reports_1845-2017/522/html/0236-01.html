Aston, </em><a href="/pa/227/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="227 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1008536" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0106-01">227 Pa. 106</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.%201017" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="75 A. 1017">75 A. 1017</a> (1910), the defendant asked for the following charge:</p>
      <blockquote id="b371-5" data-blocks='[["BL_371.2",371,[290,1141,1080,114]]]'>
        <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>Evidence of good character is material and substantive evidence in the cause, and may, <em>of itself, </em>reduce the crime from murder in the first degree to murder in the second degree.</blockquote>
      <p id="b371-6" data-blocks='[["BL_371.3",371,[257,1258,1029,36]]]'>(Emphasis added.) The Court, in rejecting this charge, stated:</p>
      <blockquote id="b371-7" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[289,1298,1081,430]]]'>The rule of all the cases is that evidence of good character is always admissible and must be weighed and considered by the jury in connection with the other testimony in the case, and it to be regarded as evidence of a substantive fact like any other evidence tending to establish innocence. In some instances it may of itself create the reasonable doubt which will entitle the accused to an acquittal____ The jury were instructed that evidence of good character must be considered in connection with all the other testimony in the case, <em>but that it did not raise a distinct issue. </em>The defendant was given the benefit of his evidence of good character, and there is nothing in this record about which he can justly complain.</blockquote>
      <p id="b371-9" data-blocks='[["BL_371.5",371,[256,1732,1112,348]]]'><a href="/pa/227/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="227 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1008536" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0106-01">227 Pa. at 111</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.%201017" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="75 A. 1017">75 A. 1017</a>. This is still good law today, and it is inexplicable why the majority ignores it. The <em>Aston </em>Court’s statement that in some cases, character evidence may of itself create reasonable doubt which would result in an acquittal does not mean that a jury must be instructed in these words, but only that when the jury is considering all the evidence, it may, in a given case, find that character evidence is so strong that it “of itself” raises a doubt as to guilt. <em>See also Commonwealth v.
