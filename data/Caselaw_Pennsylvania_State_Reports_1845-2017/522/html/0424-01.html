In the lounge’s parking lot, William Shaffer joined the group who decided to take Barrett’s car for the ride home. Jerry Barrett drove his car, along with the five passengers, out of the parking lot and onto Route 36 until reaching Oliveburg, where he turned onto Legislative Route 33060 (L.R. 33060). As they traveled along L.R. 33060, one of the passengers mentioned he had to relieve himself, so Barrett stopped the car along the berm of the road, which, unbeknown to the travelers, was directly adjacent to a strip mine.</p>

Bruce Poole, who owns the property, had leased it in 1973 to Harmon Mining Company (Harmon). In order to fully exploit the coal seam, Harmon sought and obtained a variance from DER that allowed mining within one hundred feet of L.R. 33060, which was owned, controlled and maintained by PennDOT. The variance required Harmon to build an earthen embankment on top of the highwall of the <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>strip mine to prevent cars from driving into the pit and dropping eighty feet to the bottom of the mine. The earthen embankment was six to seven feet wide and seven feet high, composed of lose dirt, rock and shale. By 1980, Harmon’s mining activities had caused the earthen embankment to be moved closer to L.R. 33060.</p>

Within moments, defendant Gary Gruver, driving a four wheel drive vehicle, pulled onto the berm in front of Barrett’s car and then proceeded to drive in reverse at a high rate of speed toward Barrett’s vehicle. To avoid being hit, Johnson scrambled up the embankment, which was seven feet outside L.R. 33060’s right-of-way, and fell to the bottom of the strip mine. He was left a paraplegic as a result of his fall.</p>

Gruver then drove forward toward Barrett’s car and the three women standing on the berm. As Gruver rapidly approached them, the women scrambled up the embankment, which was approximately twelve feet outside the right-of-way, and fell into the mine.

The basic allegation against PennDOT in the complaint was that this Commonwealth agency was negligent in permitting a dangerous condition to exist within its right-of-way. Specifically, appellees claimed that PennDOT. had failed to warn the public of the existence of the pit either by lighting, or by erecting physical barriers or guardrails along the right-of-way. It also alleged negligence in permitting mining activities to occur thereon. The allegations against DER were similar in nature but also included claims that DER failed to inspect or supervise the mine and enforce applicable mining laws. In their answer and new matter, PennDOT and DER <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>denied the allegations against them and raised as a bar to appellees’ cause of action the rule of sovereign immunity and the failure of the cause of action to fall within one of the eight exceptions enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522.</p>
    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[218,570,1147,689]]]'>Thereafter, PennDOT and DER each moved for summary judgment, alleging no genuine issue of material fact existed because the accident took place outside PennDOT’s twenty foot statutorily granted right-of-way. Additionally, PennDOT and DER claimed that since the dangerous condition of the strip mine did not exist on Commonwealth realty, appellee’s cause of action did not fall within any exception to sovereign immunity which entitled these Commonwealth agencies to summary judgment as a matter of law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Attached to the motion was an affidavit signed by the District Right of Way Administrator for PennDOT which stated that the edge of the right-of-way of L.R. 38060 was twenty feet from the center of the roadway.</p>

The court concluded that since DER did not own, possess or lease the property on which the highwall and strip mine were located, the mere authority to inspect the mining operation and enforce the laws of the Commonwealth would not support appellees’ claim against DER. The court also reasoned that regardless of any incidental intrusions which Harmon may have made on the right-of-way, the dangerous condition which caused appellees’ injuries at the point where appellees actually fell, was entirely <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>beyond the limits of the PennDOT right-of-way.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Because DER did not own or control L.R. 33060 and the dangerous condition existed off of PennDOT’s property, the court found 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(4) inapplicable.</p>

The critical distinction the trial court made between the situation in <em>Mistecka </em>and that in this case was that the plaintiffs in <em>Mistecka </em>were injured while traveling within the Commonwealth’s highway’s right-of-way, which was not true of appellees.</p>

There a home owned by Lutzko was continually flooded during rainstorms due to the negligent construction of a subdivision that altered the contour of the land. The defendants in that case sought to join PennDOT as an additional defendant for failing to maintain proper drainage along a road under PennDOT’s jurisdiction abutting Lutzko’s property, as well as for negligently changing the grade of the road without installing appropriate drainage. The court in <em>Lutzko </em>allowed joinder of PennDOT because although the injury occurred in an area off Commonwealth property the dangerous condition which caused the injury (lack of proper drainage along state road) was on Commonwealth property.</p>

For this reason, the court determined the trial court erred in holding that appellees' cause of action against PennDOT did not fall within any of the exceptions to Section 8522(b).</p>
