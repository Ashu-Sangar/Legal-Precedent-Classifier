Upon arrival an officer, Alexander Stephens, discovered that the front window to the store had been broken. Subsequently the manager of the store, Bob McDonald, arrived and both went through the store to make sure everything was in order. Upon finding everything in order the police officer left and the manager then called the Franklin Glass Company to get the window boarded up for the night. At approximately 4:30 a.m., a William Linberry, an employee of the glass company, arrived at the store and began boarding up the broken window. Approximately 10 minutes later, while Mr. Linberry and Mr. McDonald were outside the store discussing the broken window, an individual crossed the street from the ARCO service station and asked what had happened. This man was carrying a yellow <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>bag and subsequently produced a hand gun and then stated to Mr. McDonald, “put the money in the bag.” McDonald replied “what money” and with that, the man shot Mr. McDonald twice, killing him. The appellant was subsequently identified as the perpetrator of the robbery/murder and was arrested October 22, 1980, in Suffolk City, Virginia.</p>

He testified that the other boys ran across the street into Duram Park but that he only ran up the street and stopped and that from his vantage point he could still see the ARCO station and Pep Boys store. He testified that the appellant had a yellow bag and that he watched the appellant walk over to the store and talk to the two men fixing the window. He stated that he then saw the appellant shoot one of the men.</p>

Mr. Willie testified that a couple of weeks after the appellant moved in, the appellant told him that he robbed a Pep Boys store in Philadelphia. He testified that the appellant told him that there were two men there, that he had shot one and that the other had “hid under a car or truck.” Mr. Willie stated that he reported this to the Suffolk City, Virginia, Police Department, two days later. Finally an Officer Thomas Newsome, of the Suffolk City, Virginia, Police Department testified that he was involved in the interrogation of the appellant after his arrest on October 22, 1980. Officer Newsome testified that after the appellant was properly apprised of his rights, he told the appellant that he was wanted in Philadelphia in connection with the robbery of a store and the shooting of a clerk. Officer Newsome stated that the appellant immediately replied, “I did it to keep up with the crowd.” N.T., 11/23/83, p.83. Further, Officer Newsome testified that the appellant gave his address as 4808 Merion Avenue in Philadelphia.</p>

At trial the prosecution asked Officer Newsome what he said to the appellant when he was first brought in for questioning. Officer Newsome replied, “I told him I wanted to talk to him concerning an offense in Suffolk and also a Philadelphia situation.” N.T., 11/23/83, p. <em>75. </em>The defense then objected and moved for a mistrial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The trial court denied the motion reasoning that the witness’ state<a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>ment did not directly inculpate the appellant in any other crimes.</p>

At best this testimony implied that the appellant was merely a suspect in a crime and not that he was ever charged or convicted of any unrelated crime.

Further the appellant asserts that the prosecutor, in commenting about the credibility of two of the defense witnesses, stated “they are robbers — have no reason in the world to tell police the truth.” The appellant asserts that the alleged remarks were improper expressions of the prosecutor’s opinion and that they had the effect of destroying the objectivity of the jurors.</p>

Looking at the comment in this context we believe that it was an inference reasonably derived from the evidence and fell within the ambit of fair comment. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The test for determining the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner and drawing all proper inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could reasonably have determined all elements of the crime to have been established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth now asserts that even if the sketch was not properly admitted under the <em>res gestae </em>exception, its admission was harmless since the defense tried to impeach the witness after its admission. Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that the sketch is admissible under <em>Commonwealth v. Brady, </em><a href="/pa/510/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="510 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1796921" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0123-01">510 Pa. 123</a>, <a href="/pa/510/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="510 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1796921" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0123-01">507 A.2d 66</a> (1986).</p>
      <p id="b669-6" data-blocks='[["BL_669.6",669,[218,2025,1115,349]]]'>The sketch clearly does not fall within any of the <em>res gestae </em>exceptions to the hearsay rule. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Furthermore, the prosecution cannot rely on the fact that the defense tried to impeach the witness after the sketch was introduced because had it not been admitted, the defense might have refrained from trying to impeach the witness. Finally, in <em>Brady </em>we held that prior <em>inconsistent </em>statements are admissible as substantive evidence, not that every extra-judicial statement is now admissible. Thus, we believe that the sketch’s admission was improper.</p>

The appellant attacks the latter of the two findings by the jury asserting that there was no basis upon which the jury could find that the appellant had placed Mr. Linberry’s life in jeopardy. Accepting for the sake of argument, that the appellant’s shooting of the person standing next to him is insufficient to sustain a finding that Mr. Linberry’s life was in peril, the evidence was still sufficient for the jury to reach this finding. Ronald Johnson testified that the appellant fired three shots. It was established that Mr. McDonald was only shot twice. Because of the short distance between the victim and the appellant at the time of shooting, the jury could have properly inferred that appellant was not only shooting at Mr. McDonald.</p>
      <p id="b672-8" data-blocks='[["BL_672.7",672,[301,1363,1114,438]]]'>The appellant relies heavily on Mr. Linberry's testimony that he only heard two shots being fired. Further, appellant relies on an unsworn written statement allegedly made by Ronald Johnson subsequent to trial. However, the discrepancy in the testimony with regard to the number of shots fired can be explained by the fact that Mr. Linberry was very excited and was diving under his van during the shooting and thus might not have heard one of the shots. Moreover Ronald Johnson alleges in his post-trial statement, that he never saw the shooting and that he only identified the appellant to get favorable treatment by police in another legal matter. This statement does not hold up under close scrutiny.</p>

However Mr. Linberry's trial testimony corroborated Johnson’s testimony, in that he had seen the appellant and the boys at the at the ARCO station when he arrived. <em>See </em>N.T., 11/18/83, p. 83-84. Johnson testified that the appellant told him and the others to get out of there just prior to the shooting. N.T., 11/21/83, p. 9. Further the record reflects that Johnson was not arrested until two weeks after the shooting and approximately 10 days after he gave the description to the police artist for the sketch. As a general rule recantations are viewed as extremely unreliable, <em>Commonwealth v. Nelson, </em><a href="/pa/484/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="484 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1753723" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0011-01">484 Pa. 11</a>, <a href="/pa/484/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="484 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1753723" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0011-01">398 A.2d 636</a> (1979), but this one is devoid of any credibility.
