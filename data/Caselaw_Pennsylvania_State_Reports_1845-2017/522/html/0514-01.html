Dibler of the Pennsylvania State Police made arrangements to interview Appellant Thomas Dean Henlen in connection with said theft. Appellant, a guard at the prison, and considered a suspect in the case, was interviewed by Trooper Dibler at the Mercer County Jail on June 19, 1986 for thirty to forty-five minutes. Trooper Dibler made some notes of the interview. He would have made a more complete report of the interview if he had obtained more information that he believed he could use against Appellant in court. Another guard at the prison was present at the interview for approximately eight to ten minutes. Appellant secretly recorded the conversation with a tape recorder that he had concealed upon his person.</p>

In finding that the claimant did not violate the Act, the court considered the fact that testimony at such hearings is routinely recorded as indicative of the lack of expectation of privacy in the proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b645-9" data-blocks='[["BL_645.7",645,[214,1629,1146,204]]]'>The Superior Court considered <em>Gunderman </em>to be distinguishable from the instant case because under these circumstances, no official recording was made — nor was one expected to be made.</p>

In addition, not only did Trooper Dibler take notes during the interview, which he stipulated would have been made into a report had he obtained information that could have been against Appellant in court, he also allowed a third party to be present for a time during the interview.

The broad language of <em>Blystone </em>makes it clear that “[w]hat one chooses to do with another’s secrets may differ from the expectation of the teller, but it is no longer his secret. How, when and to whom the confidant discloses the confidence is his choosing. He may whisper it, write it, or in modern times immediately broadcast it as he hears it.” <em>Blystone, </em><a href="/pa/519/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="519 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1813568" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0450-01">519 Pa. at 462, 463</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="519 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1813568" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0450-01">549 A.2d at 87, 88</a>.
