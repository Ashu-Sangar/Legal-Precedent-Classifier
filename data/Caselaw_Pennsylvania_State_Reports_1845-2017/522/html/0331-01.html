It is axiomatic that the right to counsel includes the concomitant right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967). Indeed the right to counsel is meaningless if effective assistance is not guaranteed. Since appellant was entitled to representation by an attorney in his pursuit of this collateral attack, he was entitled to adequate representation of his claims at both the hearing and appellate levels. Although we have no indication of the quality of representation afforded at the PCHA hearing, we have observed the inadequate representation afforded at the appellate level. In finding that the briefs submitted by counsel were inadequate and unintelligible, the Superior Court implicitly found that the assistance rendered by appellant’s counsel was ineffective. We concur in the reasoning of the Superior Court; we do not, however, agree with its disposition. Although the Superior Court affirmed the denial of post conviction relief, the proper disposition would have been to quash or dismiss the appeal. Pa.R.App.P. Rule 2101.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The affirmance of the order below was in effect a decision on the merits and thus a rejection of the claim of ineffective assistance of prior counsel.</p>

The Constitution of this Commonwealth permits a direct appeal from “.. .a court of record to an appellate court____” Pa. Const, art. V, § 9. A proceeding in which inadequate <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>representation was afforded could not satisfy the constitutional right to review of PCHA proceedings. Where counsel’s representation is deemed to be inadequate, it is inappropriate to allow the proceedings in which it was rendered to be binding upon the defendant’s rights. Thus, at the very least, appellant must be allowed the right to have an appeal aided by competent counsel. The guidance and representation of an attorney should assure that meritorious legal issues are recognized and addressed, and that meritless claims are foregone. As we stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/427/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="427 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="1910417" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0395-01">427 Pa. 395</a>, 397, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20148" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="235 A.2d 148">235 A.2d 148</a>, 149 (1967), “[c]ounsel’s ability to frame the issues in a legally meaningful fashion insures the trial court that all relevant considerations will be brought to its attention.” It is apparent that the assistance provided by counsel in this matter did not serve to accomplish this goal.</p>
