She testified that she saw him go up to the “lady that had the car” and point to the tire of the car, apparently trying to show her that something was wrong with it. She testified that the lady then got out of the car and eventually got into the passenger-seat and that the appellant then got into the driver-side. She further testified that she then saw the appellant and this lady, pick up two other ladies who apparently were waiting for the car. The second witness, Kimberly Oyler, testified that she was in the Millcraft Shopping Center’s parking lot on Friday, June 21, 1985<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> and that she had seen the appellant holding the car door open to Mrs. Horner’s Dodge Dart, for Mrs. Kuntz, who was getting into the backdoor, on the passenger-side of the car.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> In addition she stated that the appellant was wearing a dark colored suit without a necktie.

In the search, items removed from the Woznicak home were recovered.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> In addition Trooper Stanek testified that he measured the distance from Elements Service Station to were the victims bodies were found and that the distance was approximately 1.5 miles and was travelled by him in approximately 4 minutes by vehicle.

The first route was approximately 25.8 miles and required 35 minutes and 42 seconds by automobile and the second route was approximately 18.9 miles and required 29 minutes and 30 seconds by automobile. This was significant because the Commonwealth established through three witnesses, that at approximately 5:30 on Friday, June 21, 1985, the appellant was at the Whitlock home unloading the stolen items from the trunk of Mrs. Horner’s car. He was observed taking these items into the Whitlock home.

This too was significant because Raymond Simms Ray, an employee of the Pittsburgh Housing Authority, testified that while he was assigned to the cleanup detail at Broadhead Manor he found a white clutch purse containing credit cards, between buildings 23 and 24 on Old Orchard Circle. Trooper Stanek, testified that on June 25, 1985 he went to Broadhead Manor, met with Mr. Ray and received a white vinyl bag that resembled a purse, which contained among other things, credit cards issued to Lucille Horner and Sarah Kuntz.</p>

He stated that the appellant previously lived 600-800 yards from the location where the bodies were found. An Andrew Podolak, a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was also called to testify. He had performed an examination on hair fibers found on the appellant’s clothing which were removed during the search of the home of appellant’s girlfriend. He testified that in his expert opinion, based upon his comparison of those hair fibers found with head hair samples .taken from the victim, Minnie Warrick, the hair fibers found on the appellant’s clothing were from the head of Minnie Warrick.</p>

He also testified that the trauma received by the victims in the chin, neck and upper chest portions of the of their bodies in particular, were sustained at approximately the same time, all developing the same degree of discoloration. It was his opinion that due to the similarities in injuries in this area, including the lack of foreign particles in the areas of the bruises, the lack of skin lacerations and the pattern lengths, that each of the injuries was caused by blows delivered by a hand.

She stated that the appellant told her that he had seen somebody messing around with her car and that there was a nail in her tire. Further that the appellant was persistent about going with her in her car to have the tire looked at. She then testified that when she first looked at the tire she found nothing wrong with it but that after she had gotten back into her car, the appellant bent down, near the tire, called her back out of the car and pulled a pair of scissors from under the wheel. She then testified that she took them and told him she would take them to the police and that the appellant then asked for them back stating he would take them to the police.
