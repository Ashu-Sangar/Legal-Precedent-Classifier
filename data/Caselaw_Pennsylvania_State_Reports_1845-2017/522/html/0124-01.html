It is direct when committed in the court’s presence and indirect when committed beyond its presence. Contempt is a generic concept, distinguished by two types, criminal and civil contempt. The difference is not of the essence, but of the purpose sought by their use. The gravemen of both is obstruction of orderly process, and each serves a different purpose for regulating obstruction.</p>

Such conduct is not self-evident or self-accusatory as when one refuses in the court’s presence to do a thing and proof of its commission is required. Therein lies the main difference between contempt in the court’s presence and conduct beyond. When one is charged with indirect contempt those charging such contempt are put to the usual proofs required to convict for any charge, including the right to trial by jury. This is so, because the court has no direct, immediate proof of some<a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>thing beyond its immediate view. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. section 4136, <em>supra.</em>

It was indirect. Focusing on the nature of the penalties imposed as directed by <em>Martorano, </em>there can be no dispute that they were determinate. The order at issue imposed a fine of $1500.00 and issued as a result of a series of contumacious acts committed earlier. It was not imposed and could not have been imposed as a means of restraining Mr. Moran from acts which he had already committed. So too with the sentence of forty-five days in the county jail; there is no provision in the order which would make the length of time to be served at all contingent on payment of the fine at any time. Mr. Moran’s refusal to pay resulted in a sentence to a fixed term of imprisonment.</p>

What Mr. Moran allegedly did was done beyond the immediate presence of the court. Therefore, proofs beyond the court’s own immediate witness are required. When a court seeks prospective obedience, it may set the penalty if disobeyed, but whether it was in fact disobeyed is a question that can only be answered by the regular forms of proof as required by the statute.</p>
    <p id="b261-4" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[189,930,1148,691]]]'>In its opinion the Superior Court determined the contempt to have been civil, based on the fact that the sanctions were conditional, could have been avoided by conformance to their terms, and would not have been imposed but for Mr. Moran’s alleged disregard and disobedience of their prohibitions. <em>Crozer-Chester, </em><a href="/pa-super/368/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="368 Pa.

(emphasis added). We acknowledge that the conditional nature of the fine in this case added an element of constraint. However, in arriving at our determination of the court’s dominant purpose, as we must, it is beyond cavil that the fine was of a fixed amount and imposed as a result of past violations. We cannot but infer that the proceeding was therefore criminal in nature. <em>Martorano, supra. </em>The purpose of the court to coerce compliance was ancillary and cannot work to transform the proceeding from criminal to civil. <em>Charlett, </em><a href="/pa/481/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="481 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="1747322" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0022-01">481 Pa. at 30</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="481 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="1747322" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0022-01">391 A.2d at 1300</a>.</p>
