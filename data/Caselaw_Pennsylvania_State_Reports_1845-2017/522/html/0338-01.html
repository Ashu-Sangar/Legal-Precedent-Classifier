The proposed rate increase was necessary to offset energy replacement costs incurred as a result of the closing of the Salem and Peach Bottom nuclear power plants on two occasions each. The Commission denied the Appellee’s request, finding that part of the energy replacement costs were caused by mismanagement. Furthermore, the Commission held that since one of the outages was caused by a manufacturing defect and that Appellee was in the best position to pursue redress against the manufacturer, no additional costs should be passed on to the ratepayer. Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that the Commission used an incorrect standard of care to evaluate Appellee’s actions and that it was improper to impute a third party’s negligence to Appellee under the <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>current record. Because of the important issues raised, we granted the Appellants’ petitions for allowance of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[225,432,1148,1060]]]'>The requisite facts are not in dispute. On February 22, 1983, while the nuclear reactor at Salem 1 was shut down for a scheduled refueling outage and as attempts were being made to restart the unit, the automatic protection system used to shut down the nuclear reactor failed. However, this failure went undetected until three days later when a second failure occurred. As a result of the second failure, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) instituted an investigation which culminated in the Appellee paying an $850,000 fine and the scheduling of a target restart date of May 21, 1983. The NRC investigation uncovered inadequate operations with regard to maintenance and testing of current circuit breakers and related component parts, inadequate training of operators and overall station management. Prior to restarting, NRC required that the Appellee develop and demonstrate procedures to cure these problems. Although the actual restart had been set for April 29, 1983, it had to be cancelled due to Appellee’s discovery of shellfish infestation in cooling water lines. Restart finally occurred on May 21, 1983.</p>

It appears that this failure was caused by the defective manufacturing of resins which surround the coils that protect the generator from the ill effects of vibrations. This power outage lasted until October 22, 1984.</p>

Although originally shut down for refueling, this shutdown period was extended for almost eight months as a result of problems with cracking in pipes, reactor cavity overflow and difficulty in welding and valve joints.

In addition, the judge determined that Appellee was responsible for seven days of outage at Peach Bottom Unit 3 and forty hours at Peach Bottom Unit 2. This finding excluded another $2.5 million from the requested rate increase.</p>

Since the primary pur<a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>pose of a rate case is to evaluate the effect of a rate increase on the customer and investor so as to avoid unreasonable utility costs, Commonwealth Court concluded that the heightened standard of care required to ensure safety is inappropriate.</p>

According to the Commission’s analysis, if the Appellee had operated its plants in accordance with the NRC’s regulations, the mechanical failures would have either been detected or prevented. Because of the Appellee’s lack of a sufficient maintenance policy, the failure of the protection system occurring on February 22, 1983 was not even detected until the second failure.

By disallowing the replacement costs, the Commission held that the utility and not the ratepayers were in a far superior position to seek redress for the defects and negotiate contractual protections to minimize any future problems. Appellee argued successfully before Commonwealth Court that unless the Appellants can demonstrate that the utility exercised some form of control over the contractor, the utility cannot be held responsible for replacement costs arising out of defective component parts.</p>

After all, it was the utility which chose the contractor, negotiated the contract and is in a position to seek damages for any losses sustained under the contract. While the utility may have to bear the initial losses incurred as the result of its contractor’s negligence, it is in a far better position to aggressively pursue the tortfeasor for reimbursement. If we were to hold otherwise, the utility would have no incentive to pursue the tortfeasor, having already received full compensation for its losses. On the other <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>hand, ratepayers would not be in a position either legally or financially to pursue the alleged tortfeasor. Balancing, as we must, the equities involved to determine whether a requested rate increase is just and reasonable, <em>Pennsylvania Electric v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, supra, </em>we must agree with the Commission that all energy replacement costs incurred by the Appellee as a result of faulty resins must be borne by the utility and not the ratepayers. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court erred in vacating the Commission’s order in this respect.</p>
    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[221,885,1148,736]]]'>Finally, outages also occurred at the Peach Bottom Plant during 1983 and 1984. In 1983, cracking was discovered at several weld locations in piping at Peach Bottom Unit 3. The Appellee did reinforce the designated welds but the NRC nevertheless delayed restart authorization for several weeks. The Commission disallowed approximately $2 million in requested energy replacement costs over a seven day period because of the Appellee’s failure to timely submit a necessary affidavit. The Commonwealth Court vacated this disallowance based upon its perception of the Commission’s improper designation of the applicable standard of care. Because we find no fault in the Commission’s standard of care, we must reverse the Commonwealth Court with respect to these energy replacement costs.</p>
    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[220,1644,1147,523]]]'>In 1984, a second outage occurred at Peach Bottom, this time in Unit 2. Contrary to the Commission’s findings, the problem in Unit 2 involved a gasket leak not cracks in the fuel pool gates. Since the problems in both units were distinct, the Commission erred in disallowing the energy replacement costs for the period of time necessary to make repairs to an unforeseeable period. The Commission’s findings are not supported by substantial evidence, therefore Commonwealth Court correctly vacated the Commission’s order with respect to this request.</p>

Substantial evidence was presented to the Commission to establish that the shellfish infestation could have been corrected by sequential flushing of the unit’s component parts rather than a complete shutting down of the entire unit. Accordingly, we agree with the Commission’s conclusion that the energy replacement costs incurred as a result of the shellfish infestation could not be charged to the ratepayers.</p>
