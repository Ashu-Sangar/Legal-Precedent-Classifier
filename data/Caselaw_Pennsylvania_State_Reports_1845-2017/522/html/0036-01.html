    <p id="b165-9" data-blocks='[["BL_165.9",165,[176,1141,1148,365]]]'>This appeal requires us to interpret Pa.R.Crim.P. 229 in reviewing the propriety of amending a criminal complaint at trial to include victims of assault who were not named in the original complaint. The trial court allowed the amendment on the ground that appellant was not surprised or prejudiced by the addition of new victims, and appellant was convicted. We reverse, due to violation of Rule 229.</p>
    <p id="b165-10" data-blocks='[["BL_165.10",165,[176,1529,1148,742]]]'>The appellant, Frank DeSumma, was offended one evening by the inconsiderate driving of Frank O'Hara, who cut him off in traffic. Appellant exchanged angry words with O’Hara, then displayed a handgun, menacing O’Hara and his four passengers, while the two vehicles were proceeding side-by-side on the highway. After both drivers pulled off the highway, a police officer arrived and took statements of the parties. Appellant voluntarily surrendered his loaded handgun, which he was licensed to carry, and was then arrested and charged with simple assault upon O’Hara and recklessly endangering O’Hara, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 2701(a)(3) and 2705. Appellant was not charged with assaulting or endangering the four passengers, though their names were available in the police report.</p>

None of the <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>passengers appeared at the hearing. The Commonwealth established a prima facie case through O’Hara’s testimony that appellant pointed a gun at him while both were driving their cars, and by the officer reading his report into the record, including the portion identifying the four passengers.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[254,665,1151,948]]]'>Before appellant’s trial, however, O’Hara disappeared and could not be subpoenaed to testify for the Commonwealth. One of the passengers, Michelle Sharper, was available and was summoned to testify. Due to O’Hara’s absence, the Commonwealth moved to amend the information to add the names of the four passengers, requesting that the first count charge appellant with assaulting O’Hara <em>and </em>four named passengers and the second count charge appellant with recklessly endangering O’Hara <em>and </em>four named passengers. Because the four passengers had been identified by name at the preliminary hearing, the trial court granted the motion, reasoning that appellant could not claim surprise and that the amendment did not prejudice him in any way. The court categorically refused, however, to add counts naming individual passengers in the additional counts. Over appellant’s objection, he was tried on the amended two-count complaint, wherein each count named five victims instead of one.</p>

The same is true of simple assault, prohibited by 18 Pa.C.S. § 2701(a)(3), which states that a person commits assault if he “attempts by physical menace to put <em>another </em>in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.” (Emphasis added.)

The latter, in fact, constitutes five separate offenses against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth.

      <em>Frisbie </em>allows for <em>separate </em>offenses (and sentences) to be rendered against a criminal actor who injures multiple victims with a single act in certain crimes. The specific issue in <em>Frisbie </em>was “whether the legislature intended that each injury constitute a <em>separate </em>offense.” The decision there held that, as to the crime of recklessly endangering another person, “a <em>separate </em>offense is committed for each individual person placed in danger.” 485 A.2d at 1100 (emphasis added in each quotation). The Majority rightly indicates that similar results would obtain for the crimes of arson and assault and concludes from this analysis that “the number of offenses depends on the number of victims rather than on the number of acts committed by the defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b169-10" data-blocks='[["BL_169.11",169,[165,2206,1146,150]]]'>As to Rule 229, which controls amendments to information, there is a prohibition against charging “an additional or different offense.” The Rule is clear on this point.</p>

      <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>Hypothetically, therefore, the Commonwealth in the instant case could have charged the Appellant with five counts each of the offenses. <em>Frisbie </em>would have validated that procedure. Also, hypothetically, if the Commonwealth, in its amendment, had added an offense or charged a different offense, Rule 229 would have been offended.</p>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[245,624,1147,458]]]'>That, however, is not what happened here. The Commonwealth did not add any separate offenses in its amendment. Appellant remained charged with one count each of recklessly endangering another person and assault throughout the entire judicial process. That the Commonwealth earlier could have increased the counts of each crime to coincide with the number of victims is clear under <em>Frisbie. </em>For whatever reason, that course was not chosen by the prosecution.</p>

    <p id="b170-7" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[241,1330,1147,254]]]'>The Majority’s fatal confusion lies in its incorrect assumption that by listing the names of the other victims in the car, the Commonwealth automatically was putting on additional charges as defined by <em>Frisbie </em>and in violation of Rule 229. That assessment is wrong.</p>
    <p id="b170-8" data-blocks='[["BL_170.7",170,[239,1602,1147,357]]]'>The correct focus should follow the Superior Court’s argument that, at least under its own cases, the amendment worked an irreparable prejudice by forcing the Appellant to prepare a defense without adequate notice or sufficient time. That is the only issue in this case, and it is noteworthy that <em>Frisbie, </em>decided three years earlier, played no role in the decisions or dissent of the courts below.</p>

Prior to the amendments, at the preliminary hearing, he was fully informed of the fact that there were other frightened passengers in the car. He knew at that point that he had committed the crimes against some person or persons. The Commonwealth’s failure to charge him with <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>separate offenses for each party is not germane. At trial he remained charged with one offense each underlying both the original and amended information.
