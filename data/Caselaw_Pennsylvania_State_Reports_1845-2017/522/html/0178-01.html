The orders reversed by the Commonwealth Court had prohibited Appellee, the Moon Area School District, from collecting a nonresidential patron parking tax from Appellant, Grant Oliver Corporation. The orders reversed by the Commonwealth Court also had denied the School District’s petition to have released to it tax funds already collected but escrowed by Grant Oliver Corporation. Grant Oliver Corporation is the managing operator of parking lots owned by Appellant, Allegheny County, and located adjacent to the County owned Greater Pittsburgh International Airport (which is also located in the Moon Area School District).

On March 26,1979, pursuant to the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6901 <em>et seq., </em>the Moon Area School District adopted Resolution 79-2, which imposed a 15% tax on the fees paid by patrons of nonresidential parking lots located within the School District. Responsibility for collecting the tax, and making the necessary returns to the School District, is imposed upon the <em>operators </em>of each such non-residential parking lot who are entitled to retain 2% as compensation for their collecting duties. Resolution 79-2 specifies that an operator is any person who collects the parking charge from a patron and includes any governmental body, governmental subdivision, municipal corporation, public authority, non-profit corporation or any person performing as their agent. The Resolution provides that operators are to file monthly tax returns and pay over the taxes collected to the School District. The assessment of penalties, interest and liquidated damages for non-compliance, as well as criminal penalties, is also provided.</p>

Subsequently, the parties agreed (and the trial court ordered) that the Petitioners, including Grant Oliver Corporation, withdraw their challenge to the propriety of the School District’s adoption of Resolution 79-2 in exchange for which the School District agreed to withdraw a challenge to the supersedeas until thirty days after the trial court’s decision on the merits.</p>

In this complaint, the School District demanded by way of relief that Grant Oliver Corporation do the following: file an accounting of all nonresidential parking transactions from April 25, 1979 to that date; <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>file an accounting and pay over to the School District all tax monies collected during the period including penalties, interest and consequential and liquidated damages, and pay over any tax monies collected as a set-off against any amount actually owed and to be determined.

The first was whether the School District should be estopped from giving retroactive effect to our determination that the tax was legal because during the pendency of the appeals in that litigation they took no positive steps to lift either the supersedeas or the trial court injunction against collection. The trial court determined that Grant Oliver Corporation, during part of the period in question (when it operated under the “Concession Agreement”) was an independent contractor and therefore subject to the requirement to collect the tax. However, the trial court determined that the School District had not acted to have either the supersedeas or the injunction stricken and therefore that they had waived their right to do so under Pa.R.A.P. 1732(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial court further determined that laches and equitable estoppel precluded the School District’s claim for the collection of the taxes covered during the period 1979-1982.</p>

However, the trial court found that under the “Management Agreement” of October 30, 1981, the County had reserved and exercised such a degree of control over the ongoing operation of its parking lots sufficient to make Grant Oliver Corporation the County’s “agent,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> thereby sharing in the immunity of the County from the obligation to <em>collect </em>the School District’s parking tax in accordance with this Court’s ruling in <em>Borough of Wilkinsburg v.

The Commonwealth Court also found that the trial court erred in applying Pa.R.A.P. 1732(a) and erred in hence concluding that the School District waived the right to strike the supersedeas and the injunction. The Commonwealth Court’s conclusion was based on a reading of Pa.R.A.P. 1736(b) which provides for a self-executing supersedeas of the trial court’s entire order when the School District entered this appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

We held that without expressed statutory consent, a municipality could not impose upon the Commonwealth itself the duty of collecting a tax levied by the municipality, and by the same token it could not, without express legislative permission, impose such a duty upon any other political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth. <a href="/citations/?q=74%20A.2d%20138" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="74 A.2d 138">74 A.2d, at 139</a>. We reaffirm that holding today. Contrary to the reasoning of the Commonwealth Court in this case, the reason for the rule in <em>Borough of Wilkinsburg </em>does not rest solely or even principally on the premise that one political body lacks the inherent power to command another political body of equal or greater stature to perform an act, such as collecting taxes. Nor is the rule limited only to those situations where one political subdivision seeks to force another political subdivision, <em>at the latter’s own expense, </em>to collect the former’s tax, as the Commonwealth Court thought.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The rule in <em>Borough of Wilkinsburg </em>is based on broader considerations. At bottom, it is a rule designed to insure the orderly conduct of business and public affairs between and amongst the various governmental agencies in the Commonwealth and to prevent needless, wasteful and time-consuming controversies arising when one agency or political subdivision decides to challenge another. The instant case is a perfect example of the evil the rule is designed to avoid. This matter has been contested for almost ten years. It has twice been before this Court. Excessive judicial resources have been devoted to the matter and excessive public funds <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>have been spent in order to litigate it. All this could have been avoided if the rule in <em>Borough of Wilkinsburg </em>had been more carefully followed. In short, we conclude that the School District here had no authority to impose the duty to collect their parking tax on Allegheny County. But the question remains as to whether Grant Oliver Corporation is protected by the County’s “immunity” in the matter. We find that it is.</p>

In the Nineteenth Century, state action and private action were concepts clearly distinct and separate.

Construing the exception to the Liquid Fuels Tax Act, 72 P.S. § 2611d, whereby a tax was imposed on liquid fuels delivered within the state, <em>excepting </em>liquid fuels delivered to a <em>political subdivision </em>of the Commonwealth, this Court held that the political subdivision exception applied to the management company because a political subdivision necessarily included not only the political subdivision itself, but any “integral part of a political subdivision.” <a href="/pa/484/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="484 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1753704" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0060-01">484 Pa., at 65</a>, <a href="/pa/484/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="484 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1753704" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0060-01">398 A.2d 942</a>.

    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.4",320,[273,486,1148,1066]]]'>Paragraph “26” of the Concession Agreement gave the County the right of revocation on a number of grounds including situations where the County determined that the agreement had become “contrary and detrimental to the interest of County or the public interest and welfare.” (R. 758a). Paragraph “31” makes Grant Oliver Corporation subject to county rules and regulations both new and existing. (R. 758a-759a). In short, the County retained the right to dictate the services rendered, to set the prices for such services, to approve of signs, to determine hours and days of operation, to require repairs, to approve alterations, to inspect at any time, to control the demeanor, conduct and appearance of workers, to revoke easily and to impose additional rules and regulations. It is clear to us that under <em>Feller, supra, </em>the County retained the right and authority to interfere and control Grant Oliver Corporation’s operation of the parking lot. The new “Management Agreement” of October 30, 1981, gave the County even more extensive and detailed rights. The changes were summarized in the trial court opinion as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[311,1567,1107,688]]]'>In 1981, the parties concluded a new 57-page management agreement. This agreement, which remains in force through the present, is much more detailed and provides for significantly more control by the County over Grant Oliver’s daily activities. Indeed, according to Mr. Donahoe, the County’s Director of the Department of Aviation, increased control was the primary reason for changing the contract. Mr. Donahoe, upon taking office in 1980, recommended that the County assume a more active role in the operation of the airport lots in order to maximize revenues and improve operations. To accomplish this, he suggested that Grant Oliver be made a manager rather than a concessionaire.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b320-6" data-blocks='[["BL_320.6",320,[311,2271,1102,97]],["BL_321.1",321,[238,316,1106,954]]]'>Under the terms of the management agreement, the County received between 95-97% of revenues and pays <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>95-97% of expenses. Grant Oliver is paid an administrative fee and a percentage based on overall revenues. Various provisions demonstrate that the County foresaw an active role for itself in the operation of its parking lots. The County determines not only the parking rates in effect, but also the type of parking services to be provided and the amount of space available for parking. It establishes accounting and revenue control procedures. It may specify the number of employees necessary and has a right of approval of the full-time supervisor chosen by Grant Oliver. The County retains a unilateral right of termination. While the concession agreement contained some of the same or similar provisions, the management agreement is much more detailed. From both the testimony presented and the agreement itself, it is obvious that the County took significant strides toward tightening its oversight of all aspects of the parking lot operation when the 1981 agreement was drafted.</blockquote>
