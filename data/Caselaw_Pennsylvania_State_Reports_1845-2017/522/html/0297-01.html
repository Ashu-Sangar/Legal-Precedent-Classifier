A second individual later identified as Henry Brown, the owner of the vehicle, was observed but eluded the police.

At trial, five witnesses testified that they saw an automobile matching Brown’s in the Cannonsburg area during the day in question, at the time of the robbery. Four of them later identified Brown’s car as the one they saw that day, from a number of cars parked at the Washington State Police Barracks. Also, three gave descriptions of the two occupants of the car they saw which matched the general characteristics of the appellant and Brown. Two other witnesses testified that they had observed two individuals having the same general characteristics as the appellant and Brown, running from Carl’s Cleaners right before the killings were discovered. Further, these witnesses testified that the individual matching the appellant, was wearing a tan knee-length trench coat, similar to the one owned <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>by the appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">8</a> One of these witnesses also testified the individuals he saw running from the cleaners were carrying handguns.</p>

She also testified that the two left together that day in Brown’s car and that she did not see either until Brown returned on the evening of August 20, 1979.</p>

Trooper Bivens testified he was present when the autopsies were performed and that when the bullet slugs were removed, they were turned over to him and that he took them to the Greensburg State Police (Crime) Laboratory.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">9</a> Trooper Daryl Mayfield of the Greensburg State Police (Crime) Laboratory, who was admitted as an expert in ballistics, testified that he received three bullet slugs from Trooper Bivens and after examining each, determined all three to be .32 caliber bullet slugs and further that all three were fired from the same gun.

Brown testified that around 1:00 P.M. on August 17, 1979, he and the appellant left Wheeling, West Virginia, in his car and headed towards Pittsburgh. He testified that on the way they spotted an exit for Cannonsburg and took it so they could “make a couple extra dollars.” He testified he had a .38 caliber handgun and the appellant had a .32 caliber handgun and that the appellant was wearing a beige trenchcoat. He then testified that once inside Cannons-burg, they spotted a cleaners and after circling it and seeing only one girl working, they decided to park and go in. He testified that upon entering they asked for a price list and when the girl bent down they pulled out their guns. He stated further that the appellant went into the back to make sure no one else was there. He testified that while he was emptying the cash register he heard a gun shot and when he looked back, he saw an old man holding his stomach and then saw the appellant shoot him in the back, “before he could hit the ground.” N.T., Third Trial, p. 613. He said that the appellant then came back, asked him to shot the girl and that he refused. He then testified, referring to the appellant, “at that point he didn’t hesitate, he just shot — ” N.T., Third Trial, p. 614.

In reviewing the evidence it is necessary to keep in mind that at this trial the only defendant was this appellant. What Brown told Johnson was therefore hearsay evidence as against this appellant and therefore not admissible by whoever would offer it. Certainly what Brown told her could not be used to inculpate the appellant and nothing that Brown told her was told to the jury. Were the statement allowed it not only would have inculpated Wallace and Brown in this murder and robbery but was fraught with other crimes that would not be admissible against the appellant. Hence her testimony was carefully restricted circumstantial evidence, and not the direct inculpation contained in Brown’s alleged statement to her. The statement takes a different turn, however, where the uses are to impeach the testimony of Brown. Brown <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>did directly inculpate himself and Wallace at trial. He said Wallace shot both victims.

The appellant asserts that Brown’s testimony was coerced by the prosecution, thus his right to due process, under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution, were violated. Specifically he claims that Brown’s testimony was obtained in violation of Rules 321, 1410 and, 1501 thru 1507, of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, which govern guilty pleas, sentencing and post-conviction relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (P.C.H.A.).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">16</a> The appellant does not allege that the witness lied. The record reveals that every aspect of the bargain between Brown and the prosecution was presented to the jury in painstaking detail and that nothing was hidden from their scrutiny. Thus the admission of Brown’s testimony was harmless. Further the appellant lacks standing to challenge the guilty plea or plea bargain. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In exchange for his truthful testimony against the appellant, the Commonwealth had agreed not to seek the death penalty against the hired killer. The Superior Court held that the appellant had no standing to challenge the guilty plea or plea bargain, and that the witness’ testimony could not be excluded without a showing that the appellant’s constitutional rights had been violated.</p>

The prosecutor in this case engaged in the deliberate manipulation of the judicial process to secure testimony from a witness in exchange for a plea bargain long past the time when plea negotiations were properly within his discretion. The PCHA proceeding was a subterfuge intended to regain an advantage lost when Brown would not comply with the conditions contemplated in the original offer of a plea bargain. Shared regrets by the prosecutor and witness do not justify such action. It was admitted that the district attorney’s office had even approached the State Pardons Board to find a way to negotiate a plea bargain with Brown. The patent misuse of the PCHA procedure by the prosecutor to ensure Brown’s testimony was misconduct which renders the testimony inadmissible and would require a new trial.</p>

The right to be protected is the defendant’s right to a fair trial. It is not enough then to say simply that the jury knew what was promised to Brown in exchange for his testimony.</p>

Judge Bell did not testify and determined that recusal was unnecessary. The district attorney advised Judge Bell of his intention to present the petition to President Judge Gladden.</p>
