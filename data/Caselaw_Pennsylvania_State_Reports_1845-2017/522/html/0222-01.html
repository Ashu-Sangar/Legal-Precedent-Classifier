Following these acts of violence, the rapist then unsuccessfully attempted to start the car, and while he wiped his fingerprints from the interior of the car, the victim escaped. She ran to her car in the parking lot, drove to her apartment and called the police.</p>

She assisted the police in preparing a composite drawing of the assailant and gave police a drawing which she herself had made.</p>

She stated that she was “almost positive” she would remember him if she saw him again.

Four days after that, she was shown a different selection of eight photographs, including an older photograph of Romanelli. Again, she identified Romanelli as the assailant. Subsequently, Romanelli was tried by a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Criminal Division, and convicted of rape, unlawful restraint, indecent assault, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, simple assault, and possession of instruments of crime.</p>

The victim, therefore, was permitted to testify as to information she had given police prior to hypnosis and to identify Romanelli as the rapist, but the court suppressed all of the victim's testimony “insofar as it relate[d] to those matters in the hypnotic interview which were not previously referred to or stated by her to have occurred in any statement or interview given by [the victim] prior to being hypnotized on June 8, 1981.”</p>

Furthermore, the hypnotic subject, upon awakening, is often imbued with a confidence and conviction as to his memory which was not present before. Prehypnosis uncertainty becomes molded, in light of additional recall experienced under hypnosis, into certitude, with the subject unaware of any suggestions that he acted upon or any confabulation in which he engaged. The subject’s firm belief in the veracity of his enhanced recollection is honestly held, and cannot be undermined through cross-examination. As one learned scholar observed, “The nature of hypnosis is such that the subject’s critical judgment is suspended and he responds to the demand for exact, photographic recall even when his actual recall is vague and doubtful.”</blockquote>

(Citations omitted.) Thus, we require the safeguards set out in <em>Smoyer </em>any time a witness has been hypnotized because of the danger that the witness, although he is testifying as to that which was stated <em>prior </em>to hypnosis, may have been influenced by the hypnotist, even as to those matters that preceded hypnosis. Here, the need for a neutral hypnotist is even more apparent, for the witness in the instant case testified not only to prior statements, but also to a present application of a past description.</p>

It is perhaps true that a hypnotist employed by the police cannot, by virtue of his employment, give the appearance of being as neutral as a private practitioner. We are, however, unwilling to formulate a <em>per se </em>rule that police hypnotists are not neutral, but instead, prefer to examine the facts of each case. Where, as here, a tape recording of the entire hypnotic <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>session is made and the trial court determines that the session was conducted non-suggestively, the neutrality requirement has been met. The purpose of neutrality, after all, is to ensure that the hypnosis be conducted in a non-suggestive environment. Once it is determined that the environment was, in fact, nonsuggestive, the purpose of the requirement has been met.</p>

Romanelli contends, however, that since the identification was made <em>after </em>an hypnosis, it was the product of confusion and confabulation. He also asserts that the inability of the Commonwealth to produce the photographic display denied him the opportunity to establish this claim by proving that his photo was included in the original 736 photos which the victim viewed, and that she failed to recognize him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

And if the identification was not pro<a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>duced by hypnosis, then the case is in the same posture as any other case in which there has been an identification from one photo array following other photo arrays in which no identification was made.
