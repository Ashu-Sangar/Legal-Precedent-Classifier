Code Section 989.05. The Board’s denial of a variance in appellants’ second appeal was partially based on the lack of access to the remote parking stalls. In the interim appellants had attempted to cure this deficiency with a stairway and walkway following authorization by City Council. For these reasons, fidelity to the rule requiring that <em>res judicata </em>be applied sparingly in zoning matters constrains us to decline to apply the doctrine here where there is minimal identity as to the causes of action as compared with those previous. <em>Schubach; </em>However, we note that the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>subsumes the more modern doctrine of issue preclusion which forecloses re-litigation in a later action, of an issue of fact or law which was actually litigated and which was necessary to the original judgment. <em>Clark v.
