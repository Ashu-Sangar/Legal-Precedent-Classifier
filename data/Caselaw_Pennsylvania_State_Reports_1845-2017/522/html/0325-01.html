That they offered no consideration for his release is of no moment, because he included them to obtain a settlement for which he received consideration. The question is, does the wife, not a signatory to the agreement, have an independent right to sue for the injury done her. We answer that she does. The suit was commenced by her husband and she joined to enforce her rights; hence the rule of procedure was followed, the action was brought in a single action. Pa.R.C.P. 2228(a), <em>supra. </em>That the husband cannot prevail by reason of his settlement and may be dismissed is of .no matter if the wife has an independent cause of action. In <em>Hopkins v.
