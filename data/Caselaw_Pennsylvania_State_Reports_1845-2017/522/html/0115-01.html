The first of these comments concerned appellee’s attempt to account for the large amount of cash found and seized during the search of his residence. The officers executing the search warrant found approximately $33,000 in cash in appellee’s bedroom. Appellee testified that he had saved <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>this large sum of money in spite of the fact that he had been employed for only two out of the preceding ten years and that his only income for the five years preceding his arrest was a $900 per month disability check with which he supported himself, his unemployed wife and daughter. The prosecutor argued in closing that it was “just unbelievable, incredible” that appellee could save this $33,000 under these circumstances. Appellee asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to this comment, but there is no merit to this assertion because it <em>is </em>unbelievable that appellee, who was supporting his family on the disability income, could save $33,000 in cash.</p>
    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[263,938,1150,1090]]]'>The second comment that Superior Court found to be improper involved appellee’s defense to the charge of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver. Twenty-six pounds of marijuana packaged in one pound bags was seized during the search of appellee’s residence. Appellee testified that he grew this marijuana for his personal use and that he planted a new crop every year. He further testified that he smoked 40 marijuana cigarettes a day. A state trooper testified that 27,000 cigarettes could be made from 26 pounds of marijuana. The prosecutor argued during closing that it was “totally unbelievable” that appellee smoked 40 marijuana cigarettes a day and that the 26 pounds of marijuana found at appellee’s residence was for his personal use, because this quantity of marijuana would last for years even at the rate of 40 cigarettes a day. Appellee asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to this comment.

The prosecutor argued in closing that it was “not in anyway believable” that a person would pay $150 to a total stranger for a scale that might not work. Appellee asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to this comment. There is no merit to this assertion, because it <em>is </em>“not in anyway believable” that appellee, who was living on a limited income, would purchase a potentially honworking scale for $150.</p>

On November 8, 1980, (one year and three months prior to the search that gave rise to the convictions leading to the present appeal) appellee reported to the Gallitzin Borough police that his residence had been burglarized.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellee claimed that the stolen items included a .12 gauge Fox shotgun, a .44 Magnum Winchester rifle, a .22 semi-automatic Colt pistol, a .45 caliber Thompson center flintlock pistol, and a .54 caliber Thompson center flintlock rifle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The police chief, who had investigated the alleged burglary, testified that appellee had provided the police with the serial numbers to the .12 guage Fox shotgun and the .44 Magnum Winchester rifle that appellee alleged had been stolen from his residence. These serial numbers matched the serial numbers on the .12 gauge Fox shotgun and .44 Magnum Winchester rifle that were seized during the search of appellee’s residence which took place in January of 1982, and which gave rise to the convictions leading to the present appeal. Appellee testified that he had not given <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>serial numbers to the police when he reported the burglary at his residence, and that the police could only have obtained the serial numbers after the guns were seized during the search which led to appellee’s present arrest. The prosecutor argued in closing that appellee’s accusation that the police chief was lying in this regard was “unbelievable.” Appellee asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to this comment. There is no merit to this assertion, because it <em>is </em>unbelievable that the serial numbers appearing in the November, 1980, police report would have been obtained during the present search, in that the present search was conducted more than one year <em>after </em>the report was filed.</p>

He further testified that he found the gun several weeks after the burglary, under his couch. He did not report to the police or to his insurance company that the .12 gauge Smith and Wesson shotgun had been recovered, and he justified his failure to do so on the ground that the insurance proceeds had not completely covered his losses. The prosecutor argued in closing that it was “totally unbelievable” that a burglar would take this shotgun and hide it under the couch. Appellee now asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor’s comment. There is no merit to this assertion, because it <em>is </em>unbelieva<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>ble that a burglar would not remove the shotgun from appellee's residence with the other items stolen and would, in fact, hide appellee’s shotgun under his couch (especially in view of appellee’s reports to the police and to the insurance company).</p>

We have recognized that it is no abuse of discretion for a trial court to refuse to declare a mistrial where the remarks of the prosecutor are inspired in part by the conduct of defense counsel. <em>Commonwealth v. Stoltzfus, <a href="/pa/462/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="462 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="485206" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0043-01">supra.</a> </em>Although two wrongs do not make a right, otherwise improper comments of the prosecutor are permissible when they merely counter the arguments made by defense counsel, in that such commentary would not have the unavoidable effect of prejudicing the jury.</p>

Suffice it to say counsel is there to present evidence not to testify as to its credibility. There is a major difference, however, between offering one’s personal belief and arguing that evidence is unbelievable as offered by a witness. Indeed, it is counsel’s function to comment, criticize, expose the content of the evidence of a witness to its own inconsistency, improbability, interest, conflict with other evidence, physical, chemicals, the common sense of the occasion and any other epistemological defect. So long as he does not offer it as true because he personally believes it to be true, his argument has few limits in the search for truth. Absent such a valuation by counsel; that evidence or testimony is true because he believes it, he may argue from literature, history, analogy, examples of universal experience on questions of what is to be believed by ordinary sensible men and women in matters of importance in their own lives. All of which is the function of jurors and the purpose of argument. I join the majority.</p>
