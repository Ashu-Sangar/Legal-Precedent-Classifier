It raises the question of whether the limitations period is extended by a statute that bars suit on certain contracts during the first ninety days after payment is due thereon. The Commonwealth Court held that the limitations period is not extended in these circumstances, but that it runs from the date of breach. We think that this is unjust and contrary to the law in Pennsylvania and the law as applied across the country.</p>

AGI, the general contractor, then contracted with Appellant, Centre Concrete Company, to provide raw materials for use in the project. The final delivery date of the materials supplied by Appellant was October 21, 1982. The amount AGI owed for the materials was in excess of $26,000.00 and this debt was never paid. Appellee, Insurance Company of North America (“INA”) was the surety for AGI, the general contractor.

It may sometimes be difficult to determine at just what point in time an injury has occurred or a duty has been breached. See, <em>Sicola v. First National Bank of Altoona, </em><a href="/pa/404/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="404 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="1301472" data-case-paths="/pa/404/0018-01">404 Pa. 18</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.2d%20584" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="170 A.2d 584">170 A.2d 584</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.L.R.%202d%201044" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="87 A.L.R. 2d 1044">87 A.L.R.2d 1044</a> (1961). Nonetheless, at whatever point in time the wrong was completed, the wronged party’s cause of action ordinarily accrues at that point in time, and the statute of limitations <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>begins to run therefrom. That cannot be the case, however, where, as here, even though the wrong has been done, the aggrieved party must, by statute, wait some period of time (and sometimes also make a formal demand or perform some other act) before being granted access to the courts. One does not have the “right” to institute a suit if, by statute, the courts cannot hear it. The contrary result would be unfair and unjust and would undermine the intent of the legislature to provide a fixed period of time within which suits may be brought, free of unexpected and unforeseeable shrinkage. In this connection, see, <em>Bond v. Gallen, </em><a href="/pa/503/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="469 A.2d 556" data-case-ids="1785891" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0286-01">469 A.2d 556</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="469 A.2d 556" data-case-ids="1785891" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0286-01">503 Pa. 286</a> (1983).</p>

We held that the statute of limitations for suits under the Act began to rum from the date when the $750 expense requirement was met rather than from the dáte of the accident. But <em>Bond </em>rested on two factors which are not present in this case. First, under the No-Fault Act, there was no cause of action until the $750 threshold was met. Here, the statute delays the time when a suit may first be brought, but it does not expressly deal with the accrual of the cause of action.

They rely on conventional rules under the statute of limitations. Those rules declare that the terms of a contract, including terms which expressly establish conditions precedent to bringing suit, determine when a cause of action accrues. In this case there was no express <em>contractual </em>condition precedent to Centre’s suit. The pertinent rule declares that Centre’s cause of action accrued when it completed its performance under the contract, in October, 1982. The interposition of a statutory ninety day waiting period is not the equivalent of a similar, express condition in a private contract.</p>
