The questionnaire was dated May 14, 1986, and although no specific dates were given for the alleged discriminatory events, they could have occurred no later than May 8, 1986, when Tyrone Lewis transferred from the school. A complaint containing these same allegations, verified on November 13, 1986, was mailed to the Commission on November 24, 1986, and received a day later. It was also served on the School District on November 25, 1986.</p>

At the time, Section 9(g) of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, Act of December 27, 1965, P.L. 1225, as amended, 43 P.S. § 959(g), provided that “[a]ny complaint filed pursuant to this section must be so filed within ninety days after the alleged act of discrimination.” A heading officer denied the motion, citing 16 Pa.Code § 42.11(d), which provides that “complaints that do not fully conform with § 42.31 ... will be considered filed on the date received by the Commission but may be quashed at the discretion of the Commission if such non-conformity is not remedied by amendment or otherwise within a reasonable <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>time.” The hearing officer treated the questionnaire as an unverified complaint, the lack of verification having been “corrected” within a reasonable time by the filing of the complaint form in November. Since the Commission received the questionnaire within 90 days of the last possible incident of alleged discrimination, the complaint was deemed timely filed.</p>

Tyrone Lewis, a minor, was transferred by Sandra Lewis, his mother, to a desegregation school (the Austin Meehan Middle School) in the School District for the 1985-1986 school year. On May 8, 1986, Tyrone was transferred out of the Austin Meehan School by his mother. On July 1, 1986, Mrs. Lewis filed an <em>unverified </em>complaint on behalf of Tyrone with the Commission alleging that Tyrone was discriminated against by the school on the basis of his race, which is black.</p>

The School District filed an answer along with a motion to dismiss the complaint as untimely filed, on May 29, 1987. The motion to dismiss was based on the fact that the <em>verified </em>complaint was filed approximately six months after the last possible date of the alleged acts of discrimination (when Tyrone was transferred from the Austin Meehan School) which was beyond the 90 day filing period required under Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (the Act) 1955, Oct. 27, P.L. 744 § 1; 1961, Feb. 28, P.L. 47 § 1, 43 P.S. 951 et seq.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On August 27, 1987, the Commission issued an interlocutory order denying the School District’s motion to dismiss.</p>

Therefore, in keeping with the legislative mandate that the provisions of the act shall be liberally construed to give effect to their purpose, 43 P.S. § 962(a), we find that the failure of Mrs. Lewis to conform to the verification requirement was cured by the filing, within a reasonable time, of the second verified complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

A number of federal court decisions involving the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) support the conclusion that the lack of verification is not a jurisdictional defect but a technical defect that can be cured by amendment. <em>See, Weeks v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em><a href="/f2d/408/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="408 F.2d 228" data-case-ids="2203368" data-case-paths="/f2d/408/0228-01">408 F.2d 228</a> (5th Cir.1969) (complaint that was timely filed could be amended after the running of the statutory filing period to include the necessary verification), <em>Roberson v. Great American Insurance Companies, </em><a href="/frd/48/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="48 F.R.D. 404" data-case-ids="3705276" data-case-paths="/frd/48/0404-01">48 F.R.D. 404</a> (D.Ga.1969) (verification requirement is an administrative rather than judicial feature of the statute), <em>Bremer v.

These cases provide guidance not only because this Court has characterized title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as the "federal analogue” to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, <em>See, General Electric Corp. v. Commonwealth, Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, </em><a href="/pa/469/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="469 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="1722138" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0292-01">469 Pa. 292</a>, <a href="/pa/469/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="365 A.2d 649" data-case-ids="1722115,1722138" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0291-01,/pa/469/0292-01">365 A.2d 649</a> (1976), but also because the federal statute, like our state statute, requires complaints to be under oath.</p>
