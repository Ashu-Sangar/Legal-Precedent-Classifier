The plaintiff’s complaint identified PSMI and Travelers as the two potential alternate sources of those benefits.

      <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>The Superior Court concluded that those sections required all motor vehicles registered in the Commonwealth to carry insurance providing coverage for basic loss benefits. Reasoning that a contract providing such coverage was imposed by law under those statutory provisions, the Superior Court held that the absence of a specific contractual provision providing the coverage or the failure to collect an additional premium therefor could not override the statutory provisions of the No-Fault Act. Because an administrative agency may not promulgate regulations contrary to the legislative intent expressed in the statutory provisions, the Superior Court held that the Insurance Department’s regulation was not controlling for the same reason.</p>
