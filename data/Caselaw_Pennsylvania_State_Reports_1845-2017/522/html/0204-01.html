Further, all of the provisions in sections 13(b) through (f) relating to businesses that engage in the practice of architecture expressly condition such practice upon compliance with stated ownership and control requirements. For example, section 13(e) states, “A business corporation may engage in the practice of architecture in Pennsylvania, Provided, That it ... satisfies the following requirements____” This language plainly conditions the practice of architecture upon compliance with certain requirements, and there is no basis for regarding the “requirements” as mere optional standards. Comparable language, of a mandatory nature, is found in provisions governing other types of businesses, such as partnerships and professional associations, that engage in the practice of architecture. 63 P.S. § 34.13(b), (c). Appellants concede that they do not meet these requirements, but contend that the requirements are <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>applicable only to firms that call themselves “architectural firms.” There is no basis in the statute for distinguishing between firms that denominate themselves as architectural firms and those that do not. The requirements are expressly applicable to all firms that “engage in the practice of architecture.” <em>Id. </em>Likewise, section 18(b) of the statute provides, <em>“[N]o </em>partnership, professional association or corporation shall engage in the practice or offer to engage in the practice of architecture ... unless such partnership, professional association or corporation <em>complies with section 13.” </em>63 P.S. § 34.18(b) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>

It would place firms that call themselves architectural firms under stringent ownership and control measures, but would allow many others to offer architectural services without being subject to such controls. One can only imagine the range of businesses that would be free to offer architectural services. Ironically, it would be the firms with concentrated architectural expertise, which meet the statute’s ownership and control provisions and call themselves architectural firms, that would be subject to the greatest regulation. These firms would have to closely supervise the work of their architects pursuant to 63 P.S. § 34.13(g), supra. Meanwhile, other firms with less architectural expertise would be free to perform the same services, but, because they denominate themselves differently, would be free to offer unsupervised architectural services to the public. Given that the purpose of the Licensure Law is to protect the public safety, we cannot conceive of a justification for distinguishing between firms merely on the basis of what they choose to call themselves. Certainly, the legislature would not have concluded that firms having concentrated ownership and control by architects, which call themselves “architectural firms,” pose a greater danger to the public safety than do firms that practice architecture without the benefit of such ownership and control.</p>

The Legislature was certainly aware, when the Architects Licensure Law was enacted in 1982, that there were in existence at that time design and engineering firms which offered, as part of a comprehensive package of services to their clients, the architectural services of the architects on their staffs. Recognizing that the “public safety" was adequately protected by the statutory provisions which regulate engineers and engineering firms, 63 P.S. §§ 148-158, the Legislature permitted architects to provide architectural services, without restriction, when employed in firms that do not hold themselves out to the public as “architectural” firms. I do not find any language in the Architects Licensure Law that precludes the brokering of architectural services by nonarchitectural firms.</p>
