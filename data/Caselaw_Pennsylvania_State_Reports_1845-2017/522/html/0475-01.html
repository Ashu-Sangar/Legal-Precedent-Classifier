At approximately 1:00 p.m. on May 18, 1985, two men robbed the Wash &amp; Shop Laundromat in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania of over $1,200.00 in cash, including some $550.00 in quarters and $400.00 in dimes that had been placed in clear plastic bags, knotted at the top, by an employee of the Wash &amp; Shop, John Mangino. Mr. Mangino and his girlfriend, Ms. Terry Nelson, had been cleaning the laundromat, which was closed at that <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>time, when a man entered and demanded money upon threat of death to Ms. Nelson. The man’s face was mostly covered by a flannel shirt, but the victims saw that he was a white male with a blondish-brown mustache between twenty and thirty years old with muscular arms and wearing a grey sweatsuit and white sneakers. He had a fading tattoo on his left arm consisting of a round object with a dagger through it and something “curling” around the dagger, and he had a deep cut and/or scab on his right hand between his thumb and forefinger. The victims also noticed an odor of beer on the man's breath and believed him to be drunk. A second man, also with a shirt pulled over his head, waited outside the laundromat as a “lookout,” and took one of the plastic coin bags which the “inside” man handed him.</p>
    <p id="b606-4" data-blocks='[["BL_606.4",606,[280,1074,1149,416]]]'>Bellefonte police officers had observed appellant and William Shutt, his brother-in-law, in the vicinity of the laundromat shortly before the robbery. Appellant was intoxicated and was wearing a gray sweatsuit and white sneakers. Appellant also had/has a tattoo of a dagger with a serpent wrapped around it on his left forearm, and at the time of the robbery had a cut on his right hand between his thumb and forefinger.</p>
    <p id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.5",606,[279,1510,1148,465]]]'>On May 21, 1985, Bellefonte police officers searched the residence which appellant had been sharing with William Shutt and with his (appellant’s) sister, Debra Shutt, who consented to a search of the residence. In the attic, police discovered a clear plastic bag knotted at the top concealed in a metal chest. A subsequent search accompanied by search warrant led to the discovery of some fifteen coins in the residence and on the grounds outside, which coins were seized and admitted into evidence.</p>

Several pretrial motions, including a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, a suppression motion, a motion in limine to exclude the use of appellant’s prior criminal record to impeach his <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>credibility, and a discovery motion, were entertained and disposed of by the trial court, the Honorable David E. Grine.</p>

Trial counsel filed post-trial motions. Additionally, the court granted appellant’s request to appoint new counsel who filed additional post-trial motions raising, inter alia, issues concerning the effectiveness of representation by trial counsel. An evidentiary hearing and oral argument was held on the post-trial motions before Judge Grine, who denied same. Appellant was then sentenced to four and one-half to fifteen years imprisonment on the robbery conviction and to two to five years concurrent imprisonment for criminal conspiracy. (Presumably, the remaining convictions were held to have merged for sentencing purposes, or sentencing upon same was suspended.)</p>
