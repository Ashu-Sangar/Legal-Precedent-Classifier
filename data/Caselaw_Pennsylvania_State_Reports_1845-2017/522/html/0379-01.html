The park was hosting a free “Rap Music” concert, attended by several hundred youths. At approximately 7:30 p.m. violence erupted near the refreshment stand. Two gangs of youths, who had a previous altercation a few days earlier, began to fight. The fight escalated into the firing of shots by a youth later identified as Derrick Rush. Two teenagers were injured in the shooting. Joseph Gilliard, sixteen years of age, was shot in the ankle. A fourteen year old girl, Charlene Tyson, was shot in the abdomen, colon and spleen, <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>the bullet ultimately coming to rest in an inoperable position near her spine.

Thus the burden falls upon the Commonwealth to establish that the statutory prerequisite for transfer of jurisdiction to the adult criminal division of the court has been met. Such a finding demonstrates that the juvenile would not be amenable to the purpose that the Juvenile Act was designed to achieve. As we stated in <em>Greiner:</em>

      <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>The basic question presented is one requiring a determination as to the appropriate forum for the resolution of a dispute of this nature. By the new Juvenile Act, the legislature has, in no uncertain terms, made it clear that whenever possible its provisions should control in resolving matters pertaining to juveniles. While the Act envisions instances where its provisions would be inadequate and the more drastic remedies of the criminal court must be employed, it is equally clear that the preference was to treat the juvenile delinquent, whenever possible, in accordance with the procedures specially designed for the juvenile offender. In essence, the Act creates a presumption that the errant juvenile can best be supervised, directed and rehabilitated under its provisions absent evidence to the contrary. It therefore follows that the party raising the objection to the juvenile court’s jurisdiction must shoulder the burden of presenting evidence to establish those facts which would warrant the conclusion that in a given case the provisions of the Act are inappropriate. To hold otherwise would create the anomalous situation whereby the party in whose favor a legislative presumption has been created is called upon to offer the evidence to support the presumption. Such a concept would be at variance with the well established principle of the law of evidence that a presumption shifts not only the burden of proof, but also shifts the burden of coming forward with the evidence to establish the fact in issue. <em>See generally, </em>McCormick on Evidence, §§ 342-43 (2d Ed.1972); 9 Wigmore on Evidence, §§ 2490-91 (3d Ed. 1940).

Once inside, the youths disarmed the alarm and ransacked the home. Upon the arrival of the police, the youths scattered. Appellant was apprehended while hiding in the second floor of the home. The disposition of this incident resulted in the probation appellant was serving at the time of the instant adjudication. His school records reflect that during the probationary period appellant was absent from school at least fifty days. The probation began in March and the school term ended in June. The probation reports indicate that appellant lacked respect for authority and had a negative attitude, which did not improve during the period of probation preceding the instant adjudication.</p>

The court noted that Derrick Rush had been under the care and supervision of the juvenile system for almost six months prior to the shooting, and that during that time, the probation reports demonstrated that appellant’s attitude and behavior did not improve, and, in fact, worsened. In light of the severity of the crimes committed and the firm identifications of Derrick Rush by the witnesses and victim, we find no error in the court’s decision to transfer this matter to the adult court system.

Such an abuse of discretion is more than error in judgment. It is the misapplication of law, the exercise of unreasonable judgment, or a decision based on ill will, bias or prejudice. <em>Wade, <a href="/pa/485/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="485 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="1755604" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0453-01">supra.</a></em>

      <p id="b514-8" data-blocks='[["BL_514.7",514,[331,1920,1081,263]]]'>I. Where the legislature has mandated specific criteria to be considered in deciding whether or not to certify a juvenile for trial as an adult, may the Commonwealth omit the submission of any evidence whatsoever on those factors, and have certification affirmed by Superior Court, contrary to previous Superior Court Opinions, asserting a new standard of review "gross abuse of discretion."</p>
      <p id="b514-9" data-blocks='[["BL_514.8",514,[330,2194,1081,153]]]'>II. Where a defendant has properly requested a “lineup”, may the Commonwealth avoid such lineup by asserting that a witness was unable to identify anyone and thereafter, at trial, without notice to anyone, present that witness to make an identification.</p>

      <p id="b516-13" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[242,1709,1148,334]]]'>. Although the appellant frames his issues in terms of the Commonwealth’s burden of proof and the denial of the lineup request, in granting this appeal this Court was concerned as to whether the certifying court had explained its reasons for certification sufficiently to allow for meaningful appellate review. <em>See e.g., Kent v. U.S., </em><a href="/us/383/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="383 U.S. 541" data-case-ids="6172664" data-case-paths="/us/383/0541-01">383 U.S. 541</a>, <a href="/us/383/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="383 U.S. 541" data-case-ids="6172664" data-case-paths="/us/383/0541-01">86 S.Ct. 1045</a>, <a href="/us/383/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="383 U.S. 541" data-case-ids="6172664" data-case-paths="/us/383/0541-01">16 L.Ed.2d 84</a> (1966). After a careful review of the record, we are convinced that the certifying court stated its findings of nonamenability with sufficient specificity to allow our meaningful review.</p>
      <p id="b516-14" data-blocks='[["BL_516.7",516,[274,2050,1114,311]]]'>The records upon which the court made its findings, although not formally admitted into evidence, were made available to all parties, and argument was made by both the defense and prosecution from the information contained in the files. While there was some informality in the manner in which the hearing was conducted, we believe that the certification of appellant was supported by the record before the court, and that the reasons for the certification were properly stated by the court.</p>
