Appellee was tried and convicted in a non-jury trial before the Honorable Shad Connelly, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, on charges of indecent assault and corruption of minors. Post-trial motions were filed by Appellee and, upon <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>their denial, the trial court imposed a sentence of two and one-half to five years imprisonment on the corruption of minors charge, and a consecutive sentence of one to two years imprisonment on the indecent assault charge.</p>

Upon reviewing Appellee’s claims, the Superior Court concluded that insufficient evidence existed on the record before it to determine whether trial counsel’s conduct was effective and, therefore, it vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to conduct an evidentiary hearing into trial counsel’s decision not to interview these witnesses. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellee was charged with corrupting the morals of his four year old daughter and indecently assaulting her. At trial, Appellee’s wife testified that Appellee admitted to her that he had sexual contact with their daughter, and two police officers testified that on separate occasions Appellee made similar inculpatory statements to them.</p>
    <p id="b133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_133.6",133,[170,1373,1147,738]]]'>Appellee testified in his own defense maintaining his innocence and alleging that the incriminating statements made to his wife and the police were given under extreme pressure and were not the truth. Appellant further testified that he believed other parties were responsible for the sexual assault on his daughter. He then recounted instances in which he caught his older son and daughter partially unclothed. He also testified that his daughter began to exhibit strange behavior after spending the weekend with a family who lived in the same apartment building that Appellee and his family lived in, and that this other family was known to view sexually explicit materials. Finally, Appellee testified that he once caught a son of this neighbor family exposing himself to his daughter.</p>
    <p id="b133-7" data-blocks='[["BL_133.7",133,[170,2129,1146,257]]]'>Appellee basically argues that his trial counsel was aware of this information which he claims is proof that his daughter was abused by others, and that trial counsel was ineffective for not investigating and interviewing these individuals to see if their testimony would have been beneficial to him.</p>
