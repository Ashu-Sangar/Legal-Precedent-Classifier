Farago, her husband, appeal from the order of the Superior Court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which affirmed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County. The latter court denied appellants’ post-verdict motions which were filed following an adverse jury verdict rendered in their lawsuit against appellee, Sacred Heart General Hospital.</p>
    <p id="b540-7" data-blocks='[["BL_540.7",540,[260,1108,1147,575]]]'>The pertinent facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. In the early hours of October 14, 1982, Jessie Farago, at the time a thirty-two (32) year old mechanical engineer, was admitted voluntarily to the psychiatric unit of Sacred Heart General Hospital in Chester, Pennsylvania. Mrs. Farago, who was approximately three months pregnant, had a history of mental illness dating back to her college years. That morning Mrs. Farago experienced an acute exacerbation of her chronic schizophrenic condition. This episode prompted her husband to seek her admission at Sacred Heart.</p>
    <p id="b540-8" data-blocks='[["BL_540.8",540,[258,1717,1148,260]]]'>After the initial evaluation by the admitting nurse and telephone consultation with the on-call psychiatrist, it was determined that Mrs. Farago did not require special observation. Routine orders, which included hourly physical checks, were prescribed by the staff.</p>
    <p id="b540-9" data-blocks='[["BL_540.9",540,[258,2004,1148,261]],["BL_541.1",541,[184,315,1148,782]]]'>The psychiatric unit at Sacred Heart is an open co-ed ward housed within the main building and designed to accommodate approximately twenty-two (22) patients. At around lunchtime, Mrs. Farago maintains that she was raped by a male patient in the bathroom that adjoined a <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>room on the ward referred to as a “quiet room.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Mrs. Farago and the male patient were discovered in the bathroom together after the incident by a physical plant superintendent. He in turn immediately contacted a mental health aide stationed on the floor. Mrs. Farago mentioned the incident to the aide in passing, however, she did not indicate that she had been raped by the patient. It was not until three days later that she claimed to another staff member that she was raped by this patient. Approximately eighteen days later Mrs. Farago informed her husband of this incident. In the meantime, her condition failed to stabilize and she began treatment with an anti-psychotic drug. The possible effects of this drug necessitated that Mrs. Farago undergo a therapeutic abortion at the Delaware County Hospital.</p>

The case proceeded to trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County before the Honorable Clement J. McGovern, Jr. and a jury of twelve. At the close of the evidence, the trial court instructed the jury to apply a willful misconduct or gross negligence standard to this case reasoning that Sacred Heart was entitled to limited immunity pursuant to Section 114 of the Mental Health Procedures Act (hereinafter “MHPA”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The jury returned a verdict in favor of the hospital. Appellants filed post-verdict motions with the court, which were denied. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the judgment and held that the trial court did not err in deciding that absent willful misconduct or gross negligence, Sacred Heart was entitled to the limited immunity afforded to it under the Act. Appellants <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>thereafter sought allowance of appeal to this Court, which was granted.</p>

    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[293,831,1146,204]]]'>In 1976, the General Assembly enacted the Mental Health Procedures Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> to provide procedures and treatment for the mentally ill in this Commonwealth. The policy of this Act is found in Section 102, which provides, in relevant part:</p>

    <p id="b542-8" data-blocks='[["BL_542.7",542,[291,1491,1148,411]]]'>50 P.S. § 7102. Consistent with this policy to insure adequate treatment in the least restrictive environment, is a limited immunity provision from civil and criminal liability for specific decisions regarding the treatment of the patient. This immunity is available to a mental health provider absent willful misconduct or gross negligence. The relevant statutory language regarding this immunity is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b543-3" data-blocks='[["BL_543.3",543,[237,295,1105,94]]]'>

    <p id="b543-6" data-blocks='[["BL_543.6",543,[195,1106,1148,511]]]'>At the close of evidence, the trial court charged the jury that this limited immunity under MHPA applied to Sacred Heart and that the standard of liability in this case is one of willful misconduct or gross negligence. It is appellants’ contention that the trial court erred in giving this charge and that the correct charge should have been one of ordinary negligence. Basically, appellants argue that this section applies to individual natural persons only and not organizational entities, such as Sacred Heart General Hospital.</p>

Thus, as noted by Superior <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>Court, the problem of specific provisions controlling general statutory provisions is not present in this case. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1933. Consequently, we must interpret the MHPA so that its provisions and the provisions of the general statutory construction act are allowed to operate, absent a contrary, controlling specific provision. <em>See Appeal of Yerger, </em><a href="/pa/460/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="460 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="482905" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0537-01">460 Pa. 537</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="460 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="482905" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0537-01">333 A.2d 902</a> (1975).

On the other hand, an “individual” is defined in this same section as a “natural person.” <em><a href="/pa/460/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="460 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="482905" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0537-01">Id.</a> </em>As mentioned above, the limited immunity conferred under this Act applies to specifically named individuals in addition to “any other authorized person who participates in a decisión____” 50 P.S. § 7114. Under these circumstances and absent a specific definition to the contrary included in the MHPA, it is clear that the General Assembly intended this provision to encompass organizational entities, including corporations, partnerships and associations as well as natural persons.

Treatment in these facilities, in practical terms, must be administered by individuals. Therefore, these facilities do not act independent of their personnel. To allow an individual to claim immunity under this provision but in turn preclude its employer the same benefit of the immunity would indeed undermine the stated purpose of the limited immunity conferred under the Act.

Section 114 specifically names four natural persons (county administrator, director of a facility, physician, and peace officer) who receive some immunity under the Act when they participate in decisions regarding admission, treatment, discharge, etc. and names a fifth non-specific “other authorized <em>person who participates </em>in a decision____” to receive said immunity. <em>Clearly, </em>decisions under the Act and under this section are made by natural persons, not by corporations, associations, etc. “Persons” is used later <em>in this same section </em>to refer to those natural persons needing/receiving treatment — surely the legislature did not mean to include corporations, etc. as “persons” who would receive or be refused treatment under the Act, nor did they intend to have two different operative definitions of “person” within the same section.</p>

Section 114’s “any other authorized person who <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>participates in a decision that a person be examined or treated under this act, or that a person be discharged, or placed under partial hospitalization ...,” etc., would presumably include those <em>natural persons </em>identified in section 106, “Persons responsible for formulation and review of treatment plan,” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> and those <em>natural persons </em>who are authorized in section 201 to subject a child under 14 years of age to examination and treatment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> In contrast, “facility” is clearly and specifically defined in section 103 of the Act, 50 P.S. § 7103, as follows:</p>

Just as clearly, had the legislature intended to immunize the mental health care <em>facility </em>from immunity with section 114, 50 P.S. § 7114, it would surely have immunized “any other authorized person <em>or </em>facility____” The legislature did not do this, however, and the context not only of this section but of <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>the entire Act indicates that this omission was <em>intentional </em>and that “person,” for purposes of immunity under section 114, means <em>natural persons </em>as it does everywhere else in the Act.</p>

I do not believe that appellants’ complaint is limited to the individualized treatment prescribed for Jessie L. Farago “in this unscientific and inexact field.” At 417-419. That is, assuming for argument’s sake only that appellee hospital is immune from liability under the Act, its “decision to admit Mrs. Farago under routine orders, including hourly checks ... specially formulated for her particular needs at the time of her admission,” at 304, might well be an immunized decision. However, appellants do not complain solely of that decision or its consequences; rather their complaint alleged negligence on the part of the hospital for failing to adequately supervise Jessie Farago and protect her from other potentially and actually dangerous persons in the facility such as her alleged rapist.</p>
    <p id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[249,1404,1147,844]]]'>Appellants do not seek recompense for damages caused by her “routine” admission with hourly checks, but rather from a sexual assault upon her by an unsupervised patient. It is obvious that “sexual assault by an unsupervised patient” was not part of the individualized treatment plan prescribed for Jessie Farago and that appellant’s complaint does not seek remedy for damages arising from her treatment plan. If Jessie Farago had wandered onto a driveway on hospital grounds and was struck by a car commandeered by an unsupervised patient, her complaint for damages would not be based upon the method of treatment or the treatment plan devised for her or for the other patient, but upon the hospital’s ordinary negligence in failing to take adequate security measures to prevent such occurrence. No legitimate treatment plan under the Act would provide for or contemplate negligent supervision of patients.</p>
