In dismissing Mathies’ challenge, the Board held that the DER was not required to consider the economic consequences upon Mathies or the aquatic impact of the mine discharge in setting the effluent limits<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> established in the permit. Upon review of the Board’s adjudication, the Commonwealth Court reversed that portion of the Board’s order.

The issue of the aquatic impact of the effluent limits was a secondary argument advanced in a sketchy fashion in the proceedings below. Even in this court, the arguments and briefs focus upon the economic impact issue and more or less skim over the question of the aquatic impact of the effluent limits. We believe the reason for this sketchy treatment of the aquatic impact factor is that the issue lacks merit. Basically, Mathies asserts that the DER should be required to consider evidence and determine what specific effect the particular discharge from Mathies' mine would have on the biota of Peters Creek in issuing the amendment to Mathies’ NPDES permit. That determination however, was made by the DER in establishing the effluent limits. The DER points out that Mathies is the sole discharger into the head waters of Peters Creek. The DER further points out that two of the pollutants involved here, namely, iron and manganese are considered "conservative." This means that they do not "decay with time or disappear from the stream by settling, absorption or other means.” (Brief of Appellant, p. 15, n. 27.)</p>
      <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[293,1134,1113,77]]]'>To determine the applicable effluent limitations in light of these facts, the DER developed and used a mass balance equation.</p>
      <blockquote id="b140-6" data-blocks='[["BL_140.6",140,[326,1213,1080,231]]]'>"A mass balance [equation] is very simply an expression of the basic law of conservation of matter. It is an exact accounting of all the materials that enter, accumulate, or are depleted in a given time interval. The principle of material balance calculation is to establish a number of independent equations equal to the number of unknowns of composition and mass." (citation omitted)</blockquote>
      <p id="b140-7" data-blocks='[["BL_140.7",140,[287,1448,1118,899]]]'>The mass balance equation relied upon in this case is a one dimensional model for a pollutant that does not decay, commonly referred to as a conservative or persistent pollutant, (citation omitted) The components of the mass balance equation are: background stream flow; background stream concentration of a parameter; design average flow of the discharge and the applicable pollutant criteria. The actual formula is: [Q 7-10 X background stream concentration] + [Design average flow x Unknown concentration] = [Chapter 93 criteria] (Total Flow). The appellant DER indicates that: "In this case the equation’s solution was obvious because the volume of the discharge is so large when compared to the design flow of the receiving stream (8.87 cfs to 0.056 cfs). Indeed when Mathies’ discharge combines with the receiving stream (8.87 cfs + 0.056 cfs = 8.926) its discharge of 8.87 cfs accounts for over 99% of the total stream flow. Under these circumstances, the water quality criteria became the controlling factor in the equation ... (footnote omitted), and as a result, the criteria for iron and manganese represents the highest concentration of these metals that could be present in the Mathies’ discharge. This is because any higher values would not protect all the aquatic and water supply uses of Peters Creek.” (Appellant's brief, p. 16.) Thus, the aquatic effects were indeed considered in the manner mandated by the water quality regulations, 25 Pa.Code § 93.5(b). No further individualized consideration, as argued for by Mathies, need be given.</p>
