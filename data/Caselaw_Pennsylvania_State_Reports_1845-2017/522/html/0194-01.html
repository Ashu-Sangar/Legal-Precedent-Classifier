The crime grew out of an argument involving Appellant, a male victim, and Sandra Veatch, the critical witness in these proceedings. Following an argument in a local bar, the trio proceeded to the victim’s trailer where the victim was shot to death after a quarrel concerning the company of the female. The murder weapon was found in Appellant’s home. A neutron activation test indicated that the Appellant had fired a weapon but proved negative as to Sandra Veatch.</p>

At the same hearing, however, witness Veatch testified freely that after the Appellant had pushed her and ripped her clothes, she started through a hallway to the bathroom and heard the Appellant say, “I’m leaving.” (H.T., p. 11). She further testified that she heard “Boom, Boom,” sounds which she identified as “gunshots.” After that she heard a car start outside and drive away. She stated that it was the Appellant’s car:</p>

Appearing with her own attorney, the witness stated that although she would answer some ques<a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>tions, she would exercise her Fifth Amendment privilege as to any specific questions pertaining to whether any other person was in the trailer, or whether she could identify the Appellant as the person who left in the car, or any other questions about those issues. While she gave extensive testimony (T.T., pp. 361-430) on other facts, she steadfastly refused to answer questions from both sides on what happened in the trailer as to those specific matters. In spite of defense counsel’s pleas to the court to instruct her to answer, the court ruled repeatedly that she need not break her silence. She then refused to respond to these matters on numerous occasions. (See, for example, T.T., p. 382 ff., especially pp. 415-422). The court’s rulings were based on its judgment, as explained to the witness, that if she were to testify presently in any way inconsistent with her prior testimony at the preliminary hearing, she could be subject to a charge of perjury. (T.T., pp. 365-366). While defense counsel continued to press the court to force an answer because counsel believed that a fourth unknown person was in the trailer, the court insisted in particular that in her prior testimony that no other person was there possibly could be construed as self-incrimination if she now changed her testimony on that point. (T.T., p. 410-412). Defense counsel’s strategy of getting such information from the witness was frustrated by the continuing silence.</p>

The prior testimony elicited on this occasion, pointed up again <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>Veatch’s statement that she heard two shots and that no other person was in the trailer.

I have a right to do that because this testimony elicited at the magistrate’s hearing, according to what Miss Yeatch told me, was solicited by coercion. That being the case, I have a right to inquire into that, I have a right to ask those questions.

The court’s purpose was “to find out what’s going to happen before we bring the jury in.” (T.T., p. 623). Specifically, the court wanted to ascertain, first, if the witness would continue to exercise her Fifth Amendment rights, in which case any further questioning would be futile, and, second, whether defense counsel was engaging in proper surrebuttal by addressing only issues raised on rebuttal by the prosecutor. Throughout this discussion before the court, Veatch’s own attorney advised the judge repeatedly that he was warning her to exercise her privilege on questions specifically related to her knowledge of whether she saw an unknown party in the trailer and whether the Appellant shot the victim.</p>
