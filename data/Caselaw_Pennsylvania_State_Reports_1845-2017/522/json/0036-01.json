        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis appeal requires us to interpret Pa.R.Crim.P. 229 in reviewing the propriety of amending a criminal complaint at trial to include victims of assault who were not named in the original complaint. The trial court allowed the amendment on the ground that appellant was not surprised or prejudiced by the addition of new victims, and appellant was convicted. We reverse, due to violation of Rule 229.\nThe appellant, Frank DeSumma, was offended one evening by the inconsiderate driving of Frank O'Hara, who cut him off in traffic. Appellant exchanged angry words with O\u2019Hara, then displayed a handgun, menacing O\u2019Hara and his four passengers, while the two vehicles were proceeding side-by-side on the highway. After both drivers pulled off the highway, a police officer arrived and took statements of the parties. Appellant voluntarily surrendered his loaded handgun, which he was licensed to carry, and was then arrested and charged with simple assault upon O\u2019Hara and recklessly endangering O\u2019Hara, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2701(a)(3) and 2705. Appellant was not charged with assaulting or endangering the four passengers, though their names were available in the police report.\nAt appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing, only O\u2019Hara and the arresting officer testified against appellant. None of the passengers appeared at the hearing. The Commonwealth established a prima facie case through O\u2019Hara\u2019s testimony that appellant pointed a gun at him while both were driving their cars, and by the officer reading his report into the record, including the portion identifying the four passengers.\nBefore appellant\u2019s trial, however, O\u2019Hara disappeared and could not be subpoenaed to testify for the Commonwealth. One of the passengers, Michelle Sharper, was available and was summoned to testify. Due to O\u2019Hara\u2019s absence, the Commonwealth moved to amend the information to add the names of the four passengers, requesting that the first count charge appellant with assaulting O\u2019Hara and four named passengers and the second count charge appellant with recklessly endangering O\u2019Hara and four named passengers. Because the four passengers had been identified by name at the preliminary hearing, the trial court granted the motion, reasoning that appellant could not claim surprise and that the amendment did not prejudice him in any way. The court categorically refused, however, to add counts naming individual passengers in the additional counts. Over appellant\u2019s objection, he was tried on the amended two-count complaint, wherein each count named five victims instead of one.\nFollowing a jury trial, appellant was convicted of simple assault; he was acquitted of recklessly endangering another person. Superior Court affirmed his judgment of sentence, following the rationale of the trial court. Judge Wieand, in dissent, expressed the opinion that the amendment did not comply with Pa.R.Crim.P. 229, which prohibits amendments charging additional or different offenses. Relying on cases such as Commonwealth v. Johnson, 336 Pa.Super. 1, 485 A.2d 397 (1985), and Commonwealth v. Stanley, 265 Pa.Super. 194, 401 A.2d 1166 (1979), aff'd 498 Pa. 326, 446 A.2d 583 (1982), the dissent maintained that the purpose of Rule 229 is to give a defendant adequate notice and time to prepare for trial without risk of last-minute additions to the charge which materially alter potential defenses. Judge Wieand concluded that the amendment was prejudicial because it added an additional and different offense:\nHe arrived for trial anticipating that he would be required to defend against a charge that he had pointed a loaded gun at O\u2019Hara with the intent of putting O\u2019Hara in fear of imminent bodily injury. At trial, however, he found that he was required to defend against an accusation that he had intended to put in fear of bodily injury the passengers in the other vehicle with whom he had not exchanged words and with whom he had no quarrel. Until the time when trial started, there had not been either accusation or testimony that appellant had intended to menace anyone but the driver with whom he had quarreled.\nCommonwealth v. DeSumma, 367 Pa.Super. 634, 640-41, 533 A.2d 453, 456 (1987) (dissenting opinion).\nPa.R.Crim.P. 229 provides:\nRULE 229. AMENDMENT OF INFORMATION\nThe court may allow an information to be amended when there is a defect in form, the description of the offense, the description of any person or any property, or the date charged, provided the information as amended does not charge an additional or different offense. Upon amendment the court may grant such postponement of trial or other relief as is necessary in the interests of justice.\n(Emphasis added.) This rule, taken in conjunction with the holding of Commonwealth v. Frisbie, 506 Pa. 461, 485 A.2d 1098 (1984), bars the amendment which was permitted in this case.\nIn Frisbie, this Court overruled the notion that \u201c[wjhere there is but one act of cause of injury, or death of a number of persons, there is but one injury to the Commonwealth\u201d; we therefore held it permissible for a court \u201cto impose multiple sentences on a defendant for a single act.\u201d Id., 506 Pa. at 465, 485 A.2d at 1099. Thus Frisbie was charged with nine separate counts of recklessly endangering another person due to a single reckless act which endangered nine people, garnering him nine separate consecutive sentences for the nine offenses. We stated that \u201cin resolving the issue of whether a single act which injures multiple victims can be the basis for multiple sentences, our task is to simply determine whether the legislature intended that each injury constitute a separate offense.\u201d Id., 506 Pa. at 466, 485 A.2d at 1100.\nIn construing 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2705, recklessly endangering another person, the Frisbie court concluded that the offense was defined \u201cwith respect to an individual person being placed in danger of death or serious bodily injury, and that a separate offense is committed for each individual person placed in such danger.\" Id. (Emphasis supplied.) Similarly, in Commonwealth v. Williams, 514 Pa. 124, 130, 522 A.2d 1095, 1098 (1987), we held that an attempt to murder three people by a single act of arson would constitute three separate offenses of attempted murder, for criminal homicide is defined as causing \u201cthe death of another human being.\" (Emphasis added.) The same is true of simple assault, prohibited by 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701(a)(3), which states that a person commits assault if he \u201cattempts by physical menace to put another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) With respect to crimes defined in such language, the number of offenses depends on the number of victims rather than on the number of acts committed by a defendant.\nApplying this interpretation to the case of appellant, it is clear that a charge of attempting to put O\u2019Hara in fear of bodily injury is a different offense than a charge of attempting to put O\u2019Hara, Michelle Sharper, and three other passengers in fear of bodily injury. The latter, in fact, constitutes five separate offenses against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth. It is therefore clear that the amendment of appellant\u2019s information at trial from an assault upon O\u2019Hara to an assault upon five people was impermissible under Rule 229 which prohibits an amendment from charging \u201can additional or different offense.\u201d\nThe prejudice engendered by the eleventh-hour amendment is obvious. It was implicit in the quoted portion of Judge Wieand\u2019s dissenting opinion, supra, in that at least two defenses \u2014 justification under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 503 or consent under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 311 \u2014 might have been raised with respect to O\u2019Hara but not with respect to the remaining passengers. Other potential defenses may have been vitiated as well by the amendment.\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed, and appellant is discharged.\nNIX, C.J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a dissenting opinion in which McDermott, j., joins.",

        "text": "PAPADAKOS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent from the Majority Opinion because I believe that Commonwealth v. Frisbie, 506 Pa. 461, 485 A.2d 1098 (1984), should not be read into Pa.R.Crim.P. 229 on these facts.\nFrisbie allows for separate offenses (and sentences) to be rendered against a criminal actor who injures multiple victims with a single act in certain crimes. The specific issue in Frisbie was \u201cwhether the legislature intended that each injury constitute a separate offense.\u201d The decision there held that, as to the crime of recklessly endangering another person, \u201ca separate offense is committed for each individual person placed in danger.\u201d 485 A.2d at 1100 (emphasis added in each quotation). The Majority rightly indicates that similar results would obtain for the crimes of arson and assault and concludes from this analysis that \u201cthe number of offenses depends on the number of victims rather than on the number of acts committed by the defendant.\u201d\nAs to Rule 229, which controls amendments to information, there is a prohibition against charging \u201can additional or different offense.\u201d The Rule is clear on this point.\nHypothetically, therefore, the Commonwealth in the instant case could have charged the Appellant with five counts each of the offenses. Frisbie would have validated that procedure. Also, hypothetically, if the Commonwealth, in its amendment, had added an offense or charged a different offense, Rule 229 would have been offended.\nThat, however, is not what happened here. The Commonwealth did not add any separate offenses in its amendment. Appellant remained charged with one count each of recklessly endangering another person and assault throughout the entire judicial process. That the Commonwealth earlier could have increased the counts of each crime to coincide with the number of victims is clear under Frisbie. For whatever reason, that course was not chosen by the prosecution.\nNor did the Commonwealth add any different offense in its amendment. Appellant remained charged with the same offenses, and I fail to see how Rule 229 applies to this specific point.\nThe Majority\u2019s fatal confusion lies in its incorrect assumption that by listing the names of the other victims in the car, the Commonwealth automatically was putting on additional charges as defined by Frisbie and in violation of Rule 229. That assessment is wrong.\nThe correct focus should follow the Superior Court\u2019s argument that, at least under its own cases, the amendment worked an irreparable prejudice by forcing the Appellant to prepare a defense without adequate notice or sufficient time. That is the only issue in this case, and it is noteworthy that Frisbie, decided three years earlier, played no role in the decisions or dissent of the courts below.\nAs to the issue of prejudice, nevertheless, I conclude that Appellant\u2019s defense remained unaltered by the amendments. Prior to the amendments, at the preliminary hearing, he was fully informed of the fact that there were other frightened passengers in the car. He knew at that point that he had committed the crimes against some person or persons. The Commonwealth\u2019s failure to charge him with separate offenses for each party is not germane. At trial he remained charged with one offense each underlying both the original and amended information. The elements of the offenses and the cognate factual situation were identical before and after. A careful reading of the Superior Court\u2019s majority opinion would support this conclusion.\nNothing in this case persuades me that either the trial court or the Superior Court were incorrect in affirming the judgment of sentence.\nMcDERMOTT, J., joins this dissenting opinion.",
