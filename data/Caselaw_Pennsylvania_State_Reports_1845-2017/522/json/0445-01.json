        "text": "OPINION\nMcDermott, justice.\nA jury convicted appellant, James Strong, of murder in the first degree, kidnapping, robbery, theft of an automobile, and theft of personal property valued at $200.00 or more. A separate penalty hearing was held for the first degree murder charge in accordance with Section 9711 of the Sentencing Code. The jury unanimously found three aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances, and accordingly sentenced appellant to death. Post-verdict motions were denied and the appellant was formally sentenced to death. He also received the following sentences on the lesser included offenses: kidnapping \u2014 a consecutive sentence of twenty year maximum and ten year minimum; robbery \u2014 a consecutive sentence of twenty years maximum and a ten year minimum; theft of an automobile \u2014 a consecutive sentence of seven years maximum and three and one-half year minimum; theft in excess of $200.00 \u2014no sentence imposed.\nThe appellant pursued a direct appeal to this Court from the judgments of sentence. Eleven (11) assignments of error are raised which will be addressed after first examining the sufficiency of the evidence.\nI. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\nAlthough appellant does not directly challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his murder conviction, it is nonetheless the practice of this Court to review the sufficiency of the evidence in death penalty cases regardless of whether the issue is contested. See Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 26-27, n. 3, 454 A.2d 937, 942 n. 3 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983).\nThe applicable standard in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is whether viewing all the evidence admitted at trial in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, there is sufficient evidence to enable the jury to find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Kichline, 468 Pa. 265, 361 A.2d 282 (1976). If the evidence offered by the Commonwealth at trial was legally posited, as we hold, and accepted by the jury, as it was, it can lead to no conclusion other than guilty as charged.\nAccording to that evidence, Mr. John Henry Strock, Jr., age fifty (50) risked the danger of kindness to strangers and lost. He picked up two hitchhikers and had his head blown off with a shotgun. The inculpation of the appellant was given by one James R. Alexander, eyewitness and companion in crime. He told how he and appellant were hitchhiking on Rt. 81 in Greencastle, Pennsylvania, and how Mr. Strock pulled over and offered a ride. The two got in, Alexander in the front seat and the appellant in the back. While proceeding along Rt. 30 the appellant produced a .20 gauge shotgun and put it on Mr. Strock\u2019s shoulder. Taking possession of the car, they rode awhile, Alexander driving, and when they stopped to relieve themselves, the appellant took Mr. Strock to the gulley and shot him. When Alexander heard the shot and a scream he saw appellant standing over Mr. Strock who was lying face down. Alexander asked the appellant why he shot Mr. Strock and he replied \u201cI am tired of leaving witnesses behind.\u201d Appellant then offered the gun to Alexander and told him to shoot Mr. Strock in the head. Alexander declined, but at appellant\u2019s request removed Mr. Strock\u2019s wallet. Alexander then heard another shot, that evidence showed, blew Mr. Strock\u2019s head off his body. When appellant was captured he had Mr. Strock\u2019s license in his possession, and there was testimony that appellant intended to use this license as false identification. Mr. Strock\u2019s life was only a ticket for appellant\u2019s further passage: as events proved, but a small distance.\nWe are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on the charge of murder in the first degree.\nII. PRE-TRIAL RULINGS\nAppellant first argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion in limine to exclude or prevent the Commonwealth from impeaching him by use of his prior criminal record.\nAppellant\u2019s record included a conviction for robbery and auto larceny in 1969, and two additional convictions for robbery, the most recent of which occurred in 1975. The motion was denied in part by the trial court, which allowed the prosecution to impeach the credibility of appellant through the use of his most recent robbery conviction.\nWe have recently held that \u201cevidence of prior convictions can be introduced for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness if the conviction was for an offense involving dishonesty or false statement, and the date of conviction or the last day of confinement is within ten years of the trial date.\u201d Commonwealth v. Randall, 515 Pa. 410, 415, 528 A.2d 1326, 1329 (1987). As appellant\u2019s robbery conviction in 1975 involved an element of dishonesty tending to discredit him as being untruthful, Commonwealth v. Perrin, 484 Pa. 188, 398 A.2d 1007 (1979), and as appellant falls squarely within the ten year time frame, we are satisfied that no error was committed by the trial court in allowing the admission of the 1975 conviction.\nIII. ASSERTED TRIAL ERRORS\nAppellant asserts that error was committed by the trial court through the admission of certain photographs into evidence. The first allegation of error pertains to a pre-death photograph of the victim. This particular piece of evidence, which was found on appellant, was offered by the Commonwealth to establish the identity of the victim: it was presented to the victim\u2019s father in furtherance of that particular objective.\nWe have held that pre-death photographs of a victim can be admitted if they are relevant to a determination of guilt or innocence, Commonwealth v. Green, 488 Pa. 611, 615, n. 2, 413 A.2d 651, 656 n. 2 (1980); and that the admission of photographs is largely within the discretion of the trial court, the rulings of which will not be overturned on appeal unless there is an abuse of that discretion. Commonwealth v. Woodward, 483 Pa. 1, 394 A.2d 508 (1978). In this case the identity of the victim was arguably at issue, in that the rate of decomposition had made fingerprint analysis impossible, causing initial identification to be based on dental x-ray comparisons. However, even if we agreed with appellant\u2019s contention that the admission was erroneous, appellant must still demonstrate that the error was prejudicial.\nIn Commonwealth v. Mehmeti, 501 Pa. 589, 462 A.2d 657 (1983), we held that an error may be harmless where the properly admitted evidence of guilt is so overwhelming, and the prejudicial effect of the error is insignificant by comparison, that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error could not have contributed to the verdict. See Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 383 A.2d 155 (1978).\nIn this case the Commonwealth\u2019s primary evidence consisted of appellant\u2019s partner, who not only saw the victim after he had been shot, but removed his wallet at the direction of the appellant. Additionally, when arrested, appellant had in his possession the victim's belongings. We also note that the picture which was introduced was that contained on the victim\u2019s drivers license, and its introduction was not accompanied by a recitation of the victim\u2019s family life, as was the case in Commonwealth v. Story, id. As in our decision in Commonwealth v. Mehmeti, supra, we are satisfied that the introduction of this photograph, even if it was erroneous, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAppellant next takes issue with the introduction into evidence of several post-mortem photographs of the victim. To determine whether such photographs are admissible, we have utilized a two-tiered analysis. The trial judge must initially decide whether the photographs possess inflammatory characteristics. If they do not the photographs are admissible as are any evidentiary items, subject to the qualification of relevance. If the photographs are deemed inflammatory, then the trial judge must decide whether the photographs are of such essential evidentiary value that their need clearly outweighs the likelihood of their inflaming the passions of the jurors. Commonwealth v. Hudson, 489 Pa. 620, 630, 414 A.2d 1381, 1386 (1980).\nThese black and white photographs depicted the shooting scene and the victim\u2019s body. In the photographs the body was covered by vegetation and debris and the pictures were neither very clear or graphic. As they were relevant in establishing the location of the shooting and the condition of the body when it was found, their admission was not error.\nAppellant next contends that during his trial several acts of prosecutorial misconduct were committed. The first is said to have occurred during closing arguments when a statement was made with regard to the Commonwealth\u2019s key witness, accomplice James Alexander. The district attorney said: \u201cI tell you ladies and gentlemen, there were absolutely no promises made to him.\u201d (N.T.1890). Appellant argues that this statement was an attempt to bolster the credibility of their key witness.\nGenerally, \u201ccomments by the district attorney do not constitute reversible error unless the unavoidable effect of such comments would be to prejudice the jury, forming in their minds fixed bias and hostility toward the defendant so that they could not weigh the evidence objectively and render a true verdict.\u201d Commonwealth v. McNeal, 456 Pa. 394, 400, 319 A.2d 669, 673 (1974). As the outcome of this weighing process rests with the trial court our inquiry of necessity must turn to whether an abuse of discretion was committed. Commonwealth v. Simon, 432 Pa. 386, 248 A.2d 289 (1968).\nThe remark in question was in response to a direct attack upon the witness\u2019 credibility. That attack took the form of the following comments.\nLet\u2019s look at James Alexander. Here\u2019s a guy on the stand, he\u2019s charged with murder, robbery, kidnapping and theft. Observe his demeanor on the stand. He\u2019s a guy who told you he had no deal, no deal. Do you believe it? Do you believe it by the way he testified. Did he look concerned, did he look worried about being faced with the charge of murder? You decide. That\u2019s for you to decide but recall the way he testified from that stand. Did he look concerned about it? Was he worried about it? Did he look like somebody who said, hey, baby, I\u2019m home free, I don\u2019t have a care in the world?\nN.T. 1858-1859. The obvious intent of these remarks was to put the idea in the minds of the jurors that some deal had been struck between the Commonwealth and its chief witness. Certainly the prosecution was entitled to respond to these comments, and the retort was both proper and necessary. Accordingly, we are satisfied that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial.\nWe are similarly satisfied that the next challenged statement made by the district attorney was not an example of prosecutorial misconduct. The statement was that \u201cJames Alexander told the whole ugly truth.\u201d Though petitioner argues this statement prejudiced him in the eyes of the jury we are inclined to agree with the trial court\u2019s classification of the statement as \u201can appropriate comment.\u201d A shotgun killing of an innocent man is certainly, among other things, an ugly event, and the prosecutor\u2019s description as such was not inaccurate.\nAppellant\u2019s final assertion of prosecutorial misconduct is directed at the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument during the penalty phase of the trial. During their testimony appellant\u2019s parents had attested to the good character of their son. In his closing the following statement was made by the prosecutor.\nThe Strongs testified that James Strong was a good person, and what did you expect of them? I\u2019m sure his parents are fine people, no doubt in my mind about that. But remember, they\u2019re not on trial. James Strong is on trial.\nAnd remember, everyone at one time or another had parents. Atilla the Hun had parents. Adolph Hitler had parents. Every murderer that ever set forth on this earth had parents.\nAppellant argues that reference to these notorious figures during the penalty stage of the trial had the effect of inflaming the passions of the jury by likening appellant to those figures. For authority he relies upon cases wherein new trials were granted when the defendant was characterized as an \u201cAl Capone\u201d, Commonwealth v. Valle, 240 Pa.Super. 411, 362 A.2d 1021 (1976), and as a \u201cPontius Pilate\u201d and \u201cJudas Iscariot,\u201d United States v. Steinkoetter, 633 F.2d 719 (6th Cir.1980).\nWe note at the outset that discussing such characterizations are not new to this Court. In Commonwealth v. Whitney, 511 Pa. 232, 512 A.2d 1152 (1986), the prosecutor also made reference to Adolph Hitler. In determining whether such a reference tended to inflame the passions of the jurors we looked to the context in which the comparison was made. Here the names of these figures were employed to dilute the potentially mitigating testimony of appellant\u2019s parents. The logical implication of the prosecutor\u2019s remark was that fine parents are capable of producing murderous off-spring, which is not, we are sad to say, a novel proposition. We are satisfied that in the context of this case the statement was an allusion and not a direct comparison. We further decline to adopt the view that a prosecutor\u2019s argument during the penalty stage should be a sterile affair. Many cases are sordid, mordant tales and their very description are librettos for threnodies of death and loss. To tell their story is to inevitably touch human emotions, because they are about human things: sad, terrible, alien human things. They cannot be left undescribed because they are terrible or alien to ordinary human standards of conduct. They are the issue in question and unless one transcends the evidential terms or deliberately calculates to do what the evidence does not support, they must be told and whatever human emotions they may awake are inescapable in the context of the truth of the occasion. See Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 502 Pa. 474, 467 A.2d 288 (1983); Commonwealth v. Whitney, supra.\nIV. SENTENCING PHASE\nAppellant next asserts that the death sentence imposed upon him should be vacated due to various errors that occurred during the penalty phase of the trial.\nHe first argues that the trial court committed error when it permitted the Commonwealth to argue as an aggravating factor that the victim was a Commonwealth witness to a felony committed by the defendant and was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony against the defendant in a grand jury or criminal proceeding involving such offense. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(5).\nThe Court has previously held that under \u00a7 9711(d)(5), evidence must be introduced to prove that the victim was a prosecution witness who was killed to prevent his testimony in a pending grand jury or criminal proceeding; and that the burden of the Commonwealth will not be met by simply showing that an individual who witnessed a murder or other felony committed by a defendant was also killed by the defendant. Commonwealth v. Crawley, 514 Pa. 539, 561, 526 A.2d 334, 345 (1987). See Commonwealth v. Caldwell, 516 Pa. 441, 448, 532 A.2d 813, 817 (1987).\nRecently this rule was amended so as to permit \u201ca finding of the existence of this particular aggravating circumstance where the killing results from the intention to eliminate a potential witness, if such facts can be established by direct evidence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Appel, 517 Pa. 529, 539 A.2d 780, 784 n. 2 (1988).\nApplying this reasoning to the case at bar it is clear that Mr. Strock was killed to prevent him from reporting the fact that he was robbed. Mr. Strong\u2019s avowed purpose in killing Mr. Strock became evident when he stated to his co-defendant, James Alexander, that he was \u201ctired of leaving witnesses behind.\u201d Therefore the jury\u2019s finding of an aggravating circumstance pursuant to \u00a7 9711(d)(5) was not contrary to the weight of the evidence.\nAppellant next contends that the evidence does not support a finding that he had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9). The felony convictions introduced as an aggravating circumstance were: assault, robbery and auto larceny in 1969; assault and robbery with a deadly weapon in 1970; and robbery in 1975. The 1969 conviction involved a fact pattern almost identical to that of the present action. Clearly, on this record there was sufficient evidence of previous felony convictions to submit to the jury, and that the jury\u2019s finding of an aggravating circumstance in this regard was not error. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s contention that the term \u201csignificant history\u201d contained in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9), is overly broad, is also meritless as we have previously rejected this challenge in Commonwealth v. Fahy, 512 Pa. 298, 516 A.2d 689 (1986).\nAppellant also contends that the language contained in \u00a7 9711(d)(6) is unconstitutional because it is overly broad. The specific section provides for the assessment of an aggravating circumstance if the jury finds \u201cthe defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6). We have previously rejected this challenge in Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 510 Pa. 603, 511 A.2d 764 (1986). Therefore, appellant\u2019s argument requires no further discussion.\nAppellant next contends that the trial court committed error in failing to grant his request to terminate the proceedings, and in failing to impose a sentence of life imprisonment after the jury submitted the following question during deliberations at the penalty phase: \u201cWould life imprisonment result in the possibility of parole at any time.\u201d (N.T. 2047). In response the trial court stated:\nI will not answer the question that you have sent to me except to tell you that your responsibility in this case is statutorily limited to deciding the presence or non-presence of any aggravating factors or any mitigating factors, and no other factors unless it falls within the mitigating factor listed as No. 8 is to be considered by you.\nYou will decide in this case whether the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has proved beyond a reasonable doubt any one of the three aggravating circumstances. If you find that they have not, the sentence must be life. If you find that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt one or more aggravating circumstances, then you will determine whether or not there is proof by a preponderance of any one of the eight (8) enumerated mitigating circumstances and if you find that any one of those eight (8) have been established, then it is your responsibility to weigh them one against the other.\nIf when you weigh them, the aggravating circumstance or circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstance or circumstances, then the sentence must be death.\nIf you find an aggravating circumstance or circumstances and you find a mitigating circumstance or circumstances and you find that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating, then, again, the sentence must be life. That is the law and it is on that basis and that basis alone that you shall determine and set the verdict in this case. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, on the basis of the instructions as I have given them to you, you will return to the jury room, continue deliberations in hopes of unanimously agreeing upon responses to the questions that have been submitted to you.\nWhenever you agree upon a sentencing verdict, whatever it is, it shall be received and recorded by the Court and you are instructed that the Court shall thereafter impose upon the Defendant the sentence fixed by the jury. With those instructions, you shall return to the jury room.\nAppellant argues that the refusal of the trial court to answer the jury\u2019s question left an impression in the jury\u2019s mind that if life imprisonment were imposed there would be possibility of parole, thus this response prejudiced any chance of the jury returning a verdict of life imprisonment.\nIn Commonwealth v. Johnson, 368 Pa. 139, 81 A.2d 569 (1951), a case strikingly similar to the present case, we set forth the nature of the required response. There we said \u201cthat whether the defendant might at any future time be pardoned or have his sentence commuted is no concern of their\u2019s and should not enter in any manner whatsoever into their consideration of the proper penalty to be imposed, which should be determined solely in the light of the relevant facts and circumstances as they then existed.\u201d Id., 368 Pa. at 148, 81 A.2d at 573. While the response given by the learned trial judge was not as concise as that suggested by us in Johnson supra, it did stress to the jurors that the future possibility of parole was not to enter into their decision process, and therefore was an adequate response.\nAppellant next argues that the trial court erred in not granting his motion for a mistrial based upon pre-trial statements made by the district attorney which were in violation of a gag order.\nThe particular comments in issue appeared in an article printed in the October 7, 1984, edition of the Citizens\u2019 Voice, a local newspaper. The comments appeared after the commencement of jury selection and after several jurors had been selected. In the article the district attorney made mention of appellant's attempt to fight extradition to Pennsylvania. The comments were made in a commentary regarding an unrelated case. In an attempt to counteract the district attorney\u2019s indiscretion, the trial court gave counsel for defendant the option of conducting another voir dire examination of those jurors already selected, with the right to challenge for cause any juror who had read the article. Defense counsel and defendant were given the entire evening to accept or reject this option. The offer was rejected, and the majority of the remaining prospective jurors indicated that they were not sure whether they had read the article, and said that if they had they were not influenced by it.\nWe are satisfied that no prejudice resulted to appellant through the violation of this pre-trial order by the district attorney.\nAppellant next contends that the trial court erred in appointing an investigator from the public defender\u2019s office to assist him, as opposed to a private investigator. The record reveals that petitioner\u2019s limited financial resources precluded him from independently securing the services of a private investigator. An investigator was requested in order to locate alibi witnesses. To aid petitioner the court appointed an investigator from the public defender\u2019s office.\" As this investigator was from the same office that ultimately would be defending co-defendant James Alexander, petitioner argues there was a conflict of interest. Petitioner does not allege that the services provided by the investigator were lacking; nor does he allege that the investigation was conducted with an eye towards impacting on the representation of James Alexander.\nWe begin our analysis of this issue by first stating that there is no requirement on the part of the Commonwealth to furnish investigative services at the Commonwealth\u2019s expense. Commonwealth v. Box, 481 Pa. 62, 391 A.2d 1316 (1978). Secondly, although we have held that the public defender\u2019s association is considered to be a law firm, and that representation of multiple clients with inconsistent defense would result in a conflict of interests Commonwealth v. Westbrook, 484 Pa. 534, 400 A.2d 160 (1979), we are not prepared, for conflict of interest purposes, to analogize the services of an investigator to those of an attorney. To do so would be to stretch the scope of the rule beyond the legitimate purposes for which it was intended.\nAppellant also argues that the sentences imposed by the lower court, with regard to the lesser included offenses, were illegal because they were beyond those set forth in the sentencing guidelines. As these guidelines were held unconstitutional by us in Commonwealth v. Sessoms, 516 Pa. 365, 532 A.2d 775 (1987), this argument is without merit.\nY. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE DEATH PENALTY STATUTE\nAppellant next contends that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to bar imposition of the death penalty. In this argument appellant launches a thirteen (13) point assault upon the constitutionality of our death penalty statute. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711 et seq. He alleges the statute is unconstitutional because:\n(1) The required finding that aggravating circumstances outweigh any mitigating circumstances is so vaguely phrased as to allow totally unguided discretion to the jury and introduces an element of arbitrariness of decision which violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution in their provisions against cruel and unusual punishment and in violation of defendant\u2019s rights to due process and equal protection of law in sentencing procedures. (2) The Statute is unconstitutional in requiring a defendant to prove mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence. (3) The Statute unconstitutionally makes the death sentence mandatory whenever a jury finds single aggravating circumstance which \u201coutweighs\u201d any mitigating circumstances. (4) The aggravating circumstances relating to commission of a killing is vague as applied to the facts of this case. (5) The Statute fails to provide meaningful historical proportionality review in light of the inapplicability of any death penalty in Pennsylvania from 1967 to 1978. (6) The Statute fails to provide meaningful participation by defendant in any proportionality review and fails to provide other proper procedures for such determination. (7) The imposition of the sentence of death by electrocution is cruel and unusual punishment because of the unnecessarily excessive infliction of physical pain. (8) The imposition of the sentence of death under the present statute is unconstitutionally arbitrary and capable of whimsical application because it imposes no limitation upon the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in electing to demand the death penalty in a given case even if aggravating factors are present. (9) The imposition of the sentence of death under the Pennsylvania Statute is arbitrary because Pennsylvania murder trial procedure allows the jury to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter without evidence. (10) The imposition of the sentence of death is cruel and unusual punishment because it violates current societal standards of decency. 11) The application of the aggravating factor described as \u201cthe defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony\u201d under 42 Pa.C.S.A. Section 9711(d)(6) is unconstitutionally vague, confusing and arbitrary because of its confusing similarity to the definition of second degree murder in 18 Pa.G.S.A. Section 2502(b). (12) The Statute represents an unconstitutional infringement by the legislature of the separation-of-powers. (13) 42 Pa.C.S.A. Section 9711(b) permits a defendant by pleading guilty (to murder generally) or waiving trial by jury to secure a trial on the issue of degree of guilty (plea) or guilt itself (waiver) before a finder of fact (i.e., the presiding judge) who is not necessarily death prone or as to whom the Commonwealth has no right to \u201cdeath qualify\u201d.\nAll but one of these challenges has been previously addressed and rejected by this Court. See Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 454 A.2d 937 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983), reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1236, 104 S.Ct. 31, 77 L.Ed.2d 1452 (1983 and Commonwealth v. Frey, 504 Pa. 428, 475 A.2d 700 (1984) cert. denied, 469 U.S. 963, 105 S.Ct. 360, 83 L.Ed.2d 296 (1984); Commonwealth v. DeHart, 512 Pa. 235, 516 A.2d 656 (1986), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1010, 107 S.Ct. 3241, 97 L.Ed.2d 746 (1987). Therefore, a reiteration of our reasoning in these cases would accomplish little.\nAppellant\u2019s unique constitutional attack is that 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(b) is unconstitutional in that it permits a defendant by pleading guilty to murder generally, or waiving trial by jury, to secure a trial on the issue of the degree of guilt, or guilt itself, before a finder of fact who is not necessarily death prone, or as to whom the Commonwealth has no right to \u201cdeath qualify\u201d. As such he argues this is a denial of equal protection of the law. Appellant takes this argument one step further by hypothesizing that the above constitutional infirmity could have been rectified in the instant action had two separate juries been empaneled, one for the guilt stage and the other for the penalty stage of the proceeding.\nWe begin by disagreeing with appellant\u2019s liberal paraphrase of 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(b). This section applies to a defendant\u2019s plea of guilt to first degree murder. It does not apply to a plea of murder \u201cgenerally\u201d. Indeed, if one were to plead guilty to murder \u201cgenerally\u201d, there would be a trial, either by a judge or jury, to establish the degree of guilt, e.g., first degree murder or third degree murder. Secondly, we disagree with petitioner\u2019s contention that one is denied equal protection by requesting a jury, which would be \u201cdeath qualified,\u201d as opposed to requesting a trial by a judge, who would not be explicitly \u201cdeath qualified\u201d.\nIt is important to emphasize that the death qualification of the jury is not for the purpose of assembling a conviction prone and/or death prone body. Rather the purposes is intended to ensure that the full letter of the law will be upheld if the circumstances so require. A judge by definition is sworn to uphold the law pursuant to the oath of office; and, consequently he or she is duty bound to impose the death penalty should the circumstances so dictate. Therefore, we see no unequal treatment accorded to defendants who elect a jury trial.\nAppellant next argues that the trial court committed error in sustaining the Commonwealth\u2019s challenge for cause of six prospective jurors on the basis that they could not vote for the death penalty. Appellant alleges that the trial court\u2019s ruling deprived him of a fair and impartial jury, and resulted in the selection of a panel more likely to convict.\nUnder federal constitutional law this very argument was addressed and rejected by the United States Supreme Court in Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U.S. 162, 106 S.Ct. 1758, 90 L.Ed.2d 137 (1986). Additionally, as a matter of state constitutional law, this court has declined to afford an accused greater protection in this instance than that which is mandated by the federal constitution. Commonwealth v. Peterkin, 511 Pa. 299, 320, 513 A.2d 373, 384 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1070, 107 S.Ct. 962, 93 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1987), Commonwealth v. Sneed, 514 Pa. 597, 605, 526 A.2d 749, 753 (1987). Accordingly, as we have adequately disposed of this issue on several previous occasions, further discussion is not warranted.\nVI. PROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\nFinally, we turn our attention now, as we must, to the proportionality of appellant\u2019s sentence. Because the jury found no mitigating circumstances and three aggravating circumstances have been upheld, we sustain the conviction and affirm the sentence of death. Based upon our review of the statistical data provided by the Administrative Office of the Pennsylvania Courts, see Commonwealth v. Frey, 504 Pa. 428, 475 A.2d 700 (1984) cert. denied, 469 U.S. 963, 105 S.Ct. 360, 83 L.Ed.2d 296 (1984), we conclude that the sentence of death was not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 971 l(h)(3)(iii).\nHUTCHINSON, former Justice, did not participate in the decision of this case.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion in which NIX, C.J., joins.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2901.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3903.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3903.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711, Act of September 13, 1978, P.L. 756, No. 141, \u00a7 1, imd. effective; 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711.\n.

As noted, infra, the picture in question was from the victim\u2019s drivers\u2019 license, which was taken from appellant while he was in custody. Testimony from Mr. Alexander indicated that the victim may have been killed for the sole purpose of acquiring his identification, as appellant was wanted for parole violation. Had the Commonwealth argued for the introduction on the basis that it was the incentive for the shooting, or that the possession of it linked appellant to the victim, its introduction would certainly have been relevant.\n.

        "text": "ZAPPALA, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI must register my strenuous dissent to the determination reached by a majority of this court today allowing Appellant\u2019s nine-year old conviction for robbery to be used against him for purposes of impeachment. The application here of the per se rule first announced in Commonwealth v. Randall, 515 Pa. 410, 528 A.2d 1326 (1987), demonstrates in and of itself the absurdity and lack of logic inherent in the operation of such a rule and necessitates the restoration of the Bighum-Roots principle to our jurisprudence.\nThat the majority gives little attention or analysis to the impeachment issue in this case, one in which the imposition of the death penalty is sought, is indicative of the almost complete lack of comprehension of the prejudicial implications of introducing the mere fact of prior criminal acts, ostensibly to \u201cimpeach\u201d the credibility of the defendant-witness. In abandoning the balancing approach of Big-hum-Roots, which, for all its perceived shortcomings, provided a meaningful inquiry into the need for and relevance of such facially prejudicial evidence, as well as guidelines for its use, the majority has substituted a rule which, under the guise of simplicity, has injected a different and more dangerous measure of uncertainty and prejudice to any criminal defendant who has been previously convicted of a criminal offense.\nRandall, while claiming to simplify this issue by providing \u201cconcrete guidelines for the admission of prior conviction evidence\u201d, 528 A.2d at 1328, has, in my humble opinion, effectively \u201csevered the head because the nose would not stop bleeding,\u201d in its adoption of a per se rule, akin to F.R.E. 609(a)(1), (2) which favors admissibility.\nThe majority fails to consider that the approach taken is not legislatively favored in this Commonwealth. Indeed, the policy against using prior convictions against a criminal defendant is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5918 which provides:\n\u00a7 5918. Examination of defendant as to other offenses\nNo person charged with any crime and called as a witness in his own behalf, shall be asked, or if asked, shall be required to answer, any question tending to show that he has committed, or been convicted of any offense other than the one wherewith he shall then be charged, or tending to show that he has been of bad character or reputation unless:\n(1) he shall have at such trial, personally or by counsel, asked questions of the witness for the prosecution with a view to establish his own good reputation or character, or has given evidence tending to prove his own good character or reputation; or\n(2) he shall have testified at such trial against a codefendant, charged with the same offense.\nThe policy behind the above statute was succinctly expressed by Chief Justice (then Justice) Nix in Commonwealth v. Gullett, 459 Pa. 431, 329 A.2d 513, 517-18 (1974), when he stated:\nThe reason for the rejection of this evidence is not because it fails to have any probative value on the probability or the accused\u2019s guilt but rather that the presumed effect is to predispose the minds of the jury to an extent that it would unduly overshadow the presumption of innocence.\nThe rule announced in Randall is totally contrary to these policy considerations and permits the prosecution virtual carte blanche to do indirectly, under the guise of impeachment, what \u00a7 5918 prohibits it from doing directly \u2014 introducing evidence of prior crimes to infer the truth of present criminal allegations. It would be unfair to make this statement, however, without setting forth the underlying rationale for making it.\nWhile the majority in Randall vindicate their position as necessary to end the uncertainty of litigation and to reduce the number of appeals based on this issue, the opposite result has obtained. As stated, the per se rule requires two determinations prior to the introduction of this evidence. First, there is a requirement that the conviction sought to be introduced must involve dishonesty or false statement, crimen falsi. Second, the conviction date, or the last date of confinement, must be less than ten years from the date of trial. If these requirements are met, the offense is per se admissible. If not, the trial judge must then apply a balancing test and determine whether the value of the evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. Randall, 528 A.2d at 1329.\nAs applied, however, the prosecution has only one hurdle to overcome \u2014 the ten year hurdle. This hurdle becomes lower when one examines the ten year language. As stated, the ten year period runs from the date of conviction or the last day of confinement. In effect this period can be far greater than the stated ten years since, once convicted, the time of incarceration becomes the starting point for determining the run date.\nConsidering the disappearance of the first hurdle, that the conviction be one of crimen falsi, it is clear from the majority\u2019s analysis of the facts of the instant case that this requirement has been totally dispensed with. Since the Randall majority did not facially overrule the Big-hum-Roots requirement that the conviction be one involving crimen falsi, I would assume it axiomatic that the Commonwealth is still put to the burden of demonstrating the crimen falsi nature of the conviction. Unless all crimes are now deemed crimen falsi, or the term is limited to the traditional notions of crimen falsi, i.e. perjury, false swearing and embezzlement, the record of a conviction does not itself provide the underlying factual premise to establish the crimen falsi nature of an offense. In the case before us, however, the Commonwealth failed to present any evidence of the dishonest nature of the offense, and thus, even assuming, arguendo, that the Randall rationale were valid, its requirements were not met. The effect of this is to allow the jury to hear the Clerk of Courts state that the defendant was previously convicted of an offense, and nothing as it relates to how this testimony affects the defendant\u2019s credibility.\nA review of the handling of the impeachment issue before the trial court clearly reveals that the requirements of Bighum-Roots, unquestionably operant at the time of trial, were ignored by both the Commonwealth and the trial judge. It is this total failure to meaningfully evaluate the prior conviction at the suppression hearing that evinces a complete denial of Appellant\u2019s due process rights under then existing precedent. To now attempt to validate that denial by applying a new and different standard is unacceptable. While this jurisdiction has not clearly delimited the principals of application as to the prospectivity or retroactivity of a new change in existing evidentiary or procedural rules in situations such as the present, it is clear that court which have done so, most notably the U.S. Supreme Court, have required, in most instances, prospective application of new changes, with retroactive application being the exception. See, generally, Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 16 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965); Michigan v. Payne, 412 U.S. 47, 93 S.Ct. 1966, 36 L.Ed.2d 736 (1973); See especially, Gosa v. Mayden, 413 U.S. 665, 93 S.Ct. 2926, 37 L.Ed.2d 873 (1973), Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). Where retroactive application has been applied, it has been to benefit a defendant by allowing him the protection of an enlargement in a constitutional principal. Application of the Randall rule, in contrast, has the repugnant effect of not only forcing Appellant to conform to a standard that was not applicable at the time he was tried, but also to see the correctness of his appellate assertion fail, not because he is wrong in his theory of the law, but rather because the rule of evidence upon which he justifiably relied at trial has been altered, and evidence not admissible at that time has now become post facto valid. This is an affront to due process.\nIn Commonwealth v. Roots, 482 Pa. 33, 393 A.2d 364 (1978), we placed upon the Commonwealth the initial burden of showing that the need for using prior conviction evidence to impeach a defendant outweighed the inherent prejudice to the defendant. We stated, \u201c[w]e do not assume the admissibility of this impeachment evidence absent a substantial showing of prejudice by the defendant. Rather, the burden is upon the prosecution to show that the need for this evidence overcomes its inherent potential for prejudice.\u201d Id. 482 Pa. at 40-41, 393 A.2d at 368. (Citations omitted) (emphasis supplied).\nAt the suppression hearing, Appellant requested that the court prohibit the Commonwealth from using a prior robbery conviction approximately nine years old, involving the theft of an automobile and the robbery of an individual therein. He argued that the evidence would be highly prejudicial in that the similarity of the prior conviction to the allegations in the instant case would allow the jury to draw an unwarranted inference of guilt. When asked to respond to this allegation the Commonwealth declined and stated to the court that it would rely upon its brief. That brief is not contained in the record, nor is any other record showing by the Commonwealth present. I can therefore only conclude that the Commonwealth has indeed failed to meet its burden.\nEven assuming that the Commonwealth had met its initial burden, it was then the duty of the trial court to apply the remainder of the Roots analysis, 482 Pa. at 39-40, 393 A.2d at 367. This was not done. In reviewing these factors, the trial court must carefully evaluate the competing interests rather than merely recite the five factors verbatim. We held that \"... [t]here must be a meaningful exercise of discretion in these cases and that the former per se rule of admissibility has been expressly repudiated.\u201d Id., 482 Pa. at 39, 393 A.2d- at 367 (emphasis added). In the instant case, it is clear that no meaningful review of the factors was undertaken. To illustrate this, I set forth the review of the relevant factors, and the disposition of each by the trial court. As to factor No. 1, the Court stated:\nTHE COURT: The law, I think, is relatively clear, I\u2019m supposed to consider certain factors in determining how justice balances out and what is fair.\nThe factors are, first, the degree to which the commission of the prior offense reflects upon the veracity of the defendant-witness. It is my understanding that the Commonwealth, if permitted, would use the conviction in 1975 for the offense of burglary, larceny of a vehicle?\nMR. PILLETS: That is correct, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And obviously those crimes have been construed in this Commonwealth to constitute appropriate offenses for impeachment purposes ...\nN.T. Vol. 1, pp. 307-08.\nAs can be seen, there was absolutely no discussion or analysis relative to the weighing of this factor. Instead it is clear that the trial court merely relied upon the offense\u2019s per se admissibility based upon prior court decisions, not quoted or cited, which may or may not have involved other factors more directly affecting credibility.\nAs to the second factor, the court stated:\nTHE COURT: Second, a likelihood in view of the nature and extent of the prior record, that it would have a greater tendency to smear the character of the defendant and suggest a propensity to commit the crime for which he stands charged rather than providing a legitimate reason for discrediting him as an untruthful person.\nAgain, it is my understanding that the defendant has a record of, in addition to these offenses, of three armed robbery, or three robbery convictions, at least one of which was armed, is that correct?\nMR. PILLETS: Yes, at least one of which was armed, and also for kidnapping.\nTHE COURT: And the Commonwealth, however, only proposes, if permitted, to use the last which is a crime of burglary and the auto larceny.\nMR. PILLETS: Correct.\nN.T. Vol. 1, p. 308.\nAgain the trial court provided no meaningful discussion of this factor. Little more was done than to enumerate prior convictions of the defendant and strike the \u201cbalance\u201d by acknowledging that less than all prior convictions would be introduced. That they were clearly similar to the crimes for which he is now being charged and would tend to create in the minds of the jury the impression that because Appellant had committed this type of crime in the past, he has committed the present crime, was completely ignored by the trial court.\nAs to the third factor:\nTHE COURT: The Third requirement is the age and circumstances of the defendant \u2014 -the defendant is how old?\nMR. LUMBIS: Thirty-two.\nTHE COURT: Thirty-two years of age. The circumstances of the defendant, as far as I know, is that he is obviously incarcerated without bail, has been and apparently during the pendency of this trial and depending upon the outcome, will continue to be.\nN.T. Vol. 1, pp. 308-09.\nThis was the extent of discussion on factor Three. Merely stating the age of the appellant and where he is presently residing falls far short of a meaningful exercise of discretion relative to this factor. The proper inquiry should have been whether the prior crimes were committed as a minor.\nAs to the fourth factor:\nTHE COURT: Fourth is the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case and the prosecution\u2019s need to resort to this evidence as compared with the availability to the defense of other witness through which his version of the events surrounding the incident can be presented.\nIt would appear to the Court that the essential incidents involved in this case are known, if at all, to two people, and one of which is allegedly the defendant and the other is allegedly Mr. Alexander, as to the essential elements of the actual killing.\nTo the extent that the Commonwealth\u2019s case rests in large measure upon Mr. Alexander and in view of the fact that the law provides that information coming from him comes in a sense from a corrupt source.\nThe Commonwealth may not have available to it a lot of evidence concerning this case. On the other hand I also recognize that the defendant is in a similar predicament in that he has indicated an alibi defense and has further indicated that he has been unable to identify those who could support his alibi.\nMR. KOSTELANSKY: Judge, I have one other thing, in addition to the homicide there are other charges, the theft, kidnapping are the things dealing with articles and the Commonwealth has offered, even in the suppression hearing, testimony with regard to that, other than James Alexander, so we are not balancing only one charge, there are several other charges that the defendant is charged with.\nTHE COURT: Well, on the major charge against you, that essentially is going to be decided by two people. There may be other collateral evidence or circumstantial evidence which comes from the traveling together, whatever might have been seized, but essentially it appears the Commonwealth\u2019s case \u2014 correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 is based upon Mr. Alexander.\nMR. EICHORN: In a large measure, your Honor, yes, sir, that is a fair statement.\nTHE COURT: Can the defense offer to me any other alternative that the Commonwealth would have to directly impeach the credibility of the defendant as regards the alleged homicide other than, let\u2019s say, Mr. Alexander\u2019s testimony, if they are not permitted to use this conviction. MR. KOSTELANSKI: They have essentially what is circumstantial evidence which will be presented. I am not aware of any other direct evidence the defense is going to offer in this case, testimony that was not presented her [sic] today. The Commonwealth has witnesses who will indicate that they started out together, at least based on the police report that I have been provided, by Mr. Alexander as well as Mr. Strong together and tie it to the yellow T-shirt which has been identified along the way by various people, some of which the Court has had the opportunity to hear by virtue of the suppression hearings that were held here, in addition to the circumstances as part of the criminal history and the arrest and the testimony of Officer Hill and the references that are going to be made in the presentation that Mr. Strong presented the Texas and Pennsylvania identification when questioned as to his identity. There was the victim\u2019s identification that he had upon him, either in the bag \u2014 I can\u2019t recall if he took it out of or off the person or in the bag that he discovered the wallet which was the victim\u2019s and those circumstances there, the gun, those kind of items.\nSo I think when you weigh all those factors first the case is much more than James Alexander alone. It is true on the one issue but there\u2019s circumstantial evidence which I\u2019m going to be arguing that will corroborate his testimony.\nOf course, it\u2019s the only position of the defendant is only his own testimony of the defense of the charges as it stands right now. As I indicated to the Court I think it\u2019s a fair statement to make at this time, a fair assumption on anybody\u2019s part that that is not going to change unless there\u2019s a major miracle and I don\u2019t expect that.\nTHE COURT: All right. I am satisfied on the basis of the record presented to me that the 1975 conviction of this defendant for burglary and larceny of an automobile presents Bighum offenses; and, I am also satisfied that the Commonwealth \u2014 or satisfied that the burden, that the probative value of the evidence of those convictions as it bears on the credibility of the defendant as a witness outweighs the prejudicial effect it could have upon the jury and I think that the need for the evidence in this case overcomes any inherent potential it might have to prejudice and, accordingly, the motion to preclude the Commonwealth from using those offenses for impeachment purposes should the defendant testify is denied.\nN.T. Vol. 1, pp. 309-12. (Emphasis added)\nNo discussion was had to the fifth, extremely important factor, the existence of alternative means of attacking the defendant\u2019s credibility is present. As to the discussion of the fourth factor, the trial court determined that there was a possibility that the case would consist of the conflicting testimony of Appellant and Alexander. As such, the Court weighed what it perceived to be a standoff in favor of the Commonwealth.\nFrom this review, I find that the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in determining the propriety of admitting Appellant\u2019s prior conviction was woefully inadequate. The court failed to even recognize the fact that the conviction sought to be introduced was almost nine years old, a factor, I concede, the Randall majority would now also discredit. Nor did it take into account whether other means were available for attacking Appellant\u2019s credibility, an important factor since he was the only one to testify on his own behalf during the trial. Where a defendant\u2019s own testimony is the only means by which he can present his version of the truth before the jury, we have stressed that \"... it is more important to the search for truth in a particular case for the jury to hear the defendant\u2019s story than to know of a prior conviction.\u201d Roots, 482 Pa. at 41, 393 A.2d at 368, quoting Com. v. Bighum, 452 Pa. 554, 567, 307 A.2d 255, 263 (1973).\nUsing the above analysis, I would hold that it was error to allow Appellant\u2019s prior 1975 conviction for robbery to be introduced for the purpose of impeachment in his trial. Under the law applicable at the time of trial, the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of showing that the need for that evidence outweighed its inherently prejudicial nature and further because the trial court failed to adequately evaluate and balance the factors set forth in Roots in allowing the evidence to be admitted.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I have no other alternative but to dissent.\nNIX, C.J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
