The estate of p, decedent, composed of United States securities, passing collaterally, is liable to collateral inheritance tax.\n2. Such tax is not on a specific article, but on the estate of the decedent.\n3. The acceptance by distributees of specific articles without conversion, in payment of their shares, does not relieve them from collateral inheritance tax.\n4. Theoretically, the balance on an administration account is cash."
