    "head_matter": "Frantz\u2019s Appeal.\nAn alien inhabitant of the state is liable to taxation for municipal purposes of every description, and the Acts of Assembly warrant no distinction in this respect, between inhabitants who are citizens and those who are not.\nAppeal from the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne county. In Equity.\nThis was a bill by Nicholas Frantz to restrain Jacob Robinson, Joseph Platt and Thomas Dickson, commissioners to carry out certain Acts of Assembly authorizing the raising money to pay bounties in the borough of Scranton, from collecting from the complainant the tax assessed for that purpose.\nIn a case stated, it was agreed that the complainant is an alien, and the only question raised was whether as such he was liable to taxation. The court below (Conyngham, P. J.) decided that he was so liable, and dismissed the bill, which was the error assigned.\nE. E. Wright and D. C. Harrington, for appellant,\ncited 1 Bl.
