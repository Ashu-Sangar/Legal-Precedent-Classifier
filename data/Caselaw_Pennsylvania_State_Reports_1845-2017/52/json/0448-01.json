    "head_matter": "Borough of Petersburg versus Noss.\nUnder the Act of March 25th 1864, \u00a7 12, a borough whose authorities had paid no bounties to volunteers cannot levy a tax to pay bounties to veterans, although bounties have been paid to volunteers by the voluntary subscriptions of the citizens.\nAppeal from the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Perry county. In Equity.\nSamuel Noss and Nathan Yanfossen filed a bill against the council of the borough of Petersburg, to restrain them from levying a tax to pay bounties to nineteen veterans who had reenlisted in Tennessee, and had been credited to the borough; the remainder of the borough\u2019s quota had been filled by volunteers who had received bounties from voluntary contributions of the citizens. The council answered that the tax was authorized by \u00a7 12 of the Act of March 25th 1864, viz.: \u201c In case any .veteran soldiers who have re-enlisted, and have not been credited to any special locality, shall hereafter be credited, on the present draft, to the locality from which they originally volunteered, such veterans shall be paid by the local authorities, whose duty is to pay bounties, \"such bounties as under the provisions of this act shall be paid to volunteers from said locality.\u201d\nThe court (Graham, P. J.) granted an injunction as prayed for, which was the error assigned.\nW. A. iSponsler and B. P. Junhin, for the appellants.\nThe Reporter, had no paper-book for appellees."
