        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, October 17th 1866, by\nRead, J.\nAt the time Alexander Calder executed the mortgage to William C. Marshall and Walker Marshall of the 30 acres called the \u201c Factory Lot,\u201d included in the boundaries of a larger piece of land embraced in the mortgage, the mortgagor had no title or estate of any kind in the said \u201c Factory Lot.\u201d The mortgage was dated November 1st 1853, and recorded on the 3d.\nAt the time of the execution, Israel Chapman was the undisputed owner of the 30 acres, and he died in July 1854; and Abner Chapman, who was one of the sons of Israel, with the executors and other heirs of the said decedent, by deed dated September 21st 1854, conveyed the \u201c Factory Lot\u201d to Alexander Calder.\nThe judgment of Yan Dusen & Jagger against Alexander Calder was entered August 5th 1858 ; and, on the 23d of August 1862, the \u201c Factory Lot\u201d was sold thereon, by the sheriff, to Abner Chapman, and deed executed to him and acknowledged by the sheriff, September 4th 1862. The moneys arising from the said sale being applied to an earlier judgment of Hornbeck v. Calder.\nThe Marshalls proceeded on the mortgage, and on the 2d September 1862, the sheriff, under levari facias, sold the larger tract, including the thirty-acre \u201c Factory Lot,\u201d to the plaintiffs, the Marshalls; the deed to them was executed and acknowledged September 4th 1862.\nThe question is, by these sales who became the owner of the Factory Lot ?\u201d Was it Chapman, or the Marshalls ?\nIt is said, \u201c that if a man sells and conveys land to which he has no right or title, and afterwards buys or acquires the title to the same land, he cannot claim it as against his grantee and, whether this rule is based on estoppel or rebutter, or upon the equity \"as practised in Pennsylvania by which that which ought to be done is considered as done, is perhaps immaterial, as the effects of our recording acts must be the same in either case.\nThis whole subject has been fully ventilated by Judge Hare in his very able note to the Duchess of Kingston\u2019s Case, in \u2022 2 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cas. pp. 705, 723-4 (ed. 1866), and in Mr. Rawle\u2019s excellent work on Covenants for Title (3d ed.), ch. 9; and perhaps the most succinct statement of the doctrine is to be found in the very clear and lucid opinion of Mr. Justice Nelson, in Van Rensselaer v. Kearney, 11 How. 297. \u201c It is a doctrine, therefore,\u201d said he, \u201c when properly understood and applied, that concludes the truth in order to prevent fraud and falsehood, and imposes silence on a party only where, in conscience and honesty, _he should not be allowed to speak.\u201d\nNow, in the present case, in searching for encumbrances or conveyances, the search against Calder would begin with his title from Chapman, and the search beyond would be against Chapman and those through whom he claimed; and a search against Oalder during the same period would be considered an utter absurdity. If the mortgage and the conveyance were ten years apart, the case would only be more glaring than the one presented to us.\nIn Uhler v. Hutchinson, 11 Harris 110, it was held that the holder of an unrecorded mortgage, or of a mortgage illegally recorded, by giving notice of its existence, at a sheriff\u2019s sale upon a judgment, cannot bind the estate mortgaged in the hands of a purchaser at such sale, where the judgment-creditor had no notice of the mortgage when his judgment was entered. In this case the mortgage had a defective acknowledgment. So, where the mortgage is made by an absolute conveyance with a deed of defeasance, and the defeasance is unrecorded, it is decided that it will be considered as an unrecorded mortgage ; and where the absolute deed and the defeasance were recorded in the same volume, on the same day, and though it did not expressly so appear most probably in juxtaposition, C. J. Gibson said, \u201c The principle applicable to them is the same: a creditor in search of a clue to the title would necessarily stop at a conveyanee absolute on the face of it, and referring to nothing beyond it, he would have no reason to suspect that further search would lead to a defeasance, of which, not lying in the channel of the title, he would not, though actually recorded, be bound to take notice.\u201d \u201c If the record of the encumbrance lay not in the creditor\u2019s way, he was not bound to notice it:\u201d McLanahan v. Reeside, 9 Watts 510, 511. And, in Luch\u2019s Appeal, 8 Wright 519, it was held that mortgages must be recorded in mortgage-books, and are not properly recorded in any other species of books, where they cannot be found by means of the mortgage-index. In that case the mortgage was recorded in the Book of Miscellanies in Northampton county, and it was held to 'be an unrecorded mortgage.\nThese decisions rule this case, and there is no hardship on the mortgagees; for an examination of the title when they took the mortgage must have shown them Calder had no title to the \u201c Factory Lot\u201d ; an innocent creditor should not suffer for their gross negligence.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Calder versus Chapman.\n1. Calder purchased a tract of land, excepting out of it a described lot; he then mortgaged the whole, not making any exception of the \u201clot,\u201d and afterwards became owner of the \u201c lot.\u201d A judgment was subsequently entered against him, under which the lot was sold; after the sale the whole tract was sold under the mortgage. Held, that the purchaser under the judgment acquired the title to the lot.\n2. The search for encumbrances against Calder on the lot, would begin with the conveyance to him; there would therefore be no notice of the mortgage against him.\n3. The doctrine1 of estoppel concludes the truth in order to prevent fraud and falsehood, and imposes silence on a party only when in conscience and honesty he should not be allowed to speak.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Wayne county.\nThis was an action of ejectment by Abner Chapman against Alexander Calder, William C. Marshall and Walker Marshall, for a tract of about 30 acres of land. Israel Chapman and Alexander Calder being the joint owners of a large tract of land, made partition, and Chapman conveyed to Calder the one-half, \u201c excepting from and out of the above described premises the undivided two-thirds part of the \u2018Factory Lot.\u2019\u201d Subsequently, under proceedings in partition, Chapman acquired title to the whole \u201cFactory Lot.\u201d Afterwards, November 1st 1853, Calder mortgaged to the Marshalls, defendants, the whole tract, describing it by metes and bounds, which included the \u201cFactory Lot.\u201d The lot was not excepted from the mortgage. Chapman having died, his executors conveyed the \u201c Factory Lot\u201d to Calder, September 21st 1854. On the 5th of August 1858, a judgment was recovered against Calder, under which the \u201c Factory Lot\u201d was sold to Abner Chapman, plaintiff, and conveyed to him by the sheriff, September 4th 1862. The whole tract was, on the 2d of September 1862, sold by the sheriff to the Marshalls under their mortgage. Chapman then brought this action of ejectment.\nOn the trial, Barrett, P. J., charged, amongst other things:\u2014\n\u201c The question raised is, Whether the \u201c Factory Lot\u201d was bound by the mortgage. As between the parties it clearly would have been. The mortgagor might have perfected his title to the land for the benefit of the mortgagee. But we have to deal with subsequent lien-creditors. The judgment was entered against property acquired subsequent to the mortgage. It became at once a lien. A judicial sale conveyed it clear of any lien under the mortgage.\n\u201c As between the lien-creditors the judgment had preference. But however that may have been, it was a judicial sale, and the title to the \u201cFactory Lot\u201d passed to the plaintiff. If Chapman was an innocent purchaser, then he took it discharged from the lien of the mortgage. If he was not, did the record furnish him notice of any lien ? It must have shown that the title to the lot was acquired subsequently to the making and recording of the mortgage. This being the fact, the verdict of the jury must be for the plaintiff.\u201d\nThe jury having found for the plaintiff, this instruction was assigned for error.\nF. M. Crane, for plaintiffs in error.\nDoes the mortgage cover the land subsequently acquired by Calder, and does the title enure to the benefit of the mortgagee ?\nThe legal title of the land is in the mortgagee: Lyle v.

Albright and Others, 4 Whart. 291; Stonebreaker v. Short et al., 8 Barr 155. Whatever may be the effect of a mortgage as between the parties \u2014mortgagor and mortgagee, \u2014 as between creditors it is only a chose in action, an encumbrance, a lien upon the land: Claason\u2019s Appeal, 10 Harris 359; Craft, to use of Powell, v.
