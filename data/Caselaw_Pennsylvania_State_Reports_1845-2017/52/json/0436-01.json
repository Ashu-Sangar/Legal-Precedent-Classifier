Let it be supposed, as said by Justice Rogers in Zeigler v. Fisher, 3 Barr 367, that there may be still a plea in abatement or something tantamount in case of extraordinary emergency, and by Kennedy, J., in Campbell v. Galbreath, 5 Watts 428, yet it does not follow that there must be. By the 4th section of the Act of 13th April 1807, it is enacted that \u201c the plea in ejectment shall be '\u2022Not Guilty.\u201d It has always been held that any available defence may be taken under this plea; while, indeed, some have' thought no other plea can be pleaded in the face of the statute. Whatever may be the common-law rule in other actions, in ejectment \u201cnot guilty\u201d is the general-issue plea; and we are of opinion coverture may be given in evidence under it.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Black versus Tricker.\nIn ejectment the general-issue plea is Not Guilty, and under it, coverture or any other available defence may be taken.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Bedford county.\nThis was an action of ejectment, commenced August 14th 1865, by John Black, Michael McCulloch and John McDermott, against Catharine Tricker.\nThe plaintiffs held a judgment against George Tricker, the husband of defendant, under which they levied on a house and lots, which were sold to them by the sheriff, and for the possession of which this ejectment was brought. After its commencement, a rule was taken \u201c on the defendant to file an abstract of her title and a specification of special facts and equitable matter which she intends to rely upon. November 27th 1865, defendant files her abstract, &c., want of title in plaintiffs,\u201d &c.\nThe plaintiffs having proved the sale by the sheriff to them as above stated, and that defendant was the wife of George Tricker, rested. Two of plaintiff\u2019s points were:\u2014\n1. That the plaintiffs, having shown a sheriff\u2019s deed of the title of George Tricker to themselves for the land in dispute, are entitled to recover against the defendant in the original judgment, and all who held under him, without showing any other title, and that the present defendant holds under George Tricker, the defendant in the judgment upon which the sale was made.\n2. That the plaintiffs are entitled to recover as against the wife, and she cannot set up coverture as a defence under the circumstances of this case, because if coverture was a defence she was bound to plead it in abatement.\nThe court (King, P. J.) charged:\u2014\n\u201c The evidence in this case on the part of the plaintiffs discloses the fact that the defendant is a married woman, with a husband in full life, and we therefore instruct you that the action cannot be maintained. They could not recover unless they had shown that the defendant came into possession of the property in dispute under George Tricker, as whose property it was sold by the sheriff. In attempting to do this they prove that the defendant was Tricker\u2019s wife, and this fact defeats their action, as a married woman cannot be sued alone. If we are correct in this position, it necessarily follows that the points submitted by plaintiff\u2019s counsel cannot be affirmed.\u201d\nThe verdict being for the defendant, this was the error assigned.\nRussell and Kimmell, for plaintiffs in error,\ncited Milner v. Milner, 3 T. R. 627; Campbell v. Galbreath, 5 Watts 428 ; Zeigler v. Fisher, 3 Barr 365.\nPetrihen and Cessna, for defendant in error,\ncited Williams and Wife v. Coward and Wife, 2 Phila.
