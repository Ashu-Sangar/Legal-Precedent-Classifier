Seybert, Sarah K. Seybert, Lydia A. Seybert and J. B. Seybert, against The Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad Co., for burning a building of the plaintiffs. The building was near the railroad.- As a train of empty coal-cars was passing, the building was discovered to be on fire. The train was drawn by a coal-burning engine, on which there was no spark catcher. The day was dry and windy, and the train was running with ordinary care and skill. There was no direct evidence that the building was fired by the engine, or that sparks were emitted from it at the time.</p>

Such an instruction would have taken away all the facts from the jury, and have made the court decide both the law and the facts.</p>

The use, therefore, of fire with its necessary concomitants, is legal, and the limit imposed upon its use is, that the latest improvements in its management in practical use should be applied to it.</p>

An <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>anthracite coal burner will not admit of a screen or spark catcher of wire, but will of a screen or spark catcher of tank iron with apertures of three-eighths of an inch, such as are used on the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, the greatest coal road of the country, and on the Delaware and Belvidere Railroad. On the Reading road coal-burning engines are used both for coal and freight and passengers. About 120 engines burning coal pass in and out of Reading daily, and an average of about 70 engines burning coal pass in and out of the depot at Broad and Callowhill streets daily, and no accidents by sparks from their locomotives have happened in the present year in the cities of Reading and Philadelphia.</p>

No such reason applied to the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad, which follows the course of the Susquehanna.</p>

It is clear then that the coal-burner was without the improvements introduced long ago on the Reading Railroad ; it would seem, therefore, on this ground alone, the court could not have given the instruction prayed for.</p>
