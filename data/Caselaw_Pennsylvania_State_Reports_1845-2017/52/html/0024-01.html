The grantee <em>literally </em>complied with the contract. If the rent is not a debt but an estate, it is subject to the right of the grantee to purchase it for a certain price, at a time fixed by his option, in currency then legal. When the option is exercised, the price becomes a debt. If the covenant itself had fixed the day of payment, at that day it would have become a debt; the circumstances of this case produced the same result.</p>
