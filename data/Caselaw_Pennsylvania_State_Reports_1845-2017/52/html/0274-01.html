Is there anything which can be interpreted to have that effect, and to cut doAvn the legal signification to a failure of issue at the death of the first taker ? In regard to personal property very slight circumstances are laid hold of, as sufficient to indicate an intention that a limitation over on death without issue shall take effect at a definite time, to wit, on the death of the first taker: Bedford’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%2022" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Wright 22">4 Wright 22</a>; Diehl <em>v. </em>King, 6 S. &amp; R. 32; Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Barnetz, 17 Id. 295. The limitation over to persons in being, after the death of the first taker, of itself, it has often been held, raises a strong presumption that the testator did not contemplate an indefinite failure of issue. Here such presumption arises in full force, for the limitation over was expressly to his daughters Elizabeth and Susanna, then living.</p>

The legacy is to be <em>due </em>and <em>payable </em>to the sisters ‘ immediately <em>there </em>after of John’s death.’ Now, this is directly opposed to the idea of an indefinite failure of issue. If it entered into the mind of the testator that John might die before his wife Anna, it cannot be supposed he did not intend the <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>limitation to take effect upon Anna’s death, without issue. She did survive her husband, and a contingency which the testator did not express happened. It must have been his intention that, as soon as John was out of the way, whether he died before or after his wife, upon her death without issue, the gift over should immediately vest. Any other construction involves an absurdity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b277-6" data-blocks='[["BL_277.6",277,[269,716,1160,1027]]]'>“ A period is fixed for the legacy to become <em>1 </em>due and payable,’ that is, immediately after John’s death. This was an event certain to take place ; and though the period was not, and could not, be as definitely determined as it was in the case of Nichols <em>v. </em>Hooper, 1 P. Wms. 198, 2 Jarman 311, which was a case held to relate to real estate, this principle must apply here. The postponement being only to the happening of an event certain to take place, and not beyond the time or limitation allowed by law, the contingency was not too remote. But when was it intended by the testator the limitation over to the ulterior legatees should vest ? Surely not at the death of John, for nothing is given to him, he was not indicated as a beneficiary, the payment to the sisters of Anna was merely postponed during life. Why this was cannot be clearly determined, but there must have been some time for the legacy to vest in them. That time was her death.; and the rule is where the postponement of distribution takes place from considerations not connected with the legatee personally, but attributable to some motive of convenience to the estate of the testator, the vesting will relate back to the anterior event — that was in this case the death of Anna. If, then, it was the intention the legacy should vest in the ulterior legatees on the death of Anna, the idea of an indefinite failure of issue must be dismissed, and it must be held the testator meant a failure of issue at her death only, which disposes of the case.</p>

But surely he can have no claim on this ground, when the testator expressly excluded the first husband from such a pretension. Besides, the word ‘ heirs,’ as used in this will, is to be treated as a word of limitation, and not as a word of description.
