The plaintiff was a dealer in grain and produce at Pittsburgh, where he resided, that being his <em>ordinary </em>and regular market. His purchases were made in Western Pennsylvania, Ohio and elsewhere, and the goods were shipped to him at Pittsburgh. In January 1863 he bought wheat at' Cincinnati, and had it shipped by river to him at Pittsburgh. When it arrived, he put it in store for sale; subsequently he shipped a portion by railroad to Philadelphia, that city offering for the time a better market.</p>

It is this excess over local freight that is sought to be recovered back. The question is, whether the plaintiffs’ grain was “ local freight” within the meaning 'of the Commutation Act. <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>It clearly was not if the definitions of local freight in the two cases cited above are to be followed. It was neither a domestic product nor was it sent from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia in the exercise of a domestic trade, but was imported for manufacturing an article of trade. If such an article coming from abroad for such a purpose can be regarded as local freight, then everything which a citizen may import would be local freight, whether teas from China or hides from Brazil, and the distinction which the statute creates would be obliterated.</p>

It does not present the question, either in form or principle, that was litigated in Sandford <em>v. </em>The Catawissa Railroad Co., 12 Harris 378, for the distinction complained of here is not created by <em>corporate </em>action, so much as by <em>legislative power. </em>And, although the distinction between this case and Can-field’s is nice, yet it is as appreciable as the distinction between a merchant and a manufacturer. We think we are guilty of no inconsistency in affirming this decree after what we decided in that case.</p>
