Marshall and Walker Marshall, for a tract of about 30 acres of land. Israel Chapman and Alexander Calder being the joint owners of a large tract of land, made partition, and Chapman conveyed to Calder the one-half, “ excepting from and out of the above described premises the undivided two-thirds part of the ‘Factory Lot.’” Subsequently, under proceedings in partition, Chapman acquired title to the whole “Factory Lot.” Afterwards, November 1st 1853, Calder mortgaged to the Marshalls, defendants, the whole tract, describing it by metes and bounds, which included the “Factory Lot.” The lot was not excepted from the mortgage. Chapman having died, his executors conveyed the “ Factory Lot” to Calder, September 21st 1854. On the 5th of August 1858, a judgment was recovered against Calder, under which the “ Factory Lot” was sold to Abner Chapman, plaintiff, and conveyed to him by the sheriff, September 4th 1862. The whole tract was, on the 2d of September 1862, sold by the sheriff to the Marshalls under their mortgage. Chapman then brought this action of ejectment.</p>
