In every such case, and in backing any train, the conductor or an experienced and trusty brakeman must be stationed on the top of the car, to signal, and in full view of the engineer. Wheré the track cannot be seen for half a mile, the speed must not exceed four miles per hour.”</p>

On the night of November 26th 1862, a rail was broken north of Muncy Station. Armstrong and others, by Mulligan’s direction, started on-a hand-car down the road south from Muncy Station, to get help to repair the road, and hearing the Catawissa freight train coming up they took their hand-car from the track and signalled the train to stop, which it did about a mile from the station. Armstrong went to the train and told the engineer about the broken rail above Muncy; but, in answer to the engineer’s inquiry, told him that he could run to Muncy and do his work. The train went on to Muncy; the men, expecting the train was on the siding, put the hand-ear on the track and followed the train, for the purpose of going to the place of the broken rail; as the handcar was going it was struck by the freight train backing, and Armstrong was killed; the disaster occurred about midnight, the night being dark. The evidence was that there were two lights on the front of the hand-car, that Armstrong stood facing the station, that there was a “ dim” light on one side of the last car in the freight train, that there was no person on the rear end of the train, and that there was no signal by the bell. The evidence as to whether the train went back more than once, and also whether the whistle sounded, was conflicting.</p>

You must put a value upon the life of Michael Armstrong, his probable gains and accumulations, and award to his widow such an amount of damages as a careful and impartial examination of the evidence seems to demand. The Supreme Court have said, and we say to you, that it would be wrong to limit the value of a man’s life by his probable accumulations. In estimating the amount of damages, it would be proper for you to consider the age of Michael Armstrong, at the time he was so suddenly killed. He was probably about forty years of age, as stated by Martin Lynch, having a wife and six children to support. He was a labouring man and enjoyed good health; was receiving at the time of his death 90 cents per day for his labour. Since then wages have increased from 90 cents, $1.20, $1.40 and $1.70, and are now about $1.50. How long he would have lived if this accident had not happened, we have no means of determining, and how long, if he had lived, his health would have been preserved, we cannot tell.”</p>

It is argued, and with apparent propriety, that Armstrong was“ the man” who went and conversed with Kneeht, though there were several others on the hand-car with him (Mulligan, Collins and Lynch), and the signal to stop was given by order of Mulligan. The judge apparently forgot to connect the conversation had by Kneeht with the fact that Armstrong went to the train after it stopped, though this fact is not conclusive evidence that Knecht’s conversation was with Armstrong instead of one of the other three men. But grant the blunder, of what consequence was it ? Two or three times the judge referred the whole evidence to the jury, and it appears from the charge that he read Knecht’s testimony in full; so that if Kneeht did indeed prove what passed between him and Armstrong, the jury had it fairly placed before them, and could not possibly be misled by the judge’s erroneous comment. It was not an instance of misstated testimony, still less of suppressed testimony, but was at most an inaccurate comment on a piece of comparatively very unimportant evidence, furnishing at the same time to the jury the surest means of correcting the mistake.</p>

The court affirmed the doctrine of the point in respect to Armstrong’s negligence, but said it was a question of fact for the jury whether such negligence contributed to his death. This is the part of the answer that is complained of. The point was that, <em>“ </em>If the jury believed that Armstrong approached the train in the manner disclosed in the evidence, without looking for signal or whether the train was on the siding, <em>he was guilty of such negligence as contributed to- his own </em>death, <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>and the plaintiff cannot recover.” What acts and conduct con stitut® negligence, or rather, whether a given state of facts constitutes negligence, is generally a question of law, and was in this case so declared by the judge. But whether a particular negligence contributed to the catastrophe under investigation must, from the nature of the injury, be treated as a question of fact, and when counsel insisted upon such a deduction being made, they ought not to complain that the court referred it to the jury to make it. If they could not'persuade the jury to make the deduction, it was not the court’s fault.</p>
    <p id="Aor" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[325,875,1147,384]]]'>Whether the facts in proof constituted any negligence on the part of Armstrong, might very reasonably be doubted in view of what was said of them by my brother Thompson when this case was here last year, but the plaintiff in error has nothing to complain of in the court’s judgment of these facts on the last trial. As an abstract proposition the negligence was affirmed, and the jury was permitted to find whether it contributed to the accident. This disposition of the point was as favourable to the company as they had any right to expect.</p>
    <p id="b286-7" data-blocks='[["BL_286.7",286,[324,1257,1148,1064]]]'>The only remaining assignment of error relates to the instruction given on the measure of damages. The action was brought by a wife for the killing of her husband, and the jury were instructed to put.a value upon his life, and in doing this, to have regard to his probable gains and accumulations, his age, his health, his usual wages and the family he had to support. We have said that in this class of actions all that can be sought or recovered is pecuniary indemnity for a pecuniary loss, and we think nothing else was submitted to the jury in this instance. The value of a husband’s life in a wife’s action at law for damages for killing him means the pecuniary value; how much better in her pecuniary resources and prospects would she be with him than without him. The obligation to support herself and the children is transferred by his death from him to her, and her chance to be endowed out of his future accumulations is destroyed; S,nd these are pecuniary injuries to her, and deserve redress at the hands of the party who caused them. In the nature of things there can be no fixed standard for their admeasurement; the discretion of a jury properly instructed and directed is the standard. When such questions have been committed to juries without instructions that pointed them to the right elements of an estimate, we have reversed judgments; but when, as here, the true grounds of estimate are suggested and explained, the judge has done his whole duty, except to see that extravagant verdicts, if rendered, be not sustained.</p>
