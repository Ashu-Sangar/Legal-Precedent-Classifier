It cannot be said for what the viewers gave damages; it may be for erections of stone, and since 1841. The adjudication, if it was one, was without notice or hearing.

L. 419), for the sale of the canals of the state to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company ; and, secondly, upon the antecedent legislation of the Commonwealth in relation to damages upon this division of the canals.</p>
    <p id="b122-10" data-blocks='[["BL_122.12",122,[291,2341,1149,128]],["BL_123.1",123,[203,464,1152,513]]]'>The strength of the argument, to deduce a liability from the 7th section of the Act of 1858, fastens itself upon the generality of the words, “ any and all claims for damages or other demands <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>against the Commonwealth.” Unquestionably the legislature intended every claim to be preferred and considered. Its object was to shut out no one from a hearing. But the operative words which fix the character of the claim are, “ <em>if </em>established.” It is only the established claims the section orders the purchaser to pay, and as an evidence of the sense in which these words are used, it further declares, “ but in any case the purchaser shall have notice and an opportunity to be heard against the allowance of such demands.” What is meant by establishing a claim or demand ? ¡.Certainly it is to show the right to have it allowed. The right, therefore, must be shown, and this right depends on the duty to pay.</p>
    <p id="b123-5" data-blocks='[["BL_123.6",123,[203,977,1158,590]]]'>The obligation is the correlative of the right, and both must exist in order to establish the demand. If the Commonwealth was under no duty to pay, it is clear the claimant had no right to have his damages allowed. It is only by striking out the words “ if established” the section can be made to require payment of all claims of every kind. The 7th section is not to be read alone or apart from the main intent of the whole act. The 5th section declares, <em>“ </em>That the said company, their successors and assigns, shall hold, possess, use and enjoy the said property free and discharged from all encumbrances, except as provided in this act.”’ The term encumbrances, and the intent that the purchase should be enjoyed free of aught else, tend strongly to determine the character of the demands which were first to be established and then allowed.</p>

Aside from the language of these sections, the leading design of the law sheds light on the particular provision. It is not a grant of privileges imposing duties as their consideration, but. an offer of sale with terms to invite acceptance. It was not the interest of the Commonwealth, and therefore not her motive, to impose burdens which must repel. Indefiniteness in the terms and uncertainty in the encumbrances would tend to defeat her purpose. If we interpret the provision to mean any claim which referees might think it proper to allow, the burden is indefinite, and such as a purchaser would decline. If it mean a new class of liabilities undefined in the law, the uncertainty will create distrust. This division of the public works having existed almost a generation without a thought by the Commonwealth that her justice demanded a recognition of these supposed equities, there was no reason she should adopt them to the prejudice of her contemplated sale. When she said, therefore, that the purchaser of her canals should have title free of all encumbrances except those imposed in the act, and declared that those claims only should be allowed which should be estab<a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>lished, we must conclude she intended only such as were existing obligations.</p>
    <p id="b124-6" data-blocks='[["BL_124.6",124,[311,545,1153,756]]]'>We are next brought to consider what injuries to private property were the subject of compensation in 1829-30, when the dam ■was erected, and in 1840-41, when it was rebuilt and heightened. Under the Act of 9th April 1827 (P. L. 192), this injury, had it then existed, would have been compensated as “ interfering with the petitioner’s right of property.” But the law confined its operations to the completion of the work, or within one year thereafter, and what is decisive is that the injury averred in the petition is the consequence of raising the dam in 1840-41, and not of the original structure. The legislature, by the Act of 6th April 1830 (P. L. 218), changed the law as to damages, conferring upon the canal commissioners the power to adjust all claims, with a right to appeal to appraisers if the claimant be unwilling to accept the offer of the commissioners, and confining the subject of damages to “ cases where injury has been or may be done to private property by reason of the Pennsylvania Canal or Railroad passing through the same, or by taking of any materials on said canal or railroad.”</p>

It is unnecessary, however, to resort to argument, as the legislature in 1832, following up the interpretation and acts of the commissioners, made the Act of 1830 applicable to the Delaware Division. The resolution of 10th April 1832 (P. L. 637), after reciting the appraisement of damages upon this division in September 1831, under the Act of 6th April 1830, and the death of one of the appraisers before the record was completed, made valid the report signed by two of the appraisers instead of three, and directed payment accordingly. This was followed by the resolution of 5th May 1832 (P. L. 642), extending the provisions of the former resolutions to every division of the canal and the railroad. With these acts in our view, it cannot be denied that the Act of 1830 and its supplements were the rule for the assessment of damages, and continued to be in 1840-41. The legislation then existing did not embrace a case of consequential injury. This seems to have been the view of the petitioners themselves, as we find them uniting in their petition to the canal commissioners in 1842, and after its refusal by the board in the same year they suffered the matter to drop. Thus it rested until 1856, when an attempt was made through a very influential gentleman to enlist the board in favour of compensation. The subject was under consideration about a year, and a report made against it by a competent engineer. The petitioners <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>manifestly hoped to obtain a favourable consideration by the canal board, whose recommendation doubtless would have secured payment by the legislature.</p>
