The council answered that the tax was authorized by § 12 of the Act of March 25th 1864, viz.: “ In case any .veteran soldiers who have re-enlisted, and have not been credited to any special locality, shall hereafter be credited, on the present draft, to the locality from which they originally volunteered, such veterans shall be paid by the local authorities, whose duty is to pay bounties, "such bounties as under the provisions of this act shall be paid to volunteers from said locality.”</p>
