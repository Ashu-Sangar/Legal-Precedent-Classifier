Here it means money. The agreement was not to repay the very thing, but “ like funds” with “ interest,” which is the sum “allowed for the loan or use of some other sum:” Whart. Diet. The agreement to pay interest manifests the nature of the transaction. Upon its delivery to the defendants it became their property. Their act had no reference to the legal-tender laws. The defendants have borrowed $625 in gold to be paid in gold; they have refused to pay. What is the amount of damages ? the amount of debt and interest, for which alone the court can give judgment; and that is to be paid in the <em>lawful money </em>of the United States: Borie <em>v. </em>Troth, per Hare, J., 21 Leg. Int. No. 9.</p>
    <p id="b27-8" data-blocks='[["BL_27.10",27,[246,1391,1155,545]]]'>Congress cannot in general vary a contract so as to make an agreement for paying in one thing, payable in another. But when the payment is to be in money, Congress may say how and at what rate the payment is to be made. A payment to be made in money, therefore, is to be taken to mean <em>lawful money, </em>and if agreed to be paid in silver dollars, it may be paid in gold coin, or other money made <em>laioful </em>by Congress. The power of the government over money is sovereign: Pardessus, Cours de Droit Com., No. 285 ; Troplong, Traité de la Vente, No. 163; Pothier Fr. du Cont. de Vente, No. 416; Case of Mixed Money, J. Davies R. 48; Shoenberger <em>v. </em>Watts, 1 Law Reg. N. S. 553. Congress has reduced the value of both the gold eagle and silver dollar.</p>

    <p id="b27-12" data-blocks='[["BL_27.14",27,[252,2243,1153,86]]]'>3. The transaction between the parties was a loan of money for a time specified, with interest to pay for its use.</p>

The defendants do not allege that they then intended to refuse to return like funds ; both parties intended that it should be paid in gold. If the defendants can now pay in legal-tender notes, they could have done so immediately after the deposit, and1 thus take the amount of the premium from the plaintiff the moment the deposit was made.</p>

A contract to pay in wdieat at a specified price, could not be discharged by tender of the sum in money: Meason <em>v. </em>Phillips, Add. Rep. 346.
