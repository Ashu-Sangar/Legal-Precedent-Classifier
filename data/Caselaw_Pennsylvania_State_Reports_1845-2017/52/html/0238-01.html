In charging: “ Even if it had been shown that the injury could not have occurred if the pier had not been there, this would not constitute a defence, as it is obvious that the jam was caused by the act of the defendants in driving logs by means of artificial <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>floods, an act which was wholly unauthorized and illegal. * * * No legal right exists to create such floods, and he who undertakes to use them without authority of law must he held responsible for all injurious consequences resulting from their use. The court regard as unanswerable these positions taken by the counsel of plaintiff, <em>‘ </em>that the injury of which plaintiff complains was caused by loose logs driven down the stream in large masses by artificial floods made by defendants, that the act of defendants in making such floods was illegal, that they are consequently liable to plaintiff for all damages sustained by him resulting from such illegal and unauthorized act, and that such damages are recoverable in this action.’ ”</p>

The evidence shows that timber had no fixed, definite market value on Bennett’s branch. It was regarded as worth there just what it would sell for at Lock Haven, deducting the expenses of its delivery. Plaintiff’s rafts were not offered for sale, nor intended to be sold where they were injured. If timber run upon the first flood that season brought a higher price at Lock Haven than timber run the second flood, and plaintiff was prevented from getting his timber to market on the first flood by the illegal act of the defendants, and thereby obtained a less price for it, the loss ought to be charged to the defendants in the assessment of damages in the suit, provided' the delay of plaintiff in’ getting his rafts to market was caused by the defendants, and was not the consequence in whole or in part of plaintiff’s own acts or negligence.”</p>

The evidence to prove that plaintiff was not the sole owner of these rafts was introduced without objection, and was admissible for the purpose of showing the extent of plaintiff’s' injury so far as these were <em>concerned; </em>for being a joint’owner with another, he ought not to recover more than- one-half of the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>damages sustained by the joint property.

The defendants accepted the terms offered, pleaded to issue, and went on to- trial. If Mr. Chapin withdrew their former appearance and plea without authority, they may possibly have recourse to him. To us the withdrawal of the appearance and plea appears to have been a device to postpone a trial. However that may have been after the appearance was withdrawn, the record stood as if none had ever been entered, and we are not prepared to say the court had then no power to give judgment for default of appearance, the declaration having been filed nearly three years previously. Our Act of Assembly of June 13th 1836, does authorize judgment for default of appearance in personal actions, and the case of Michew <em>v. </em>McCoy, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20502" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 502">3 W. &amp; S. 502</a>, relied upon by the defendants, has no bearing on this case. That was an action of ejectment, the statutory provisions in regard to which are unlike those enacted for personal actions. If, then, the court had power to order a judgment for default of appearance, opening it was subject to their discretion exclusively, and the defendants cannot be heard here complaining of the terms imposed, especially after they accepted them. The second assignment of error presents the question, whether the defendants were liable to the plaintiff for injuries sustained by him, in consequence of their having raised the creek by an artificial flood. “ Bennett’s Branch of the Sinnemahoning” is a public highway, declared such by law. The defendants, therefore, had no right to interfere with the natural flow of the water, except so far as they were licensed by the Mill-Dam Act of March 23d 1803. They were not authorized to build dams for any other purposes than those described in that act. A dam to provide for a “ splash” flood is illegal, and of course its consequences are illegal. To hold that the builder of such a dam might at his pleasure open it, and precipitate a flood into the creek below, sweeping away and destroying the property of <em>infra riprarian </em>owners or navigators on the stream, without responsibility, would be extraordinary. Even for the purpose of floating logs, the owners of such a dam have but a eommqn right of navigation. They must so use the stream as not to exclude other navigators. They may not therefore by artificial means send their logs down the current’ in such a mass as to render navigation by others impossible, or to make the destruction of other rafts than their own certain. We think, therefore, the charge of the court, to which exception has been taken in this assignment, was entirely correct. The third and sixth assignments relate to the instruction given respecting the assessment of damages. In this we perceive no error. The <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>court did not instruct the jury that the damages arising from depreciation in the price of lumber should be estimated according to the price at Lock Haven. The whole that was said upon this subject must be considered. It is plain from the evidence there was no market on. the creek where the plaintiff’s logs were. They were rafted and prepared for transportation to a market, and Lock Haven was the nearest. The price at Lock Haven was necessarily some guide to a determination of the value on the creek. And if the fact was that the plaintiff was unable to run his logs to market, in consequence of the illegal acts of the defendants, until after the price of lumber had fallen, the injury he sustained in this particular was a proximate consequence of the wrong, and proper to be considered in estimating the damages.</p>
    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[255,1006,1162,549]]]'>The remaining assignments raise the question, whether the plaintiff could recover for the injury done to two of the rafts, which were not his sole property, but which he owned jointly with Anthony Kuntz. This is settled by the following cases: Addison <em>v. </em>Overend, 6 T. R. 766; Sedgworth <em>v. </em>Overend, 7 <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20502" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 502">Id.</a> 279 ; Wheelwright <em>v. </em>Depeyster, <a href="/johns/1/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Johns. 471" data-case-ids="2128293" data-case-paths="/johns/1/0471-01">1 Johns. 471</a>; Agnew <em>v. </em>Johnston, 5 Harris 378. These cases assert the doctrine, that though joint-owners of chattels should join in actions for injuries to the chattels, yet if one sue alone the defendant can take advantage of the nonjoinder only by plea in abatement, and that if he does not thus plead the plaintiff may recover for the injury to his interest. This seems to be anomalous, but it is sustained by the cases cited.</p>
