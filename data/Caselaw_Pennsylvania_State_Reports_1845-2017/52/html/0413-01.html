This, indeed, was precisely Judge Kennedy’s mode of stating the doctrine in Roland <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20393" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 393">3 W. &amp; S. 393</a>.

    <p id="b417-6" data-blocks='[["BL_417.6",417,[221,725,1159,1288]]]'>It is observable that the defence here cannot be treated as a mere equity, as in Beaupland <em>v. </em>McKeen, 4 Casey 130, but that it is a strictly legal defence that springs out of the very terms and conditions of the mortgage. The defect in Mensch’s title was known to his vendees, for Hughes’s deed or agreement was on record, and is precisely recited in the mortgage. Whether any covenant was inserted in the deed to them, we are not informed, but the condition in the mortgage amounts in effect to a covenant on the part of the vendor that Hughes’s right under the agreement of 17th November 1840 shall be extinguished before the ¡§6000 bond shall be payable. By the very terms of the instrument this bond was to be paid three years after the death of the vendor, <em>provided, </em>that is, on condition of farther assurance, and especially on condition that the Hughes agreement be rescinded. If no farther assurance, and especially if that agreement be not rescinded, then, though the interest on the bond is to be paid annually, the principal is not to be demandable. Such is the plain legal import of the condition, and it was precedent to the right of the executors to recover, if not to sue, for the balance of the purchase-money. They stand like a vendor under a covenant against a known defect, after breach of the covenant, and their breach is alleged as a legal defence against their action. So far as appears to us, neither Mensch in his lifetime nor his executors since his death ever put forth an effort to rescind the agreement. The ejectment of Clement and Masser was <em>res inter alios acta, </em>to which the executors were not a party, and the effect of that suit was not to rescind the agreement. It was a mistake, therefore, to admit it in evidence. The only ground then upon which the court’s opinion can rest is, that the rights of Hughes’s alienees under the agreement were barred by non-user. Let us see how this is:—</p>
    <p id="b417-7" data-blocks='[["BL_417.7",417,[224,2014,1154,427]],["BL_418.1",418,[292,458,1165,384]]]'>From the date of the agreement to the institution of the ejectment was fourteen years, without any adverse possession of the land for <em>mining purposes; </em>a period quite too short to bar the right or to raise a presumption of abandonment. . But for the purposes of the present suit we are to treat the agreement as the parties treated it, as a subsisting encumbrance in 1851, eleven years after its date. Nothing can be more express than their recognition of the existence of the agreement at the date of their papers on the 1st April 1851, and they contemplated its continued existence until a period three years after Mensch’s death. He died in 1854, <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>■ and three years thereafter would bring the agreement down to .1857, when it was to be rescinded as a condition precedent to the payment of the money now in suit. Between that date and the institution of this suit was only seven years, and such a period could give birth to no such presumption as the learned judge set up. On the contrary, the parties have treated the agreement as an encumbrance existing down to so recent a date as absolutely to exclude all legal presumptions of its extinguishment. And it was a very substantial encumbrance ; one that would materially</p>
    <p id="AZTr" data-blocks='[["BL_418.5",418,[303,843,1158,386]]]'>impair the marketableness of the title. If the case stood upon executory articles of sale and purchase, no chancellor would compel the vendee to accept and pay for a title with so substantial an interest outstanding. It is more than a cloud upon the title; it is a conveyance of valuable rights in the land, be they corporeal or incorporeal. And the positive engagement that these rights should be extinguished before this balance of purchase-money should be demanded, makes this a much stronger case than Nicol <em>v. </em>Carr, 11 Casey 382, or Murphy <em>v. </em>Richardson.</p>
