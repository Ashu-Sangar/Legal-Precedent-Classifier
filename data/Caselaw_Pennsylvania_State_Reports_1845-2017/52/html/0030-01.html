This is a constitutional principle perfectly plain, and of the very highest importance. The States are prohibited from making anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts; and, although no such express prohibition is applied to Congress, <em>yet, as Congress has no potoer granted to it in this respect but to coin money and regulate the value of foreign coin, </em>it clearly has no power to substitute paper or anything else for coin as a tender in payment of debts and in discharge of contracts;” Webster’s Works, vol. 4, p. 271.</p>

In this sentiment, the inviolability of private contracts, American minds were, a few years since, an absolute unit.

The entire currency of the country — the paper money of the States, as well as all lawful money of the Federal Government, whether paper or specie — would have to be multiplied, therefore, many times, to express the aggregate of public and private debts. What was that aggregate at the date of this enact<a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>ment ? I have had neither the leisure nor the means at command to make even an approximate estimate of it, but 'when we consider that it would include very much of the indebtedness of the Federal Government, all the debts of all the State governments, the debts of counties, cities, boroughs, townships, and every species of municipality ; the debts of all corporations, associations and partnerships, as well as the debts of individuals, however secured or evidenced; we see that the aggregate must have been immense — a sum to be counted by hundreds of millions of dollars, and the figures to express which would be too unwieldy for the purposes of a judicial opinion. But it was not all due on the day this law was passed, and therefore did not require a legal tender commensurate with itself. The one hundred and fifty millions of greenbacks,- as they are familiarly called, and the sums issued under similar Acts subsequently passed, were perhaps equal to the actual indebtedness of the country due that day; and as they, when used to pay debts, would fall back into the circulation of the country, they would, like all other currency, multiply themselves many times as legal tenders, and, in a period of years, serve to pay very much, if not the whole of the vast indebtedness of the country, as it would from time to time fall due and become payable. The Act has been in operation for three years and more, and has furnished the legal tender for paying the debts that have fallen due, duties and interest on public bonds only excepted; and if it shall last for any considerable time, every debtor will avail himself of it when his pay-day comes.</p>
    <p id="b33-6" data-blocks='[["BL_33.6",33,[246,1570,1159,896]],["BL_34.1",34,[300,460,1155,681]]]'>Now, such being the nature and obligation of all the debts of the country (excepting always those excepted in the statute -and the inconsiderable sums contracted to be paid in specific chattels), let us look for a moment at the effect of the statute upon them. Since the date of the act the premium on gold has risen to 160 per cent., and has fallen, in the present month, to 30 per cent., and between these extremes it has touched all points by a continual fluctuation. If the average premium should be assumed at 100 per cent., it would be equivalent to an average discount of 50 per cent, upon the legal tender provided by the Act of Congress, and one-half of every debt paid by it has been sacrificed. But if 50 should be assumed as the average premium, the discount on greenbacks would be about 33 j- per cent., showing the operation of the law to have been a sacrifice of a third of the debts falling due. From such observations as I have been able to make, I believe the average discount since February, 1862, to have been about 40 per cent., so that, for the purposes of the present discussion, 33 per cent, may be very confidently assumed. Assuming that the aggregate of debts at the date of the law exceeded the entire currency of the country, it is material to observe that every dollar of these debts, except in the inconsiderable <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>instances otherwise specially expressed, was contracted upon the specie basis, and liable and entitled to be demanded in gold or silver coin. Not that, in point of fact, they would have been so paid ; for in a sound state of the currency the legal tender is rarely demanded ; but, in point of law, they were all payable in the legal tender of the country, and in nothing else. Such was the tenor and obligation of the contracts out of which that vast indebtedness grew. Debt is the creature of contract; and the law of the land at the time a contract is made, enters into, permeates, and incorporates itself with the contract, and becomes an essential element of it, as much as if it were expressly recited in the text of the contract. According to the law of the land, before the 25th of February, 1862, gold and silver were the only legal tender in payment of debts; and every debt, unless the contrary were expressly stipulated, was legally payable in nothing but gold or silver.</p>
    <p id="b34-6" data-blocks='[["BL_34.6",34,[300,1141,1155,1063]]]'>In some of the ground-rent cases before us the contract was <em>expressed </em>to be payable in gold or silver; and in one of them the weight of the silver dollar to be paid is Expressly fixed at 17 pennyweights and 6 grains, or 414 grains, which is one and a half grains heavier than the silver dollar, as fixed by the Act of Congress of 18th January, 1837; but in all of these ground-rent covenants lawful money of the United States is stipulated for; and at the date of the contracts nothing but gold or silver was lawful money for the purpose of paying debts. It may he granted, that where the parties had agreed upon a heavier silver dollar than that in common use, the difference would have to be compensated in current dollars ; but where gold or silver was stipulated for, without mentioning the weight of the coin, the lawful dollar for the time being would be intended. Where coin was not mentioned at all, but only lawful money of the United States, the creditor would have the right to demand, and the debtor was bound by his contract to pay so many dollars in the current gold and silver coin of the United States, or in foreign coin at the rates prescribed in existing Acts of Congress. The diversities in these covenants, therefore, may be disregarded for present purposes ; and if they are debts at all (which shall be considered hereafter), they may all be placed on the'same footing as other debts; that is, debts which, by the law of their creation, can be legally extinguished only by the tender of gold or silver coins at their statute rates.</p>

It is not too much to ask them to point out the words in the written document we have to deal with, which, being read according to their grammatical and historical meaning, did expressly, or by necessary implication, vest in Congress this destructive power. It is one of the infelicities of the occasion that the advocates of the power are not agreed as to the part of the Constitution they will make responsible for it. Some charge it on the coining power, some on the borrowing power, some on the war power, some on the clause relating to commerce; whilst others state the argument more comprehensively though less definitely, as is printed in one of our paper-books, in these words: <em>“ </em>If to carry on war, regulate commerce, or maintain a navy, it be necessary to make paper money and give it a legal-tender character, or to carry into effect any other substantive power under any circumstances, Congress has the power by implication.

As that argument is the substance of much that has been said and written in behalf of the power, let it be examined for a moment. If, to execute a granted power of the Constitution, Congress should conceive it necessary to revoke all the land titles of the country, to abolish the marriage relation, to substitute primogeniture for our systems of intestacy, or to do any other preposterous thing which may be imagined, the argument is, that the powrer must be implied, and the degree of the necessity is not subject to judicial cognisance. Not so thought Chief Justice Marshall and the Supreme Court of the United States, in McCullough <em>v. </em>The State of Maryland, <a href="/us/17/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Wheat. 316" data-case-ids="4702" data-case-paths="/us/17/0316-01">4 </a><a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a><a href="/us/17/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Wheat. 316" data-case-ids="4702" data-case-paths="/us/17/0316-01">Wheat. 316</a>, and in Osborne <em>v. </em>United States Bank, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wheat.%20816" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="9 Wheat. 816">9 Wheat. 816</a>, where the doctrine was asserted that it belongs to that court to make the final decision upon constitutional questions, and that the clause conferring power to make “ necessary” laws for carrying granted powers into effect meant not an absolute physical necessity so strong that one thing could not exist without the other; but if the end be legitimate and within the scope of the Constitution, all means which are appropriate to this end, and which are not prohibited, are lawful. This is the judicial test of necessary laws, and according to it, those who support this Act of Congress must begin by showing that impairing the obligation of contracts and blotting out from a third to a half of the debts of the country are legitimate “ ends” of the Constitution and within its <em>“ </em>scope.” Because, until this is established — until these ends are shown to be legitimate fruits of the Constitution, results which it was planned and framed to produce — there can be no question raised about “necessary” means. It were idle to discuss, appropriate or necessary means to an impossible or inadmissible end. Or, will we reverse that maxim of questionable morality which teaches that the end justifies the means, and say that whenever means are satisfactory to a majority in Congress the end must be legitimate. If so — and this is the highest point to which I have seen the argument pushed — then our Constitution is waste paper, and Judge Marshall’s declaration, in the above cases, that the Government of the United States is one of enumerated powers, and that it can exercise only the powers granted to it, is nonsense. If, however, any man can demonstrate that the Federal Government was formed for so base a purpose as the impairing the obligation of contracts, I give up the controversy, and I agree that this Act of Congress was appropriate, if not necessary, to <em>that </em>end. But if, on the other hand, the government was formed to enforce contracts and protect private rights, it has not been shown, and it cannot be, that the legislation in question was ordinary, appropriate or necessary.</p>

Thus the Act of Congress of 2d April 1792, establishing the mint, carried out the idea of the Constitution by declaring that, “ there shall be from time to time struck and coined at the said mint coins of gold, silver and copper, of the denominations, values and descriptions” therein-afterwards described, and the sixteenth section made these gold and silver coins a legal tender. The Act of 18th January 1837, supplementary to the above law, reduced the weight of the silver dollar, and made the gold and silver coins of the'mint a legal tender. By the Act of April 1806, foreign gold and silver coins shall pass current as money, and be a legal tender at the respective'values assigned them in the statute.

If to coin money meant to stamp or print paper, as is sometimes argued now-a-days, here was a very bungling, expensive and ill-contrived execution of the power; and it is wonderful that all the Congresses before that of 1862 had not found out the more convenient and expeditious mode. In my apprehension, the legislation before 1862 was strictly constitutional, as I am sure it was reasonable and beneficial; and let it never be forgotten that every contract for the payment of money, which existed in the United States on the 25th of February 1862, had been made on the faith of that legislation, and was, therefore, capable of being discharged only by gold or silver coin.

I agree that the Act under consideration was, in some sort, a law for borrowing money, though it is not so entitled. By making a depreciated paper currency a legal tender every debtor was tempted to take it of the government, in exchange for other paper money, and pay off his specie debts with it. I have already shown that the effect of the Act was to annihilate from a third to half of the indebtedness of the country. Was that borrowing money within the meaning of the Constitution ? If Congress had required every creditor to assign to the government a third or half of his bonds, notes, mortgages, ground-rents and other money securities, that might have been considered a forced loan; but when a creditor is required to take depreciated paper in satisfaction of a debt contracted on the specie basis, it is more like confiscation than it is like the constitutional right to borrow money. Having the right to borrow money, Congress has an undoubted right to issue evidences of indebtedness therefor; and I will not dispute their right to declare these evidences lawful money, so that men may deal with it <em>in future </em>contracts ; but I do very earnestly deny the right and power of Congress to make such “ lawful money” a tender in payment of <em>past </em>contracted debts. It was an intrusion of governmental power upon the relation which creditors and debtors had established between themselves on the faith of prior legislation. It was an impairing of the obligation of that relation. It was tempting men to breach of good faith, and, therefore, not only unconstitutional, but of extremely evil example.</p>

Our government has carried on several wars, foreign and domestic, and a commerce that has penetrated every part of the globe, upon a paper currency, State and Federal, having a sound specie basis, without making a dollar of that paper currency a legal tender. Where, then, is the ground for the assumption that this Act of Congress was demanded by the exigencies of our civil war ? Had Congress borrowed gold and silver enough at current rates to maintain the speeie basis of our paper currency, I believe it could be demonstrated (though it is not my purpose to enter into the question) that the debt of the country to-day would have been less than half what it is, and that no one effort .of the government would have lost energy or effect.</p>

The proposition is too monstrous to be entertained. No men who ever lived understood better, or respected more religiously, the obligations of plighted faith; and that they empowered the government, under, pressure of any emergencies, to strike down, at one fell swoop, a third of the debts and credits of the country, is so incredible, that it ought not to be asserted until it can'be proved. No evidence has been shown. No book of history, no judicial record five years old, no legislation before 1862, no tradition, no romance tells us that the Constitution was ever so read. And this is the reason why the professional mind was a unit on this point until a very recent period — the reason why the weighty words of Mr. Webster, which I placed at the head of this opinion, not only condensed the whole constitutional argument, but expressed the universal thought of the people. In the language of Fisher Ames upon the Jay treaty: “ If there could be a resurrection from the foot of the gallows, if the victims of justice could live again, collect together and form a society, they would, however loath, soon find that it was their interest to make others respect, and they would therefore respect themselves, the obligations of good faith.”</p>

Whilst much more than this might he justly claimed in behalf of the Constitution, nothing more need be conceded to condemn this Act of Congress. If the Constitution did not authorize that part of the enactment that relates to legal tender, it is null and void; and were the reasons for passing it a thousand fold stronger than they were, it were better to sacrifice the enactment to the Constitution than to repudiate the morality of the Constitution. “ Good faith is the philosophy of politics, the religion of governments.” It is worth more than many Acts of Congress, infinitely more than the one before us.</p>

The annual or semi-annual interest upon that principal he is bound by his covenants to pay; and when we speak of this as a ground-rent, it is by common consent a debt. Our present question, however, has regard not to these periodical payments, but to the principal sum; and as to that, its technical classification is, undoubtedly, as a rent-service, which is an estate in land. But, though an estate, may it not also be a debt within the purview of the Act of Congress ? I suppose that Congress used that word debt in its largest, most comprehensive, and popular sense, and that they meant by it every sum of money which one man was either obliged or entitled to pay, and which another had a legal right to receive.</p>

Where land is bought and sold by articles of agreement, both vendor and vendee have an estate, and yet the unpaid purchase-money is a debt on the part of the vendee. True, there is a covenant that obliges him •to pay, and in that point the analogy fails, but the point which the analogy illustrates is that purchase-money is a debt, whilst at the same time it is the measure of an estate. The principal of a ground-rent deed is nothing but purchase-money for land, and the covenants confer on the purchaser an option instead of an obligation to pay. When he exercises his option he has a legal right to pay, and the landlord is obliged to receive, and then, if never before, it becomes a debt. It may be likened to the right of a former owner to redeem his land, sold for taxes. That right is an estate or interest in the land; but the owner is not obliged to redeem; yet, when he exercises his option, the redemption-money is universally regarded as a debt. Since this Act of Congress, it has never been doubted that redemption-money could be paid in treasury notes. I think my Brother Agnew’s opinion at Nisi Prius, in Shollenberger <em>v. </em>Brinton, followed, if not endorsed, by <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>my Brother Thompson in Davis <em>v. </em>Burton, has not been shaken hy anything advanced in argument, and is not inconsistent with the point ruled in Bossler <em>v. </em>Kuhn, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 183" data-case-ids="483356" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0183-01">8 W. &amp; S. 183</a>. The point ruled there was that a ground-rent becoming due after the discharge of the debtor, under the bankrupt law, was not extinguished'by his certificate. When there was no covenant to pay, and no offer to exercise his option, it was necessary to say there was no debt within the bankrupt law; but that which distinguishes these eases from Bossler <em>v. </em>Kuhn is the very circumstance that gave rise to the cases, the <em>offer </em>of the tenants to pay. The covenants had given the option to pay principal or interest. So long as he elected to pay interest, that only was a debt; but on his election to pay principal, that became no less a debt.</p>

It is said Congress have not power to alter people’s contracts when they stipulate for gold or silver, but have full power to do so if they only stipulate for lawful money. I cannot comprehend such reasoning. It is an extreme act of sovereignty to touch private contracts at all by legislation, but that the sovereign should be obliged to keep his hands off a contract that <em>expressed </em>the legal obligation, though at liberty to invade that which just as clearly <em>implied </em>the same legal obligation, is an incomprehensible distinction, especially in a case where the sovereign has expressed the only debts intended to be excepted.</p>

This conclusion resulted rather from consequences supposed liable to flow from an opposite conclusion than from a logical view of the subject. I feared that redemptions of tax sales and the like, might be affected injuriously by such a conclusion; but on reflection I do not think they would, as tax sales and the allowance of a redemption is a mode of collecting taxes, and taxes are of the character of debts. They are properly debts created by law when overdue. But neither the law nor any contract renders it obligatory at any time, on the owner of the fee of land held on ground-rent, to extinguish the <em>corpus </em>of the rent; and while it remains unextinguished it is so far from being a debt, it is not even a chose in action of any sort, but an estate partaking of the nature of the realty from which it springs. It descends to the heir and not to executors or administrators. <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>It is an incorporeal hereditament, in which of course the owner has a fee, if the estate out of which it is reserved is a fee: 1 Barr 349 ; <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%2042" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 Wright 42">3 Wright 42</a>; 2 Harris 445.</p>

This may be granted without prejudice to the principle here sought to be maintained. It must be remembered that the only mode of enforcing the option is by making the tender, and as the tender must take place and be perfect, in order to work the change it must be in such money as prior to the mutation would satisfy the covenant; otherwise we would embrace the sophism, that the principal being converted into a debt by the tender, the tender is made good by a conversion of the principal. The reasoning on this point, however plausibly advanced, amounts to scarcely more than this. At the best it requires the construction of an artificial theory to make the principal of a ground-rent a debt, and this I do not regard as demanded, in order either to give effect to the Act of Congress, which should be interpreted in the ordinary legal meaning of the terms used, or the relation created between the parties by the ground-rent deed. In fact, to hold as claimed by the appellee would be to violate, beyond dispute, the express terms on and by which he had the option to acquire the estate of the appellant in the ground-rent, unless indeed we should succeed in persuading ourselves that silver money is paper money, and paper money is silver.</p>

If a universal rule had been adopted by Congress in regard to the effect and operation of the issue of legal-tender notes, so as to supersede all other <em>media </em>of currency, there would have arisen a rule of necessity out of such a revolution as would have required the courts to give the same effect to the substituted money as belonged to the displaced; but that is not the case. These notes are by express words restrained of their universality as a legal tender.

The owners of real estate on ground-rents could not be compelled to pay anything but the annual rent as it accrued, and as this became a debt when due, the law applied to that because the tenant could be compelled to pay it; but is there not. an infinite difference between that and the principal sum, which, although existing, could not be demanded ?</p>

In support of this view I also rely on Bossler <em>v. </em>Kuhn, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 186" data-case-ids="483304" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0186-01">8 W. &amp; S. 186</a>.

The annual payments spring into existence, and for the first time become debts when they are demandable, for while they are growing due the landlord.' has no property in anything distinct from the <em>corpus </em>of the rent or the realty of which they are the produce, and the fruit must he severed from the tree which bears it before it can become personal property and a chose in action.

While I agree with what is sometimes asserted in these cases, that whatever is lawful money of the kind stipulated to be received at the time of exercising the option to pay, will be a good tender notwithstanding the sovereign power may have changed its value; undoubtedly the rightful exercise of power <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>in a State is not to be controlled by the mere terms of contracts. For example, our coin was reduced in its standard of fineness in 1837, and no court ever held that it was not a legal tender in payment of debts and engagements entered into when it was intrinsically more valuable. The case of the Mixed Money, to be found in Sir John Davies’s Irish Beports 48, is in point to this effect. But, notwithstanding this, if a purchaser of ground takes it on special terms and conditions as to the redemption of the annual duty by paying the principal out of which it accrues, I see no hardship in holding him to the terms, if they be legally possible, and I do not believe there is an instance on record in which a decree for specific performance in the absence of fraud ever was made without performance by the party, seeking to have performance, unless he was prevented by the party, the law, or the act of God. Impossible conditions, especially subsequent, never defeat a contract; but <em>“ </em>the rule does not extend to contracts founded on difficult, impossible, or contingent considerations, for it is the duty of the promissor well to weigh the difficulty or impracticability of the consideration before he binds himself to perform it; and the law will not help him to avoid duties which he has deliberately imposed upon himself so long as they are possible.” Story on Oont. 463, and note. The original grantor of the land in this case, and his grantor of the ground-rent, established the law of the case as it was to be between them and their assignees, and in the absence of any intent on the part of Congress to break down such contracts to give greater scope to the paper currency created by it, supposing the right to impose them be conceded, we have no right to abate a tittle of what the parties agreed should have the effect of performance, the possibility to perform remaining unimpaired. For these reasons and another, which I think exists, noticed in the outset as waived, I am for reversing this case.</p>
