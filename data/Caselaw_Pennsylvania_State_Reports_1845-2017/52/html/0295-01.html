Thus, in an action for land against a tenant, the heir must bring error in case of the tenant’s death. And it may be brought by a tenant to reverse his own judgment if erroneous or given for a less sum than he has a right to demand: Johnson <em>v. </em>Jebb, 3 Burr. 1772.

At the impetration of the writ of <em>scire facias </em>he was in point of fact a terretenant. The writ was directed to terre-tenants. And though Cadmus was not served, his subsequent appearance, by leave of the court, made him to all legal intents a party to the record. The <em>sei. fa. </em>was upon a mortgage, and a mortgage is a specific lien upon the premises described in it, and when the mortgagee has got a judgment against his mortgagor and terre-tenants he has a right to sell the premises to the highest and best bidder. Now Cadmus claimed to own the premises relieved of the mortgage, and though he might, perhaps, battle successfully with a future vendee of the sheriff, can it bd said that a judgment which commits him to such a battle does not aggrieve him ? His title would have prevailed and he would have had the thing if the judgment, which he complains of as erroneous, had not been given. As between him and Jackson there could be no further litigation if Cadmus’s fundamental proposition that the Orphans’ Court sale divested the lien of the mortgage had been sustained, for if it divested it for part of the debt it divested it altogether: Mevey’s Appeal, 4 Barr 80. But his proposition was not sustained, for a judgment was rendered on that very mortgage, and whether it was against him or another, it subjects the premises to liability of sale, endangers his title, impairs its marketableness and exposes him to the costs of litigation, and, therefore, we think him so aggrieved by the judgment as to be entitled to his writ of error.

They encourage bidders to pay outside prices, and they sweep off all liens which debts of the decedent may have occasioned, except only certain fixed liens like a widow’s dower, which are incapable of pecuniary admeasurement.

To this effect the two Acts of Assembly of 11th April 1835 and 16th April 1845, Purd. 325, are* express. See also Perry <em>v. </em>Brinton, 1 Harris 202. And not only did not that sale divest the lien of the mortgage, but it left in Young’s heirs an interest which sprung from the right of redemption for two years. This indeed is all the interest which the counsel for the defendant in error will agree remained to Young’s estate upon which the Orphans’ Court could act; and it being all which that court could order to a sale, it was all that Cadmus could purchase; and as he did not redeem within two years, it is argued that he took nothing by his purchase, or rather that he forfeited by laches the imperfect right which he did take.</p>

The argument is, that he took the title as clear and unencumbered as when it was first mortgaged to Harper. We cannot deduce this conclusion from the authorities to which we have been referred. <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>If the sale had been on the mortgage, or upon a bond accompanying it, the- lien would have been divested and the mortgage satisfied, however far short of the principal debt the purchase-money had fallen; but even then there would have been no substitution of the purchaser to the title of the mortgagee, because a mortgagee, as such, has no title to which a purchaser can be substituted. He is a mere encumbrancer. If he have the title still in him, as a vendor may have, undoubtedly he would be decreed to convey upon receipt of the purchase-money, .but here was a mere security for money, and the fund that was distributed was not raised by proceedings upon that specific security, but by a proceeding for the payment of debts in general. As far as the mortgagee received proceeds of the sale his debt is satisfied. As to the unpaid balance the question is, whether his mortgage lost its lien ? I know of no principle of law that would justify us in carrying the purchaser’s title by relation back to the date of the mortgage-debt, any more than to the date of any of the other debts of the decedent, which moved the court to order the sale.</p>
    <p id="b305-6" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[206,1196,1159,683]]]'>What other answer does the defendant’s position admit of ? If it cannot be answered — if it must be admitted that the Orphans’ Court sold and Cadmus bought only the right of redemption, then it will follow that that estate or interest expired with the limitation of two years, and Cadmus has no position in court. But the major proposition assumes that the sheriff’s sale to Keenan was valid. If this were not so — if that sale was incompetent to divest the interest of Young’s heirs, then the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court attached to a substantial interest the whole estate, and passed it to Cadmus cleared of all liéns. When Young died on the 27th of January 1860, though he stood in the place of the mortgagor, he had more than an equity of redemption, he had the full and absolute estate in fee simple, encumbered indeed by the mortgage, by the city’s judgment for taxes, and by whatever other debts he owed, but subject to those encumbrances his seisin was complete.</p>

The administrators had been appointed on the 17th February 1860 — the very day the <em>levari facias </em>issued upon the city’s judgment; but they -were not warned, and there is nothing upon the record to indicate notice to them that their decedent’s estate was about to be sold at sheriff’s sale.</p>

Yet why was it nqt subject to the 35th section of that act ? This section in very express terms forbids an execution to issue upon a judgment obtained in the lifetime of the decedent, until the personal representatives (who are the administrators) have been warned by <em>scire </em>facias, notwithstanding the <em>teste </em>of such execution may bear date antecedently to his death. This section changed the <em>old </em>rule which carried back the effect'of the execution to its teste, which was usually the first day of the term to which it issued ; but it did not alter the practice of fully executing writs of execution, where the death occurs pending tibe writ. The death of Young, however, did not occur pending the <em>levari </em>facias, but before it issued, and it is immaterial whether before or after the day on which it bore teste.</p>

Not only must there be a legal judgment, but a legal execution also, to make a sheriff’s sale valid. But it was urged in argument with great pertinacity, that Keenan’s title is not in question here, and our right to pass upon it was very earnestly denied. If his title be not in question, <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>why is he upon the record as a terre-tenant ? Jackson seeks the fruits of a judgment against Keenan upon the mortgage which he holds on the premises, and unless Keenan is indeed a terre-tenant, that is a claimant to <em>title </em>in the premises, he has no right to be upon the record, and Jackson has no right to a judgment against him. It is idle, therefore, to argue that .Keenan’s title is not in question. He stands as a purchaser at sheriff’s sale under void process, and the liability of the premises in his hands for the balance due upon Jackson’s mortgage is the vital question of the cause. The premises are not liable if the lien of the mortgage was divested by the Orphans’ Court sale. The lien was divested by the Orphans’ Court sale upon all the interest sold. The interest sold was the fee simple and not a mere redemption right, unless the sheriff’s sale to Keenan was valid. But it was not valid because not made upon legal process. The conclusion is inevitable, therefore, that Jackson is entitled to take no benefit from the present <em>scire facias.</em>

And a mortgagee who looks to an Orphans’ Court sale to reimburse his mortgage-debt, should not forget that it is the quality of such a sale to divest the lien of his mortgage, and therefore, if he bid not the property to a sum sufficient to cover his mortgage, his remedies upon that instrument are gone, and his only recourse must be to his bond, if there be one accompanying the mortgage.</p>
