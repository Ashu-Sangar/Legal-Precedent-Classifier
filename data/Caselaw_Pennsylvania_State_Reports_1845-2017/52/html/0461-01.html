The letter is a suggestion, submitting it to the election of the defendant to carry a larger quantity from Wilkesbarre and less from Pittston than the contract called for; and the defendant proceeded with his carrying without any answer to the plaintiff’s suggestion.

[If in addition to that difference he was put to trouble and expense in procuring other boats, allowance may be justly claimed for these. Again, if all his efforts were ineffectual, and his supply was insufficient and much less than it would have been had the contract been fulfilled by the defendant, whereby in consequence of deficient supply and increased price of coal he sustained loss and injury in his business, such loss would be another element of the damages properly claimed in this suit; and if he incurred expenses on account of his expected receipt of this coal under the contract, which he would not otherwise have encountered, these may also be added in making up the amount of damages.”]</p>

His defence was principally a letter of the 6th of May 1863, from the plaintiff to the defendant, which he never answered or took any notice of, nor did he in any way accept the proposition contained in it, and therefore the written contract remained unaltered and in full force. The defendant (then offered testimony to prove a contemporaneous parol contract in addition to the written contract, varying and contradicting the written contract, which the court properly rejected. This dis- • poses of the 1st specification of ex-ror.
