Fulmer confessed judgment to Slate, part of the amount to secure creditors of Fulmer who were named, and the halanee to secure Slate. As collateral security for the judgment, Fulmer assigned a claim against an insurance company, for which he afterwards recovered judgment. The claim had been attached by a judgment-creditor of Fulmer &amp; Co. (of whom Fulmer was a partner), whose debt if recovered would leave more due on the judgment against the company, than would pay all the creditors of Fulmer secured by his judgment to Slate. <em>Held, </em>that one of the secured creditors was a competent witness in a contest between the attaching creditor and Slate.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[183,852,1159,69]]]'>2. Fulmer himself was a competent witness, as he could neither gain nor lose by securing the fund to the one or the other.</p>

The claim was originally owned by Fulmer &amp; Co., and the suit against the company being in their name, was marked to the use of Slate on the docket by their attorney. The court charged that if it was so marked at the instance of Fulmer without the assent of the other partners, and without any consideration being shown, it was inoperative and void against the creditors of the firm. <em>Held, </em>that this instruction was correct.</p>
