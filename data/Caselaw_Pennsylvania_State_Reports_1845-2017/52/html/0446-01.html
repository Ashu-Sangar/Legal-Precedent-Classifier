    <p class="summary" id="b446-6" data-blocks='[["BL_446.6",446,[285,678,1162,459]]]'>This was an action of replevin, by George Steele and Simeon B. Pownall against James Pownall and Simeon Pownall, commenced July 7th 1864. The plaintiffs declared for wheat in shock taken and 44 detained” by the defendants. Levi Pownall devised the land on which the wheat grew to his daughter Catharine for life. There was evidence that she leased it to George D. Steele for the year 1863 ; and there was also evidence that Steele had agreed with Simeon B. Pownall to farm the place with him to the shares. After the plaintiffs closed, the defendants asked the court to order a nonsuit, which was refused and an exception taken.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b446-8" data-blocks='[["BL_446.8",446,[292,1190,1158,472]]]'>44 The wheat mentioned in this writ of replevin was a crop growing on the life estate of Catharine Pownall at the time of her decease, and is claimed by the plaintiffs as their property on the ground of a lease to George Steele by Catharine Pownall in 1863, of the premises for that year, and of an agreement by George Steele to let Simeon B. Pownall farm it on the shares. It is requisite for these plaintiffs, in order to maintain their action, to show that the wheat in question is their joint property. To prove that the wheat belonged to one of them and not the other, would prove them not joint owners, and be just as fatal as to show that neither of them owns the property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b446-9" data-blocks='[["BL_446.9",446,[296,1661,1159,557]]]'>44 The question for the jury is in the following point, viz.: 4 If the jury believe that Catharine Pownall, the tenant for life, leased the premises on which the wheat in dispute was raised, for the year 1863, to George Steele, and that George Steele agreed with Simeon B. Pownall to let him farm the same on shares, and the same was so farmed in the lifetime of Catharine Pownall, the plaintiffs are joint owners or tenants in common of the grain in dispute, and are entitled to recover.’ The jury will inquire whether Catharine Pownall did lease these premises for the year 1863 to George Steele, or to George Steele as agent of his father, John D. Steele, for that year, as well as the years preceding; and also whether George Steele, in agreeing with Simeon B. Pownall to let him farm the same, so agreed as agent of John D. Steele.</p>

Pownall to let him farm the same on the shares, and the same was so farmed, the plaintiffs are joint owners and entitled to recover.</p>
