    <p class="summary" id="b432-18" data-blocks='[["BL_432.18",432,[295,2173,1149,160]]]'>“The first question has been before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and the constitutionality of the Bounty Act affirmed. This is conclusive, and the question requires no further examination.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b432-19" data-blocks='[["BL_432.19",432,[294,2344,1151,129]],["BL_433.1",433,[191,444,1158,1331]]]'>“ The second question I consider equally plain. The act subjects to taxation all property taxable for state or county purposes. Residence in the particular township or district, when the tax is <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>upon real estate, is not required or contemplated. If it was, taxation by the wealthy landed proprietors would be easily avoided by a removal from the district where the land was situated, and the object of the act would be entirely frustrated. Nor is there anything unjust or inequitable in taxing real estate of non-residents. If the Union is worth preserving — if its preservation contributes to the happiness and prosperity of the people — those who have large possessions have the greatest interest at stake, and derive the greatest benefit from its preservation and perpetuity. And this is the principle upon which all taxation is levied — national, state, county and township ; all are required to contribute in proportion to their ability, and the protection afforded them by law in their personal rights, both absolute and relative. In protecting these persons from wrong, and enabling them to acquire and enjoy private property, the same power which imposed the tax defendant resists, conferred upon him the privilege of holding and enjoying the very property upon which he deems it unjust to pay taxes for the preservation of the government under which he lives, and enjoys all the blessings which wealth and affluence can confer. All who enjoy the benefit and protection of government are bound to contribute their due proportion to the preservation of law and order; to protect their private acquisitions from pillage, rapine and destruction, as well by the hands of rebel insurgents as by the hand of burglar or incendiary. The difference is, treason and insurrection can only be subdued and vanquished by the armed power of the nation, while the community is protected from the depredations of the burglar and incendiary through the medium of courts of justice. But in both cases the law demands that every citizen shall contribute to the general welfare in proportion to his ability, and the acquisitions which are enjoyed under its provisions, guardianship and protection.”</p>

The opinion of the majority had the unqualified assent of the three judges uniting in the decision, and we now have before us a copy of the opinion of Butler, J., in the case of Booth <em>v. </em>Woodbury, decided in Connecticut, and to be found in the American Law Register for February 1866, ably sustaining the same view of the powers of the legislature. Under these circumstances, finding nothing new or forcible in the anonymous argument furnished in the paper-book of the appellant, we are not constrained by any motive of public interest, sound reason or patriotism, to recall a decision upon which so many valuable securities now passed into the channels of business must depend. It is not deemed worth while to rescue the opinion itself from criticisms upon detached sentences and isolated expressions.</p>
