It appears clearly that the testator intended, after making special provision for his daughter Elizabeth, to divide his estate between his three other surviving daughters, his two sons and the children of his deceased daughter, Mrs. Souder, those children taking together a share equal to that of each son and each surviving daughter. It appears with equal certainty by the general terms of the will, that he designed, upon the death of one of his grandchildren under the age of twenty-one years, to give the share of such grandchild to the surviving grandchild and to his own children, the share of each of the latter being double that of the former. It is said on the part of the plaintiffs, that the language of the concluding quoted clause is so definite and significant as to require, in the event that has occurred, that this second intention should be disregarded and set aside. But it can hardly be claimed that the testator evinced any purpose to change the limitations he had' provided for the devolution of his estate. He left those limitations to become operative in the event of the death of his son-in-law occurring previously to the death of the grandchildren. And thus we would have, upon the view of the case urged by the plaintiffs, a limitation to one grandchild of the whole share of the other, provided that other should die in the lifetime of John K. Souder, whereas, if the death of the grandchild should occur after the decease of Mr. Souder, the samo share would be limited to the surviving grandchild and his or her uncles and aunts. The result would he, in the division of an estate of $11,000, that in the one case, the surviving grandchild would take the whole, and in the other would take $1000, while each of the uncles and aunts would take $2000. Upon the death of both the grandchildren subsequently to the decease of their father, in their minority, there would be no doubt of the right of the sons and daughters to take their shares under the limitations of the will. But upon their death in their father’s lifetime, whither would the shares go ? Perhaps to their heirs under the intestate laws, including uncles and aunts on their father’s as well as their mother’s side' — perhaps to the heirs under the intestate laws, of Mrs. Souder, including the testator’s daughter Elizabeth. In either event the object of the will would be frustrated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[266,2094,1152,385]],["BL_171.1",171,[229,466,1160,1365]]]'>“ In the judgment of the court, the clause which raises this question contemplated no results like these. It was simply designed to exclude John K. Souder from participation in any distribution of the estate. To give it the construction claimed for it, would destroy the entire symmetry and subvert the whole plan of the will. It is the duty of the court to carry all of the intentions of the testator into effect, when they can he clearly ascertained. If the last clause stood alone, and could be aided by reference to no other provisions of the instrument, it may well be <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>that the entire share of Jacob Seitzinger Soúder would go to Mrs. Newbold. But it must be construed in connection with the rest of the will. The object to be gained by inserting the clause is manifest upon its- face. It was not to establish limitations of interests devised. The rule of succession had been fixed by elaborate provisions already made. It cannot be called a repugnant clause to the clause fixing the succession, for it was not a clause relating to the succession. It was designed to deprive John K. Souder of any right which, without it, he might assert under the intestate laws. It is a well-settled principle of construction that where clauses in a will are repugnant, the last must prevail, as expressing the final determination of the testator. But to make the application of the principle safe, it should appear that the repugnant clauses have relation to the same subject-matter. In the present case, the conflicting provision relates to a subject entirely distinct from the limitations of the estate devised, for which clear and careful directions had been already given. It seems to the court that it would be an entire perversion of this will to treat the terms of exclusion of John K. Souder, however peculiarly expressed, as evincing a purpose to change, in a single contingency, the settlement of the estate as it had previously been directed. It is clear that this clause could not so operate if Mr. Souder had died before his son. To give it such an operation now would be to impute to the testator a capriciousness of intention that would be incredible. It is believed that the construction contended for by the plaintiffs would, in the language of Judge King, in Earp’s Appeal, 1 Pars. 458, ‘ tend to destroy the symmetry of the will, and to produce results inconsistent with the whole scheme of the disposition of his property proposed to himself by the testator,’ while that which has been adopted ‘harmonizes all his dispositions and accomplishes all his intentions.’</p>

The will directed the share of Jacob Seitzinger Souder to be paid to him on the attainment of his majority. Upon his death a minor, it was to be added to the shares of his sister, uncles and aunts, <em>‘ </em>subject to the same trusts and limitations’ previously declared in relation to those shares. Mr. New-bold’s interest under the will had been vested in Messrs. Richard Boone, David F. Gordon and William Wetberill, in trust for her sole and separate use during her. life, she receiving the income, rents, issues and profits, free from the control of her husband, and from liability for his debts ; and upon her death in trust for certain appointees she was authorized to make by will. Mr. Boone, the defendant, represents this trust, and as trustee holds the fund in controversy.

Mrs. Newbold’s share of the principal of the estate of her brother under the will remains during her life subject to the trust.

A construction which would destroy this symmetry cannot be allowed, unless the language be so clear that there is no escape. 2d. The testator, in the contingency which has occurred, has by express words given Jacob’s share to his sister — by providing that all the gifts to the children of his daughter, shall, in case of the death of either intestate in the lifetime of their father, go as if their mother had lived until then, and died the absolute owner of the property given. The meaning of this is too clear for doubt. It is the closing provision so far as the question here is concerned.

    <p id="b174-10" data-blocks='[["BL_174.10",174,[288,2209,1153,256]],["BL_175.1",175,[216,443,1158,205]]]'>This was his difficulty — he had provided for the deaths of his children and grandchildren, and of their issue, who should not live to the age of twenty-one ; but if the issue of deceased children or grandchildren should reach that age, the estates given would vest in them absolutely, and if such issue should after-wards die without issue, the parent being illegitimate and by law <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>not of his own blood, the estate could not return into his own family, but must either escheat for want of inheritable blood, or pass into a new line of the blood of the last owner, but not of the blood of the testator. This was the relation in which John K. Souder stood to his own children.</p>
    <p id="b175-6" data-blocks='[["BL_175.6",175,[212,658,1162,1241]]]'>It appears from the will that all of his children were minors excepting Margaret Adelia Jones and Mary Agnes Souder, both of whom had married and had children. Mrs. Souder, being either the first or second child, was doubtless one of the supposed illegitimates. Being dead, the devises and bequests were directly to her children, who by her illegitimacy became a new stock as the first perquisitors. In case of their death leaving issue who should attain the age of twenty-one, the estate then vesting in such issue absolutely, and they dying without issue, it would then not be governed -by the former paragraph, but would .escheat or go to John K. Souder, if alive, or his issue if dead, as the next of kin of the new stock dying seised. The testator therefore proceeds in the two sections next following (the second of which is the last but one of the will already quoted), to provide for the difficulty. He begins by saying — “ So far as the rules of law against what are legally denominated perpetuities may permit, I desire to prevent the possibility of. the occurrence of any escheat of my estate, real or personal, which would not have occurred or taken place if all my said children had been born in wedlock.” He then provides for the continuation of the estate in the children and grandchildren and their issue “ until twenty-one years after the death of the longest-lived of them, and only such issue of them or any of them who may be living at his death;” and concludes by providing that their estates <em>“ </em>shall then and thereupon pass to and vest in such person or persons as would then have been entitled to the same if all my said children had been begotten by me of my said wife after our marriage, and as if <em>I </em>had lived until such time or times and had <em>then died the owner of the same.”</em>

Hence, in the next paragraph, to prevent John K. Souder, the father of Mrs. Souder’s children, who by her illegitimacy became a new stock as <em>perquisitors, </em>from carrying the estate into a new line of descent, he provided that if the children of Ann Souder or <em>their issue </em>should <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>die in the lifetime of John K. Souder, the subject of their devises and bequests should <em>“ </em>pass to and vest in such person or persons, and for such estate or estates, as would then have taken or been entitled to the same, if my said deceased daughter (Ann Souder) had lived until then, <em>and had then died the'absolute owner </em>of the same, <em>a widow </em>and intestate.”</p>
    <p id="b176-6" data-blocks='[["BL_176.6",176,[278,705,1159,511]]]'>Thus, by making her the stock from whom the descent should be east, by force of the terms of the will, he prevented the estate from passing out of the line of her blood, in case the issue of her children, having lived to take the estate absolutely by arriving at twenty-one years of age, should die without issue in the lifetime of John K. Souder. That this paragraph I have just considered is a part of the provision against the effects of the illegitimacy of some of his children, appears on the face of the will itself; for in the next and last paragraph the testator expressly links the three preceding paragraphs together, and declares that their provisions shall not prevent alienation by deed or will of the several devisees and legatees.</p>
    <p id="b176-7" data-blocks='[["BL_176.7",176,[281,1216,1154,173]]]'>There are other considerations arising from the language and effect of the last paragraph but one, which are convincing that its purpose was not to create a new limitation of the estates of his grandchildren, in direct conflict with what had gone before.</p>
    <p id="b176-8" data-blocks='[["BL_176.8",176,[281,1388,1161,1067]],["BL_177.1",177,[242,446,1154,641]]]'>This will was written by an eminent lawyer, and from its whole tenor we discover that its language is precise, technical and well weighed. Now, if he intended that on the death of one of Mrs. Souder’s children his or her share should go to the survivor, how natural and easy to say so, instead of the most singular circumlocution (this being the design) of saying it should pass as if Mrs. Souder had lived to take it, and had survived her husband, John Souder. Notice also, he says the subject of the devises and bequests hereinbefore contained shall pass and vest. Not as if he intended something new, but that what he had already done should go on in a certain way, in case John K. Souder is alive at the time; that it shall pass just as if he were dead. Notice also, that he refers not only to the children of Ann Souder, but her <em>issue </em>also, manifestly not tautologically, but referring to air indefinite time of issue, a purpose comporting entirely with an intention to provide, as far as the law against perpetuity would let him, to remove the obstacle caused by her illegitimacy. It is argued against this, that his design was to preserve equality among his descendants, which the former paragraph would defeat, by giving the share of a deceased grandchild over to its aunts and uncles in shares doubly larger than that of the surviving grandchild. But this argument runs against the fact, that such is the expressed intention in the former paragraph, which must prevail if John K. Souder die first. What motives had he for the singular provision, that if he died first the estate of the grandchild should be divided <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>among uncles and aunts and the survivor, but if he were alive then the share should pass to the surviving grandchild ? This was as much as to say to the survivor, If your father be alive you shall have your deceased brother’s or sister’s share ; but if he, your natural protector, be dead, and no longer able to aid and care for you, all this share shall pass from you but a trifle. If that be the design, it exhibits the testator as capricious, changeable and acting without motive. But when we notice that the testator treats the latter clause as one of three in <em>pari materid, </em>and that this illegitimate being cut off by law from his blood, his estate would, after vesting in the issue of his devisees and legatees who attained majority, pass out of the former clause) reading only issue dying underage), and that by operation of the bastardy it would pass into a new line of descent, or else escheat, we can readily comprehend the effect intended by the latter clause.</p>
    <p id="b177-6" data-blocks='[["BL_177.6",177,[240,1088,1155,86]]]'>The clauses being therefore reconcilable, the estate passes under the former, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>
