Besides, if the administrator-had not the right to appeal, the Register’s Court had not jurisdiction, and all that was done was <em>coram non judiee.</em>

We have no dispensing and no enlarging power in respect to it. If the legislature have not given administrators the right of appeal, we cannot give it.
