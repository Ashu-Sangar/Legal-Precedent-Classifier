Steinman and Charles Regnier, trading as George M. Steinman &amp; Co., against Abraham T. Bair, in which Martin Groff, Jr., was garnishee.</p>

On the 1st of January 1864 the sheriff attached all the property of defendant in the hands of Groff; and notified Bair, who made no claim for his exemption. The plaintiffs filed interrogatories which the garnishee answered January 25th 1864, admitting that he owed Bair $145, and on the 4th of February, judgment was rendered against the garnishee for that amount.</p>

On the trial the defendant asked the court (Long, P. J.) to charge that he had the right to claim the exemption; this was refused, and the jury instructed to find for the plaintiffs, because the defendant had failed to give notice to the sheriff of his claim. The verdict being for the plaintiff, this instruction was assigned for error.</p>
