      <em>“ </em>In the engineer’s estimate, the price allowed for the work actually done was $6.80. It is said that the increase of $1.30 in the price was inadequate, and 'there is evidence that ‘ ashler range’ masonry was worth $10 or $12. If the parties treated this change in the work as a change to that extent, of the written contract, then the plaintiffs ought to recover that sum which, under the evidence, would be equal to the increased cost beyond what they have received. The fact of the allowance of the increased price in the estimate beyond the rate fixed in the contract, is relied on as evidence that the contract itself had been replaced by a new agreement; the value of the fact is left to the jury to decide. If the parties agreed that $6.80 should be the price of the new masonry, and the plaintiffs have been paid at that rate, there can be no recovery. But if there was no such agreement— if the plaintiffs were employed to do new work, entirely different from that specified in the contract, and if they went on and performed it without any stipulation, express or implied, either that they should receive the contract price or that the engineer should adjust the increased compensation, a case would be presented excluding the engineer’s authority to decide conclusively the rights of the parties.

He was to ascertain and report the <em>‘ </em>amount and quantity’ of the work specified in the contract, at the contract rates.

This is the substance of the stipulation in the contract before us between the contractor with the company and his sub-contractor, the plaintiff below.</p>

The allowance was final if the engineer had authority to make the change; and if there was on fraud or mistake, that he had the authority to make the change, the contract is express. It <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>says: “And further, that any alterations in the form or materials which may be directed in writing by said engineer shall be made by such contractor as directed.”</p>

The contractor is by the very terms of his contract, as the portion above quoted shows, bound to do the work as directed. Alterations, therefore, when directed and executed, are as much within the contract as any other part of the work. This gives jurisdiction to the engineer to determine and estimate the allowance incident to the change; and if fair, or rather, not fraudulent, which was not pretended, is conclusive. “ He (the engineer) shall,” says the contract, “ in all cases decide every question which can or may arise relative to the execution of the contract.” Then his decision is to be final and conclusive. The question of compensation necessarily arose in this ease as incident to the change, and we see in the final estimate it was considered, and an allowance of $1.30 per cubic yard made in consequence of it.</p>

Certainly for work done outside of the contract the engineer had no jurisdiction to determine anything about it. It is alleged that the work claimed for, under this branch of the case, was after the completion of the work under the written contract, and after it had been taken off the contractor’s hands. If, therefore, it was extra work not paid for, the plaintiff had a right to claim for it in this action. Indeed, the plaintiff in error submitted no argument on this part of his case. We discover nothing wrong in it, but the first assignment of error being sustained, the judgment is reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>
