The principal of the trust by it is given to the survivors of John Foulke’s children in the&gt; event which occurred, viz.: the death of Mary Foulke without issue. These surviving children were Richard Foulke and Eleanor Long. But the sixth item (already quoted) creates a difficulty in the case. Mr. Clay insisted that the provisions of this item had no application, because Richard Foulke had <em>not </em>died <em>before </em>Mary <em>and </em>Eleanor Foulke, but only before one of them. Mr. Vail contended that the word £ <em>and </em>’ should be read £ or,’ so that if Richard died before <em>either </em>Mary or Eleanor, the provisions of this item did apply; that the whole will showed the testatrix’s desire to keep the principal of the trust set apart for her two nieces during their lives, in the family; and that in order to effectuate this intention, it was necessary to read the copulative as a disjunctive conjunction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b203-10" data-blocks='[["BL_203.10",203,[221,1568,1152,374]]]'>“ It is unquestionably true that the plain ordinary reading of the words of this clause, requires the death of Richard Foulke to occur before <em>loth </em>of his sisters, in order to allow it to alter the previous provisions of the will in the event that occurred. It is equally true that the law constantly construes £ <em>and </em>’ for£ <em>or,’ </em>and £ <em>or </em>’ for £ and,’ in cases where it is necessary so to do in order to carry out the intent of the testator. But this intent 'must be made to appear: 2 Roper on Legacies 1405†, 1410† ; 2 Wills on Executors 932*. It must be to effectuate a clear intention.</p>

In order to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, we must place ourselves as we would have been immediately upon Mary’s death. Then under the third item creating the trust, Richard and Eleanor, being the surviving children of John Foulke, would be entitled to the principal in equal parts. But it is contended that the sixth item prevents this; and snatching the principal from Richard and Eleanor gives it to his issue. If so, <em>when </em>are this issue to take ? Certainly, not at once, for Richard still living may have more children; so that the principal must be invested, and the income must accumulate until Richard’s death, for <em>then only </em>can the number of the issue be known, and there is nothing in the will to authorize the pay<a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>ment of the interest meanwhile to Bichard and Eleanor. No such intent as this appears in the will.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b204-6" data-blocks='[["BL_204.6",204,[264,541,1156,1056]]]'>“ Moreover, this would make the testatrix discriminate not only against the surviving niece, but also against Bichard, in order to favour his unknown issue. Had this clause not been inserted, then, upon the event which occurred, Bichard would have received one half of Mary’s trust estate, and Eleanor the other half; but Mary happening to die before him, he gets none of it, and all of the trust goes to Bichard’s heirs, and <em>his </em>only chance of getting any of either of his sister’s trusts is his surviving them both. This surely is not the meaning of the will. Again, had the third and fourth items alone been in the will, then Bichard surviving one of his sisters, and she dying without issue, he would get one-half of her trust, and also surviving the other, likewise dying without issue, he would get the whole of her trust, or $5250 in all. But, thought the testatrix, he may die before either of his sisters, and then no part of this $7000 will reach his children; and for this contingency she provides, by saying in the sixth clause that the whole of the $7000 should go to his issue, as Mary and Eleanor, or both should respectively die without issue. This would make the testatrix discriminate in favour of Bichard’s issue, and against Mary and Eleanor, in the event of either of them dying after him without issue, and then the issue of Bichard being ascertained and fixed by reason of his previous death, would at once take the share of their aunt so dying, and when the surviving aunt died without issue, they would also take the principal of her trust.</p>

The testatrix in looking back over what she had written (for the original is all in her own handwriting), saw that in the third and fourth items creating the trusts for her nieces, she had provided for the following contingencies, viz.: First, The death of one of the sisters without issue, and Bichard surviving, he and the surviving sister would take the principal of the deceased sister’s trust in equal parts. Second, The death of both sisters without issue, Bichard surviving, he would then take the whole of the last surviving sister’s trust. Third, The death of Bichard before either sister, and then the death of one of the sisters without issue; the surviving sister taking the whole of her sister’s trust, there remained but one other possible contingency, and for this no provision had thus far been made. Fourth, The death of Bichard <em>before </em>the surviving sister, and she dying without issue, and to meet this possibility, made the provision in the sixth item, if Bichard died before his sisters, his issue should take the surviving sister’s share in the event of her leaving no issue. It is true that this intent could <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>have been expressed in more explicit language than that used in the will; but it is submitted that this is what she meant to provide, and that this is a more reasonable interpretation than to say, that she meant that upon the contingency of Richard’s dying before either or both of his sisters, neither he or either of his sisters should have any of the principal of these trusts. In the opinion of the auditor, upon the death of Mary Foulke without issue, the principal became divisible between Richard Foulke and Eleanor Long in equal parts.”</p>

Mary died without issue, leaving her brother Richard and her sister Eleanor her survivors. But by the terms of the will this sum passed to them as tenants in common. By the will a similar sum in the same form had been given to Eleanor, and the sixth item of the will was in these words: “ Item. In case my nephew, Richard Foulke, should die before my nieces Mary and Eleanor Foulke, and they my said nieces should die leaving no issue, then I will and direct, if there be issue of my nephew Richard Foulke living, that the <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>said $7000 herein given to my said nieces shall be divided equally between them.” This clause never came into operation, because Richard died after Mary hut before Eleanor, who is still living and married.
