    <p class="summary" id="b364-9" data-blocks='[["BL_364.9",364,[289,1224,1150,83]]]'>The court below (Conyngham, P. J.) delivered the following opinion:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b364-10" data-blocks='[["BL_364.10",364,[283,1309,1158,712]]]'>££ The action here is brought upon a contract for the sale of certain real estate for a definite money price, but with the further provision that such payments shall be made in axes. It is a real contract, for the non-performance of which, upon the part of the defendants, they are responsible in damages, estimated as the unpaid portion of the purchase-money, with interest. It is not a contract between the parties for the sale and delivery of personal property at a stipulated price, that is to say of axes at a certain valuation per dozen: the contract is for the sale of land at a definite price, the mode of payment of such price being only incidental. That this must have been the clear meaning of the parties is evident from the stipulation that in case £ of default in payment of any instalment for the term of sixty days,’ the purchasers agree to a confession of judgment, with condemnation of real estate £ for the amount of said payment, interest and costs,’ thus clearly ascertaining and liquidating the damages upon any such failure.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b364-11" data-blocks='[["BL_364.11",364,[282,2032,1154,425]]]'>££ The question raised here is, whether the plaintiff can claim as damages, when the axes were not delivered, any greater sum than the stipulated price of the land and interest. Regarding this agreement, as we are disposed to consider it, as an undertaking to pay for the real estate a fixed price in money, though payable in axes, the rule laid down in the books seems to be that such an agreement gives the payee or vendee of the land the option to pay the price in money or in property; that the election is with him, and that the vendor has no further claim than for the price of his land and interest.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[205,444,1160,772]]]'>
      <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>44 Chipman, in his Law of Contracts, p. 35, thus states the principle, citing as his authority Poth. on Ob. No. 497: 4 All agreements to pay in specific articles are presumed to be made in favour of the debtor, and he may in all cases pay the amount of the debt in money in lieu of the articles, which by the terms of the contract the creditor had agreed to receive instead of money.’ He says also,4 If A. give B. a note for $100, payable il? wheat at a future day, at 75 cents per bushel, and wheat, on the day of payment, be $1 per bushel, A. may, at his election, pay in wheat of an average quality at 75 cents per bushel, or pay $100 in money.’ This rule, in nearly parallel language, is adopted by Mr. Justice Ross, in Roberts <em>v. </em>Beatty, 2 Penna. R. 63, and reaffirmed in same book, p. 301, Church <em>v. </em>Feterow. In Plowman <em>v. </em>McLane, 7 Alabama 755, it is decided that a promise to pay a certain sum of money at a certain time, which may be discharged in leather, is a conditional contract, leaving the debtor the option of paying in that manner if he elect. We refer also to 2 Pars, on Contracts 163, in notes, for the same general doctrine.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b365-6" data-blocks='[["BL_365.6",365,[198,1216,1165,985]]]'>44 Here the defendants, or those under whom they claim, covenant to pay for the real estate $2300, a money price, and attach a further agreement to pay in merchantable steel and iron poll axes at a fixed value per dozen, &amp;c. Looking, then, to the contract, and considering all the attendant circumstances, who can doubt that the intent of the parties was in conformity with the legal intent we have stated ? The plaintiff, being the owner of an axe factory, for a certain price, its presumed value, which he agrees to take, sells the same to the defendants; they become .the operators and workmen in the manufacture of axes, and to avoid the necessity of a sale to others, so as to raise money to pay the instalments of the purchase-money, it is agreed that the seller shall take the axes in payment at a definite price. Common knowledge of business teaches every one that this would be a privilege to the vendee, particularly so when with both parties, to avoid the uncertainty of a market price, the value of the article is agreed upon. Again, if the seller receives the full stipulated price of his farm, why has he not received full satisfaction ? There is nothing in the transaction to lead us to think that a speculation in the rise and fall of the price of axes entered into the consideration of the parties in the sale and purchase of the factory; it was a convenient mode of payment for the debtors, and at the price fixed we may suppose no great risk to the sellers.</p>

Upon principle, independently of authority, this is manifest. In the former the damages, as a general rule, is the difference between the contract price, and the market price at the time appointed for delivery. In the latter, the delivery of specific articles is an alternative mode of paying a fixed sum of money, which, if not delivered, leaves the rule of damages for non-payment of money untouched, namely, interest. This was the view of the learned judge, and is so well vindicated in the opinion delivered by him that we forbear further remarks.</p>
