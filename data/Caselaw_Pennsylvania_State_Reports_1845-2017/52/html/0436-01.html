They could not recover unless they had shown that the defendant came into possession of the property in dispute under George Tricker, as whose property it was sold by the sheriff. In attempting to do this they prove that the defendant was Tricker’s wife, and this fact defeats their action, as a married woman cannot be sued alone. If we are correct in this position, it necessarily follows that the points submitted by plaintiff’s counsel cannot be affirmed.”</p>

Let it be supposed, as said by Justice Rogers in Zeigler <em>v. </em>Fisher, 3 Barr 367, that there <em>may </em>be still a plea in abatement or something tantamount in case of extraordinary emergency, and by Kennedy, J., in Campbell <em>v. </em>Galbreath, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20428" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="5 Watts 428">5 Watts 428</a>, yet it does not follow that there <em>must </em>be. By the 4th section of the Act of 13th April 1807, it is enacted that “ the plea in ejectment shall be '•Not Guilty.” It has always been held that any available defence may be taken under this plea; while, indeed, some have' thought no other plea can be pleaded in the face of the statute. Whatever may be the common-law rule in other actions, in ejectment “not guilty” is the general-issue plea; and we are of opinion coverture may be given in evidence under it.</p>
