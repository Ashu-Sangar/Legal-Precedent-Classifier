But the qualification is most material, since it cannot fail to operate as a weighty caution upon the minds of all judges, and it forbids relief whenever the evidence is loose, equivocal or contradictory, or is in its texture open to doubt, or to opposing presumptions. Such is the language of Judge Story in his admirable Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence. The proof must be such as will strike all minds alike as being unquestionable and free from reasonable doubt.\nSuch is not the case before us; the evidence is contradictory and open to doubt, and a plain mistake is not made out by satisfactory proofs, and this was probably the opinion of the learned president judge in the court below. The decree must therefore be reversed and tbe bill dismissed, but as there is a suit on tbe common-law side of the court in which this whole'question may be raised and decided, tbe bill is dismissed without prejudice.",

Relief in cases of writings will not be granted when the evidence is loose, equivocal or contradictory; open to doubt or to opposing presumptions.\n3. The proof must be such as will strike all minds alike as being unquestionable and free from Reasonable doubt.\nOctober 23d 1868.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Read, A&new and Shabswood, JJ.\nAppeal by Jacob Edmonds from the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of' Venango county: In Equity: No. 132, to October and November Term 1868.\nThe Cumberland Yalley Mutual Protection Company filed a bill against Jacob Edmonds, alleging that on the 13th of September 1862 the defendant made a written application to them for insur anee against fire on hi's buildings and their contents for three years, and in pursuance of the application it was resolved to issue a policy for three years; that by mistake, the scrivener who prepared the policy inserted \u201cfive\u201d instead of \u201cthree,\u201d so that it appeared on the face of the policy that the insurance was to continue for five years; that after the expiration of three years and within five years the property insured was burned, and the defendant has commenced an action, to April Term 1867, against the plaintiffs on the policy, for the recovery of the amount insured. The prayer was that the policy might be cancelled and the defendant restrained from carrying on an action on it.\nThe answer averred that the premium paid upon the application was for an insurance for five years, and that the agent of the plaintiffs by mistake inserted \u201c three\u201d in the application; other facts to the same effect were alleged, and the answer averred that the plaintiffs had a remedy at law.\nThe application contained a statement of the property insured, in detail, with the amount insured and the premium on each species; there was written on its face \u201c three years,\u201d and attached to it was a premium-note for $180, which referred to the application for insurance and in which it was stated that it was in consideration of policy No. 7624, to be dated September 22d 1862 and issued when the application should be approved. A statement appended to the application showed that part of the premium was made up by part of the premium of an unexpired policy.\nThe policy was dated September 23d on the property mentioned in the application to which it referred, and was against loss.by fire \u201c during the term of five years from the 22d day of September 1862 until the 22d day of September 1867.\u201d The plaintiffs gave evidence that the amount paid and allowed for the premium of the old policy and all the entries, &e., on the application indicated that the insurance was to be for three years.\nThe defendant gave evidence by the agent who effected the insurance and drew the application, who stated that at the time the insurance was made the estimate was made for a five years\u2019 risk and the defendant paid for such risk; that he recorded the risk in his books first as a three years\u2019 risk, and having called on defendant about the time it would thus have expired to renew it, and being told it was for five years, he examined policy 7624 and the surrendered policy, made a new calculation and found that the defendant had paid for five years, \u2014 he then altered his record of the risk to five years.\nThere was other evidence on both sides.\nThe Court of Common Pleas, Trunkey, P. J., dissenting, decreed that the policy be declared void and be delivered up to be cancelled, and that the defendant be enjoined from prosecuting his action on the policy.\nThe dates of the several proceedings in the Common Pleas did not appear in the paper-books.\nThe defendant appealed, and assigned the decree for error.\nW. L. Qorlett (with whom was J. B. Saneoclc), for appellant.\nA court of equity will not cancel a policy of insurance unless the mistake is clearly shown: Henkle v. The Royal Exchange Assurance Co., 1 Vesey, Sr., 317; Lyman v. United Assurance Co., 2 Cranch 630; Barnwell v. Boston Marine Insurance Co., Id. 442; Gillespie v. Moore, 2 J. C. C. R. 597-98; Lyman v.

Lebenguth, 2 Rawle 430; Graham v. Pancoast, 6 Casey 97; Narr v.
