        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, January 4th 1869, by\nWilliams, J.\nThere is no assignment of error in this case, and as we discover no error in the record, the judgment must be affirmed. It is clear that Conkle\u2019s title to the property levied on by the sheriff was not divested by his deed of voluntary assignment to the plaintiff until after the lien of the defendant\u2019s execution had attached.\nThough the deed was signed and acknowledged by Conkle before the hour at which the execution went into the sheriff\u2019s hands, a blank was left therein for the insertion of the name of the assignee as soon as one should be determined on or procured, and the plaintiff\u2019s name was not inserted as such assignee until the second day after the defendant\u2019s writ was received by the sheriff.\nAt the time the writ went into the sheriff\u2019s hands there had been no delivery of the deed. It had been merely left in the hands of the scrivener until an assignee should be selected or procured.\nThe title to the property remained in Conkle, and did not pass to the assignee until after the insertion of his name in the deed, and its delivery to him. The insertion of his name as assignee was essential to the completion and validity of the instrument; and, as was said in McKinney v. Rhoads, 5 Watts 844, delivery of the instrument was necessary to constitute it a deed and consequently to protect the property from execution. The court below, therefore, rightly instructed the jury that the voluntary assignment, executed in the manner it was, did not, before an assignee was named or inserted in the deed, divest the property of the defendant in the execution.\nJudgment affirmed.\nAgwbw, J., was holding a Court of Oyer and Terminer in Westmoreland county, from the 9th to the 14th of November, inclusive.",

    "head_matter": "Reamer versus Lamberton et al.\n1. An assignment for the benefit of creditors, leaving a blank for the assignee\u2019s name, was executed and acknowledged. An execution was after-wards issued against the assignor and put into the sheriff\u2019s hands; subsequently the assignee\u2019s name was inserted and the assignment recorded. Held, that the title to the property remained in the assignor till the assignee\u2019s name had been inserted and the assignment delivered to him, and the assignor\u2019s goods were not protected from the execution.\n2. The insertion of the assignee\u2019s name was necessary to the validity of the assignment.\nNovember 13th 1868.\nPresent, Thompson, C. J., Read, Sharswood and Williams, JJ. Agnew, J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny county: No. 12, to October and November Term 1868.\nThis was a sheriff\u2019s interpleader between Josiah Reamer, assignee for the benefit of creditors of A. Conkle, and R. Lamberton & Co., to try the title to certain goods levied on under a fi. fa. to March Term 1867 of the Common Pleas, at the suit of Lamberton & Co. against Conkle.\nLamberton\u2019s execution was for $4725, was tested December 8th 1866, and placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands at 8J o\u2019clock P. M. of that day. On the same day, Conkle executed and acknowledged a deed of assignment for the benefit of his creditors, leaving a blank for the name of the assignee; the assignment was left with the. scrivener until the name of an assignee could be procured and inserted. This was all done before Lamberton\u2019s execution came into the sheriff\u2019s hands. On the 10th of December, the name of Reamer was inserted in the blank, and the deed then put on record. On the 11th of December, the sheriff levied on Oonkle\u2019s goods in question in the issue.\nThe court (Mellon, J.) charged that the assignment did not divest the property of Conkle. The jury found for the defendants. The plaintiff took out a writ of error. No assignment of error was filed.\nR. G. Kirkpatrick, for plaintiff,\ncited Lucas v. Sunbury and E.
