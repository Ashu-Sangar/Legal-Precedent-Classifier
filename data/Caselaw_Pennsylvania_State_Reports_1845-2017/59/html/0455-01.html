It seems to me the councils were under no imperative necessity to sue the contractor and his surety for a breach of the contract, and exhaust their legal remedies against them, but that they might compromise the matter by rescinding the contract and entering into a new one, on fair and reasonable terms, if they acted in good faith, and without any fraud or collusion.” This is common sense and good law.</p>
