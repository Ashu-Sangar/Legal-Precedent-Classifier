Seltzer, for plaintiff, testified, that in 1854 the plaintiff and defendant settled their accounts in his presence; the settlement resulted in a balance in favor of the plaintiff of from $3700 to $3900. It was agreed that $1500, being about 40 per cent, of the amount, should be paid by a note from the defendant to witness, who was a creditor of the plaintiff, and that the balance beyond 40 per cent, should be paid when Batdorf was able. Amongst the items making up the indebtedness was a note from the defendant to Plickinger &amp; Eshelman, endorsed by the plaintiff, which he said he had paid, but which was not then produced. There was other evidence of the indebtedness of the defendant to the plaintiff, and also of the defendant’s ability to pay.</p>

The authorities cited apply to the former exclusively, and show that they are not to be altered or varied by parol, except for fraud, accident or mistake. But this case belongs to the latter description, and is governed by different principles. Receipts when mere acknowledgments of delivery or payment, are but primá. facie evidence of the facts and not conclusive, and therefore these facts may be contradicted by oral testimony: 1 Greenl. on Ev. § 305. The instances in our books, in which this rule has been applied are too numerous to be cited, but among them, see 3 S. &amp; R. 355; <a href="/watts-serg/1/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 321" data-case-ids="1852530" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0321-01">1 W. &amp; S. 321</a>; 5 Barr 151; 1 Harris 46 and 62; 8 Barr 264; <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%20236" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="2 Jones 236">2 Jones 236</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20294" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="2 Wright 294">2 Wright 294</a>. The testimony complained of, showed what the words of the receipt applied to. This was proper in order to prevent a fraudulent use of the receipt. It disclosed that it was delivered for one purpose, while the attempt was to pervert it to another. Law, in our equitable administration of it, is as efficient to prevent the fraudulent use of an instrument, as is equity to restrain it. The cases of Dutton <em>v. </em>Tilden, 1 Harris 46, Park <em>v. </em>Chadwick, 8 S. &amp; W. 96, Grans <em>v. </em>Renshaw, 7 Barr 117, 9 Id. 275, cited by the counsel for the defendant very conclusively establish this. On both grounds the testimony was properly admissible, and if credible, which the jury thought it was, served to defeat a fraudulent use of the receipt.</p>
