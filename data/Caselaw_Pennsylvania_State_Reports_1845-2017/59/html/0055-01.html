The sisters of the whole blood with their husbands asked that administration should be granted to Barbara Miller and her husband David Miller. The brothers and sister of the half blood, with the sister’s husband, asked that administration should be granted to Joseph Single. On the 13th of January 1868, the Register’s Court, composed of the register, Graham, P. J., and one of the associates of the Court of Common Pleas, directed that administration should be granted to Barbara and David Miller. Joseph Single appealed and assigned the decree for error.</p>

In granting letters to the kindred of the intestate, it uses this language, “ preferring always of those so entitled such as are in the nearest degree of consanguinity with the decedent, and also preferring males to females.” This provision, tkken in connection with the 4th section, 5th article of the Intestate Act of the 8th April 1833, which enacts that the personal estate of the intestate shall be distributed among brothers and sisters of the intestate “ <em>without distinction of blood,” </em>clearly indicates that the register must grant letters to the brothers of the half blood in preference to the sisters of the whole blood.</p>
    <p id="b56-7" data-blocks='[["BL_56.7",56,[265,1006,1146,336]]]'>Mr. Justice Williams, in his learned treatise on the Law of Executors and Administrators, vol. i., p. 410 (6th ed.), says: “ Where there are several persons standing in the same degree of kindred to the intestate, the statute we have seen, gives the ordinary his election to accept any one or more of such persons. It remains to inquire by what principles and rules of practice his discretion in making such election has been guided in the ecclesiastical courts.”</p>
    <p id="b56-8" data-blocks='[["BL_56.8",56,[260,1352,1157,767]]]'>One of these rules is, that “ the whole blood is preferable in the grant of administration to the half blood, though the majority of interests concur in the latterId. p. 411, which is thus explained in note (b) to 1 Welsby and Beavan’s Ohitty’s Collection of the Statutes, p. 1410, under the title “Executors and Administrators.” “Although it seems to have been at one time-held that the whole blood has not any preference to the half, in respect of the rights of administration, any more than in the case of distribution (Aleyn. 36; Sty. 74; 2 Bla. Com. 505), this doctrine can no longer be considered to be law, it having been decided in Mercer <em>v. </em>Morland, 2 Lee 500, that where the contest for administration is between one of the whole blood and one of the half blood, the whole blood is preferable, although the majority of interests concur in favor of the latter, unless material objections can be proved against him of the whole blood; and it has accordingly been held that the guardian of a minor of the whole blood is entitled to a grant of administration in preference to the half blood: Stratton <em>v. </em>Linton, 31 L. J. P. M. 48.”</p>
