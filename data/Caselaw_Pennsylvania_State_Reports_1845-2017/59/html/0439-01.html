The power to make such reservation depends on the provisions of the Act of June 12th 1839, entitled “ An act relating to the several courts in the county of Allegheny,” Pamph. L. 262, by the 5th section <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>of which it is declared that “ It shall he lawful for any of the said judges, when he thinks it expedient, to reserve questions of law which may arise on the trial for the consideration and judgment of both of the judges of the said court sitting together, provided that either party shall have the right to a bill of exceptions to the opinion of the court as if the point had been rjiled and decided on the trial of the cause.”</p>
    <p id="b442-6" data-blocks='[["BL_442.4",442,[276,689,1153,423]]]'>There are two rules which are necessary to he observed in such’ ■reservations. The first is, that they can only be of pure questions of law. In order that such questions may be reserved, it is requisite that the facts should be agreed by the parties or found by the jury, for <em>ex facto oritur jus: </em>Clark <em>v. </em>Wilder, 1 Casey 314; Irwin <em>v. </em>Wickersham, Id. <em>316; </em>Wilson <em>v. </em>Steamboat Tuscarora, Id. 317. If a point of law be reserved, it must be done by stating on the record the facts on which it arises, without which judgment cannot be entered <em>non obstante veredicto: </em>Winchester <em>v. </em>Bennett, 4 P. F. Smith 510.</p>
    <p id="b442-7" data-blocks='[["BL_442.5",442,[286,1116,1143,204]]]'>It may no doubt also be a pure question of law whether there is any evidence at all to go to the jury on some fact essential to the plaintiff’s case, or, if the plaintiff’s case is admitted or conclusively established, on some fact essential to the defendant’s defence.</p>
    <p id="b442-8" data-blocks='[["BL_442.6",442,[286,1330,1141,640]]]'>The second rule is that the question or questions of law must be such as to rule the case. It is of course worse than useless to reserve every question of law which may arise in the course of a trial. The main object of a reserved point is to save the necessity of a second trial — the verdict of the jury on the facts, if adverse, precluding the point of law from arising. Thus, if the question reserved is whether there is any evidence to go to the jury, the verdict against the sufficiency of the proof disposes of the whole question. But the reservation of subordinate questions does not yield this or any other advantage, but tends only to embarrass and complicate the case. Indeed, I have always been of the opinion and acted upon it, that no point of law can be properly reserved, unless if that point'be held in one way, the court would be bound to give a binding instruction to the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff or for the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b442-9" data-blocks='[["BL_442.7",442,[286,1971,1139,295]]]'>Judged by these rules, the reservation in this case was wrong. The court instructed the <em>jury pro formd </em>to find for the plaintiff, if they believed the uncontradicted evidence in the cause, but reserved the questions submitted by the counsel on both sides. The verdict was for the plaintiff, but afterwards the court <em>in bane </em>entered judgment for the defendants on the questions of law reserved, <em>non obstante veredicto.</em>

It would not certainly have authorized a binding direction to the jury. If affirmed, it would only show that the defendants’ title was bad, not that the plaintiff’s was good, which in ejectment is the important question; for the plaintiff can only recover on the strength of his own title, not on the weakness of the defendant’s. Suppose the will to be invalid, the questions still are on the evidence — can the plaintiff recover on the alleged forfeiture and entry for condition broken under the deed; or failing on that ground as the heir at law of his wife, under the 10th section of the Act of April 8th 1833, entitled “An act relating to the descent and distribution of the estates of intestates,” Pamph. L. 318.</p>
    <p id="b443-9" data-blocks='[["BL_443.8",443,[193,1502,1147,386]]]'>The 2d point is “ that the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon the ground that the condition that Susan Wilde should release her right of dower upon request of plaintiff, was broken by her, and entry afterwards made by plaintiff on the property in dispute.” This evidently was not a pure question of law, and could not have been affirmed by the court without withdrawing from the jury the determination of questions of fact entirely within their province. Courts cannot reserve to themselves the questions of fact which arise, though they may necessarily be mixed with questions of law.</p>
    <p id="b443-10" data-blocks='[["BL_443.9",443,[200,1888,1141,169]]]'>The 3d point is “ that the plaintiff is entitled, upon the whole evidence, to recover.” This is so clearly a mixed question of law and fact which it would have been error if the court had affirmed that we may dismiss it without further remark.</p>

I know of no rule of law that an entry for condition broken must be in the lifetime of the party, by whom the breach was committed. But conceding this, it only affected one aspect of the case. His title as <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>the heir at law of his wife, if she died without any kindred of her own, did not depend upon whether he had made an effective entry. If answered affirmatively, there could not have been a binding direction on the whole case for the defendants.</p>

    <p id="b444-7" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[264,675,1140,246]]]'>The 3d point of the defendants is that <em>“ </em>the deed of trust itself amounts to, and is, a quit-claim deed to all and any property that George W. Wilde had or may thereafter acquire.” This, like the defendants’ 1st point, only bears upon one aspect of the plaintiff’s claim — his title under the forfeiture and re-entry — and did not therefore rule the case.</p>
