The second is that the charter of the Erie Canal Company does not impose upon that company the duty of making or keeping in repair public bridges connecting highways intersected by the canal: Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Duquesne Borough, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20223" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 Wright 223">10 Wright 223</a>; Meadville <em>v. </em>The Erie Canal Co., 6 Harris 66.</p>
    <p id="b176-10" data-blocks='[["BL_176.15",176,[289,1909,1136,213]]]'>This leaves in this cause but one question, whether the Act of March 16th 1864, entitled “An act to compel the Erie Canal Company to construct and keep in repair the bridges made necessary by the construction of their canal,” is a constitutional exercise of legislative power.</p>
    <p id="b176-11" data-blocks='[["BL_176.16",176,[288,2121,1136,216]]]'>Had the legislature seen fit to impose such a duty upon any municipal corporation within whose bounds the bridges were, it seems now well settled that they would have had the right to do so: Sharpless <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 9 Harris 147; Kirby <em>v. </em>Shaw, 7 Harris 258; City of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Field, 8 P.

Art. ix., § 17, 3 Story on the Const. 260. But it has been expressly decided by this court that a charter to a company to make a lock navigation in a public stream is a contract, and that no new terms can be subsequently imposed by the legislature, not within the scope of the original grant: Monongahela Navigation Co. <em>v. </em>Coon, 6 Barr 379. In that case the act of incorporation contained no clause subjecting the company to liability for consequential damages arising from the construction of the work committed to them, and it was held that the legislature could not by a subsequent act, without their acceptance, impose that responsibility upon them.</p>
    <p id="b177-8" data-blocks='[["BL_177.7",177,[206,1346,1139,292]]]'>The power of the state would have been incompetent to burden the company with charges not originally imposed on it.

L. 518. That while the state retained this power of resumption, the company submitted to and accepted, either expressly or tacitly, many impositions laid on them by acts of the legislature which they might have resisted, may be true; but there is nothing which can be construed to be an agreement express or implied to surrender to the state the poVer of making whatever changes they might see fit.</p>
