The defendants appear to have been partners in the business of getting out and running timber to this and other markets; the contract, therefore, if made, was within the scope of the business, and though made by but one of the partners would bind both. And this, notwithstanding it is in writing, and purports to be under seal. But this suit is not on the speciality — that is only used as evidence of the existence of the contract declared on. [There is another reason why the cause cannot be dismissed on that ground — if the contract was after-wards modified by parol; in that case the suit in its present form, is proper.] * * * * * *</p>

There is some evidence in regard to that here.] Mr. Scott relates a conversation between Baum and the plaintiff in 1863, which would indicate that the contract was still open for performance, and delivery promised and expected. If Mr. Scott is not mistaken about the lumber to which that conversation related, it would tend to show the breach had not yet occurred. I would say, however, that it is only where expectation of performance has been kept up, and the time of it deferred by mutual consent, that a breach can be regarded as postponed beyond the time originally stipulated for performance.</p>

This agreement was under seal, and purported to be executed by one of the members of a firm. The action was assumpsit, and both in the original and the amended declaration the agreement in question was set out, not as the cause of action, but as inducement to a parol promise by the defendants to the plaintiff. Any alteration of a specialty by parol makes the whole contract parol; covenant cannot be maintained upon it; the terms of the specialty are in effect adopted, and become a part of the parol agreement: Vicary <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/watts/2/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Watts 451" data-case-ids="1840171" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0451-01">2 Watts 451</a>; Vaughn <em>v. </em>Ferris, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 46" data-case-ids="1853566" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0046-01">2 W. &amp; S. 46</a>. It follows <em>ex necessitate </em>that the agreement under seal was admissible, to be followed, as it was, by evidence of an extension or alteration by parol: Charles <em>v. </em>Scott, 1 S. &amp; R. 294. Where an action of assumpsit lies, and the amount which the plaintiff <em>seeks </em>to recover appears by a writing under seal, said writing is admissible : Mehaffy <em>v. </em>Share, 2 Penna. R. 361. If there was a new contract by parol within the scope of the partnership, which was a subsequent and distinct question in the cause, it mattered not whether the agreement as originally executed bound the firm or not.</p>
    <p id="b410-7" data-blocks='[["BL_410.7",410,[298,1346,1143,758]]]'>The 2d error assigned is in admitting evidence of the price of timber in April 1863. This was objected to, because the breach of the agreement occurred, if at all, as early as June 1st 1862; and that should therefore be the time at which the difference between the contract and the market price should be ascertained. But Graham Scott had testified that “ during the spring of'1863, about April 1st, Baum called at Dilworth’s office. Plaintiff asked him what about the six rafts to fill out the contract. Pie stated he had them coming down, and would deliver them. Dilworth was satisfied with that. These six rafts were to be paid for, same as original contract, in four months from delivery.” This certainly was evidence for the jury that there had been a parol alteration and extension of the original agreement, which was by its terms to be performed June 1st 1862. The mutual promises of the parties, the one to deliver and the other to accept and pay, were ample consideration to sustain it as a new contract. The learned judge would, therefore, have erred if he had ruled out' this evidence.</p>

The answer did the plaintiff in error no injury. The learned judge himself, after expressing his opinion on the point presented, re<a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>marked that the suit was not on the contract under seal, hut on a separate and distinct agreement by word of mouth by Baum, one of the firm, to deliver at a subsequent day the rafts which had not been delivered under the original contract, at the price therein agreed on. Whether that contract was binding as within the scope of the partnership business, was another and different question.</p>

I have already referred to the testimony of Graham Scott, and to one of the objections made to this testimony that it showed no consideration. As to the remaining exception taken to it, that it did not refer to the timber included in the written agreement, but to another lot, that surely was a pure question of fact to be responded to by the jurors, and not by the court.</p>
