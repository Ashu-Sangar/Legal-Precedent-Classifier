The county auditors settled his account, finding a balance against him. On the 3d of April 1862 an Act of Assembly was passed authorizing a re-audit of his accounts. In pursuance of this act his accounts were again audited, and on the 30th of July a balance of $528.92 found to be due from him to the county. On the 22d of September Brandon appealed, and on the 5th of March 1864 an agreement was entered into between Brandon and the county, signed by two of the county commissioners, “to make an amicable submission of all matters at variance” to three referees named, “ their award to be final and conclusive, and no appeal is to be taken by either party. John Gr. Brandon is to take a credit of $597.95 balance due him at first settlement, and $707.54 commission on orders received, and what other credits the arbitrators may think him entitled to.” On the same day the parties entered into another agreement signed by the same two commissioners, by which it was agreed that Brandon should “be charged with $1235.53, being the amount received from the collectors for both years, and take a credit for $599.69, for orders paid over at first settlement, over and above what paid the county tax on Darling and Pox’s notes.”</p>

It is very manifest to our minds that the court below set aside the award on the ground of fraud and collusion between two of the county commissioners and the plaintiff in the concoction of the submission, and the agreement controlling the finding to be made by the arbitrators. The effect of these agreements was to prevent an inquiry into the real matters of controversy, and to give to the plaintiff (a relative of one of these two commissioners) a compensation, as county treasurer, of a most extravagant and extraordinary amount, without the approbation of the county auditors, under the Act of 15th of April 1834, or a decision of the arbitrators upon any evidence of its reasonableness.</p>
