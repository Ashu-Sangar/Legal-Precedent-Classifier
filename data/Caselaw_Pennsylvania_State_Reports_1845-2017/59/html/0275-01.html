Such also was the decision in Dewey <em>v. </em>Dupuy, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 553" data-case-ids="1853546" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0553-01">2 W. &amp; S. 553</a>.

After stipulating for payment by the ton, when it exceeded 1250 tons taken, semi-annually, it provides, “ and if less than that amount, then they (the grantees) are to pay on each of the days above mentioned $150; it being distinctly understood and covenanted and agreed by the parties of the second part (Johnston, Taylor &amp; Co.) that they will pay $150 every six months during the term aforesaid, although they may not have mined and taken away an amount of clay equivalent, previous to the time the said sum falls due; but if they take more they are to pay for the same.”</p>

It is not very material to refer the rights acquired under the contract to any specific class of interests in, or arising out of, real estate, for the intention to grant a privilege and to pay for it in a specified way, and at definite periods, is clearly expressed, and the soundest rule in the world is, that which carries into execution the intention 'of the parties. It is highly improper to call the fixed sums to be paid in the event of the <em>minimum </em>of clay not being taken, liquidated damages. <em>It is </em>an alternative price to be paid in an event which it was foreseen might happen, not as damages, but in payment for the privilege. However this may be, it is certain it is nothing like a penalty. We hold that the contract was not a mere license, but the grant of a right or privilege, which the parties were bound to pay for, whether they enjoyed it or not. This was their contract, and they must abide it.</p>
    <p id="b280-6" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[274,1098,1146,899]]]'>We are of opinion, also, that even if, as the defendants claimed, this was a grant of a corporeal interest, a hereditament, there was a sufficient signing to take the contract out of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries. Cowan, the grantor, owner of the land, signed, and that bound <em>him; </em>and this was sufficient: Lowry <em>v. </em>Mehaffey, <a href="/watts/10/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 Watts 387" data-case-ids="1851016" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0387-01">10 Watts 387</a>. The covenantees could enforce the contract against him, for he was bound as the statute requires, by writing. The intention of the framers of the statute was to prevent titles from being divested by parol. Hence he who has a title to convey, must be bound by writing, but the opposite party need not be, on account of anything contained in the statute, for he is not parting with title, and he may recover a conveyance without a written assent. But in this case we hold, as clearly indicated, that the contract before us was not a sale of a corporeal interest, but a mere privilege. This is sustained by Grove <em>v. </em>Hedges, 5 P. F. Smith 504. We see no reason, therefore, why one member of the firm could not bind the firm by signing the firm name in the course of its business. Nothing appears to show us that the contract was beyond its scope. Without enlarging, we think that the court below committed no error in entering the judgment complained of.</p>
