That shortly after the will was made, the said Joshua Howard was found dead in his bed; and that he was on the day previous to his death, in good health. That the plaintiff immediately took possession of Howard’s property, and took the widow into his family to live; that afterwards, Mrs. Howard died suddenly, and without previous illness; that these circumstances caused considerable talk in the town and vicinity as to the strange and sudden manner in which the said Howard and his wife had died; and that it was currently reported that they had died from poison, which reports had been communicated to the defendant. This is offered to show the circumstances under which the words charged were spoken, to repel malice and in mitigation of damages, and to show that the charges made were uttered under a misapprehension of the facts on which they were based.</p>

    <p id="b486-12" data-blocks='[["BL_486.16",486,[305,1434,1135,600]]]'>It is well settled, if anything can be by repeated decisions of this court, that in an action for slander, evidence of the truth of the words is not admissible under the general issue, in mitigation of damages — the only safe rule on the subject, as declared in Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20442" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Wright 442">3 Wright 442</a>, is that if the proposed testimony tend to prove the-tmtLMLthe charge it isjLQiuaádence. Subordínatelo this rule, the defendant may prove, in mitigation of damages, the circumstances which induced him erroneously to make the charge. But the circumstances must not be of such a character as tend to^pmvaJts — truth. Facts and circumstances can only be shown in\ mitigation when they disprove malice and do not tend to prove the charge, or form a link in the chain of evidence to prove a justification: Petrie <em>v. </em>Rose, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20366" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 366">3 W. &amp; S. 366</a>; Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20442" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Wright 442">3 Wright 442</a>.</p>

The circumstances as recited therein, under which Jacob Howard, a childless old man, was found dead in his bed, without any previous sickness, shortly after he had made his will devising his property to the plaintiff — the equally sudden death of his widow, while living in the plaintiff’s family, and whose maintenance was charged on the estate devised — the motive which the plaintiff had for desiring their death, and the other facts stated in the offers certainly tended <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>to prove, though they may have come short of establishing the truth of the charge, that the plaintiff was guilty of their murder by poison, as charged by the defendant.

And if so, they were not admissible under the plea of not guilty in mitigation of damages.</p>
