During the larger part of our juridical history we had no separate court which could by an appropriate decree order an instrument which had been drawn by mistake to be reformed so as to express truly the real understanding and intention of the parties.

It is denied that Webster, as a partner, had an insurable interest in the entire stock, and had a right to insure his partner’s interest as well as his own. The interest of each partner in the assets of the firm is not a title to any aliquot part, as a half or a fourth. Each partner being liable <em>in solido </em>for the engagements of the partnership, has a right, which is termed his equity, because in England it was administered only in the Court of Chancery, to have the firm assets applied in the first instance to the payment of the firm debts — an equity through the instrumentality of which the partnership creditors have a priority over separate creditors to be paid out of the partnership funds. The interest of a partner is therefore only such a proporción of the capital and profits as by the original articles or agreement he may appear to be entitled to receive after all the debts are paid, and the affairs of the concern liquidated and wound up. It is plain, then, each partner has an insurable interest in the entire stock, and on receipt of a loss on insurance must account therefor to the partnership.</p>

Now, the offer of evidence below was to show by persons present when the insurance was effected by the agent of the insurance company, “ that it was stated by Mr. T. Webster that the wool proposed to be insured was owned jointly by himself and William Cross, and he wanted to insure the interest of both ; that the agent said it was not necessary to put both their names in the policy; their joint interest could as well be insured in the name of Webster as to have both names in the policy.”</p>

The testimony adduced fully sustained the offer, so that a chancellor would have considered it amply sufficient <em>on </em>which to found a decree for the reformation of the contract. Tibbals, the agent of the insurance company, himself testified: “I intended that Webster should understand the contract as I did, that the policy covered the whole interest in the wool. I said to Mr. Cross I had insured that wool. I never denied I had insured the whole amount of the wool. I understood all the time the interest of Cross was insured the same as Webster’s, although he denied that he had conveyed to Webster the idea that it made no difference whether Cross’s name was in the policy or not, as the subject was not mentioned; yet Robinson, a witness present on the occasion, said distinctly that Tibbals told Webster it would make no difference whether Cross’s name was in the policy or not, if loss should occur; and two other witnesses testified that Tibbals had admitted the same thing to them.</p>
