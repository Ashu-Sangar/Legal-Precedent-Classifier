On the 7th of March they sold their stock to Jacob Billingsley, at the wholesale price in Pittsburg, including the cost of carriage. The goods were inventoried on the 7th and 8th, and amounted to $1152.89. Final possession was given to Jacob on the 9th. He paid for the goods $552 in cash, and a note at six months for $600, which was paid at maturity. After the sale Patterson rented some land and commenced farming. James continued in the store as a hired-hand under a contract with Jacob for $1 per diem. On the 16th, witness out of the $552 paid a firm-debt to G. W. Dilworth in Pittsburg, and gave notice to the firm-creditors there that Billingsley <em>k </em>Patterson had sold out. The book-debts due to the firm were more than sufficient to pay all the firm-debts at the time of sale. Witness lived across thev street from the store, and occasionally but not often sold goods after the sale. Jacob resided at California, Washington county, at the time of the sale, and has continued to reside there. He often came to Cookstown and returned the same day; was more there than at California. After the sale James remained and sold goods up to the time of the sheriff’s levy. Plaintiff gave evidence that on the 9th of March a notice from Billingsley <em>k </em>Patterson was put on their store-door, that they had sold out and requested their debtors to pay, and that the same notice was posted in other places. He also gave evidence of owning $500 in July 1866.</p>

But if there has been an actual and continued change of possession, the court cannot pronounce the sale fraudulent in law, but must leave the jury, whose province it is, to determine whether or not it is fraudulent in fact.</p>

Undoubtedly the vendor must deliver to the vendee the possession of the property in order to consummate the sale, and render it valid as against creditors. The delivery must be actual, and such as the nature of the property or thing sold, and the circumstances of the sale will reasonably admit, and such as the vendor is capable of making. A mere symbolical or constructive delivery, where an actual or real one is reasonably practicable, is of no avail. There must be an actual separation of the property from the possession of the vendor at the time of the sale, or within a <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>reasonable time afterward, according to the nature of the property: Barr <em>v. </em>Rietz, 3 P.

    <p id="b467-6" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[162,493,1150,547]]]'>But is it essential to such separation that the property shall be removed from the vendor, or the vendor from the property, so that there shall be an actual and visible separation between them, measurable by space or distance ? Must the vendor absolutely cease to have any connection or contact with the property after its delivery, not as owner, but as the agent or servant of the vendee, on pain of having the sale declared fraudulent ? To hold this would be going beyond the established doctrine of our own decisions, and the reason and requirements of the law. Separation of the property from the possession of the vendor implies nothing more than a change of the vendor’s relation to it as owner, and consists in the surrender and transfer of his power and control over it to the vendee.</p>
    <p id="b467-7" data-blocks='[["BL_467.6",467,[162,1050,1149,728]]]'>But in order to prevent fraud the law requires that this shall be done by such appropriate and significant acts as — if done in good faith — shall clearly show the vendor’s intention to part with the possession of the property and transfer it to the vendee. And these acts must be so open and manifest as to make the change of possession apparent and visible. If there are such palpable tokens and proofs of the vendor’s surrender of his dominion over the property as owner, and of the transfer of his possession to the vendee, the sale will not be declared fraudulent in law, although the vendor may act as the agent or servant of the vendee in the management and disposal of the property, provided that his acts are professedly and apparently done, not as owner, but as the agent or servant of the vendee, and are so understood by those with whom he deals. If the change of possession is otherwise sufficiently shown, the mere fact of such agency is not, and never has been held to be, such a badge of fraud, or evidence of retained possession, as to render the sale invalid.</p>

There was not a particle of evidence tending to show that either Billingsley or Patterson, after tbe sale to tbe plaintiff, ever bought or sold any goods, or did any other act professedly or apparently in tbe name of tbe firm, or that either of them bad any connection with tbe plaintiff’s business, except as bis agent or employee.</p>

Do these circumstances, then, in connection with tbe other facts of tbe case, constitute such a badge of fraud, or evidence of retained possession, as to render tbe sale fraudulent in law ? They would undoubtedly be sufiicient to avoid tbe sale if they bad tbe effect of rendering the possession of tbe plaintiff doubtful or ambiguous. But if they did not, why should tbe sale be declared fraudulent ? If no one was misled, or deceived by tbe conduct of tbe parties, if their relations to each other and to tbe goods in question were well understood by those who dealt with them after tbe sale, and if their acts and declarations, accompanying and following tbe delivery, furnished such evidences of an apparent and actual change of possession as to satisfy tbe community, why should not these evidences be sufficient to satisfy tbe requirements of tbe law ?</p>

The purchaser’s name did not appear in the books except in one or two instances, where he was charged with some goods. He was not engaged in the store, nor did he have any direction of its business.
