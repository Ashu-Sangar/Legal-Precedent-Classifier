Snowden received an assignment for value, of the certificate of stock No. 266, of the appellant’s company, from Isaac M. Pennock, on the 9th day of May 1866. The cancellation of the stamp, as well as other testimony, abundantly proved that to have been the true date of the transaction. The court would have erred had it not permitted this to be proved. Nor was Pennock an incompetent witness to prove it. He had no disqualifying interest in the matter. Between creditors his interest was equally balanced, and that was his position.</p>

That this was the effect of the assignment and delivery of the stock to Snowden, is clearly shown in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Watmough, <a href="/whart/6/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Whart. 117" data-case-ids="1836939" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0117-01">6 Whart. 117</a>, and in Building Association <em>v. </em>Sendmeyer, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%2067" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="14 Wright 67">14 Wright 67</a>.
