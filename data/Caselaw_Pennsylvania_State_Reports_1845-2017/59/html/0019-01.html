The transaction which is the subject of the present controversy occurred in April 1865, and the question is, Was he then a member of the House of Representatives ? The first requisition is that he should be elected, for the words are after his election. How his name was never proclaimed by the governor according to the Act of Assembly, nor was he admitted until February 1866, and on July 1866 he was ousted, and it being proved that his competitor, Mr. Koontz, was elected a member of the House in October 1864, it seems clear that in April 1865 the plaintiff was not a member within the meaning or words of the Act of Congress.</p>
