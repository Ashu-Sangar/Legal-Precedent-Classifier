A subpoena in divorce was accordingly issued, returnable on the 1st Monday of September, and was served on the respondent August 2d. On the 31st of August the respondent obtained a rule on the libellant to show cause why an order should not be made that he should pay her a reasonable sum for her support <em>pendente lite. </em>On .the 24th of September a commissioner was appointed to take testimony. On the 8th of October the rule of August 31st was made absolute, and the libellant directed to pay respondent $30 per month for her support, and $75 for counsel fees. Same day the answer of the respondent was filed, denying that she had deserted the libellant; averring that he had sold all his furniture and leased his house for the purpose of forcing her to leave him, and left her without any means of support, &amp;c. She did not state in her answer that she demanded an issue.</p>

The respondent appealed to the Supreme Court, and assigned for error that the court refused her a trial by jury because it was not claimed. under the 80th rule of court when the answer was filed.</p>

In other words, they are not to be instrumentalities to defeat those rights; but their provisions are always adhered to, when in any neglect of them, rights have accrued which it would be inequitable or unjust to disturb. When, however, a failure to <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>comply with their requirements in any given case, is the result of mistake, haste or surprise, and positive injury is likely to ensue to a party, courts will not adhere to them simply on account of the rules, at the expense of justice and the just rights of parties. Hence amendments to fulfil requirements, are generally allowed when offered without unreasonable delay, and before much expense and costs have accrued.</p>
    <p id="b432-6" data-blocks='[["BL_432.4",432,[284,684,1148,644]]]'>In the case before us, the appellee the libellant, issued a subpoena in divorce to the respondent, returnable on the 1st Monday, the 2d day of September 1867, to which she appeared by counsel, and filed her answer on the 8th of October following. In her answer the respondent omitted to claim an issue to try the facts denied therein, as she ought to have done, if she desired it, under the 80th rule of the Court of Common Pleas; but in the short period of eleven days thereafter she did apply to the court for leave to amend her answer in this respect, and set forth in her affidavit, haste and surprise, in preparing her answer, owing to the rapid movements of the libellant in preparing to take testimony before her answer was in. She might well have expected to be called on to answer under rule 79; for in this way only could the libellant know, whether he was to prepare to take testimony for the court, or to produce his witnesses before a jury.</p>
    <p id="b432-7" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[284,1327,1144,76]]]'>The answer would, according to the rule of court, disclose whether an issue would be claimed or not.</p>

In substance, that it was imperfect, and she prayed leave to amend, so as to claim an issue and trial by jury, which she also affirmed her belief to be necessary to the trial of her case properly. The amendment, had it been granted; would not have delayed the final result, and as but little testimony was taken on the part of the libellant before the amendment was proposed, we think it should have been allowed.</p>
    <p id="b432-9" data-blocks='[["BL_432.7",432,[284,1886,1148,383]]]'>. What occurred after the rejection of the offer, cannot be allowed to operate in the libellant’s favor on this point of practice, for it was on his objection the amendment was refused; nor against her, for she proceeded with promptitude to propose the amendment. We are of opinion the amendment should have been allowed and an issue granted, and because this was not done, we feel bound to revérse the decree and send the case back, to be proceeded on in accordance with the views herein expressed. The disputed facts will then be settled by trial by jury.</p>
