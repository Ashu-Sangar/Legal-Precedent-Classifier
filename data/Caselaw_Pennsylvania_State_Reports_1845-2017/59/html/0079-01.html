If he was not duly served, both endorsers are discharged. If the holder of the paper can prove that he notified the endorser of its non-payment in due time, it is sufficient, whether that notice be sent through a notary public or a private messenger. Where the holder and endorser reside in different towns, cities or places, notice sent through the post-office and properly directed is sufficient, whether the party received it or not. The holder has done all that the law requires him. Where they reside in the same town or city, the notice must be served <em>personally; </em>and this is the settled íaw of Pennsylvania, of almost every state of the Union, and of Great Britain, except, perhaps, in the city of London. But <em>actual notice </em>received by the endorser in due time is good, no matter how sent. It is incumbent on the plaintiff in the present case to show that the defendant did receive the notice of protest in proper season. Where a note is protested on the last day of grace, the holder must give notice on that day, or at furthest on the next business-<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>day thereafter. It need not necessarily he given on the last day of grace, as was supposed in the present case; but the next day is in time, and each endorser has one day to notify his predecessor on the paper.”</p>

To this we respond that where there is no other evidence of notice than the bare mailing of a letter to an endorser residing in the same town, even with proof that he is in the daily habit of calling for his letters, it [is not sufficient, and cannot be left to the jury as evidence of notice. But all of the best writers on the subject declare that notice need not be served by a notary public; one may be sent by any private messenger;” “that the post-office messenger, or what is generally known as the penny-post, may be used as well as any other. In those states or countries where such a method of service is recognised, the courts require proof of the mailing of the notice in due time, that a post-office messenger regularly delivered to the party to be' notified his letters, and his belief that the one in controversy was delivered, although the messenger is not expected to speak with positive certainty as to that, but merely as to his general practice and best belief. We have no decisions in our own state recognising the <em>1 </em>penny-post’ as a messenger, but it has received the sanction of those in many other states, and of the English courts. It is important that in a mercantile question of this character there should be uniformity of decision. The evidence is not positive as to the delivery of this notice, and we have already said that the jury must be satisfied of its receipt by the defendant in due time, to wit, by the 11th of May 1865.”</p>

The conversation proved does not contain a <em>promise to pay, </em>yet a request for time; and the failure to make any objection then on account of the want of notice is a circumstance to be considered in connection with the other evidence in the case. Are you satisfied, from all of it, that the defendant received the notice of protest in due time, to wit, on the 11th of May 1865 ? It rests upon the plaintiff to prove this clearly.

In the 6th edition of Story on Promissory Notes (1868), § 323, it is said: “ There is an apparent exception to the general rule, which however is not in reality such, but falls within the general rule. It is that where there is, as in large towns and cities, a letter carrier, or, as he is often called, a penny post, who carries letters daily from the post-office, and delivers them at the houses or places of business of the parties who are accustomed to receive their letters by him; there if the notice be left at the post-office, early enough in the day to go by sixch letter carrier or penny-post, on the same day to the party <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>entitled to notice, it will be deemed sufficient; for in such cases the letter carrier or penny-post is treated as an agent for the purpose, because it is a usual mode of conveyance.” And now that free delivery of letters is established and regulated by law, so as to secure a certain delivery according to its address,- it seems proper that this rule should be adopted in this state, as called for by the improvements introduced into the post-offices by the general government. But the present case does not call for the strict application of this rule.</p>
