J., the plaintiff gave evidence by Joseph Thomas, that he (Thomas) had bought the land about 30 years before, from Henry Dull, who was not living on it; it was vacant land. Thomas, five years afterwards, put up a house to the joists; he then sold it to Henry Boyer. The sale was made by written articles, dated December 15th 1845. Boyer was to pay $100 in annual payments of $25 each. Boyer finished the house, paid Thomas $10, refused to pay any more and left the premises about 18 months after he had gone in; they remained unoccupied for three years, when George Anderson went in. Thomas sold the land to Henry Horn whilst Anderson was in possession ; and conveyed it March 21st 1859, about four or five years after he had sold. Plaintiff gave evidence that Anderson improved the premises and lived there till a few months before his death, in May 1866. Anderson, whilst on the land, claimed to hold it by improvement. Snively, the defendant, took possession after Anderson left.</p>

Boyer’s contract not being complied with to Thomas, the latter brought his action of ejectment against Anderson in 1852, and recovered an award under the Compulsory Arbitration Law on the 20th May 1854, which was not appealed from. While that ejectment was pending, viz., January 10th 1853, and while he was yet under Thomas’s title, Anderson undertook to convey his title to Anthony Smith, under whom the plaintiff below claimed title. The title set up by the plaintiff was founded upon an alleged abandonment of the settlement of Boyer under Thomas’s improvement, and a new settlement begun by Anderson on his own account, and the case was submitted to the jury on this question of fact. It was in proof by Thomas, who was called by the plaintiff, that he sold the property to Henry Horn while Anderson was in possession, and four or five years before the deed of 24th March 1859; and in a <em>nota bene </em>to <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>the deed itself it is stated that the agreement for the sale was made in 1854. This is corroborated also by the testimony of Henry Darr. Now, under these circumstances it was important for the defendant, who claimed under the title of Thomas and Boyer, to show that Anderson, who was in under Boyer, and did not leave the property after the recovery in the ejectment, continued in possession under Horn, who had become the owner of Thomas’s title in 1854, the same year of the recovery. The defendant offered in evidence a lease from Horn to Anderson, dated the 29th December 1854, which was rejected by the court, on the ground that Anderson had already parted with his title to Smith. But clearly this was error. Smith bought of Anderson with notice by way of <em>Us pendens. </em>Anderson was still in possession under Thomas’s title, and never yielded it up. Horn, Avho held the title then, had a right to show that he never abandoned the land, hut, on the contrary, that it had continued in the possession of his tenant from 1854. The effect of the exclusion of the lease was to leave Anderson in effect the tenant of his grantee Smith, and to place Horn in the attitude of having abandoned the land from 1854. It is quite probable the learned judge overlooked the time of the inception of Horn’s title, and referred it to the date of his deed in 1859. But the judgment must he reversed for the refusal to receive the lease in evidence.</p>
