As compensation for services rendered by the daughter after she attained her majority. * * * [2d. It is said to be a gift by the parent to the child, and doubtless the closeness of the relationship ordinarily furnishes sufficient consideration for such gifts, but certainly this one has assumed an unusual form — that of a judgment-bond with power to enter it up, and issue an execution, and covering perhaps one-third of the donor’s property, as a gift this would be subject to grave suspicion, when we consider that it was drawn secretly, no one present, the father old and feeble, the daughter active and intelligent, the instrument drawn by herself, and the donation wholly in her own favor.] Still if you believe that the father was of sound business capacity and not in anywise overreached, it would be good as a gift; but if his intellect was weak to almost second childishness, such an act requires explanation. 3d. The main reliance is that the bond was given with perfect understanding by the father to correct an injustice and inequality in his will. If the decedent at the time of giving this bond had a sound dispos<a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>ing mind and understanding, was convinced of having done injustice to this daughter <em>by </em>his will, and resorted to the bond as a means of correcting that injustice, it may be sustained, although the instrument was drawn by Mrs. Eouch in her own favor, and not attested with the usual formalities attendant on the execution of wills. [There is however in this action itself some evidence not only of vacillation, buffof great mental weakness — first that he would be persuaded by one daughter so to frame his will as to cut out another, and then on the mere suggestion of his wife should probably more than reinstate her. The will solemnly declares that Eliza had secured her share in the price of the land, and although this may not have been the case, we must believe that the deceased so considered when he dictated the instrument.] Did he change his opinion, and did he understand that he had subsequently made a great alteration in the arrangement of his business ? * * *</p>

Was this bond obtained from a parent of feeble intellect by any management or overreaching on the part of a daughter of business capacity, in whom he reposed confidence, and was that confidence abused ? If such was the case and the bond given without consideration, or one greatly inadequate, it is not obligatory, should not be enforced, and your verdict should be in favor of the defendants.</p>

It was not stated for what purpose the will was offered by the defendants. It showed that they were the executors, which, however, they had already admitted of record by their plea: Hantz <em>v. </em>Sealy, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Binn.%20410" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Binn. 410">6 Binn. 410</a>. To say the least, the will at the time it was offered was wholly irrelevant to the issue. If the object was to put in evidence declarations contained in it bearing on the question of the single bill in suit, such evidence was clearly incompetent. If the purpose was to rebut the presumption of a gift by showing that the plaintiff had been fully provided for, the will contained no such provision. It averred a fact as a reason for not making provision for her. Whether this were or were not so may have been material, but it could not be proved by the mere declarations of the obligor. If the evidence was improper when offered, the error is not cured by the plaintiff’s having given testimony to rebut it or avoid its effect. A party ought not to be prejudiced by an attempt to parry what has been illegally admitted against him. We are of opinion that there was error in the admission of the will of Jacob Zehring.</p>

It was proposed to ask him, if from what he saw and <em>heard detailed </em>the deceased was in his opinion competent to transact business. Heard detailed — by whom ? If the witness had been an expert he could not state an opinion founded upon what he had heard out of court. In the case of a witness not an expert, he must give facts and circumstances within his own knowledge as the grounds of his opinion: Rambler <em>v. </em>Tryon, 7 S. &amp; R. 90; Bricker <em>v. </em>Lightner’s Executors, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20205" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Wright 205">4 Wright 205</a>; Aiman <em>v. </em>Stout, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20114" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Wright 114">6 Wright 114</a>; Dunham’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Conn.%20198" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="27 Conn. 198">27 Conn. 198</a>. As to experts, their opinions must either be predicated of the facts proved or admitted: Champ <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 2 Metc. (Ky.) 17; or of such as appear in evidence, hypothetically stated: Spear <em>v. </em>Richardson, 37 New Hamp. 23; State <em>v. </em>Windsor, 5 Harring. 512.

He was offered to testify to declarations by Jacob Zehring the spring before he died, shortly after the execution of the note in suit, that he had not signed it. This was not a fact in dispute. The testimony was admitted not to disprove the execution of the instrument, but to show want of memory and understanding about what had been done. In this point of view we cannot say that it was inadmissible.
