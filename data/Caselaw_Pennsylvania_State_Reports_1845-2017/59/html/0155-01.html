This point is nearly correct, except as to so much of it as refers to the survey of the land claimed under the settlement. We are of the opinion that the certified copy of the survey made by Herrington, the deputy surveyor, under date of December 24th 1827, was a sufficient survey to give Davis a right to a patent from the Commonwealth, especially as the survey was accepted at the surveyor-general’s office. The settler had done all he could do in procuring the survey. He could not enter it in the surveyor’s book, even if it was necessary. Herrington sent a copy of the survey to the land office; whether it was entered in his book or not does not appear; for the plaintiffs, for some unexplained reason, do not offer that proof nor account for its absence. They rely on the survey returned to the land office, and although we think the office record ought to have been produced, if it could be, we are of the opinion that the survey made, procured, returned and accepted, was a sufficient compliance on the part of Davis to give him a right to a patent from the Commonwealth on payment of the purchase-money.</p>

Hence the principle of Skeen <em>v. </em>Pearce must be considered as applicable to such forfeiture in its full vigor. That principle is expressed in this language in the opinion of the court delivered by Duncan, J., “ When the law prescribes the mode and manner in which rights to land accruing to the state by reason of any default in the grantee shall issue, that mode and no other must be pursued. Here it is to be by a special warrant of a specific form; in no other, by the express words of the act, can a new grant be obtained; for the mode is not merely formal and directory, but substantial, imperative and restrictive.”</p>
