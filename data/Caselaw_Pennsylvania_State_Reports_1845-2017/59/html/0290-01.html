The charter of the Western Pennsylvania Railroad, granted in 1860, also vests it with all the powers, privileges and authorities of the North Western Railroad Company, set forth in the act incorporating it, repeals the charter of the North Western Railroad Company totally, and confers on the Western Pennsylvania Railroad Company the right to sell its railroad and all the estate, real and personal, rights, credits and franchises which were of the North Western Railroad Company, providing, however, in a subsequent section, “that all unpaid damages which have accrued to landholders by reason of the original construction of said road shall remain for ever, until paid, a lien upon said road, and in case these cannot be amicably settled, the same shall be determined according to the provisions of the several railroad acts.”</p>

It is very clear, therefore, that if an entry to use and occupy the ground was ever made, there is nothing in the stated case to enable us to infer an entry, at least before the proceeding to assess the damages. In this view the North Western Railroad had no interest or claim in the land in question upon which the previous mortgage could operate, and the sale under it neither conveyed the subsequently acquired title, nor extinguished the lien, if any, obtained for the damage. This might be a sufficient answer to the argument of the plaintiff in error, but as the case has been put upon the ground of an extinguishment of the lien of the judgment for the damages, by the sale under the mortgage, it will be necessary to examine the nature of the interest acquired by the North Western Railroad in the land appropriated under its charter, and how far it is the subject of the lien of a judgment.</p>

It is an easement merely upon the land, a right of way or passage, with such an occupancy as is necessary to give this right its effect; that is, in constructing, repairing and using the works adapted to the purpose of passage : Lance’s Appeal, 5 P. F.

This being the nature of the interest acquired by a railroad company in land appropriated for the use of its railroad, a mere easement or right of passage for a public purpose, it is a settled principle in our law that this interest is not the subject of a lien or a sale under execution.

Johnston for his damages, was not a lien in the ordinary sense, and his claim was not liable to be divested by the sale on the mortgage. It is a familiar principle that a judicial sale extinguishes liens, not estates or interests of third persons: Catlin <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20378" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Watts 378">2 Watts 378</a>. In order, therefore, to divest by a sale under the mortgage the title or claim to damages of Johnston, who continued to be the owner of the soil, his right must have been derived from the North Western Railroad Co., the mortgagors, subject to the lien of their mortgage. But clearly his title to damages was paramount to the mortgage, for the mortgagors had no title or interest of any kind, not even the easement it is shown to be, until Johnston, as landowner, had been paid or secured for his damages. This interest could not be extinguished by any adversary proceeding, for it rests not only on the constitution, but the law itself, which provided, as we have seen, that no entry or possession should be had until compensation made or security <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>given. Hence, it could be extinguished only by payment, release or limitation. The Limitation Act, it is said, applies 'to claims for damages: Foster <em>v. </em>Cumberland Valley Railroad Co., 11 Harris 371. This was held by three judges of this court to two. But whatever may be the force of that decision, it has no application here, for the plaintiff in due season prosecuted his claim to a judgment which now stands as a record, and not within the statute. Nor can it be said that the plaintiff has waived his right. It does not appear that the possession was taken by the North Western Railroad Co. of the plaintiff’s land, but conceding this, and that the plaintiff permitted the company to construct its road, and even to use it without payment or security, it is not easy to perceive that a waiver of the trespass can be a waiver of damages in the face of a prosecution of the claim to judgment. Before payment or security it is clear that the entry is tortious and not rightful. Though equity might estop an owner standing by and permitting the company to expend money by laying a track upon the land essential to the use of its line of railroad, from regaining the possession, it would not estop him from recovering the damages to which he is entitled for the use of his land, and so it has been held: Borough of Harrisburg <em>v. </em>Crangle, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20464" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 464">3 W. &amp; S. 464</a>.</p>
    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[216,1319,1151,375]]]'>The action of trespass is the very form in which a landowner would proceed at common law for the recovery of his damages upon an unlawful entry, had no provision by statute been made: Union Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Woodside, <a href="/nc/46/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Jones 177" data-case-ids="8681940" data-case-paths="/nc/46/0177-01">1 Jones 177</a>-8; Foster <em>v. </em>Cumberland Valley Railroad, 11 Harris 372.

Perhaps it would be sufficient for this case to say that the Western Pennsylvania Bailroad Company accepted a charter repealing the charter of the North Western Bailroad Company, and providing that the damages of the landowners remaining unpaid should remain a lien on the road till paid, and, therefore, that the legislature clearly intended that they should be paid by the new company which, under the <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>deed from Hirst and under its charter, is possessor of all the rights and interests of the old company. But the case rests upon other grounds. The plaintiff, who has never parted with his rights, stands on the higher fundamental right of property; that it shall be taken and used by no one for the public purpose of a' railroad without just compensation being made to him: Monongahela Nav. Co. <em>v. </em>Coons, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20114" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 114">6 W. &amp; S. 114</a>; Yost’s Report, 5 Harris 524; Borough of Harrisburg <em>v. </em>Crangle, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 460" data-case-ids="1854630" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0460-01">3 W. &amp; S. 460</a>. This is a sacred constitutional right not to he spirited away by refinement. If, therefore, the original occupant has so managed its card as to escape payment until it has divested itself of its interest by any form of alienation, its alienee, mediate or immediate, if it would enjoy the uncompensated right, must-pay the price of it, unless it can show an equity growing out of the conduct of the owner of the soil which would estop him. It must not be forgotten we are treating of a case where the owner has done nothing to divest his right by his own act or alienation, hut where the alienee of the original actor stands upon a seizure at law, which must be shown to have conformed to the law in all its steps, in order to deprive the owner of his title. The mortgage was hut a mode of alienation of the estate of the mortgagor, but could not operate upon the paramount claim of the landowner over the mortgaged interest. This we have seen is not a mere lien, the judgment in the process of assessment not being the source of his right, hut the means only of ascertaining the amount of his claim and of enforcing its payment. It could be extinguished only by payment or release. When the alienees of the North Western Railroad Company came into possession, therefore, under their purchase (if at all), they took the interest acquired <em>cum onere. </em>If possession never had been obtained, then clearly they could get it only by payment or security. In law and equity neither they nor any one claiming the interest of the North Western Railroad by an act of eminent domain, subordinated by the law and the constitution to payment as the condition of its exercise, can hold and use the interests thus acquired without compensation : Borough of Harrisburg <em>v. </em>Crangle, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 460" data-case-ids="1854630" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0460-01">3 W. &amp; S. 460</a>.</p>
