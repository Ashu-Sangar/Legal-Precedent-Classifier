An ordinance was passed the- same day for assessing a bounty tax. Eight or nine bonds, dated December 28th 1864, promising <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>to pay $300 with interest on or before the 28th of December 1866, were issued to men who had been drafted and procured substitutes,-no volunteers having been put in to the credit of the township. In 1865 a bounty tax was assessed by the directors, and on the 1st of June 1865 Michael Dunnegan was appointed collector. He levied on and advertised the property of the plaintiffs for the payment of the bounty tax assessed on them; this was the trespass complained of.</p>

      <em>“ </em>"Whether or not the assessment of the tax was regular and legal or authorized by the Acts of Assembly passed for that purpose, may, we think, admit of controversy. But assuming that it was illegal, and assuming, also, in favor of the plaintiffs, that the writing, or entering by the collector on his book, of a list of the property mentioned or given him as a levy, and advertising it for sale, would without more, so far as it concerns that question, be an act of <em>trespass, </em>we cannot think it rendered the school directors liable in this form of action. The plaintiffs, we think, if likely to suffer wrong, had a remedy. Equity, we think, would have restrained the collection of taxes illegally assessed, if there was no legal remedy. The most that could be claimed as a legal remedy, we think, is that the collector himself would be answerable in trespass.</p>

When the board of school directors laid the tax, made out the duplicate, and issued the warrant to collect it, and when they authorized the issue of bonds to borrow money to pay bounties and relieve the township from the draft, they were clearly acting within their authority. A draft had been ordered, and the laws authorized them to borrow money and lay taxes to procure volunteers; and even to pay drafted men who had procured substitutes as volunteers in their stead.</p>

In issuing the warrant the board was not guilty of an excess of authority, but exercised a high public function upon a just legal cause. If any of the persons to whom the directors were about to pay out money were believed not to be within the purview of the law, the proper course of the tax-payers who doubted the legality of the disbursement of the money was to restrain payment by proper legal proceedings, or to contest the payment before the auditors having jurisdiction of the accounts of the directors.</p>
