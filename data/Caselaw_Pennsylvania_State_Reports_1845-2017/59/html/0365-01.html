The defendants offered the transfer book of the company, without proof that the book was what it purported to be. On objection it was rejected for the reason that the court could not determine its character by inspection. The defendants next offered the deposition of P. F.

The court has already ruled in answer to the defendants’ offer of evidence, that the measure of damages for .the plaintiffs’ failure to complete and deliver the locomotive in good working order, at the time mentioned in the contract, is not the difference in the cost of transporting the coal actually mined by them, or which might have been mined, during the period of the delay, by means of horses and mules, and the cost of transporting the same by means of the locomotive, if it had been delivered in good working order, according to the contract, but that the measure of damage is the actual or probable cost of the hire of such a locomotive, for the period of such delay. We think this is the true rule or measure of damages. And accordingly [we allowed the defendant to call, as witnesses, men engaged in railroad transportation — familiar with the cost of engines and the price of their hire — to testify as to the per diem value of the use or hire of such an engine as the one in controversy. One of the witnesses estimates the sum of $20 per day to be a fair price for the hire of such an engine. The other says that $10 per day would be a fair price for the use or hire of such an engine. It will be seen that these witnesses differ very widely in their estimates. Their opinions, if not mere conjectures, must be founded on a different basis. While their opinions are evidence, they are not the only evidence in the case. <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>The jury have the evidence as to the price or cost of the locomotive, viz., $5500.</p>

If the jury, then, should find that $20 per day was too high an estimate, is $10 a reasonable sum ? At this rate the engine would more than pay for itself, including interest on the price, in two years, and in twenty years would pay more than ten times the price or value thereof. It seems to me that the estimates of both the witnesses are too high; but this is a question for the jury, and they will allow such an amount as they may think right and proper, under all the evidence. .</p>

The defendants below offered in substance to prove the difference in the expense of transporting the coal carried on their railroad, between horse or mule power and steam-power, and for this purpose, to prove how much ■ coal was actually carried over their railroad between the 1st day of February — the time for the delivery of the engine under the contract — and the day when the engine was actually put in running order on the road; claiming that this difference of expense was a loss directly occasioned by the failure to finish and deliver the engine in time.</p>
    <p id="b369-8" data-blocks='[["BL_369.9",369,[208,1008,1158,509]]]'>The learned judge overruled this offer, being of opinion that the measure of damage's for the delay was the ordinary hire of a locomotive during the period of the delay. We think that under the circumstances of the case, this was an error. It was in proof, and was also a part of the offer, that the only means the defendants had of transporting their coal was by horses and mules, and it also appeared in the evidence that, owing to the gauge of the railroad track and the kind of engine required for their use, it was impossible to have procured for hire an engine to suit their pui’pose, and that the hire of such an engine was purely a speculative and not a practical question, owing to the fact that the witnesses knew of none such to be had.</p>
    <p id="b369-9" data-blocks='[["BL_369.10",369,[209,1525,1156,816]]]'>The true inquiry which arose under these circumstances, was whether the damages thus claimed were the necessary consequence of the failure to perform the contract in time, and whether they were presumptively within the view of the plaintiffs at the time of making their contract to finish and deliver the engine in running order on the defendants’ track by the 1st of February. The-damages ordinarily recoverable are those necessarily following the breach, which the party guilty of the breach must be presumed to know would be the probable consequence of his failure: 2 Grreenl. Ev. § 253. This rule is well expressed by Strong, J., in Adams Express Co. <em>v. </em>Egbert, 12 Casey 364. They must be a proximate consequence of the breach, not merely remote or possible. There is no measure for losses of the latter kind. “But, on the other hand,” he remarks, “the loss of profits or advantages, which must have resulted from a fulfilment of the contract, may be compensated in damages, when they are the direct and immediate fruits of the contract, and must therefore have been stipulated for, and have been in the contemplation of the parties when it was made.”</p>

    <p id="b370-6" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[304,543,1157,732]]]'>That the loss in this case was immediate and the necessary consequence of non-fulfilment, is obvious. The coal company was by the contract to have a finished locomotive adapted to their railroad put in thorough running order upon their track by the 1st day of February. The direct consequence of not getting it was, that they were obliged to continue transporting their coal as before, by horses and mules, until the engine was put there. It is quite as clear, also, that this consequence must have been in full view of Foster &amp; Co. when they entered into the contract. The instrument evidencing the agreement was a proposition of Foster &amp; Co., accepted by the president of the coal company. It was directed to James M. Bailey, president of the Pittsburg Coal Company, and proposed to build a locomotive engine to fit a forty-inch track. It was to be built in a workmanlike manner, of the best material, and finished by the 1st day of February then next, and “ put in thorough running order on your track on or before that day.”</p>
    <p id="b370-7" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[298,1271,1155,636]]]'>The price, $5500, was to be paid, to wit: $1500 on the 16th day of January, “and the balance when the engine is completed and running on your road.” Thus the proposition to build the engine shows very clearly that Foster &amp; Co. knew that it was to be used in running on a coal railroad and upon a track of unusual gauge, and the proof shows that at the time of the making of the contract, engines of the size and character of the one described in the proposition were not in ordinary use and could not be hired. From the nature of the circumstances, Foster &amp; Co., as engine-builders, must have known that if they failed to deliver the engine on the track by the day agreed upon, the coal company would be forced to continue transporting their coal by their former means, and consequently would suffer a loss in the difference of expense of transportation between the old mode and the one stipulated for in the contract. •</p>

This is a <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>possible or remote consequence, but not a necessary one. For augbt Foster &amp; Co. could know, the defendants were mining to the extent of their ability to operate in the mines; and even could they mine more, it does not follow they must know that the engine would haul more in the same time than the company could do with their horses and mules.
