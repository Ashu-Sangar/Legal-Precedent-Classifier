In this case Henry Baker devised his farm to Joseph E. Baker <em>upon </em>payment of $6000 in gold. <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>This expression is not unmeaning, for though not contemplating a postponement of the enjoyment of the farm after Joseph had accepted the devise, it suspended the investiture of a complete title, for the testator then directed that a deed should be made by his executors, and proceeded to add that $3000 should be “ secured in said farm, and the interest thereof paid to his wife annually during life,” and directed that this $3000, calling it the “balance of purchase-money, remaining in the farm,” should be» divided among his children, including Joseph, at her death. Further on he directs that Joseph should be <em>allowed </em>a reasonable time for payment of the shares of the heirs, with interest from his death, <em>“ </em>should he accept or purchase my farm upon the terms set forth in this my will.”</p>
    <p id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[236,972,1157,302]]]'>Again, he provides, should he <em>“ </em>refuse to purchase or accept my farm,” then that it should be sold by his executors. Thus the intention to treat the money to be paid by Joseph as in the nature of purchase-money, and control the title until it be paid in part and the remainder secured, is too apparent to be doubted. The authorities are clear upon this subject, that an intention to charge must be inferred in such a case.</p>
    <p id="b317-7" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[232,1274,1161,477]]]'>This charge confers jurisdiction upon the Orphans’ Court under the 69th section of the Act of 24th of February 1834, to enforce payment of the legacies, after an acceptance of the terms of the will. We notice that the executors have not been made parties, as required by this section of the Act of 1834. Especially should this have been done in this case, where the executors are made by the will the conduit of the title and of the security for the unpaid purchase-money. It is their right to be called in to defend, though they may not petition for the payment of the legacies: Fields’ Appeal, 12 Casey 11. But as no exception was taken or error assigned on this ground, we pass it by.</p>

The proceeding is not at common law, but in the nature of a bill of equity, and the joinder inflicts no injury upon the devisee or the executors, but saves litigation and a multiplicity of suits and the increase of costs. There is nothing in the language of the act or its purpose forbidding it, but the contrary, the court being directed to proceed according to equity and make such decree or order as may be requisite and just. It was very proper in this case, where the $6000 is viewed by the testator as the entire purchase-money (though to be divided in final distribution), a single sum, therefore, and in the language of the act, “ a legacy charged upon real estate.” It is highly proper, therefore, that the Orphans’ Court should have all the parties before it in making a decree against the devisee. One alone might have petitioned, but we perceive no error in others joining with him.</p>

The time of payment is future and uncertain, and gold may then bear no premium, or it may bear one much higher. The decree must be modified to meet this contingency.
