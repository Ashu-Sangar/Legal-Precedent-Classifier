He did so, and I signed it; but discovered soon after that it was entirely incorrect. I wished to get it back but could not, and then appealed. I examined and found we had made no profits. We have since made two years’ reports, and they were accepted. The amount paid in this case was $1,000,000. We declare dividends of oil, which are only a return of the investment to those who advanced. We have returned to shareholders some $600,000 or more, but our books will not balance till $1,000,000 is paid in. No net earnings are made. We pay a tax on our capital stock — $15,000 last year, $10,000 this year. The first well flowed some three hundred barrels per day, next one pumped seventy-five barrels per day. Plowing wells do not last over four or five months; pumping wells six months, generally.</p>

    <p id="b63-12" data-blocks='[["BL_63.17",63,[271,1666,1148,254]]]'>This company calling and returning its capital at one million, is taxed upon its capital stock at that sum, but by the Act of-the 30th April 1864, Pamph. L. 218, the “ net earnings or income” of said corporation are subjected to a state tax of “ three per centum upon such annual net earnings or income, in addition to the taxes now imposed by existing laws.”</p>
    <p id="b63-13" data-blocks='[["BL_63.18",63,[269,1921,1148,215]]]'>The question therefore is, what is the meaning of “ net earnings or income?” Does it mean, as it was construed by the treasurer in his report to the auditor-general, the product of the business after deducting expenses only ? if so, then the settlement by the auditor-general and state treasurer is correct.</p>
    <p id="b63-14" data-blocks='[["BL_63.19",63,[269,2135,1149,258]],["BL_64.1",64,[276,382,1147,173]]]'>But it is contended by the company, that the annual product must first be applied to the repayment of capital, and this would leave no net earnings or income to tax. The court below compromised between these two constructions, and held that there must be an application of so much of the annual product, as would repay the capital, in the probable number of years that oil would <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>flow or be taken from the land, and then the surplus would be the net earnings or income subject to taxation. This mode requires the interposition of a jury wherever there is a difference of opinion between the company and the state authorities,</p>
    <p id="ASI" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[262,556,1159,244]]]'>f I can see no warrant for such a reading of the law. The injcome from the works of the company after deducting all expenses, appears in this case by the testimony of the treasurer, to have ,'been paid to the shareholders as dividends, and were no doubt ■' advertised as such, thus enhancing largely the value of the stock in the market.</p>
    <p id="AYB" data-blocks='[["BL_64.5",64,[275,810,1146,429]]]'>When a capital stock is created, and paid into a corporation, authorized to transact any business whether of banking, manufacturing or mining, and is divided into shares of a fixed amount, that capital is presumed to remain until its dissolution. The value of the stock and the shares into which it is divided, may rise or fall according to the success of the enterprise. In banks, for instance, the profits may be largely remunerative, or if unfortunate, the capital may be utterly lost. This is the theory of incorporated companies, the capital invested remains either really or nominally to their close.</p>
    <p id="b64-7" data-blocks='[["BL_64.6",64,[272,1239,1147,299]]]'>The present company pays dividends which are of course its net earnings or income, and it is the net income, whether declared or not, the state intended to tax. This is the plain common sense meaning of the term, made familiar to every one since the formation of the internal revenue system. The theory of the company is, that the capital must be repaid to its shareholders, and then it has no capital left.</p>
    <p id="b64-8" data-blocks='[["BL_64.7",64,[270,1536,1145,218]]]'>But if this company has paid $600,000, it must be different from all other such companies, if its shareholders have not been overpaid already.
