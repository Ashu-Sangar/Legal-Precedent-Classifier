The writ was executed May 27th 1867, and the hank having answered the interrogatories filed hy the plaintiffs in the attachment execution, the court below, on the Bd January 1868, ordered that judgment be entered against the bank for the sum of $1865.30, with interest from the 27th May 1867, to wit, $1921.58, to be levied of the debt due by the bank to John Kerwin.

So far, therefore, as the judgment in this case includes interest on the principal sum, for which it is entered, it is clearly erroneous. But this is not the main question raised by the assignment of error.</p>

On the contrary, does it not allege an indebtedness of Kerwin to the bank of $644.70 in consequence of the non-payment of Richardson’s check ? But it is contended that because Richardson’s check is credited in the account as cash, the presumption is that it was taken and received by the bank as cash. But is not this presumption met and rebutted by the answer ? If Richardson’s check was taken and received as cash, the fact that it was protested for non-payment and still remains in the possession of the bank unpaid, would not leave Kerwin indebted to the bank in the sum of $644.70, as alleged in the answer; and in this respect the answer would not be true. There may have been an agreement between the bank and Kerwin that all checks deposited by him and credited in his account as cash, if not paid on presentation, should be made good by him; or he may have endorsed Richardson’s check, and, in either event, its protest for non-payment on presentation, and its remaining in the possession of the bank unpaid at the date of the answer, would leave Kerwin indebted to the bank as stated by the cashier. As his answer was drawn up without the advice or assistance of counsel, he may have unwittingly omitted to state the facts upon which Kerwin’s liability for the check, and the bank’s right to set it off against the balance appearing in his favor, depend. If Richardson’s check was received absolutely as cash, without endorsement by Kerwin, and without any agreement on his part to make it good, if not paid on presentation, the cashier could hardly have supposed that its non-payment would render him liable therefor, and entitle the bank to charge him therewith. A garnishee’s answer is not to be construed with the same strictness as a defendant’s affidavit of defence. A defendant, under' our affidavit system, is bound to set forth every fact material and necessary to his defence; and every fact, not distinctly and positively averted, is presumed not to exist. <em>The </em>affidavit <em>must </em>show primá, facie that the defendant has a good defence to the action, otherwise judgment will be entered against him. But a garnishee is not bound to set forth “ specifically and at length the nature and character of his defence” to the attachment. He is only required to answer the interrogatories that may be submitted to him. And judgment will not be entered against him on his answer, unless he expressly or impliedly admits his indebtedness to, or his possession of, assets belonging to the judgment-debtor; and the admission ought to be of such a character as to leave no doubt in regard to its nature and extent.</p>
