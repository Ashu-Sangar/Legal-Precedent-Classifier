On the 9th of December a boat laden with oil belonging to Conkle, arrived at the refinery of the defendants ; on the 10th, they, claiming that the oil belonged to them, pumped from the boats, and took away a quantity of the oil amounting, according to the witnesses of the plaintiff, to 134 barrels and 33 gallons. The sheriff returned that on the 11th he had levied <em>“ </em>on one bulk boat containing 362 barrels and 17 gallons of oil;” that was the amount, according to the testimony, which the boat had contained before any had been taken from it by the defendants. The defendants claimed the oil as levied on, and after the preliminary steps an issue was awarded to try the right of property in the oil. Subsequently the following order was made by the court:—</p>

Lamberton &amp; Co., as required by the rule of this court; therefore it is ordered and adjudged by the court, that the sheriff shall proceed with the said execution, and that the said Lockhart, Frew &amp; Co. be barred and restrained from maintaining or prosecuting any suit or action against the said officer, with respect to or on account of the seizure and sale of the said property.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b378-8" data-blocks='[["BL_378.6",378,[263,953,1149,292]]]'>“ But the plaintiff contends that even if the oil was taken by the defendants, and pumped into their tank on Monday, before the date of the levy, that still the defendants are liable for the said oil, inasmuch as the execution in the sheriff’s hands was a lien thereon.

But it seems to me that the adjudication of the Common Pleas is only conclusive as to the title of the oil, but not of the actual quantity levied on. If the defendants did not take or remove any of the oil actually levied on by the sheriff’s deputy, then the sheriff cannot maintain this action; if the defendants did, in point of fact, pump a portion of the oil on Monday, before the levy thereof by the sheriff’s deputy, and did not pump or take any portion of the oil after the levy thereon, then there is nothing in the judgment or order of the Court of Common Pleas, upon the rule of interpleader taken by the sheriff, that will enable him to maintain this action.</p>

He was not an owner, but armed merely with a power, and therefore can maintain no action founded upon an injury done to the possession: Lewis <em>v. </em>Carsaw, 8 Harris 84.
