On the 2d of March 1861, as he with others was returning, riding in the haggage-car, when within about two miles of Kittanning a rail broke, the baggage-car was thrown off the track, the plaintiff thrown out, both legs broken, one had to be amputated, and he was otherwise badly injured. To recover compensation for these injuries he brought this suit.</p>

I was authorized by the company to employ hands under me. I employed the plaintiff to work as a carpenter on the Kiskiminetas bridge. He was living in Kittanning. While engaged at that bridge I and my hands boarded in Kittanning. I refer to such hands as lived there, or near there. We came to Kittanning at night and went down to the bridge in the morning. By my contract I authorized the plaintiff to go home at night and return in the morning, and by that contract he was to travel back and forth to and from his work on the cars. I was to pay him so much per day, and he was to travel on the train free of charge. The riding free of charge was part of the consideration of the contract. If &lt; he had been compelled to pay his fare I could not have hired him-’ to work at the same price I did. Myself and hands, as a general i thing, rode in the baggage-car. The conductor of the train knew the fact and saw us in the train twice every day. He made no objection to our riding there; he did not give us notice to leave it, but allowed it. It was customary for me and my hands to ride in the baggage-car to and from work. We could either ride there or in the passenger-car, if not crowded too much. * * * I did not consider the ties good; they were rotten. I would not consider the road safe. There was no ballast but earth. The chair-ties were not sound enough to keep the rails in their places. The ties were pretty much all hemlock. I understand about laying the wood work of a railroad. When the locomotive would pass over a solid tie it would settle down and bound with such force as would be apt to break the rail. The chair-ties giving, and the others solid, would have the effect of throwing the locomotive off the track. There might have been a tie put here and there on the road. As a general thing there were not any repairs at this place before the accident. In going up and down, myself and hands, including the plaintiff, assisted in taking in and putting out freight, at the request of the conductor on the cars. Myself and hands always helped to remove obstructions of any kind on the road that would, detain us from getting to the bridge or up to Kittanning. The assistance in taking in and putting out freight and removing obstructions was voluntary on the part of myself and hands; it was not compulsory. We were not under the orders of the conductor in doing it. Mr. O’Donnell was hired by me by the day. I paid the men at the bridge. He was hired <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>by me specially to work on the bridge as a carpenter. When I employed plaintiff there was no agreement what car he was to ride in; there was no contract that he should help to take in or put out freight. I had no authority to appoint baggage-masters, freight deliverers or receivers. Neither I or my hands were under the control of the conductor. Whatever we did in handling freight was voluntary on our part, but at conductor’s request. We were not refused admission to the passenger-cars.”</p>

There was much evidence also as to the rottenness of the cross-ties and the generally bad condition of the road; most of the ties having been in since the road was made about thirteen years previously.</p>

J., of the Fifth Judicial District) charged : * * * « q, Was ¿e accident which resulted in the injury of the plaintiff occasioned by the negligence of the company, its officers or servants ? Any neglect or omission of duty on the part of a railroad company or individual engaged in carrying passengers is negligence; It is the duty of such company to provide and keep in good repair a safe and sufficient track, which includes ties and rail of sufficient material, size and strength, properly laid down and screwed in their place, to provide suitable <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>engines and cars, and employ a sufficient number of tried, sober and competent men to act as conductors, engineers, bralternen, &amp;c., in running their trains.</p>

The law holds them to a strict responsibility for care, vigilance and skill on the part of themselves and their employees.

They are responsible for any injury caused by defects in the road, the engines or the ears, or by any species of negligence, however slight, which they or their servants may be guilty of.</p>

Whatever these can do for the safety of the passengers the law requires the transporting company to do. Gruided by these principles, then, you will determine whether the company was guilty of negligence which caused the accident and consequent injury to the plaintiff. It is manifest that there must have been some cause for the rail breaking. * *</p>

We think not, if you find the fact to be as testified to by Mr. Liston. The recognised rule of law on this subject is, that where several persons are employed in the same general service, and one is injured by the carelessness of another, the employer is not responsible. The reason generally assigned for the rule is, that when a person enters the service of his employer in any business that brings him in contact, while in <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>the discharge of his duty, with other servants of the same employer, he is presumed to assume all the risk of injury attendant upon such service while engaged therein. At the time the plaintiff in this ease was injured, he was not engaged in the service for which he was employed. He had been, employed to work as a carpenter on defendant’s viaduct. He had completed his day’s work, and was some twelve or thirteen miles from his field of labor on his way home, in pursuance of defendant’s agreement to furnish him transportation to and from home.</p>

Hiding on the cars to and from Iiittanning was no part of the service to be performed by him for the company. If he had paid his fare regularly on the cars, or had travelled to and from his work in a private conveyance, and had been negligently injured by defendant’s cars at the same point on the road, it would hardly be pretended that he was without remedy against the company on the ground that he was an employee.</p>

It is claimed that the advantage to the company in procuring the services of the plaintiff was the consideration received by it. Mr. Liston testifies that he could not have hired the plaintiff if he had not agreed to have him taken down and up on the cars free of charge. The company was in need of hands, and this method of securing them was adopted. Trains were running daily anyhow, and no fare was lost to the company by taking Mr. Liston’s men up and down without charge. It was doubtless regarded as an advantageous arrangement for the company, or its agent would not have made the contract. If you find from the evidence that the plaintiff was employed and rode on the cars, as stated by Mr. Liston, and that some advantage or benefit was derived by the company from the arrangement, we think that you will be justified in finding that the relation of the plaintiff to the railroad company was the same, in its legal effect, as that of a regular passenger for hire on the road; and we so instruct you as matter of law.</p>

The substance of it is this: He had the supervision of the carpenter work on the road from Kittanning to Pittsburg, and was authorized to employ hands. He specially employed the plaintiff to do carpenter work upon the bridge over the Kiskiminetas, about fifteen miles below Kit-tanning. The plaintiff and other hands lived in and near Kit-tanning, and it was an accommodation to the company to have them to work at the bridge. Liston agreed with the plaintiff as; a part of his contract of hiring that he should travel on the passenger train down and up free of charge, and in consequence of this hired him at a less price per day than if the plaintiff had paid his fare, and if he had not so agreed he could not have been employed at the wages he was paid, [fhe work of the plaintiff was wholly at the bridge, and he received his pay there. At the time of the accident the plaintiff had finished his day’s work, and was ten or twelve miles distant from the bridge on his way home. <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>Under these circumstances the court below instructed the jury that the plaintiff was travelling as a passenger and not in the capacity of a servant. The defendants in error, considering it a fundamental question fatal to the plaintiff’s right to recover, asks us to affirm the judgment, although no writ of error was taken by them. We think the company cannot set up this objection upon the present writ of error. But as this case must go back for a retrial for misdirection of the court on another point, it is proper to express our opinion as a guide to the court on the next trial. We think the court left this question fairly to the jury on the testimony of Liston and with proper instructions.</p>

In the last case our brother Read has brought together most of the decisions./ But this case is clearly distinguishable from them all./ In Ryan <em>v. </em>Cumberland Valley Railroad Co., the plaintiff was a laborer on a gravel train, whose business caused him to travel upon it in the exercise of his employment. The loading and unloading of gravel necessarily required the hands employed in that work to travel with the train from place to place. He gave nothing out of his wages for his fare and travelled not as a passenger to a place of destination, but went with the train whither-soever it became necessary to get and deposit gravel. His travel-ling on the cars was like that of a brakesman or a fireman in pursuance of his employment, and not under a contract for carriage.</p>

In this case, however, the plaintiff, O’Donnell, travelled not as a part of his employment as a carpenter at the bridge, but as a passenger from and to his home. He was not hired to pursue his business <em>on </em>the train, but was carried in consideration of a <em>reduc-! </em>tion in the price of his wages. When his day’s work was performed he was no longer in the service of the company, but was free to go or to stay, and when he travelled in effect paid his fare out of his wages: Myers <em>v. </em>Cumberland V. Railroad Co., 5 P. F.’ Smith, is more directly in point. There as soon as Myers had performed the special act he had undertaken to do, which on the first writ of error was held to place him in a temporary relation of service, and had returned to his stand on the platform, his relation as employee ceased, and it was held he was entitled to the protection of a passenger. We adhere to the doctrine of Ryan <em>v. </em>Railroad Co. and Caldwell <em>v. </em>Brown as the general rule, and as the safe one in governing the relation between the employer and employed.

Ordinary peril is the rule stated by Shaw, C. J., in Farwell <em>v. </em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Metc.%2057" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Metc. 57">4 Metc. 57</a>. In Caldwell <em>v. </em>Brown, <em>supra, </em>Justice Read quotes the rule as stated by Judge Gray in Gilman <em>v. </em>Eastern Railroad Co., <a href="/mass/92/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="10 Allen 233" data-case-ids="2116918" data-case-paths="/mass/92/0233-01">10 Allen 233</a>, to wit, that the servant assumes all the risks of the master’s service which the master cannot control, including those arising from the negligence of fellow-servants, but qualified thus: —“ The master indeed is bound to use ordinary care in providing suitable <em>structures, </em>engines, tools and apparatus, and in selecting proper servants, and is liable to other servants in the same employment if they are injured by <em>Ms own neglect </em>of duty.” In the more recent case of Weger <em>v. </em>Pennsyvania Railroad Co., 5 P. F. Smith 465, Justice Read restates the substance of the rule and remarks, <em>“ </em>that it seems to be conceded that if there be any fault in the selection of the other servants, or in continuing them in their places after they have proved incompetent perhaps; or in employing <em>unsafe macMnery, </em>the master will be answerable for ¡all the injury to his,servants in consequence.” In the present case the injury arose from the breaking of a rail, and according to the plaintiff’s testimony this was caused by its resting upon rotten ties. One of the chief witnesses of the defendants says the ties were the same put in when the road was made; that two-thirds were hemlock, and that the road had been built twelve or thirteen years. If the fact be so, it is a clear case of faultiness; and insecurity in one of the permanent structures of the company,] evidencing the negligence of the company itself. A railroad company is bound to furnish a safe and sufficient roadway. It owes this as a duty to all who travel over it. It is true, that remotely its unsafe condition might have been owing to the negligence of some one in its service, who failed to report its condition or to put it in repair. But it might also be the mere neglect of the company from false economy to order the repair or to furnish the means. The remote negligence of servants will not excuse the non-performance of such a direct and immediate duty as this. If the substructure carrying the rails were suffered to lie until it had become rotten and unsafe, it is the negligence of the company itself, and not merely that of its servants. Casualty from such a cause is not one of those ordinary perils which presumptively every one incurs who takes service with the company. It is not to be likened to the breaking of a rail from frost or mere accident, or from some cause immediately traceable to the negligence of another employee. It would be a cruel exposure of life to hold such a casualty to he an ordinary risk of the service, and <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>it would extend a license to negligence on part of those whose duty it is to be careful of liuman life.</p>
    <p id="b249-3" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[232,492,1178,1880]]]'>The next question relates to the car in which the plaintiff was^ at the time of the accident. Summing up -the doctrine of the court as found in the charge and answers to the points, it was this: That the baggage-car is an improper place for a passenger, and whether the rule of the company forbidding him to be there is made known to him or not,- his own intelligence should teach him that it is not his proper place — that if he leave his seat in a passenger-car and go into the baggage-car, he is guilty of negligence. That nothing less than a direction or an <em>invitation </em>from the conductor to go there will excuse this negligence, and such direction or invitation should not be inferred from the mere fact that he had been accustomed to ride frequently in the baggage-car with the knowledge of the conductor, and without objection. The judge therefore instructed the jury that if the plaintiff left the passenger-car without the direction or invitation of the conductor, he did what no passenger has a right to do, even though he had been accustomed to ride there with the knowledge of the conductor and without his objection. In view of the evidence this instruction was erroneous. The plaintiff had been riding in the baggage-car twice a day for about two months. Murphy the conductor himself admitted that Liston’s men rode frequently in the baggage-car without his objecting — that he never ordered them out. When they got on that car they generally remained there without objection — that he had no recollection of requesting them to go into the passenger-car, and that' he had not at any time requested the plaintiff to leave the baggage-car. The reason for this is obvious. These hands, though passengers on the train from the terms of their employment, still retained the outward appearance of employees. They were in their working clothes, which owing to their employments were doubtless often soiled and filled with perspiration. They were probably at times not considered pleasant travelling companions for those who sat in the passenger-cars, and at times the cars were probably filled. It was not at all unnatural that they themselves should wish, and that the conductor should desire them to travel on the baggage car out of the immediate presence of the passengers. Under these circumstances it cannot be justly said of them as of ordinary passengers, “that any one who is possessed of sufficient intelligence to travel should be held to know that the baggage-car is not an appropriate place for passengers,” nor to say although the consent of the conductor to riding there may be inferred from these facts, yet it does not follow that the company is liable unless it is shown that they were there at the <em>invitation </em>or by the <em>direction </em>of the conductor.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.6",249,[280,2383,1099,45]],["BL_250.1",250,[279,426,1144,1367]]]'>It is undoubtedly the right of the company to prescribe rea<a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>sonable rules for the regulation of those who travel as passengers on the cars: Sullivan <em>v. </em>Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Co., 6 Casey 238; Powell <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 8 Id. 416; Miles <em>v. </em>West Chester Railroad Co., 5 P. F. Smith 209. But the right to regulate is not to be carried to an unreasonable extent, or to make one regulation conflict with another. It is no doubt a proper rule that passengers shall not travel in a baggage-car, but it is as well known that the conductor is the person to administer the rules of the company and to apply them according to the circumstances. The passenger travels under his directions, and generally is bound to conform to them. The conductor acts under a general authority, and from the nature of his position must necessarily exercise some discretion. In Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Chenewith, 2 P. F. Smith, it was held that when the owner of a freight-car attached it with the consent of the agents of the company to a passenger train, contrary to the rules of the company, he agreeing to run the risk, the company could not repudiate the act of their agents so as to free themselves from responsibility for their negligence, by which he was hurt and his car wrecked. The same principle was asserted in perhaps a stronger case, where a valuable mare was lost by using straw (which caught fire from the sparks of the engine) for her bedding in the car, contrary to the positive rules of the company : Powell <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 8 Casey 414; Goldey <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., 6 Id. 242. Erom the evidence in this case, the jury might reasonably conclude that O’Donnell was in the baggage-car with the permission of the conductor and for the benefit of the company, and was rightfully there at the time of the accident. His right to recover for an injury arising from an unsafe track was the same when in the baggage-car as when in the passenger-car. The risk attended every car which traversed the unsafe roadway, and was confined to none in particular.</p>
