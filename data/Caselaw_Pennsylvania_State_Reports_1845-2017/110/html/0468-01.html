Such being the ease, and we will say to you that it is very far from being clear of doubt, our mind is very much confused over this thing, and it is not the first time we have thought the matter over. The cases are conflicting; they are so much so that it is very hard to tell just where this will finally end, and it will probably take another court, the Supreme Court, to settle this question and to reconcile these cases, because to our mind they are very troublesome cases, being very far from reconcilable. But let that be as it majq for the purposes of this case we have concluded. to instruct you that the service of the <em>scire facias </em>upon the terre-tenants in that property on thé Dickey judgment was not sufficient to continue the lien longer than the five years dating from the date of the original entry of the judgment, and that as. the sale took place seven years <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>thereafter, the lien had been lost about two years, and there being no lien on the property, that the sale would pass no title.</p>

It is conceded that the latter was the owner of the land at the time a judgment was recovered against him and others in June, 1875. The contention is whether the lien of the judgment continued until the sale made by the sheriff in September, 1882.</p>
    <p id="b487-14" data-blocks='[["BL_487.17",487,[146,1943,1184,437]]]'>In May, 1879, Wilson sold and conveyed the land to Craig. In May, 1880, a <em>scire facias </em>issued on the judgment. It was duly served on Wilson and on the other defendants in the judgment; but was not served on Craig, although he was in possession of the land. In October of the same year judgment was duly entered against Wilson and his co-defendants for the amount of the original judgment and interest. Execution issued thereon by virtue of which the land was levied on, and sold to the plaintiff to whom a deed was made, duly acknowledged in open court, and delivered in September, 1882.</p>

    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.6",488,[232,757,1189,697]]]'>These two procedures are stated disjunctively. Either one fulfills the requirement of the Statute. The suing out of the writ within the five years just as effectually extends the lien beyond that period as if the judgment were actually revived within that time. The Statute is silent as to the time in. which a writ thus sued out must be served. Judicial decisions, however,- have given construction to its language, and declared the effect of a writ thus duly issued. It is not necessary that the writ be served, nor in case an alias or pluries writ be issued that either be served. The mere issuing of a <em>scire facias </em>within five years after the rendition of the judgment, continues the lien for the period of five years from the time the lien of the former judgment would expire. This rule applies as well to a terre-tenant as to the defendant in the judgment: Lichty <em>v. </em>Hochstetler, 10 Norris, 444; Kirby <em>v. </em>Cash, 12 Id., 505; Porter <em>v. </em>Hitchcock, 2 Out., 625.</p>

Dig., 947, pi. 10, does not enlarge the rights óf a terre-tenant? but on the contrary restrains them. Its effect is not to discharge any lien on his lands which would remain a lien under previous laws ; but to continue it still longer if he has not put his deed on record or is not in actual possession of the land by himself or his tenant. In the present case the tenant was in actual possession, and therefore the Act of 1849 does not apply.</p>
    <p id="b488-7" data-blocks='[["BL_488.8",488,[229,1804,1188,207]]]'>The learned judge misunderstood the ruling in Buck’s Appeal, 4 Out., 109.'
