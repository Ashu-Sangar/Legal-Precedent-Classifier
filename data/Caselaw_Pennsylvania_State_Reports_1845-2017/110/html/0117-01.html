Then follow the words, “ but the landlord may waive further proceedings before the justice, and pursue the method of distress in the usual manner for the balance so settled,” and from this language the learned judge of the court below implies the power of the justice to enter a judgment and issue execution thereon. Why, if this power was intended by the legislature to be given to the justice, were the words “the balance so settled ” used ? Would not “the judgment so rendered ” have been more natural? And why use the limiting words “so' far,” if it was intended that the-justice should have the power, <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>not only to settle the balance, <em>id est, </em>“ to defalcate or set off the just account of the tenant” out of the landlord’s claim for rent, but to proceed to judgment and execution. Either the words “so far ” are meaningless and absurd or the words “ he may waive further proceedings,” etc., are. If the justice can only proceed so far, it is nonsensical to say he can go further. The Act provided that “ the remedy by replevin shall remain as heretofore.” Under the decision of the lower court the remedy does not remain as heretofore. Heretofore the remedy by repelviu permitted the landlord and tenant to try before a jury the question of rent or no rent in arreaiy but where the tenant availed himself of the provisions of the twenty-second section of the Act of March 20th, 1810, to procure a settlement of the amount of rent due, the remedy by replevin was by grace of his landlord; if the latter pursued the method of distress the tenant could have his replevin; if he saw fit to issue an execution there remained nothing for the tenant, but to pay.</p>

What was the purpose of the Act ? To provide a simple and inexpensive means of settling disputes between landlord and tenant. To hold that it is intended to provide an action, which settles nothing and accomplishes nothing, and does not tend to simplify and lesson litigation, is contrary to the universal policy of law, to prevent multiplicity of suits. What was the old law, prior to the passage of the Act allowing defalcation by tenant? The landlord could levy by landlord’s warrant for any amount he saw fit to claim, and the tenant had no remedy but replevin. What was the mischief? That the tenant might be a man of small means and entirely unable to give the necessary bonds and would be therefore completely at the mercy of the landlord. What was the remedy provided ? That the tenant could apply to a justice and have the matter settled at trifling cost, and the landlord could only collect the amount so settled by execution or distress, and if he collected <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>more by distress be “ should forfeit four times” the amount Of surplus.</p>

The learned judge very correctly said it was of difficult construction. Without the aid of Hilke <em>v. </em>Eisenbeis, 8 Out., 514, it is not surprising that he fell into an error. In that case we said the language of this section was indefinite and obscure, and that very little aid was given in its construction by the adjudged cases. After a careful consideration and examination of them, and of the Act, we declared that the main purpose of the limited and restricted jurisdiction given by this section, was not to submit to the justice to find how much rent was in arrear to the landlord, but what amount of the tenant’s account should be deducted from, or set off against the rent. We held the section did not direct the justice to enter any judgment, nor did it authorize him to issue any process to enforce his decision. We adhere to that case as giving the correct construction to the statute. It therefore rules this case and shows that the Recorder, whose power was the same as a justice of the peace, had no jurisdiction of the rent in arrear, and was not authorized to enter any judgment therefor.</p>
