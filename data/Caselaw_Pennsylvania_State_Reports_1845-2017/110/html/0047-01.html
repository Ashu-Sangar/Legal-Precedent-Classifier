The premises were occupied by both husband and wife, who by their joint exertions raised and harvested the wheat, oats and potatoes which were levied on in execution at the suit of Charles Standart, a judgment creditor of the husband, as the property of said husband. It also appeared, inter alia, that Isaac J. Sober was insolvent, and that his wife possessed no separate estate, but had obtained a judgment against him for money loaned him derived from her deceased father’s estate, prior to the entry of defendant Standards judgment.</p>

F. S., 448; Seeds <em>v. </em>Kahler, 26 Id., 262. It is equally as well settled that when she has no separate estate, and buys property on her personal credit, she cannot so hold it: Baringer <em>v. </em>Stiver, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%20129" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Wright 129">13 Wright, 129</a>; Brown <em>v. </em>Pendleton, 10 P.

The true intent of the Act of 1848 is to preserve to her and to protect her in the use and enjoyment of her bona fide separate estate, but not to enable her to defraud the. creditors of her husband. In the present case the wife had no separate estate on which a credit could be based. The purchase was solely on the personal credit of herself and of her husband. There is no error in the record.</p>
