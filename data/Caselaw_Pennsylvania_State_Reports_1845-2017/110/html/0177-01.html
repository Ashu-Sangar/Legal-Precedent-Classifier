That such evidence is admissible is shown by the cases of Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>Bousall, 22 P. F.

For the same reasons we deem it unnecessary to collate and cité any of the innumerable authorities on the subject of stock gambling.</p>
    <p id="b196-6" data-blocks='[["BL_196.9",196,[225,847,1208,1130]]]'>A <em>bona fide </em>contract for the purchase and sale of stocks, though a speculation, is a legitimate transaction, and when the stock is actually bought there can no longer be any question of intention as to delivery. In this case, as the stock was unquestionably actually bought for Potts, on his express order, he can. raise no question about the intention to deliver it to him. It became his property from the time it was bought, and the loss incident to the re-sale, which was properly made, must fall upon him. In Smith <em>v. </em>Bouvier, 20 P F. S., 325, when it was insisted that the jury should have been instructed that all purchases of stock, with a view to re-sell and make profit on their rise, or contracts to furnish stocks on time should be declared gambling transactions and illegal, not only between buyers'and sellers, but as to brokers or agents through whom the sales and purchases had been made, Thompson, C. J., in answer, said: “ This would make a great inroad into what has, for an indefinite period, been regarded as a legitimate business, and would either destroy it altogether or, if continued, put the brokers at the mercy of those for whom they transact such business. Let it be understood that a broker has no power to recover either for advances or commissions, however justly he may have dealt, and there will be found enough persons whose easy consciences would throw their losses upon the shoulders of those who advanced the money and earned commissions in their service.” In Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>Bonsall, 22 P. F S., 155, the same principle is recognized.</p>

      <em>We </em>adhere to the rule that an agreement for the purchase of stocks on margin without any intention of delivering the stock is a gambling contract, which will not support an action between the parties thereto. That, however, is not this case. Here there was no agreement between these parties by which one was to buy of the other. The defendant in error did not agree to sell to the other party; but, at the request of the latter, and for him, the former agreed to buy the stock specified. He was to lend or advance the money to an amount sufficient <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>to make the purchase, but was not to own the stock himself. With his money thus advanced he caused the stock to be purchased for the plaintiff in error, and notified him of the purchase. It was delivered to the broker of whom it was purchased, and ready for delivery to the plaintiff in error whenever he was prepared to pay the unpaid portion of the purchase money. The evidence shows that he recognized it as his stock. The jury has found under a fair and clear charge that the transaction between the parties was not a gambling contract, but was founded on an actual sale and purchase of the stock by the defendant in error for the plaintiff in error, and that the stock was bought with an intent to deliver the same to the latter. The fact that the defendant may have purchased for other persons, other stocks, under arrangements which would stamp them as wagering or gambling transactions, is wholly irrelevant. All the evidence offered as to contracts with other persons was therefore properly rejected. The intention of the parties to the contract is to be ascertained by their acts and declarations, and not from their thoughts unexpressed. A careful examination of the whole case does not disclose any sufficient cause for disturbing the judgment.</p>
