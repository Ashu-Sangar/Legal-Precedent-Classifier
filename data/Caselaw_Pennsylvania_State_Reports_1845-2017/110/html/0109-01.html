Downey, by taking the assignment, by implication at least, agreed to pay the future assesments; He paid Boas $65 for the right to be substituted to his place in the contract he' had made with the insurance company. His contract in effect was the same as if the policy had originally been made payable to him. No changes were made in its terms at time of the assignment. He became the beneficiary instead of Boas. His bargain was a better one than if he had taken the policy at its inception, because the assured had paid $185.20 of assessments and received but $65 for the policy from him.

Such a policy would be a wager policy, or a mere speculative contract upon the life of the assured, with a direct interest in its early termination. The assignment of a policy to a party not having an insurable interest is as objectionable as the taking out of a policy in his own name.

The court held “ that the purchaser having no interest whatever in the life of the assured, he was a mere speculator upon the probabilities of human life.

    <p id="b132-10" data-blocks='[["BL_132.20",132,[278,1839,1187,610]]]'>The rule, however, applicable to this class of cases appears to rest on public policy which forbids gambling on the duration of human life. It is not sufficient that the sale and purchase of this policy may have been in good faith and with correct motives. The mischief resulting from a sale of the policy for purposes of speculating on human life is so contrary to the policy of the law, and so in conflict with the just principles of life insurance, that it is unsafe to relax the rule that the holder of the policy must have some pecuniary interest in the life of the person insured. Permitting the assignee to retain the sum he has paid to the person insured and to the company, with interest thereon, so far protected the assignee and enforced the rule based on public policy, as to give no just reason to complain.</p>
