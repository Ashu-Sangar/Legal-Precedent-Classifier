The Act, it is true, does not prescribe any particular form of notice, but in Allison <em>v. </em>Johnson, <em>et al., </em>11 Norris, 314 and Pardee’s Appeal, 4 Out., 408, we said it should be sufficiently full and clear to show the officer and others interested that the labor was performed within the time limited by the Act, in a business defined therein, the sum duejj and that the property subject to tlie preferred lien is embraced in the levy. These four ingredients are necessary to bring a claim within tlie protection of the Statute, and hence they must appear in some form, in the notice served on the sheriff.
