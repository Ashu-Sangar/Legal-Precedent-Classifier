If sufficient reason for so long delay has not been affirmatively shown by the plaintiffs, their neglect to comply with the requirement of their policy is fatal to their claim, and plaintiffs cannot recover. In this connection you will consider the items which the policy required to be expressed in this proof, the exactness of the proof which the company required, as shown'by their letters of May 10th, 1883, and the difficulty a person of ordinary intelligence and information would have, under the circumstances in getting such proof as the terms of the policy or the requisitions of the company required. If the plaintiffs used all reasonable means and exertions by themselves or through their agent or attorney to get together the requisite facts for a proof of loss, and to furnish such information as the company desired, and in so doing were unable to perfect the proof and furnish it to the company until the time the final proof in this case was furnished, their delay would not bar their recovery......You will also consider the evidence which has been given as to the character of W.

What is a reasonable time, when the facts are ascertained, is ordinarily a question of law for the court, to be determined upon a consideration of all the circumstances; where, however, the facts are not clearly established, or where the question is dependent upon other controverted matters it is, under proper instructions, for the jury: Hickman <em>v. </em>Shimp, 13 Out. 16. In the case at bar, it is alleged on part of the plaintiffs, that W. B. Hazen was at the time of the fire, and for a long time afterwards in a very feeble condition of health, physically and mentally; that two of his sons had died in that spring, and that he was himself seriously sick, having been for two or three months confined to his bed, that his memory was very much 'affected and that from February to August 1883, ho was totally unfit, and did not pretend to do any business whatever; that he was obliged to submit himself to a surgical operation, and that as soon as he was sufficiently recovered, he gave’the matter his attention and made the proofs dated 30th August, 1883. Mr. Cochran, who was his attorney, and prepared the proofs, testifies that he was unable on account of the illness of Mr. Hazen to communicate with him; that Mr. Hazen could give him very little if any aid, and that it was with the greatest difficulty that he was able to obtain the information requisite to comply with the requirements of the company. The forms for proof, it would appear, provided for an estimate of the value of the <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>building by' the builders, and of the machinery by the millwrights, and Mr. Cochran states in detail the efforts which were from time to time made to complete the proofs on this plan; that for a long time he failed to find the,millwrights who had constructed the machinery, that in the meantime he procured an estimate of others unacquainted with it, and that from these the proofs of 30th August, 1883, were made; that subsequently, however, he learned the names and whereabouts of the millwrights who built the machinery, and in order t'o know with certainty that the estimates were correct he held the proofs for the inspection and examination of those who thus had personal actual knowledge of the nature and value of the subject of loss. He says that he exercised reasonable diligence in the matters committed to his charge, and forwarded the proofs as soon as he could. These facts it is true were seriously controverted, but with the weight and conflict of the evidence, and the veracity of the witnesses we have nothing to do.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[257,1207,1192,610]]]'>The company demanded that W. B. Hazen should join in the proofs, the preparation of which under the requirements of the company involved a considerable degree of detail and exactness pf statement. If he was in fact mentally and physically unfit so tó do; if as soon as he was sufficiently restored he set about the business of preparation; if his attorney advanced the work as rapidly as he could under the circumstances, if there was not upon the part of either any neglect or want of due diligence, until the time the final proof was furnished, the delay which ensued could not bar the plaintiffs’ recovery. In this determination of the question, therefore, as to what was a reasonable time, under the circumstances, it was for the court to apply the law, and to submit the facts to the jury, and this, we think, was done.</p>

The affidavit filed is not before us, but it appears to be conceded that it contained no averment as to incumbrances entered against the property, or that any defence could be taken upon that ground. If the rule of court is as stated the offer of the judgment of Emma Seedle against W. B. Hazen was rightly refused for any other purpose than that for which it was admitted. For the same <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>reason and others which might be stated, the record of the action of the Susquehanna Mutual Fire Insurance Company against W.

The evidence as to the plaintiff’s general reputation as an honest, peaceable, and orderly man may perhaps have had little effect in the determination of the pause by the jury, but it was received against the objection of the defendant, an exception was noted, and it is assigned for error here. It seems to be well settled in Pennsylvania that in civil eases, evidence of general character is not admissible, unless from the nature of the action character is directly drawn in issue, as in libel or slander and seduction. Putting character in issue, as was said in Porter <em>v. </em>Seiler, 11 Harris 424, is a technical expression which does not signify merely that personal reputation is incidently involved in the consequences or results of the action, but that the action in its nature directly involves the question of character.</p>

In Porter <em>v. </em>Seiler, 11 Harris 424, an action of trespass was brought to recover damages for an injury wilfully inflicted with a knife, and evidence of the defendant’s good character, as a peaceable man was excluded when offered for the purpose of rebutting malice. So in Zitzer <em>v. </em>Merkel, 12 Harris 408, it was held that evidence of the defendant’s good character was inadmissible in an action on the case for seduction.</p>
    <p id="b553-8" data-blocks='[["BL_553.8",553,[117,1778,1187,617]]]'>In Porter <em>v. </em>Seiler, <em>supra, </em>the authorities are carefully collected, and the whole subject elaborately considered, and we deem it unnecessary, on that account, to enter into any extended discussion of the question here. The rule maybe considered as settled under our decisions, that in civil suits evidence of character is not admissible except where it is directly in issue, and when from the nature of the issues such evidence is of special importance; whether the act charged as complained of be indictable or not is not material. Here the company set up by way of defence, that the plaintiffs or some of them wilfully caused the fire which occasioned the loss, and although a verdict in favor of the company on that ground might affect the character of the plaintiffs, yet their character was in no proper sense put in issue.</p>
