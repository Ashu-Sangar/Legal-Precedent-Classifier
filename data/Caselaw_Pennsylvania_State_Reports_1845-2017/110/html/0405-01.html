      <em>First. </em>Because it is an attempt to tax “ property ” owned in New York by a New York corporation, “in violation-of a necessary implication of the Constitution of the United States that each state shall have jurisdiction only over property within its territorial limits.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b423-9" data-blocks='[["BL_423.9",423,[107,1155,1183,554]]]'>In considering this objection, we must keep in view the facts of the case, which show that the “ property,” taxed is the money which accrued to defendant as gross receipts from business transacted by it within the state of Pennsylvania. We do not know of any provision or implication of the Constitution of the United States which prohibits the taxation of such receipts. There certainly is no provision or “ implication that each state shall have jurisdiction only over property within its territorial limits.” It may have jurisdiction over the property and not over the person, or over the person and not over the property ; the latter as well as the former may give jurisdiction to tax receipts such as we are concerned with in this case.</p>

The principles which lead-to this conclusion are clearly stated in St. Clair <em>v. </em>Cox, <a href="/us/106/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="106 U.S. 350" data-case-ids="3498601" data-case-paths="/us/106/0350-01">106 U.

Its officers and agents constitute all that is visible of its existence, and they may be authorized to act for it without, as well as within, the state. ' There would seem, therefore, to be no sound reason why, to the extent of their <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>agency, they should not be equally deemed "to represent it in the "states for which they are respectively appointed when it is called to legal responsibility for their transactions.”</p>

      <em>Second. </em>Defendant contends that the tax is invalid because it is a regulation of commerce between the several states, Avliich is forbidden by clause four of section eight of Article I of the Constitution of the United States.</p>

We are unable to distinguish this case from those, and we are bound by them until, if ever, they are overruled or reversed. It certainly cannot be any more a regulation of commerce, as contended by defendant, to tax gross receipts which have accrued from business doneAvithin the state, but which have not been physically Avithin the state, than it would be if such receipts had been physically here. If their physical absence from the state Avould render the tax invalid it must be for a <em>reason </em>other than that it is a regulation of commerce.</p>
