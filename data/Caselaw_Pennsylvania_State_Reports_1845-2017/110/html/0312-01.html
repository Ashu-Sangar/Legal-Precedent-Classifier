The defendant’s second point should have been affirmed. The mortgage covered only “one engine,” and there was one on the premises and nothing to show that it was not the one mortgaged. The engine sold by the sheriff to the defendant was <em>not </em>on the premises. The charge of the court was too broad that “ the mortgage vests in the plaintiffs the right to follow the property wherever they could find it.” A mortgagee out of possession should show the circumstances, intent or purpose of the removal: Angier <em>v. </em>Agnew, 2 Out., 587.

The right to maintain the action is claimed by them as an incident of the leasehold mortgage which has been considered in writ of error to the judgment in ejectment between the same parties, No. 73 'of this' term. (Preceding case.) Some of the facts are common to both cases, and, so far as they have been stated in that case, it is unnecessary to repeat them here.</p>

Neither the mortgagor nor any one coming into possession under him as purchaser at sheriff’s sale of his interest, subject to the mortgage, has a right to remove the machinery or fixtures, covered by the mortgage, to the detriment of the mortgagee. The law regards such removal as a fraud upon the latter, and permits him to follow the property and assert his right thereto as against the wrong-doer: Hoskin <em>v. </em>Woodward, 9 Wr., 42; Witmer’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20455" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="9 Wright 455">Id., 455</a>; and there appears to be no reason why he may not do this, notwithstanding the mortgage is not due, unless the mortgagor has provided against it by reserving to himself the possession and control of the mortgaged property until default is made in payment of the mortgage debt: Martin <em>v. </em>Jackson, 3 Casey, 504; Tryon <em>v. </em>Munson, 27 P.
