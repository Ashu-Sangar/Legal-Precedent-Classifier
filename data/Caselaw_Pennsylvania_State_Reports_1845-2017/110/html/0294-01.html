Scott, C. B. Curtis, Joseph A. Neill and Leroy S. Lowry, as tenants in common in lots Nos. 5230, 5231, 5223 and one half of lot 5228, in Limestone township, and on that day the said owners conveyred to Elmer N. Lacy the whole of the land mentioned, reserving all the oil, coal or other minerals upon said land, or in any way growing out of or connected with the said lands as heretofore described. Also, reserving the right of ingress and egress to operate the same as fully as if this conveyance had never been made, except upon ten acres upon which may be erected a mill for the manufacture of lumber, and which exception shall extend to each tract, which, may be used in the manufacture of lumber as aforesaid, relieving all the oil and minerals in said ten acres in each tract heretofore reserved for lumbering.</p>

Kline, the defendants, became the owners of lots Nos. 5230, 5223 and one half of lot 5228. The said lots were advertised for sale by the treasurer of Warren county for arrears of unpaid taxes for the years 1880 to 1882, and on June 12, 1882, they were put up for sale at auction by the treasurer and bids were made upon each tract, upon one as high as $30,000.</p>

Lacy, by which the taxes could be paid, or would <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>be paid, or the property purchased and bid in, in the interest of all parties concerned who had interests therein. That Cable replied that lie was there for the purpose of bidding off the property for Lacy, and had no authority to make any arrangement about it or to do anything else. That, in order 'to preserve the interests of Scott, Curtis, Lowry and himself in the reservation, Joseph A. Neill, the plaintiff, then induced the treasurer to stop, under the promise of Neill that he would pay the taxes, and he did so that day, to the amount of $589.07, and took from the treasurer’, F. M. Knapp, his receipt therefor of that date. That Neill, at the time he arranged to pay the taxes to the treasurer, and when he did pay them, publicly announced that he did it under protest and for the purpose of preserving’ the interest of himself, Lowry, Curtis and Scott. And in all these deeds, including the one from the master', the reservation of the oil and minerals, as contained in the first deed, is specifically mentioned.</p>

In 1880, 5228 was assessed in Limestone township. That the lands were cried for sale a little out of order before they were reached in their regular order to accommodate Neill so that he could return home on the next train, he not knowing that any person representing Lacy was present until after they were ¡nit up, and when the}’ were put up, Neill announced that he would purchase for the benefit of all the parties interested, and Neill did not discover Cable or anyone else representing Lacy until after the first were cried for sale.</p>

But the fact that Lacy, through his agent, was attempting to buy the lands we think lias no bearing on the question, even if it be granted that a purchase by him unredeemed from would extinguish the rights of Neill, Scott, Curtis and Lowry. As we understand the law, Lacy had the same right to become a purchaser at the treasurer’s sales of unseated laud as an entire stranger to tlio title had. Although owner or part owner of the land at the time of the treasurer’s sale, he was under no legal and personal liability to pay the taxes. The land and not the owner is debtor to the unseated tax. Being-<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>under no personal liability to the public for the taxes on his own land, he was under no personal obligations to discharge the same in the relief or for the protection of the plaintiff’s interest in the same land. Had the plaintiff paid taxes for which the defendants were legally and personally liable, in order to protect his own interest in the lands, the law would imply an agreement by defendants to indemnify him for such payment. But here the law fixes no personal liability on defendants. They have made no express promise to pay, and there is no community of interest from which a promise to pay can be implied. The interest of the plaintiff is distinct from and of an entirely different nature from that of defendants. The one has an estate in the oil, coal and other minerals. The other has an estate in the lands, excluding the oil, coal and other minerals. To hold the defendants liable to reimburse the plaintiff for money expended by him in what we think we must treat as a voluntary payment of taxes, would be to decide contrary to what we understand to be the settled law of the state, namely, that unseated land and not the owner thereof is the debtor to the taxes.”</p>
