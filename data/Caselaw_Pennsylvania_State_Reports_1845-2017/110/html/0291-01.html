B. Siggins, Drusilla Siggins, A. M. Belnap, N. P. Belnap, W. D. Belnap, Ezra Belnap, and Hiram Belnap, defendants. The lien was filed under the General Borough Law of April 3d, 1851. The claim was filed more than thirty days but within six months after <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>the last work was done. The defendants took a rule to show cause why the lien should not be stricken off, because it was not filed within thirty days after the work was completed, .which rule the court made absolute, Bbown, P. J., delivering the following opinion :—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b308-5" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[256,688,1188,258]]]'>By Act of 3d April, 1851, a borough may direct the paving of sidewalks by the owner of the ground fronting thereon, and upon failure of the owner, may cause the same to be done, and collect the cost of labor and materials, with twenty per centum advance thereon from the owner, as claims are by law recoverable, under the law relative to mechanics’ liens.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b308-6" data-blocks='[["BL_308.6",308,[253,949,1190,689]]]'>The Act prescribes that the particulars of the labor and materials, and the name of the owner or occupier of the premises, shall be set forth in a statement to be filed within thirty days after such expense shall have been incurred. The statement in this case was not filed within the thirty days, and the defendants moved to strike off the lien. The plaintiff resists this, contending as we understand, that inasmuch as the mechanics’ lien law provides that the debt shall be a lien for six months, though no claim shall'be filed, that the lien of the borough claim for the building of the sidewalk continues for the same time, although no claim be filed until after the thirty days, that the provision of the borough Act providing for a statement within thirty days is directory, and hence not essential to the collection of the debt from the lot fronting on the sidewalk, provided the same shall be filed within the six tnon ths.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b308-7" data-blocks='[["BL_308.7",308,[252,1646,1188,339]]]'>Although not free from difficult}7 we are inclined to think that the legislative intent was to make the borough claim for the building of sidewalks collectible in the same manner as the claims of mechanics under the mechanics’ lien law of 1836, except that the statement provided in the borough law should- stand in place of the statement required by the mechanics’ lien law, and should be filed within thirty days, instead of six months.</p>

If the Act of 1851 provides for the lien at all, the lien is disposed of by the preceding sentence providing for the collection of municipal claims “as claims are by law recoverable under the provisions of the law relative to mechanics’ liens.” The phrase, “to be filed in thirty days,” is not the principal part of the sentence, but only a qualifying adjunct. It is not a proviso to the power conferred upon the borough, nor is it a condition to the existence of the lieu. Certain things shall be set forth in the statement, but it is not said the statement <em>shall </em>be filed within thirty^ days. The phrase “to be filed within thirty days” is directory and not mandatory: Bladen <em>v. </em>Phila., 10 P. F.
