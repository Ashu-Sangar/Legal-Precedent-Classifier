But no such reason exists here. Brodbeck bound himself alone in the deed, and executed no dower bond or other personal obligation to Mrs. King.

But in tracing this doctrine, both in courts of law and equity, it is by no means clear, that in our mixed administration of law and equity, he ought not. It would be very inconvenient if he should not. Transfers of land are so very frequent; lands are so continually changing owners ; the policy of our laws is so much in favor of removing every impediment in the way of alienation, and the hardship is so great on the grantee, who is entitled to the full benefit of his covenant, that I would feel a strong desire to relieve him, if by analogy to any principle of the common law, or any rule of equity, it could be done.”</p>

All the authorities seem to concur in stating this to be the measure of damages in such cases. Thus in Pitcher <em>v. </em>Livingston, <a href="/johns/4/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Johns. 1" data-case-ids="2001786" data-case-paths="/johns/4/0001-01">4 John., 1</a>, the court said, Van Ness, J.: “ The covenant against incumbrances stands upon a different footing, and is governed by different principles. That is strictly a covenant of indemnity and the grantee may recover to the full extent of any incumbrances upon the land which he shall have been compelled to discharge. But even there it -will be found that the same rule'prevails in fixing the amount of damages as in actions upon the covenants of seisin and for quiet enjoyment, that is, the party recovers what he lias paid with the interest and no more.” In Delavergne <em>v. </em>Norris, <a href="/johns/7/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Johns. 358" data-case-ids="369178" data-case-paths="/johns/7/0358-01">7 Johns., 358</a>, the court said: “If the plaintiff when he sues on a covenant against incumbrances has extinguished the incumbrance, he is entitled to recover the price he paid for it. But if he has not extinguished it, but it is still an outstanding incumbrance, his damages are but nominal, for he ought not to recover the value of an incumbrance on a contingency where he may never be disturbed by it.”</p>

The law on this subject is laid down with precision and accuracy in the very able judgment of Chief Justice Parsons in Prescott <em>v. </em>Trueman, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Mass.%20630" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Mass. 630">4 Mass., 630</a>: ‘If a mortgage is the incumbrance, it being only a collateral security, the grantee can only recover nominal damages unless he has'removed it, because the mortgagee can compel the mortgagor to pay the debt which is the principal security; but if the grantee has paid it so that the mortgage is discharged, the sum secured by the mortgage is the measure of damages.’ And I am of the opinion that where the mortgage money is not due, but the grantee chooses to pay it, the jury ought to allow him the fair price it necessarily cost him, for it would be a most inconvenient doctrine to hold that the vendee was to wait ten years until the last instalment became due, and the vendor a beggar. But whether <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>the plaintiff paid it or not, still he was entitled to nominal damages; the covenant was broken.”</p>

    <p id="b219-7" data-blocks='[["BL_219.7",219,[160,785,1184,920]]]'>While it is true that a reason for the rule given by some judges is that the mortgagee might resort to an action on the bond of the mortgagor, yet that is not a controlling reason, the more satisfactory one being that before the covenantee can recover the whole amount of the incumbrance, he must pay it. This was the view taken in Stanard <em>v. </em>Eldridge, <a href="/johns/16/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="16 Johns. 254" data-case-ids="378152" data-case-paths="/johns/16/0254-01">16 Johns., 254</a>, where the general doctrine was affirmed as in Delavergne <em>v. </em>Norris. Chief Justice Spencer speaking of that case said: “ We there held that in a suit upon a covenant against incumbrances, unless the covenantee had extinguished them, as he well might, for his own security, and if they were still outstanding, the damages were but nominal; for that there ought not to be a recovery of the amount of an incumbrance on a contingency, when the covenantee might perhaps never be disturbed by it. It is supposed that this principle is not applicable here, for it is stated in the case that no bond was given ; still the mortgagor might be sued in the covenant to pay the money, which is imported in every mortgage. We ought not to refine on this salutary principle, that before there can be a recovery on a covenant against incumbrances, the covenantor must pay and satisfy them.”</p>
    <p id="b219-8" data-blocks='[["BL_219.8",219,[160,1706,1184,434]]]'>In the present case the incumbrance is an annual charge in favor of a widow and a principal sum payable after her death to the heirs. The latter may not become due for many years and the plaintiff may never be called upon to pay it. It is true the land is liable for it, but so also is the defendant Brodbeck, who assumed to pay it, and therefore became personally liable for it. The plaintiff could have protected himself bv withholding a sufficient amount of the purchase money, but lie did not choose to do so, and was satisfied with Brodbeck’s personal liability.</p>

Whether he can still do so and thereby entitle himself to present relief in some form, is a question which is not before us and which therefore we do not <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>decide.
