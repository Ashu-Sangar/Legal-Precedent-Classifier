    <p class="summary" id="b17-11" data-blocks='[["BL_17.8",17,[129,1905,1180,176]]]'>This was an action on the case, by Martin W. Keifer against the township of Eldred, to recover damages for the loss of a colt, caused by negligence of the defendant in not keeping in repair and safe condition a bridge on a public road.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b17-13" data-blocks='[["BL_17.10",17,[128,2164,1177,167]]]'>1. That under the uncontradicted testimony in this case the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in allowing his eattlo to run at largo on tbe highway, and on this bridge, and therefore cannot recover in this action.</p>

It <a id="p2" href="#p2" data-label="2" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*2</a>is not material to what extent his negligence has contributed. If he is also negligent, and his negligence has contributed to the infliction of the injury upon his person or upon his property, he cannot recover. We will leave to you the question as a question of fact, whether Keifer in this instance was guilty of contributory negligence, whether his own action in allowing his horses to cross this bridge without anybody having them in charge, as would appear was the custom — for them to cross that bridge to get to the water — was negligence on his part, which contributed to bring about this accident. If it was so, then he could not recover. Therefore, we will negative this point. In doing so, I refuse to take the ease from your consideration.</p>

Or, is the theory of the defence correct, that the colt could not have fallen through that hole, or that the bridge was perfectly safe, and, therefore, that there was no negligence ? In the one case you will find for the plaintiff, and in the other you will find for the defendant. If you find for the plaintiff, that he lost his property in consequence of the negligence of the township, that they failed to make repairs there which they should have made, which the supervisor should have made, in order to render this bridge safe, then the next question you would have to dispose of would be the amount of damages to which he is entitled.”</p>

      <em>dido, </em>tho record must show distinctly what point is reserved: Miller <em>v. </em>Bedford, 5 Norris, 454; Patton <em>v. </em>Railway Co., 15 Id., 169. While the question reserved must be one of law only, yet the record must show the specific fact or facts on which the law is reserved. The reservation cannot be on the whole case. Whether there is any evidence of a fact which ought to be submitted to the jury, is a question of law which may be reserved; but whether tho evidence be sufficient to justify the finding is a question of fact which cannot be reserved. Nor can questions of law mingled with questions of fact be reserved: Wilde <em>v. </em>Trainor, 9 P. F. S., 439; Chandler <em>v. </em>Commerce Fire Ins. Co., 7 Norris, 223. The judge cannot himself draw conclusions of fact from the evidence and enter judgment thereon <em>non obstante veredicto.</em>

This uncertainty is fatal to the reservation, and the learned judge erred in entering judgment <em>non obstante veredicto, </em>therefore—</p>
