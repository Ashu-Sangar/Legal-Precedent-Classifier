J., tlie following facts appeared: Elizabeth A. Pursell is the owner of a farm in Bucks county which fronts upon the river Delaware and extends for some distance along its banks to the left of where Gallows Run flows into said river. Stover, one of the defendants, is the owner of a saw mill on the other side of Gallows Run and some distance above its mouth. When Mrs. Pursell became tlie owner of the farm she caused printed notices to be posted on the -trees in the vicinity, forbidding the landing and tying of logs along her river shore and the passing over her property ; a copy of such notice was served upon Stover. On April 30th, 1883, Stover came down the river with a small float of logs, a portion of a raft which was stored in an eddy near by. These logs he tied to a tree on the bank in front of or upon Mrs. Pursell’s property, and near the mouth of Gallows Run. Stover then called Williams, tlie other defendant, <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>who was oh the opposite side of the creek, and he drove across the mouth of the creek with a pair of horses attached to timber wheels, and then along the edge .of the river in front of plaintiff’s property to where the logs were, and after loading them he drove back the same way. Mrs. Pursell thereupon brought this action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b60-4" data-blocks='[["BL_60.5",60,[261,673,1188,958]]]'>Defendants raised three points of defence. 1st, that Stover had a license .to use the river and shore in the manner complained of, which license was derived as follows: He showed that originally the saw mill property and plaintiff’s land were one farm belonging to one Treichler; that when the mill was sold by Treichler s heirs, of whom plaintiff was one, it was announced at the sale that the purchaser of the mill should “have the privilege of tying logs on the farm, with access to it in order that he might run them down to the creek’s mouth to haul them out up to the mill.” This announcement, as was testified by several witnesses, was made with the knowledge and consent of the heirs who were all present, and the result .of the privilege being granted was a realization of a higher price. These privileges were not mentioned in the deed to the purchaser but they were used by him, and when lie conveyed to Stover, they were expressly mentioned in the deed. When Mrs. Pursell was given this farm by an adjudication of the Orphans’ Court, she claimed that she had not consented to the granting of these privileges, and notified Stover to stop tying logs upon her property. Stover’s grantors then paid him $1,500 for a release of their liability to him on account of their conveying to him these privileges.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b60-5" data-blocks='[["BL_60.6",60,[260,1631,1182,216]]]'>The second defence set up was that he had the right to the use of the eddy and shore of plaintiff’s land for the reason that it was made servient to.the mill property by Treichler, who carried on the business in this way, and the same was so continued by his heirs previous to'the sale of the same.</p>

    <p id="b62-6" data-blocks='[["BL_62.8",62,[246,680,1192,995]]]'>It was not error for the learned judge below to instruct the jury, “that a parol license of a privilege, such as this is claimed to be, obtained upon a verbal and executed contract, and founded upon a sufficient consideration, would be plead-able by this defendant in his defence.” The argument for the plaintiff upon this branch of the case rests mainly upon the ground that the evidence of a parol license was insufficient. There is no assignment of error to this point, and if there had been it would have been of no.avail, as there was ample evidence to go to the jury and to sustain the verdict. The defendant’s mill property and the. plaintiff’s farm were originally one property, and belonged to Newton Treichler. When the mill was sold by the heirs, of whom the plaintiff was one, it was distinctly announced at the sale that the purchaser of the mill should “ have the privilege of tying logs on the farm, with access to it, in order that he might run them down to the creek’s mouth, to haul them out up to the mill.” This announcement was made with the knowledge and consent of the heirs, who were all present at the sale, and resulted in their getting an increased price for the property. It is true, there was a conflict of evidence upon this point, but the jury have found the facts substantially as I have stated them, and that is. the end of the matter.</p>
    <p id="b62-7" data-blocks='[["BL_62.9",62,[248,1682,1190,304]]]'>The question whether the tree to which the defendant tied his raft was above or below high water mark was fairly submitted to the jury in a clear and impartial manner by the learned judge, and they have found it was below high water mark. Had it been above, the defendant would have been a trespasser; if below, he would not have been a trespasser, and so the learned judge instructed the jury.</p>
    <p id="b62-8" data-blocks='[["BL_62.10",62,[249,1987,1191,478]],["BL_63.1",63,[125,422,1182,258]]]'>The Delaware River is a public highway, and it is settled by abundant authority that the rights of the riparian owner extend to high water mark absolutely, and to low water mark in a qualified sense; that is to say, between high and low water the public have a right of way for the purposes of navigation, which includes all that is reasonably necessary for that purpose: Zug <em>v. </em>Com, 20 P. F. S., 138; Hartley v. Crawford, 32 Id., 486; Wood <em>v. </em>Appal, 13 Id., 210; Stover <em>v. </em>Jack, 10 Id., 340; Kreiter <em>v. </em>Bigler, 5 Out., 94. It follows that when the space between high and low water is actually covered with water, it may be used by the public, because it is a part of the <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>public highway. This is as far as it is necessary to go in this case, as the defendant did not use any portion of the dry land in getting away his logs. They were attached to a truck in the water, and floated down to the mouth of the creek. This was navigation within the meaning of the term as applied to our fresh water rivers, and the business transacted thereon.</p>
