Prior to 1877 he bought the phosphate from the firm and sold it on his own account. In August, 1877, he commenced receiving phosphate from them on consignment account and selling it for them as their <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>agent or bailee.

This agent found a large amount of accounts outstanding, sufficient when collected probably to liquidate the consignment account. He then prepared an agreement whereby Coe and Richmond appointed James Bighain as agent for the sale of their phosphate, to net said Coe and Richmond $35 per ton on the basis of four months, on board of cars at their works at Point Breeze, Philadelphia.</p>

Remittances were made by Bigharn during the same time from collections made, both on account prior to Febrmuy, 1879, and also subsequently thereto. These remittances were always credited as directed by Bigharn. Sometimes he would direct the credit to be made on the old consignment account and it was so done, and sometimes to the new account and it was so done. Where no direction was given the credit was applied by the plaintiffs to the old account until it was extinguished. The total amount of payments made on the consignment account under the agreement on which defendant was surety was $2,708.16, leaving a balance owing on the phosphate shipped to Bigharn during the summer of 1879, under this agreement, of $3,453.84.
