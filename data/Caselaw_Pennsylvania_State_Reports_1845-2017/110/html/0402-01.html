    <p class="summary" id="b419-6" data-blocks='[["BL_419.7",419,[116,1141,1188,601]]]'>A citation was awarded, and Rank filed an answer in which he admitted that he was appointed guardian of the estate of the said Eliza in 1858, but averred that he ought not to be required to file his account, for the reason that he made a settlement with the said Eliza, his ward, when she became of age, and took her receipt and release joined by her husband, which was duly acknowledged by them ; that therebty she, joined with her husband, acknowledged that they received on the twentieth day of March, A. D. 1865, the sum of $1,773.20 from the said guardian in full satisfaction and payment of her and their full share of the real and personal estate of her said father, John M. Rank, deceased, and therein released and discharged him of and from his said guardianship, and prayed to be dismissed with his reasonable costs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b419-7" data-blocks='[["BL_419.8",419,[112,1752,1192,524]]]'>To this answer petitioners replied that the said Eliza was a minor when the money was paid over and the release executed and delivered, viz.: on March 20th, 1865; that both petitioners were at that time without business experience and placed implicit confidence in Rank; that nineteen years later it was discovered that a full payment had not been made to the ward; that petitioners do not seek to recover a second time money that was actually paid, although the said Eliza was a minor at that time, but claim that Eliza is entitled' to an account so that she may recover from her guardian the -balance that may justly be coming to her after the same has been properly adjusted.</p>

It seems to us, therefore, that the case should be regarded in the same light as if no settlement had been made and release executed. Then nothing short of the presumption of payment would preclude the ward from having an account. In the case of a legacy that is twenty years : Appeal of Bentely’s Exrs., 3 Out., 500. And as the guardian’s liability arises out of a trust, and is founded also on his bond, the presumption of payment only should defeat this proceeding. That had not arisen when these proceedings were commenced.</p>

Taking the account which the guardian furnished the ward as containing all the items which enter into the settlement (and that is not disputed by either party), a proper decree can be made by this court, doing justice to the ward, and with the certainty of not doing injustice to the guardian.

This citation was awarded in June, 1884, being nineteen years after she became of full age. During all this time the parties were living within a few miles of each other. The guardian now testifies that the books containing the account of his guardianship have been lost, and that he cannot now file an intelligent account. ” No sufficient cause is shown for this great delay of the ward in asking that one be filed. The neglect is so great as to bar her right to now demand an account: Gress’ Appeal, <em>2 </em>Harris, 463; Bones’ Appeal, 3 Casey, 492.
