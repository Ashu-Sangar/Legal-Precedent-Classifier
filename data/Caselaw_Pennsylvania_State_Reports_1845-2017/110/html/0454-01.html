The notice is dated Sept. 2d, 1879. There was no oral testimony to show when or bjr whom the notice was attached, to the return, and the return itself makes no mention of the paper.

The reserved question was whether, under the facts as presented by the record, there can be any recovery. We see no error in the ruling upon this point. The record shows the receipt of the notice before the return of the writ. The precise time of the return is not therefore of much importance. In the absence of all proof there is no presumption that it was returned before the return da3r, which it was conceded was on the 25th of August. The record also shows that a <em>venditioni exponas </em>was subsequenth1, issued to sell the property levied upon-under the <em>fieri facias, </em>and the following return to said writ: “ November 10th, 1879. After $220 paid to plaintiff the writ was stayed by order of the plaintiff.” It thus appears the sheriff paid no attention to the landlord’s claim, but collected a portion of the money, paid it over to the plaintiff in the execution and returned the writ st.a3red. Whether this was the result of ignorance or design is not material, as the effect upon the rights of the landlord is the same. The sheriff had notice of the landlord’s claim and he disregarded it at his <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>peril. It makes but little difference when it was given. Anytime before the return of the <em>vend, ex., </em>and the payment of the money over to the execution creditor would have been sufficient. There was no time when the property was not bound by the lien of the levy after the levy had been made. The <em>venditioni exponas </em>was but a continuation of the <em>fieri facias. </em>The sheriff knew that the landlord claimed his rent out of the proceeds of the sale of the property levied upon, and that is enough to fix his liability.</p>

The act prohibits the plaintiff from staying a writ under such circumstances without such consent.
