The correctness of this ruling is the controlling question in the case. If there was no error in that, the questions involved in the subordinate specifications become wholly unimportant.</p>

To reach these calls, necessarily increases the quantity of land. It is alleged that this excess in quantity together with the enchanced value of the land prompted speculative cupidity and led to the location of later warrants, covering the northerly as well as the southerly portion of the “ Nelson ” survey, and hence the litigation that ensued. The only question that' ever did or ever could possibly arise between the “Nelson” and these much later surveys was that of its location. Neither of the parties, in any of the several trials that have been had, appears to have contested the title of the others on any other ground. Their respective titles were regularly derived from the Commonwealth, and each claim, upon its face, appeared to be complete. The question was solely one of location. As between the “ Nelson ” and “ Carskadden ” surveys, both parties asserted that the northerly line of the Nelson was the southerly line of the Cray, Martin and Tompson .surveys for which it called. If the Nelson was limited to 130 perches south of that line, there was room for the Carskadden warrant. If the Nelson had a right to reach the Taylor land on its southerly call, and the White Oak, at northwest corner of the Taylor tract, Called for in its western line, then there was no <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>room for the Carskadden warrant, and the latter, however perfect it might appear to be, had no unappropriated land to which it could attach. The <em>status </em>of the case is well expressed in one of the cases referred to, Dreer <em>v. </em>Carskadden, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%2038" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Wright 38">12 Wright, 38</a>, in which tlie same question of location was in issue. In that case the verdict and judgment were in favor of the Carskadden location, but it was reversed by this court, for reasons that will appear in the opinion of Chief Justice Woodward.</p>
    <p id="b40-4" data-blocks='[["BL_40.5",40,[221,757,1194,303]]]'>The learned president of the Common Pleas was clearly right in admitting the records of the Circuit Court and in holding that the concurrent verdicts and judgments, evidenced thereby, definitively settled the question of location, as between the Nelson and the Carskadden warrants and surveys, in favor of the former, and that the present plaintiff, being in privity of estate, is forever concluded.</p>
    <p id="b40-5" data-blocks='[["BL_40.6",40,[214,1062,1195,1080]]]'>The general rule, to which this case is no exception, is that judgments are conclusive between parties and privies: 1 Greenleaf Ev. Sect. 522, et seq.; 4 Minor’s Inst. 718; Peterson <em>v. </em>Lothrop, 10 Casey, 223; Adams <em>v. </em>Barns, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20Mass.%20365" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="17 Mass. 365">17 Mass., 365</a>. The term <em>parties </em>is of course well understood as including all, directly interested in the subject matter, who have a right to defend or control the proceedings and appeal: Giltinan <em>v. </em>Strong, 14 P. F. S., 242; and courts will even look beyond the nominal party and treat, as the real party, him whose interests are involved in the issue, and hold him concluded by any judgment that may be rendered: Peterson <em>v. </em>Lothrop, <em>supra. Privies </em>are those whose relationship to the same right of property is mutual or successive. In other words, privity denotes mutual or successive relationship to the right of property, title or estate. It may be in blood, in law, or in estate. A purchaser at sheriff’s sale, for example, is in privity to the defendant’s title; and, for like reason, we have no doubt a purchaser at treasurer’s sale is in privity to the title, if any, that, is divested by the sale and passes to him. In actions of ejectment, two verdicts and judgments thereon, upon the same title, are conclusive of the title between the parties and their privies, assignees or vendees. The bar of two such judgments is a statutory estoppel between privies as well as parties: Blackmore <em>v. </em>Gregg, <a href="/watts/10/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Watts 222" data-case-ids="1850939" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0222-01">10 Watts, 222</a>; Drexel <em>v. </em>Man, Jr. 2 Barr, 267.</p>

The last two judgments in the Circuit Court were entered June 28th, 1875, and the treasurer’s sale, on which plaintiff relies, was made nearly a year thereafter. The purchaser at that sale had record notice that the Carskadden warrant had been laid on previously appropriated land, and therefore those claiming under it had no title. It is conceded that the Nelson tract was duly assessed for 1871 and 1875 and the taxes paid. Upon what principle then should the title to the latter be divested in favor of a purchaser who had at least constructive notice of these facts?</p>

The taxes on the land in question having been paid, the sale under the assessment against the “ Carskadden ” gave the purchaser no better title than that warrant and survey could confer. He conceded that the title so acquired by the purchaser at treasurer’s sale would enable plaintiff to try the question of the true location of the “Nelson,” and whether such location would leave room for the “ Carskadden,” <em>provided </em>that was an open question; but, inasmuch as that question had been definitively .settled and closed by the judgments in the Circuit Court, not only as to the Carskaddens, but as to all persons succeeding to their title, whether by their act or by operation of law, they were concluded.</p>
