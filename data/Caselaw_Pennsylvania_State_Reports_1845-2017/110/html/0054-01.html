By this Act it was provided that when the bridge was erected “ the property shall vest in said company and their successors; ” it also fixed a schedule of tolls for the bridge. Subsequently the bridge company purchased a lot near the east end of the bridge and erected thereon a dwelling house for the use and occupancy of the toll gatherer. At the distance of 155 feet from the west end of the bridge, the Schuylkill Navigation Company’s canal is spanned by a bridge. The original bridge over the canal was constructed by the canal company, and subsequently under a contract with the canal company the bridge company agreed “to take it off the hands of the Schuylkill Navigation Company.” The fridge company afterward widened this canal bridge and reí <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>built it, using in part the old foundation walls of the canal company’s bridge.

As the state conferred the privilege upon the bridge company to take tolls not exceeding ten per cent, on the cost of the bridge, it is not competent now for the bridge company to claim damages for more than that amount, simply because it has illegally taken more than it had a right to take. The canal company could not relieve itself from the obligation to maintain the bridge over the canal by entering into a contract with the bridge company. The county can compel the canal company to keep their bridge in repair without assuming the contract of the bridge company, and it is wrong to make it pay for what is of no use to it.

    <p id="b74-7" data-blocks='[["BL_74.13",74,[248,1590,1198,341]]]'>No question arises as to the power of the county of Montgomery to take the bridge for public use and to declare it a county bridge free from tolls, under the Act of Assembly of May 8th, 1876, P. L., 131, and the supplement thereto of May 3d, 1878, P, L., 41. Such taking, however, involved the ne-. cessity of making compensation to the owners, and it was as to the proper measure of damages that all the difficulty occurred in the court below.</p>
    <p id="b74-8" data-blocks='[["BL_74.14",74,[247,1940,1189,262]]]'>The defendant contended, as appears by their eleventh point, “ the measure of damages is the cost of the construction of a new bridge at the time of the taking by the county, similar to the present one,- diminished by an amount in proportion to such cost equal to the depreciation of the old bridge from wear and decay.”</p>
    <p id="b74-9" data-blocks='[["BL_74.15",74,[246,2202,1199,263]],["BL_75.1",75,[115,410,1190,1492]]]'>The learned judge very properly declined to- affirm this point. The vice of it consists in the fact that it substituted one of the elements of damages for the measure of damages itself. The bridge structure, the stone, iron and wood, was but a portion of the property owned by the bridge company,' and taken bj^ the county. There were the franchises of the <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>company, including the right to take toll, and these were as effectually taken as was the bridge itself. Hence, to measure the damages by the mere cost of building the bridge would be to deprive the company of any compensation for the destruction of its franchises. The latter can no more be taken without compensation than can 'its tangible, corporeal property. Their value necessarily depends upon their productiveness. If they yield no money return over expenditures, they would possess little if any present value. If, however, they yield a revenue over and above expenses, they possess a present value, the amount of which depends in a measure upon the excess of revenue. Hence it is manifest, that the income from the bridge was a necessary and proper subject of inquiry before the jury. The court permitted' the plaintiff to prove the receipts for, say, five years before the taking, but denied the defendants permission to extend the inquiry back to the time of the organization of the company. We perceive no error in this ruling. It was competent to go into this investigation for a few years immediately preceding the taking, but I am unable to see what light it would have thrown upon the matter to show the receipts forty or fifty year's ago, when Norristown and Bridgeport were comparatively small villages. Had the bridge been non-productive at remote periods, it would in no sense affect its value now. Its value at the time of the taking is the rule. Nor is the value of the bridge to the county a material inquiry. The county may have made a mistake; the bridge may not be worth to the county what the'jury have fixed as the damages. The county might perhaps have built a new bridge at another street for half the money, but it did not do so ; it elected to take the property of the bridge company, and the inquiry under such circumstances is not what it is worth to the party taking, but its value to the company that is deprived of its property.</p>

They were built by the company for the convenience and proper use of the bridge and the travelling public who used it. Hence it was not error to instruct the jury that if they found the canal bridge and toll-house as now there are a necessary part and parcel of the main bridge as a convenient and necessary approach to it, the plaintiffs were entitled to be compensated for the taking thereof. The jury allowed damages for both, and could not well have done otherwise.</p>

One bridge may be of little value, because unproductive; another, of no greater size and cost, by reason of its location may be extremely valuable. ; The property and ■franchises of the bridge company are represented by its stock, and the market value-of the stock maybe said to represent the market value of the property taken, as nearly as it can be ascertained. If the market value of this company’s stock had been the test, the probability is that the defendants would have been more dissatisfied with the verdict than they are at present, and would have been invoking some other rule to relieve them therefrom. As to the particular use of this bridge, it is sufficient to say that the use referred to is the only one of .of which the bridge is capable, and if the damages cannot be measured by that use, they can be measured by no other.
