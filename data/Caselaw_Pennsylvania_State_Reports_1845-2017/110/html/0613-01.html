It was necessary thus to exhibit the charter that the court might be informed as to the objects of the corporation, the powers with which it was originally invested, and the changes proposed. As expressed in the Act, the objects are, “ to improve the moral, mental and social condition of the members of the lodges under its jurisdiction, and to prevent strikes among all classes by exhausting all honorable means in its power for such an end.” The principal powers of the corporation are “ to institute such subordinate lodges as it may see fit, under such rules, by-laws and regulations ” as it may establish; “ to create, hold and disburse a beneficiary fund, for the relief of the members and their families of the lodges established by the corporation, under such regulations as may be adopted by the corporation ; provided that such fund shall at no time exceed five thousand dollars.”</p>

    <p id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[260,546,1193,1568]]]'>We naturally inquire, what is the <em>“Supreme, Lodge” </em>that is thus introduced into the proposed amendments, and invested with power to at least participate in making rules, by-laws and regulations for the government of a Pennsylvania corporation and its subordinate lodges ? Is it an incorporated or unincorporated-association? If the former, when and where was it incorporated, and what are its powers ? If the latter, who compose the association, and where is it located ? Neither the petition, nor anything else on the record, furnishes an answer to any of these inquiries. If the “Supreme Lodge ” is a foreign corporation, that is, a corporation not created by the laws of -this.- state, or an unincorporated association of individuals located outside the state, it will scarcely be claimed that the court below, in the exercise of a sound legal discretion, could approve the proposed amendments by which the Grand Lodge and subordinate lodges established by it, in this state, might in-any degree be subjected-to' the- control of such foreign corporation or association. In the absence of any information on the subject, the court had no right to infer that the Supreme Lodge was a Pennsylvania corporation. There is nothing on the record to warrant any such inference. An application to alter or amend a charter is one of those proceedings in which nothing should be left to inference or conjecture. All the facts necessary to enable the court to act understanding^ should be embodied in the application or petition. If the petitioner had taken the same pains to set forth the charter or articles óf association of the Supreme Lodge as it did to exhibit its own charter, the fact, perhaps, would have been apparent that the Supreme Lodge is a foreign corporation or association, and that the- court was asked to do what the legislature never intended. The granting of corporate franchises is a sovereign act; and, so far as the power has been delegated to the courts, it should never be exercised in a perfunctory manner, nor until all the facts, necessary to a full understanding of the application in all its bearings, are dul ypresented.</p>

In the proposed amendment the words, “and elsewhere,” are added immediately after the word “ states,” thus entirely removing <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>the limitation and giving a world-wide field of operations to the corporation. If the public interest and the interests of the membership of subordinate lodges are to be consulted, the proposed amendment is one of more than doubtful propriety, if not also beyond trie power of the court to approve.</p>
    <p id="b637-6" data-blocks='[["BL_637.6",637,[118,654,1189,125]]]'>Other reasons have been strongly urged against the decree, but it is unnecessary to notice them. Enough has been said to show that it should not have been made.</p>
    <p id="b637-7" data-blocks='[["BL_637.7",637,[118,786,1189,340]]]'>We have no doubt as to the standing of the exceptants in the court below. As members of a subordinate lodge of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, liable to be affected by the proposed changes, they were entitled to be heard, and it does not appear that their right was even questioned in the court below. The writ sued out by “Thomas Gr. Sample <em>on </em>his own behalf and as agent for other exceptants,” was quite sufficient to remove the record into this court for review.</p>
    <p id="b637-8" data-blocks='[["BL_637.8",637,[383,1134,924,131]]]'>Decree reversed and petition dismissed, and it is ordered that the costs, including the costs of this writ, be paid by the petitioner.</p>
