There is no trace of any authority from the board of directors to receive such deposits. But when Mr. Flenniken, as cashier, pledged the bonds for the debt of the bank to Ira B. McVay &amp; Co., the matter became a transaction of the bank; the fraud of Mr. Flenniken became the fraud of the bank, and his concealment of the pledge became the bank’s concealment. The bonds were subsequently sold by McVay &amp; Co., and the proceeds went to pay the defendant bank’s debts. The bank cannot retain the fruits of the crime and repudiate the fraud of its agent.

It was not until the month of April, 1876, that the plaintiff was informed that the bonds had been pledged and sold, and the proceeds credited to the bank. It is true the plaintiff called at the bank in 1874, and at several other times subsequently to get his bonds and take them away. But he was always put off with excuses; he was informed that the bonds had been sent to Pittsburgh for safe keeping. In the meantime the bank continued to pay him the interest, even after the bonds had been sold. All this was a fraud and concealment, well calculated to throw the plaintiff off his guard. Repeated promises were made to him bjr the cashier to get the bonds from Pittsburgh and return them. But they never came. Performance of the promise was evaded and fresh promises substituted. It may be that these were circumstances of suspicion, calculated to alarm a prudent man. If we concede this to be so it does not help the defendant bank. It cannot take advantage of its own wrong. Holding the plaintiff’s property and having fraudulently converted it to its own use, and concealed that fact from him, we will not be astute to hold the plaintiff to knowledge which he did not possess.
