It was sold by the sheriff, A. becoming the purchaser, leaving a balance of the purchase money unpaid. Before the Auditor appointed to distribute the funds in the hands of B.’s administrator among his creditors, A. testified that at the time he took the mortgage, he gave (he thought) a bill of sale or other paper, transferring his title to B. No such paper was recorded. The Auditor rejected A.’s claim for the balance due him, holding that B.’s interest being an equitable one, A. had rescinded the original contract by his purchase at the sheriff’s sale and he could not come in for a' pro rata share of the fund: ■</p>

Wright died intestate-'on September 2d, 1881; his administrator filed his account showing a balance, after payment of preferred debts, of <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>$2,687.30. This account was confirmed and an Auditor was appointed to distribute this balance among Wright’s creditors. The Auditor found the estate to be insolvent. J. D. Wolfe presented a claim before him for a balance due him on certain promissory notes, given by Wright, for the purchase money of a certain leasehold interest in ten acres of land in McKean county together with two oil wells, machinery fixtures, tools, etc. These notes were secured by a mortgage on the said leasehold for $4,668.75, dated February 23d, 1881, which was duly recorded. Wolfe testified that at the time he took said mortgage, he gave (he thought) a bill of sale or other paper transferring his title to Wright, but there was no title of record from Wolfe to Wright for said leasehold. The notes, for which said mortgage was given as security, were six in number and bore even date with said mortgage. At the time of Wright’s death, three of these notes, amounting with interest to $3,081.02, were unpaid; as they fell due they were protested for non-payment. Wolfe then issued a scire facias on the said mortgage, caused the property to be sold by the sheriff, bought in the property himself and receipted for the proceeds of the sale upon the writ. This amounted with interest to $1,024.87 and it was the balance still due, viz: $2,056.15, that constituted the present claim.</p>

But when the legal title has been conveyed to the vendee, the contract is completely comsummated, and the term rescission is inapplicable. The burden was oil the objectors to show that the legal title had been retained by Wolfe, and that he had divested himself of the right to proceed further for unpaid purchase money by his own act. Wolfe had a perfect right to rely on his claim for the notes due, and was entitled to his pro rata share of the fund for distribution in the absence of affirmative evidence that he had done some act amounting in law to an estoppel. From the nature of the transaction, it is more reasonable to suppose that Wolfe assigned his legal title to the leasehold than that he retained by executory stipulation any legal title thereto at the time when he took. the mortgage for purchase money.</p>

And we urge that the Auditor was justified in so finding. No deed was on record for the property; no evidence of the delivery of one was produced before the Auditor; and whatever title passed from Wolfe to Wright at time of sale was contemporaneously reconveyed to Wolfe as security for the purchase money.</p>

      <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>We gather from the Auditor’s report, that in February 1881, appellant sold and assigned to Victor C. Wright, appellee’s intestate, a mining lease, known, in business circles, as an “ oil lease,” together with machinery, fixtures, engines, tools &amp;c., on the premises; and, for part of the purchase money received from Wright six promissory notes, aggregating over $4,500, secured by a leasehold mortgage of the mining lease, machinery, &amp;c., vested in him by virtue of the assignment. In other words, Wolfe sold and transferred his interest in certain real estate and took from his vendee a mortgage thereof for residue of purchase money. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it must be assumed that Wolfe transferred all the interest he had in the land, machinery, &amp;c., embraced in the lease, and that the only security he had for the consideration money was the notes and mortgage of the lease, etc. There is not a particle of testimony tending to show anything else than that the contract was an executed and not an executory one. The case differs widely from the ordinary sale on articles of agreement in which the vendee acquires merely an equitable' interest in the laud — a right to a conveyance of the legal title upon paying or securing, as may be agreed upon, the residue of purchase money. In the meantime the vendor retains the legal title as security for the unpaid purchase money; and, if on a lien therefor, he sells and purchases the equitable interest of his vendee, the contract is thereby rescinded and he is precluded from recourse to the vendee personally for the balance of purchase money that may not be paid by the proceeds of sale. This principle, applicable to executory contracts for the sale of lands is recognized in many of our cases, as far back at least as Purviance <em>v. </em>Lemmon, 16 S. &amp; R., 292, among which are, Love <em>v. </em>Jones, <a href="/watts/4/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts 465" data-case-ids="1842704" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0465-01">4 Watts, 465</a>; Horbach <em>v. </em>Reiley, 7 Barr, 81; Vierheller's Appeal, 12 Harris, 105; Bradley <em>v. </em>O’Donnell et al., 8 Casey, 279; P. &amp; S. Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Jones, 9 P. F. S., 433; Zeigler, Baker &amp; Co.’s Appeal, 19 P. F. S., 471. In McCay <em>v. </em>Orr, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20W.N.C.%20524" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 W.N.C. 524">11 W. N. C., 524</a>, the same principle was applied to an executory contract for sale of personal property. The authorities above cited,- and others that might be added, firmly establish the principle, that while the legal estate of the vendor and the equitable estate of the vendee may each be the subject of levy and sale by their respective creditors without affecting the other, a sale by the vendor for unpaid purchase money passes the whole estate; and, as was said in Bradley <em>v. </em>O’Donnell, <em>supra, </em>the “ re-union of the equitable with the legal estate is virtually a rescission of the contract.” This is always the case when the vendor himself becomes purchaser.</p>

An absolute transfer of the lease was made by appellant. He reserved to himself no interest therein. The mortgage he took was his only security. Having exhausted that without realizing the full amount of his claim, he has a right of recourse against the estate of his debtor for the residue. The learned Auditor and court below, failing to note the distinction that has always been observed between executed and executory contracts, refused to let him participate in the distribution.</p>
