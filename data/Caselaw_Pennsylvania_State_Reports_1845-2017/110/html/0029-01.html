In the former, there was a clause in the contract that in case any difference or dispute should arise touching the amount of any loss, there should be a reference of the same, and no action at law maintainable unless the amount should be first so ascertained. And it was held, that a failure to resort to the arbitration clause was no barrier to a suit, as it seemed from an offer of evidence made on the trial and objected to, that one ground of defence was, that there had been a breach of another condition of the contract; and the defendants must show not only that a dispute had arisen, touching the amount of loss, but also that they admitted the validity of the policy and their liability under it, and that the only question was, as to the extent of the loss.</p>

But the principle recognized in both cases seems to be, that an agreement for general arbitration cannot be set up as a condition precedent to the right to bring suit, as it would oust the court of all jurisdiction, and (as was said in Gray <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%2041" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Watts 41">4 Watts, 41</a>, in explanation of such a ruling) “it is not to be supposed that parties waive the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals of the country unless they expressly exclude them.”</p>

There is no evidence that at the time this suit was brought the company disputed anything save the extent of the loss. They made an offer to settle for $500, and thereby admitted their liability. Upon'the trial an objection of a serious nature was raised in regard to the admission of evi<a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>dence under the pleadings, as to an encumbrance, but it did not appear that the fact of a false warranty was raised as an objection to the claims before the suit was commenced; if, in fact, it was not entirely waived on the parts of the defendants. What occurred was first at the trial, and we do not understand that something done by the defendants after the suit was instituted, in the line of defending the liability of the suit itself, and in objecting to the legality of evidence offered as part of plaintiff’s case, can operate to estop them from interposing against the plaintiff’s recovery, a condition precedent to his right to sue at all.</p>

At the time the action was commenced below there had not been an award under the foregoing clause, nor had any steps been taken by either party to procure one. The court below held that under the policy an award was a condition precedent to the right to sue.</p>

It will be observed, 1st, that the arbitrators are to be chosen at the request of either party in writing, and, 2d, that the condition <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>that no suit shall be commenced until an award shall be obtained fixing the amount of the claim, uses the language, “in the manner hereinbefore provided.” This means, if it means anything, that upon the written request of the company, the plaintiff shall join them in choosing arbitrators, and procuring an award, before he shall commence suit. It was the right of either party to demand arbitration ; it was the right of either party to waive it, and the defendant, having made no such demand, must be presumed to have waived it. The one clause in the policy must be read in connection with the other; the one refers to the other, and relates to the same subject matter.</p>
    <p id="b52-4" data-blocks='[["BL_52.5",52,[249,949,1207,1308]]]'>In Mentz <em>v. </em>Armenia Fire Insurance Co., 29 P. F. S., 478, there was a condition in the policy which absolutely required an arbitration to settle the loss in case of dispute, and that no action should be brought until after such award was made. It was held, however, not to be binding. It was said by Mr. 'Justice Shaeswood: “Such an agreement,'like any other agreement of reference, is revocable, though the party may subject himself to an action of damages for the revocation.. It is not in the power of the parties thus to oust the courts of their general jurisdiction, any more than they have to a personal covenant that they are not to be responsible for a breach of it: Furnivall <em>v. </em>Coombes, 5 Mann. <em>&amp; </em>G., 736. The Supreme .Court of the United States have recognized the soundness of this general principle in Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Morse, 20 Wallace, 445, in which they held that an agreement by a foreign insurance company, in conformity with a State statute, that if sued in a State court they would not remove the suit into the Federal Court, was invalid.” Flaherty <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.N.C.%20352" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 W.N.C. 352">1 W. N. C., 352</a>, was cited as sustaining the opposite view. The condition of the policy was not given in that case, and as reported it is of very little value in this connection, for the reason that we are left in considerable doubt as to what the case really was. In German-American Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Steiger, 13 Insurance Law Journal, 546, the condition in the policy was 'substantially similar to the one in this case, and it was held “.that .such written request was a condition precedent to the appraisal and award, and that' there not having been a written request by either party for an appraisal, such appraisal and award were not necessary under the conditions in order to entitle the plaintiff to a recovery.”</p>
