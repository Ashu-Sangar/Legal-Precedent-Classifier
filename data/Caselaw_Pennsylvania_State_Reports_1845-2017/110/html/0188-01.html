Now there is no pretence that Swartz gave any written promise respecting the note until July 25th, 1877. On that date lie gave the Bank a writing containing the following: “H. D. Groff’s note, $1,350, due July 11th, 1876, if he renews 90 days date July 11th, for $1,250, indorsed by S. Groff, charge old note to me and Cr. new note to my account, and I promise to indorse it.” This paper also contained a promise respecting two other notes. The same date he gave the Bank a guaranty as follows: “I hereby guarantee the payment of all notes drawn by Diller &amp; Groff, and indorsed by me, now held by First National Bank, Lancaster, Pa., either matured or to mature, July 25th, 1877.” The cashier testifies that he asked for the second paper, told Swartz who were the guarantors 'of these notes, and then he signed the additional guaranty. The accounts were given in evidence, and oral testimony respecting the accounts.</p>
    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[277,1312,1191,427]]]'>No reason appears why the testimony of Mr. Harner should be disbelieved; if believed, in connection with the written testimony, the jury ought to have found, that in consideration of Zahm’s guaranty the Bank did not protest the note, and that Swartz neither waived protest nor did any act to continue his liability as indorser. The ease differs from its former aspect. Material allegations by the defendant are either not proved or disproved. Acts by Swartz, done aftm- the guaranty by Zahm, do not affect him or others as if they had been done before.</p>
    <p id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.6",210,[277,1748,1191,348]]]'>In the general charge the court properly remarked that the facts were to be found by the jury from tire evidence submitted; but followed by affirming the defendant’s third point: “Under all the evidence in the case, the verdict must be for the defendants.” It is quite immaterial whether the evidence was submitted when the jury were instructed to render a verdict for defendants. As it was the duty of the court to permit the jury to find the facts, that instruction was error.</p>
    <p id="b210-7" data-blocks='[["BL_210.7",210,[277,2096,1189,391]],["BL_211.1",211,[89,438,1188,179]]]'>If the note was not protested in consequence of the guaranty of Zahm, and if the guaranty by Swartz was given at the request of Harner as an additional guaranty after Zahm’s, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. The plaintiff asked instruction to this effect by its first and second [joints, but so framed them that the court was justified in the refusal. It did not follow from the fact alone that the note was not protested in consequence of Zahm’s guaranty, that the plaintiff could recover, and therefore its first point was denied. So, the assumed fact <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>in its second point might be true and not absolutely control, the veidiet. Had adequate instruction been given upon the material facts referred to in these points, the first and second assignments would be passed without remark.</p>
    <p id="b211-6" data-blocks='[["BL_211.6",211,[90,613,1186,612]]]'>Zahm guaranteed the note without protest, and by acceptance thereof the implied agreement was that the indorsers should be released. There is no evidence to warrant a finding that such notice was given to Swartz as continued his liability as indorser. Mere knowledge of non-payment is not notice— the Bank took no steps to hold the defendant as indorser by protest of the note or otherwise. The- subsequent guaranty by Swartz, if supported by a good consideration, created a liability that could be enforced in case the Bank, having used reasonable diligence, had failed to collect the note from the makers or prior guarantor. Only in the event that Swartz should be found liable as indorser, was it the right of the Bank to appropriate any part of his account to payment of the note. The ninth, tenth and twelfth assignments are sustained.</p>
    <p id="b211-7" data-blocks='[["BL_211.7",211,[90,1225,1184,132]]]'>As it does not appear in the paper book whether the deposition of Swartz contained anything pertinent to the issue, the fourth assignment is not considered.</p>
    <p id="b211-8" data-blocks='[["BL_211.8",211,[86,1358,1189,906]]]'>The first and second assignments are not sustained. The questions objected to were calculated to elicit the state of Oilier &amp; Groff’s account at the date of the maturity of the note and afterwards. It appeared that when the note matured the balance to their credit was $25.82, and the total amount of the deposits afterwards was much less than the note. These deposits, numbering six, were made at intervals within thirty days from the maturity of the note, and' were paid out on a larger number of checks, at intervals, within the same time. At no date after July 11th, 1877, at the close of business hours, did they have a balance exceeding $800. It is unlikely that those small deposits were intended by Diller &amp; Groff to apply on the note. Had payment of their checks been refused, would they have continued making the deposits? We think the circumstances clearly bring this case within the doctrine of Peoples’ Bank <em>v. </em>Legrand, <a href="/pa/103/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="103 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="449084" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0309-01">103 Pa. St., 309</a>. Here, though the action is against a guarantor, as respects appropriation of deposits by the principal debtor in the bank, his claims are not superior to those of an indorser. The ruling in the Commercial N. Bank <em>v. </em>Henninger, <a href="/pa/105/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="105 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="454243" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0496-01">105 Pa. St., 496</a>, was upon dissimilar facts.</p>
