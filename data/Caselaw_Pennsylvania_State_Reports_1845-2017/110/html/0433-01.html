    <p class="summary" id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[262,941,1193,820]]]'>“The debt, interest and costs of these three judgments, amounting to $5,314.05, has been paid into court, and the question is now as to attorney’s commission. The notes provide for five per cent, attorney’s commission and judgment has been so confessed. The judgments have been entered by an attorney who has taken on himself the professional responsibility of seeing that this was promptly and correctly done; and now the additional responsibility of receiving and paying over the money, and securing himself in the future from any question of having paid over the money. Is it reasonably required of him to do this for nothing? I think not; and if .not, must his client pay what the defendant himself contracted to pay, and for which they now severally have judgment, if attorney’s commission be refused. There has been no payment of the money to them or tender of money personally to them. I am unab.le to see any difference between this case and Daly <em>v. </em>Maitland, 7 Norris, 384, and the plaintiffs should be allowed enough to pay their counsel.</p>

They were dated November 26th, 1883, and were payable at one year after date with interest. On November 26th, 1884, being the date of the maturity of the notes, the defendant by leave of'the court paid into court the full amount of debt, interest and costs on all the judgments. He refused to pay any attorney’s commissions because he was ready and willing to pay the whole amount due, thus rendering unnecessary any services by an attorney in the way of collection. The learned court below allowed a commission of 2-| per cent, for <em>the </em>attorney, and in this there was error. To permit such a practice as this, where the defendant offers to pay all that is due at the maturity of the obligation, would be sanctioning an intolerable and unreasonable oppression. There is no occasion whatever in such a case for the service of an attorney for the purpose of collection, and it was no part of the contract in this case that any commission should be paid for the mere entering of the judgment. We said in Imler <em>v. </em>Imler, 13 Norris, on p. 375: “ It was never intended, nor can we permit such a clause to <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>be used to compel a debtor to pay attorney’s commissions where the latter does not dispute the claim and pays at maturity.” In Johnson <em>v. </em>Marsh, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Leg.%20Int.%2092" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="42 Leg. Int. 92">42 Leg. Int., 92</a>, we refused to allow commissions even after execution issued, because there was no satisfactory evidence of a demand for payment before entering judgment, although the debt had passed maturity. Once more we condemn this practice and trust we may not again have occasion to pronounce upon it.</p>
