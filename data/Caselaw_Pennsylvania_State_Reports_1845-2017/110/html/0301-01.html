Christy is, on the face of it, clear, perfect and intelligible in the conveyance of the “one undivided moiety, or half part, of the following described tract of land,.....containing 131 acres and 108 perches therein.” A difficulty arises from the fact that, at the time of the execution and delivery of this deed, Evered Oles and Mary Oles, his wife, each was the owner of the one undivided moiety, or half part of the whole tract. This produces a latent ambiguity as to which moiety, that of the husband, or that of the wife, or a moiety composed <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>of the half part of the interests of the husband and wife was intended to be conveyed.</p>

On that day Oles and wife united in a deed conveying an undivided moiety of the farm to Jacob <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>A. Christy, Esq., who by deed of even date and for same consideration conveyed the same undivided moiety to Evered Oles, one of his vendors. After continuing in possession over forty-five years, Oles devised the farm to his nephew, William S. Oles, who afterwards bound himself to convey the same in fee to plaintiff in error. In this action of covenant, brought by William S. Oles for purchase money, the only defence is that neither the devisor nor his devisee was ever sole seised of the land, and hence the latter is unable to convey according to the terms of his contract. It is contended there is nothing in the deed of Oles and wife to Christy, nor any evidence <em>dehors </em>the deed, from which it can be determined what moiety was conveyed or intended to be conveyed ; in other words, there is nothing to indicate with sufficient certainty whether it was the undivided moiety owned by Mrs. Oles in her own right, or that which her husband appears to have acquired by purchase from his sister-in-law, Mrs. Crozier, or whether it was an undivided moiety composed of half the separate interests of each.</p>

The learned president of the Common Pleas so construed the deeds and directed a verdict in favor of plaintiff below for the unpaid purchase money. In this we think he was clearly right. It cannot be presumed the parties to the first mentioned deed intended to do a vain and utterly useless act, as would have been the case had they conveyed the undivided moiety of the husband to Christy to be by him immediately reconveyed to his vendor. On the other hand, if they intended to vest the entire title in the husband, we can readily understand why the wife’s moiety should be first vested in Christy and then conveyed by him to Mr. Oles. This construction of the deed also harmonizes with the recitals of title therein contained. After describing the farm by courses and distances, it is in substance declared to be the same land of which Richard Bell died seised, testate, etc., and which became vested, as to one moiety thereof, in his daughter Mrs. Oles, and, as to the other moiety, in her sister, Mrs. Crozier, thus tracing title, as to one moiety, into Mrs. Oles, one of the vendors, and, as to the other, into Mrs. Crozier, a stranger to the conveyance in question. The deed is entirely silent as to any personal interest of Mr. Oles in the land, and it is only by resorting to the deed of Mrs. Crozier and her husband that we are informed of the previous pur<a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>chase by Oles of her undivided moiety of the farm. By thus reciting title in Mrs. Oles to the exact interest conveyed, and virtually ignoring title in her husband, the vendors indicated their intention to convey the undivided interest of the wife, and we have no doubt such was the fact. This view is further sustained by the fact that Mrs. Oles signed the receipt for purchase money.</p>
    <p id="b321-6" data-blocks='[["BL_321.6",321,[137,713,1182,381]]]'>In some exceptional cases, extrinsic evidence may be offered to show the intent of grantors in a deed of conveyance, but when, as in the case before us, their intention is expressed with sufficient clearness in the deed itself, evidence of extraneous facts is inadmissible. Such evidence was neither offered nor required in this ease. We are satisfied the deed of Oles and wife to Christy was properly construed in accordance with the general rule that a deed must be construed <em>ex viseeribus suis.</em>
