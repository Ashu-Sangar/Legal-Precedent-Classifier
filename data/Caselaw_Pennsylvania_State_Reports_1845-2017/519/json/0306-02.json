        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nSTOUT, Justice.\nIn this case we consider an insurer\u2019s duty to defend under a comprehensive general liability policy.\nThe question arises out of the refusal of Nationwide Insurance Company to defend its insured, Gene\u2019s Restaurant, Inc., against a complaint in trespass alleging the willful and malicious assault and beating of one of its patrons, Patricia A. Aschenback. Nationwide refused to defend on the ground of noncoverage. Gene\u2019s Restaurant then filed an action in assumpsit against Nationwide seeking to recover the amount it had expended for costs and fees incurred in defending the trespass action. An arbitration panel found in favor of Gene\u2019s Restaurant. In the de novo, non-jury trial which followed upon appeal, the Court of Common Pleas found in favor of Nationwide and held, as a matter of law, that an insurer may base its decision to defend solely on the allegations of the Complaint. The Superior Court affirmed, 362 Pa.Superior Ct. 642, 520 A.2d 1219, and so do we.\nAn insurer\u2019s duty to defend an action against the insured is measured, in the first instance, by the allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings ...\n[I]n determining the duty to defend, the complaint claiming damages must be compared to the policy and a determination made as to whether, if the allegations are sustained, the insurer would be required to pay resulting judgment____the language of the policy and the allegations of the complaint must be construed together to determine the insurer\u2019s obligation.\n7C J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4683, at 42, 50 (W. Berdel ed. 1979) (footnotes omitted). See also Cadwallader v. New Amsterdam, Casualty Co., 396 Pa. 582, 152 A.2d 484 (1959); 14A G. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 51:44, at 458-69 (M. Rhodes 2d rev. ed. 1982); 1A H. Long, The Law of Liability Insurance \u00a7 5.02, at 5-19 to -39, \u00a7 5.04, at 5-41 to -42 (1987).\nFollowing these principles, we make the requisite comparison. Paragraph four of the Complaint in Trespass reads:\nOn or about January 6, 1976, at or about 1:30 a.m., the defendant ... willfully and maliciously assaulted and beat the wife plaintiff, PATRICIA A. ASCHENBACK, striking her with fists and with great force and violence repeatedly shook, cast and threw the said plaintiff to the ground causing plaintiffs to sustain the injuries and damages hereinafter set forth.\nThe policy provided comprehensive general liability insurance, including \u201cbodily injury liability,\u201d for \u201ceach occurrence.\u201d The definition section of the policy stated that:\n\u201cbodily injury\u201d means bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by any person which occurs during the policy period, including death at any time resulting therefrom\n\u201coccurrence\u201d means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured ...\nUnder this definition an \u201coccurrence\u201d is an accident. The willful and malicious assault alleged in the complaint is not an accident but rather is an intentional tort. As such, it is not covered by the policy and, therefore, the insurer owed no duty to defend. Wilson v. Maryland Casualty Co., 377 Pa. 588, 105 A.2d 304 (1954). See also Annotation, Allegations in Third Person\u2019s Action Against Insured as Determining Liability Insurer\u2019s Duty to Defend, 50 A.L.R.2d 458 (1956).\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nZAPPALA, J.', concurs in the result.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a' dissenting opinion.\n. Gene\u2019s Restaurant argues that because it neither \"expected\u201d nor \"intended\u201d Ms. Aschenback\u2019s injuries, Nationwide had a duty to defend. Such a reading ignores the policy requisite that the \"occurrence\u201d must be an accident which a malicious, willful assault and beating could never be. In this regard, Gene\u2019s Restaurant's reliance on United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Elitzky, 358 Pa.Super. 362, 517 A.2d 982 (1986), allocaturs denied, 515 Pa. 600, 528 A.2d 957, 515 Pa. 601, 528 A.2d 957 (1987), is also misplaced. Elitzky first found the conduct alleged, namely malicious defamation and the intentional infliction of emotional distress, could have been \"reckless\u201d as opposed to intentional, and then defined synonymously the exclusionary terms \"intentional\u201d and \"expected\u201d as encompassing a \"desired consequence,\" \u201csubstantially certain to result,\u201d Id. 358 Pa.Super. at 375, 380, 517 A.2d at 989, 991, as would certainly be the case with Ms. Aschenback\u2019s allegations.\n. Courts of other jurisdictions have had occasion to consider the question of the duty to defend in assault and battery cases in which the liability insurance policy defined \"occurrence\" in the exact words as the policy in this case. They too have decided that the intentional torts of assault and battery are excluded from coverage and the insurer has no duty to defend. See Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Freyer, 89 Ill.App.3d 617, 44 Ill.Dec. 791, 411 N.E.2d 1157 (1980); Briscoe v. Travelers Indent. Co., 18 Wash.App. 662, 571 P.2d 226 (1977); Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v.

State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 502 Pa. 335, 466 A.2d 609 (1983). See also, Mohn v. American Casualty Company of Reading, 458 Pa. 576, 326 A.2d 346 (1974); Penn-Air, Inc. v. Indemnity Insurance Co. of North America, 439 Pa. 511, 269 A.2d 19 (1970); Hafer v. Schauer, 429 Pa. 289, 239 A.2d 785 (1968); Miller v.

Cropper, 32 Pa. 351, 6 P.L.J. 209, 75 Am.Dec. 561 (1859).\nThe majority has insensibly abandoned this sound doctrine today. Granting that the duty of Appellee, Nationwide Insurance Co., to defend is dependent upon its ultimate duty to compensate should the underlying suit against its insured be lost, coverage, and therefore duty to compensate, turns on the following language in the insurance policy at issue:\n\u201coccurrence\u201d means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured____\nAllegedly, Mrs. Aschenback, was willfully, maliciously and repeatedly assaulted physically while a patron in Appellant\u2019s restaurant. She sued Appellant. Appellant itself was not guilty of intentional wrongdoing in the attack. It is certainly reasonable to argue that if the allegations in the underlying suit were proven, Mrs. Aschenback was subject to \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in [her] bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured [Appellant] ...\u201d The policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as meaning an \u201caccident,\u201d and \u201caccident\u201d is defined to include such a \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to conditions.\u201d This may be an unusual and expansive way to define an accident, but that is what the policy says. \u201cAccident\u201d is defined so that it includes such an eventuality. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that Appellant purchased this policy to protect itself from lawsuits arising from such occurrences which, after all, are not unheard of in an establishment that serves food to the public. As long as it can be reasonably argued that the definition contained in this policy covers the attack on Mrs. Aschenback, and there is no doubt in my mind that the argument is at least plausible, then under our law the policy should be most strongly construed against the insurance company and in favor of the insured.\nThis convoluted clause was inserted in the policy by Nationwide and was intended for their benefit. If it is tortured or obscure, it is their fault. A lay person could not be expected to grasp the fact that an occurrence, such as happened here, was excluded from coverage. Since the clause is capable of two interpretations, that should be adopted which is most favorable to the insured.
