When the trial court’s order was affirmed by the Commonwealth Court, the involved employees and their labor union successfully petitioned us for further review pursuant to section 724(a) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 724(a).</p>

In late August of 1984, Officers Musser and Brachbill were dismissed from their positions, as a result of acts committed by them against a prison inmate, one Robert Riggleman. Based on the factually supported findings of the labor arbitrator referred to above, the acts in question may be described as follows:</p>
    <p id="b598-10" data-blocks='[["BL_598.9",598,[238,1636,1152,739]],["BL_599.1",599,[218,346,1149,97]]]'>In the evening of August 10,1984, Officer Musser tricked Riggleman into going to a certain area in one of the prison dormitories. Upon Riggleman’s arrival, Officers Musser and Brachbill seized him, wrestled him to his knees and put a pillowcase over his head. Assisting the two guards in this action was another inmate, named Nicholas. The pillowcase was full of shaving cream, and the three assailants proceeded to rub it repeatedly over Riggleman's head and face. When the cream got into Riggleman’s mouth and nose, he began to have difficulty breathing. After a few moments the pillowcase was removed, at which point someone snapped Riggleman’s picture. Riggleman emerged from the episode cursing and yelling at the three men; he then went to a lavatory to wash his face and head. Officer <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>Musser, not yet done with the affair, put another handful of shaving cream on Riggleman’s head.</p>
    <p id="b599-4" data-blocks='[["BL_599.4",599,[213,463,1152,1070]]]'>The next day, August 11, Riggleman was again set upon by the trio of Musser, Brachbill and Nicholas. Brachbill and inmate Nicholas held Riggleman while Musser went to obtain a tube of Ben-Gay ointment from the medical supply room. When Musser returned, Brachbill and Nicholas pulled down Riggleman’s trousers; and Musser applied the ointment to the captive’s penis and testicles. Matters did not stop with the Ben-Gay incident. A short time later, after Riggleman had gone to shower and change his clothes, he was confronted anew by Brachbill, Nicholas and a guard named Goodrow. The two guards and Nicholas handcuffed Riggleman to a gate, with his hands being wrapped around one of its bars. They also shackled his ankles. One of the three captors then produced a paper bag, inscribed upon it a homosexual allusion, and put it over Riggleman’s head. With Riggleman thus displayed, one of the captors photographed him. Shortly thereafter, a Lieutenant Bodge came upon the scene and ordered that Riggleman be freed from the handcuffs and shackles. That instruction was complied with — at least temporarily.</p>
    <p id="b599-5" data-blocks='[["BL_599.5",599,[209,1550,1151,852]]]'>Evidently, the command given by Lieutenant Bodge did not have a lasting effect on either Goodrow or Nicholas. Later that same day, August 11, 1984, Goodrow and Nicholas again joined forces to re-acquaint Riggleman with the handcuffs and the shackles. This time they held Riggleman down between two desks and shackled each of his ankles to a desk leg. They also cuffed his hands and secured the handcuffs to a candy machine by means of a belt. Officer Musser came upon the scene and joined in by sitting on Riggleman’s stomach. Next, Officers Musser and Goodrow used a felt-tip pen to mark his body. The two guards drew circles around Riggleman’s nipples, marked his face, put stripes on his penis, and wrote the names of two known homosexuals on his buttocks. Following that event, Riggleman was freed from the desks, but was kept in the handcuffs and shackles for an additional period of time.</p>

About seven o’clock that evening, Brachbill and Nicholas grabbed Robert Riggleman and pinned him to the floor. While Riggleman was thus restrained, Musser approached carrying a spouted, plastic bottle filled with water. Musser then proceeded to inject the bottle’s spout into Riggleman’s anus, and by that means emptied the water into his body. Upon the completion of that mission the three perpetrators ran from the scene.</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[240,837,1150,358]]]'>The final series of events occurred during the evening of August 13, 1984. Musser and Brachbill accosted Riggleman and put him to the choice of having his head shaved or his testicles shaved. After the inmate had weighed the options given, Musser and Brachbill escorted him to a chair where they then proceeded to cut all the hair from his head and to shave it.</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[234,1223,1154,1170]]]'>Riggleman’s term of incarceration at the Centre County Prison expired on August 14, 1984. During a pre-release interview with a counselor, Riggleman revealed, upon inquiry, that the appearance of his head was the work of guards Musser and Brachbill. The counselor reported the head-shaving incident to the prison authorities, who then had the Deputy Warden look into the guards’ behavior. The investigation brought to light the various acts committed by the guards against Riggleman during his last four days at the prison. Riggleman was at first reluctant to lodge a complaint or press charges; in his view the incidents were merely “horseplay” between friends. However, at the urging of the Deputy Warden, he changed his mind and decided to cooperate with the prison authorities in taking disciplinary action against Musser and Brachbill. Soon thereafter, the prison Warden submitted a report to the Centre County Prison Board, recommending that Officers Musser and Brachbill be discharged for physical abuse of inmate Riggleman and shackling him in violation of state regulations. On August 30, 1984, the Prison Board accepted the Warden’s recommendation and notified the two guards of their dismissal.</p>

The Union, challenging the discharge of Musser and Brachbill, filed a written grievance pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (“Agreement”) in force between Centre County and the Union. The parties met in conference, as required by the Agreement; but the Prison Board affirmed its decision to terminate the two guards, citing the employee discipline provisions of the Agreement.</p>

The County’s evidence in that regard was uncontradicted. The sole point of controversy was whether the conduct of the two guards provided “just cause” for their discharge; The County, in support of its position, brought out that Musser and Brachbill, like all guards at the prison, had been given instruction as to state regulations governing the treatment of inmates and the use of physical restraints, such as <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>handcuffs, and shackles. Thus, according to the County, the two grievants were aware, or should have been aware, that their treatment of Riggleman violated state law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The employer also asserted that the conduct in question, besides being blatantly unprofessional, could have exposed the County to civil liability.</p>

That argument was rejected by the arbitrator on the basis of his conclusion that the provision referred to did not delimit the employer’s power of immediate dismissal. The Union next contended that the sanction of discharge was too severe for the behavior involved, and that nothing more than a suspension was justified.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[207,1260,1154,944]],["BL_604.1",604,[237,329,1149,149]]]'>The arbitrator found that the grievants’ conduct toward Riggleman was a clear violation of professional standards, and that their acts, in several respects, probably violated state regulations governing the treatment of prison inmates. The arbitrator also determined that the conduct of the grievants was cause for disciplinary action of some type. He decided, however, that the penalty of dismissal was inappropriate. In concluding that a lesser sanction was called for, the arbitrator accepted two of the Union’s assertions: (1) that the conduct in question was merely “horseplay” between friends; and, (2) that “horseplay” between guards and inmates had been long tolerated at the prison without ever before causing the discharge of a guard. Based on the two findings last mentioned, the arbitrator decided that the Prison Board’s termination of Musser and Brachbill was discriminatory and, for that reason, could not be found to rest upon “just cause.” The arbitrator then proceeded to enter an award reducing each of the dismissals <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>to a four-week period of suspension.

Their petition, labeled as one to “modify, correct or vacate an arbitration award,” sought relief pursuant to section 7302(d)(2) of the Uniform Arbitration Act (“Uniform Act”), 42 Pa.C.S. § 7302(d)(2).

The <em>Philadelphia Housing Authority </em>case, like the present one, concerned an award by a labor arbitrator reversing the discharge of a governmental employee. The employee there involved, a security guard at a public housing project, had been dismissed for defrauding an elderly tenant. Although the arbitrator found, as the employer had alleged, that the security guard had committed the fraud and had lied about his conduct, an award was entered reinstating the guard to his former position. That decision was based on the arbitrator’s determination that the guard’s fraud resulted from an abuse of friendship, not abuse of his official status. This Court declared the award to be invalid. We held that, given the infraction proved, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement did not empower the arbitrator to reverse the discharge. We characterized as “manifestly unreasonable” the arbitrator’s implicit conclusion that the employer had bargained away, under the agreement, its absolute responsibility to ensure the integrity of its security guards by the power of dismissal. <em>Philadelphia Housing Authority, </em><a href="/pa/500/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="500 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1781058" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0213-01">500 Pa. at 216</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="500 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1781058" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0213-01">455 A.2d at 627</a>.</p>

This reservation of power is reiterated in Article XX, which more specifically addresses the subject of employee discipline. The very first sentence in section 1 of <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>Article XX states: “The <em>sole right </em>to discipline and discharge employees for just cause <em>is retained by the County." </em>(Emphasis added.) That clause is tempered by a provision concerning “minor offenses”; for offenses of that type the employer agreed to follow a scheme of graduated discipline, starting with a written warning for the first offense, progressing to a “disciplinary layoff” for the second, and ending in discharge for the third.</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[243,764,1149,471]]]'>Section 1 of Article XX also confers upon an employee the right to grieve any discipline imposed upon him, should he dispute the existence of “just cause.” Section 4 of that same Article sets forth the powers of an arbitrator regarding employee discipline. Where the matter grieved is a discharge, section 4 provides that “the <em>sole question </em>to be decided by [the] arbitrator shall be <em>a question of fact as to whether or not such employee was discharged for just cause.” </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>

Articles IV and XX of the Agreement clearly set forth that understanding. Indeed, the arbitrator recognized as much in his discussion. Besides the express limitation that any disciplinary action must rest on a factual basis constituting “just cause,” the only other contractual limitation on the employer’s power to discipline relates to a class of employee misconduct denominated “minor offenses,” for which the employer has bound itself to follow a scheme of graduated, or progressive, sanctions. The arbitrator’s power regarding disciplinary decisions is carefully circumscribed by section 4 of Article XX: he is restricted to deciding whether or not the requisite factual predicate exists for the imposition of discipline, and whether the disciplinary measure selected by the employer is in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p>

When the arbitrator took it upon himself to modify the employer’s decision of dismissal, the arbitrator stepped beyond the bounds of power conferred upon him by the Collective Bargaining Agreement. It is worth noting that, according to the arbitrator, the Prison Board could reasonably have decided upon dismissal based on the information it had. As a ground for overruling the Board’s decision, the arbitrator “inferred” that the Board was not aware of the history of “horseplay” at the prison.

I wish to emphasize that, as the majority observes, judicial intervention in labor arbitration awards is and should be the rare exception. So long as the arbitrator “essentially” (i.e., reasonably) derives the award from the collective bargaining agreement, the award will not be disturbed.</p>
    <p id="b613-7" data-blocks='[["BL_613.8",613,[172,1030,1152,1240]]]'>Here, however, as in <em>Philadelphia Housing Authority v. Union of Security Officers # 1, </em><a href="/pa/500/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="500 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1781058" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0213-01">500 Pa. 213</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="500 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1781058" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0213-01">455 A.2d 625</a> (1983), the union did not bargain for and the employer did not bargain away the right and responsibility of the employer to discharge an employee who is guilty of the atrocious criminal conduct that we witness in these cases. In the instant case, the sustained physical abuse, humiliation and torture of the victim-inmate (which is undisputed) in the guards’ “care” (e.g., handcuffing and shackling, forced enemas, shaving of hair, exposing private areas, inflicting pain to and offensive touching of the genitals and buttocks, etc.), clearly violated the criminal laws of this Commonwealth prohibiting, inter alia, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and assault. A public employer cannot bargain away its right and responsibility to discharge an employee for such egregious criminal behavior occuring in the performance of the employee’s duties; such a bargain would violate public policy. The Centre County Prison Board did <em>not </em>attempt to bargain away that right and responsibility, and the arbitrator in this case, without a doubt, roved far beyond the collective bargaining agreement to dispense his own notion of justice. This award cannot be permitted to stand.</p>
