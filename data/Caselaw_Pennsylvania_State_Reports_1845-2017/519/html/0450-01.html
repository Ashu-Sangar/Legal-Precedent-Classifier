    <p id="b672-6" data-blocks='[["BL_672.5",672,[261,1364,1150,627]]]'>On the night of Friday, September 9, 1983, Scott Blystone, his girlfriend and another couple were riding around Fayette County in Blystone’s automobile. Blystone, who was driving, worried about the fact that his automobile was low on gasoline and he had no money with which to purchase more. At approximately midnight, Blystone observed Dalton Charles Smithburger, Jr., hitchhiking. Blystone announced to his companions: “I am going to pick this guy up and rob him, okay, ... ?” His friends endorsed the idea, or at best did nothing to oppose it, so Blystone pulled over to pick up his victim. Unfortunately, Smithburger, who was not acquainted with anyone in the car, accepted the ride.</p>
    <p id="b672-7" data-blocks='[["BL_672.6",672,[260,2010,1149,150]],["BL_673.1",673,[214,320,1151,471]]]'>Once underway Blystone asked Smithburger if he had any money to contribute for the purpose of purchasing gasoline. Smithburger replied that he had only a few <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>dollars and reached into his pocket. Dissatisfied with that response, Blystone drew a revolver which he held to Smith-burger’s head. In no uncertain terms Blystone ordered Smithburger to shut his eyes and place his hands on the dashboard. Smithburger understandably offered no resistance. Though in the course of a taped interview he would later admit that “I almost splattered him right there in the car,” Blystone assured Smithburger that he would lose only his money, not his life.</p>
    <p id="b673-4" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[212,811,1150,472]]]'>Blystone pulled the car off the road at a lonely spot and walked Smithburger at gunpoint a short distance into an adjacent field. Blystone searched Smithburger, finding thirteen dollars. He ordered Smithburger to lie face down on the ground and wait. Smithburger complied. Blystone briefly returned to his companions in the car to inform them that he was going to kill Smithburger. The best that can be said for Blystone’s friends is that perhaps they were startled into ambivalence by the enormity of the statement.</p>
    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.5",673,[209,1301,1151,416]]]'>In any event Blystone decided to kill Smithburger. He returned to the field where he found his victim as he had left him. Blystone knelt on Smithburger’s back and asked him whether he could identify the vehicle which had picked him up. Smithburger correctly replied, “all I know is it was green and the back end was wrecked.” Blystone then said, “goodbye” and emptied his revolver into the back of Smith-burger’s head.</p>

Such deaths take on a life of their own and rattle thiough the lives of the those who know, until chance or nature loosens tongues. Appellant Blystone heard more than the voice of his passengers; he heard his own voice bragging in vivid and grisly detail of the killing of that unlucky lad. (See the Appendix attached to this opinion.)</p>

However, his associates eventually exposed him. The testimonial evidence they contributed to the Commonwealth’s case, along with physical evidence, would have been sufficient to support Blystone’s convic<a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>tions. Additionally, an audio tape of Blystone describing the murder to an informant was presented to the jury (See Appendix). The combined effect of all this material was to present the jury with evidence of the appellant’s guilt which was more than sufficient; it was overwhelming.</p>
    <p id="b674-5" data-blocks='[["BL_674.4",674,[249,591,1150,524]]]'>Nevertheless, the appellant attacks the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his robbery conviction and, consequently, the imposition of the death penalty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Specifically, the appellant argues, the Commonwealth did not present sufficient evidence to satisfy the <em>corpus delicti </em>requirement for the crime of robbery. To establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>of robbery, the Commonwealth must prove a theft by criminal means. <em>Commonwealth v. Tallon, </em><a href="/pa/478/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="478 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="1740513" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0468-01">478 Pa. 468</a>, 475, <a href="/pa/478/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="478 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="1740513" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0468-01">387 A.2d 77</a>, 81 (1978). In other words, the Commonwealth bears a burden to show that the crime actually occurred.</p>
    <p id="b674-6" data-blocks='[["BL_674.5",674,[247,1134,1149,311]]]'>The Commonwealth presented ample evidence, apart from the appellant’s own admissions, that Scott Blystone did in fact rob Dalton Smithburger. Both of the young women in the car that night testified that the armed appellant took thirteen dollars from Smithburger. One of the women testified on this point as follows:</p>

The appellant searched his victim at gunpoint, taking thirteen dollars; forced him to lie down; and instructed him not to move unless he wished to die. Blystone then traversed the short distance to his automobile, remaining there only long enough to announce his murderous intent and gain the endorsement of his companions. Meanwhile, Smithburger remained motionless on the ground out of fear that Blystone would fulfill his deadly promise should he resist or attempt to flee. Indeed, Blystone described in detail how he instilled doubt in Smithbur<a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>ger’s mind as to whether his robber was merely a few feet away or fled the scene: “He never moved. He thought I was there. I stepped around him, right, and I walked a little bit in a circle and I stopped. I didn’t make no noise, and I said ‘don’t think I am gone, mother-f.....r,’ and then I f.....g tiptoed off, you know.” Upon his return from the automobile Blystone killed Smithburger; only then did he flee the scene. Thus, this robbery was not complete when Blystone took Smithburger’s money, nor when Blystone went to his car, but when he successfully fled the scene after murdering his victim.</p>

It was also apparent that Blystone did not tell his trial counsel of the possibility of establishing his presence elsewhere at the time of the crime until after the Commonwealth rested its case.</p>

Should the fact-finder determine the Commonwealth has satisfied its burden of establishing the aggravating circumstance, then, and only then, does a penalty of death become cognizable.

As the majority correctly points out, in interpreting the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the United States Supreme Court has taken the approach that one party consensual interceptions do not violate that provision since an accused waives his “expectation of privacy” by conversing with another party. In short, the United States Supreme Court and the majority can discern no difference between communicating with the police informant who in turn reports to the police and surreptitiously recording the conversations directly by interception. This analysis embodies the proposition that the key factor to be considered in a wire intercept is whether the individual has a “legitimate expectation of privacy” and whether he has waived that expectation by disclosing information to any other party. While on the surface the majority’s reliance upon the federal court’s position seems to have merit, closer analysis reveals that blind adherence to this proposition is erroneous.</p>

(Citations omitted) What the provisions forbid are unreasonable searches and seizures, i.e., certain acts of the government. Article I, section 9 “presents the police with a web of rules that are meant to protect the privacy interests of ‘the people’, and the police violate section 9 if and only if they violate these rules.” <em>State v.

Whether police conduct is a search does not turn on whether its object could be discovered by conduct that is not a search. For example, in <em>State v. Lewis, supra, </em>the defendant exposed himself to public view through his living room. This Court held that the police officers did not engage in a search by photographing him from a house across the street with a 135 m.m. camera lense, which provided only minimal enhancement of what could be observed with the unaided eye. Nonetheless, <em>the police officers would have engaged in a search had they entered his living room to observe what could be observed from the street. </em>Similarly, if an undercover police officer is invited into a home and observes illegal conduct, the officer has not committed a search, but an unconsented entry into the home by other police officers to observe what the undercover officer could or did not observe <em>would be a search. </em>The issue is not whether what the <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>police learned by using the transmitter in this case was “exposed to public <em>view </em>”, but whether using the transmitter is an action that can be characterized as a search.</blockquote>

Conversations in public may be overheard, but it is relatively easy to avoid such eavesdroppers by lowering the voice or moving away. Moreover, one can be reasonably sure of whether one will be overheard. But if the state’s position in this case is correct, no movement, no location and no conversation in a “public place” would in any measure be secure from the prying of the government. There would in addition be no ready means for individuals to ascertain when they were being scrutinized and when they were not. That is nothing short of a staggering limitation on personal freedom.

If the key element is the expectation of privacy, then the consent of one participant is insufficient. Unlike the majority, I fail to see the distinction between having the consent of one participant or none as the polestar in guaranteeing a fundamental right. Furthermore, I cannot accept the majority’s conclusion that one who communicates to another does so at the expense of his privacy rights. Implicit in the right to privacy is the right to determine who benefits from your knowledge. Knowledge is as much a possessory right as the right to possess and protect our homes and personal property. An individual then may <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>desire not to expose his inner thoughts or ideals to the public at large which he may not trust, but only to selected individuals.

      <blockquote id="b682-13" data-blocks='[["BL_682.12",682,[305,1809,1083,506]]]'>Nor should we be too ready to erect constitutional barriers to relevant and probative evidence which is also accurate and reliable. An electronic recording will many times produce a more reliable rendition of what a defendant has said than will the unaided memory of a police agent. It may also be that with the recording in existence it is less likely that the informant will change his mind, less chance that threat of injury will suppress unfavorable evidence and less chance that cross-examination will confound the testimony. Considerations like these obviously do not favor the defendant, but we are not prepared to hold that a defendant who has no constitutional right to exclude the informer’s unaided testmony nevertheless has a Fourth Amendment privilege against a more accurate version of the events in question.</blockquote>
