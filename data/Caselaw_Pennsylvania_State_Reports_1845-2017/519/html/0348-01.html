It was determined that appellant drove a yellow Chrysler LeBaron and the car behind the restaurant was identified as belonging to him.</p>
    <p id="b570-7" data-blocks='[["BL_570.6",570,[247,1257,1149,575]]]'>Appellant was then asked to come to the state police barracks for further questioning. He was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and he gave a statement corroborating an earlier statement that he had dropped off a W-4 form and returned home to watch television. He was informed of inconsistencies in his statement, such as the fact that his car was seen behind Genetti’s Manor at the time that he claimed he was watching television. He was also informed that a search warrant was obtained for his car and that the police were looking for blood, clothing fibers, etc. Appellant then decided to make a more complete statement.</p>

Appellant then said to the victim “come with me for a walk” and both proceeded to the ladies bathroom. Appellant told Ms. Kurmchak to walk over to one of the stalls, to open the stall door and to take off her pants. He then told Ms. Kurmchak that he wanted to have sex with her.</p>

Appellant stabbed the victim five or six more times and the victim began to gasp. Appellant then stabbed her in the throat. Appellant exited the building. He buried the knife in the swamp behind the restaurant, got in his car, and drove home.</p>

He then demonstrated for the officer who was taking the statement, how he held the <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>knife, how the victim tried to grab it, and how he stuck it into her stomach.</p>

She slid down and hit the flush on the toilet, and blood began to run out of her into the toilet. Appellant further stated: “I then stabbed her around the throat because she was gasping and trying to say something. After I stabbed her near the throat she slid down the rest of the way to the floor.”</p>

We find no merit to this argument since the. prosecutor was merely commenting on evidence which the defendant himself introduced into the record. This evidence had been offered presumably to show that defendant’s mental composition made it difficult for him to conform to societal rules. In response however the prosecutor pointed out that appellants epileptic seizures occurred when he was a young boy, that they had not recurred, and that there were no demonstrable residual effects. This was certainly fair comment on the evidence, and we detect no prosecutorial misconduct in pursuing this line of argument. <em>See Commonwealth v.
