This property was registered in the name of Universal Atlas Cement Company. However, the actual owner of the property was United States Steel Corporation. For tax year 1984 the Board assessed the property in the amount of $335,500.00.</p>

The appeal challenged the assessment on the grounds that the assessment was too low, in that it was based on a fair market value less than 25% of the actual value.</p>
    <p id="b383-7" data-blocks='[["BL_383.7",383,[175,1237,1151,259]]]'>On March 30, 1984, U.S. Steel, approximately one month beyond the appeal period, sought leave to intervene in the appeal and filed with the Board a “Notice of Intervention”. The notice did not indicate a reason for its intervention; nor was a specific challenge made to the assessment.</p>
    <p id="b383-8" data-blocks='[["BL_383.8",383,[173,1515,1152,366]]]'>A hearing was scheduled before the Board for October 24, 1984. However, in the interim the Taxing Authorities, upon their independent evaluation, determined that the property was properly assessed, and therefore elected to withdraw their appeal. This fact notwithstanding, U.S. Steel notified the Board that it intended to proceed to the hearing and seek a reduction in the assessment.</p>
    <p id="b383-9" data-blocks='[["BL_383.9",383,[173,1902,1149,258]]]'>The hearing was held, as scheduled, with only U.S. Steel in attendance.

In response U.S. Steel contended that once intervention was allowed the intervenor assumed the status of a proper party, with all attendant rights and liabilities; consequently, it was entitled to proceed with the appeal to seek a reduction in the assessment.</p>

Where their own rules are unclear or non-existent, they are not free to ignore the conventional principles and doctrines of civil practice and procedure. Failure to apply the commonly understood doctrine of waiver in the context of intervention here was a flagrant abuse of discretion in my view. Administrative agencies should be encouraged to conform their adjudicative practices as much as is practicable, to those used by courts throughout the Commonwealth. Our governing principles and procedures are the product of centuries of learning and experience. See, <em>Philadelphia Electric Co. v.
