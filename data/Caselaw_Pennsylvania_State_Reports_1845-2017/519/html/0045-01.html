On June 13, 1983, the victim Randolph Jones, appellant, and friends had a picnic along the Delaware River in Bristol Borough, during which Jones had manifested abusive behavior, induced by heavy consumption of alcohol, toward several members of appellant’s party. Thereafter appellant drove his girlfriend Cora Lucy Davis and their children in his van to Schumacher Drive, also in Bristol, and parked on the street in front of Jones’ residence. The group intended to sleep in the van overnight.</p>

Appellant and Jones exchanged words, subsequent to which Jones went into his house for the purpose of securing a handgun. Seated in his van, appellant saw in his side mirror Jones approaching with what appeared to be a pistol. Appellant threw open his door, which struck Jones and knocked him to the ground. They struggled for the gun which had also been knocked away. Appellant grabbed the gun and shot Jones five times, although no one testified at trial that they actually saw appellant with the weapon. He then fled the scene with his family. Within two hours, he surrendered himself to Bristol Township Police, and in the company of <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>his attorney gave police an inculpatory statement. Jones succumbed to his injuries the following day.</p>
    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[210,445,1150,526]]]'>Appellant was charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with criminal homicide, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2501, and possessing an instrument of crime, 18 Pa.C.S. § 907. He entered an open plea to murder generally and, following an evidentiary hearing, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2503(a) and (b), and the weapons offense. A sentencing hearing was subsequently held, resulting in the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for a three to ten-year period. Thereafter, the Commonwealth filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence which was denied.</p>
    <p id="b265-6" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[210,1011,1150,855]]]'>The court of common pleas, in denying the applicability of section 9712 to appellant’s conduct, limited the provision to criminal acts by “those who <em>choose </em>to use a firearm for the express purpose of committing one of the enumerated felonies,” reasoning that the mandatory sentence was not intended to apply to the “conduct of persons in defendant’s situation who grab a firearm <em>suddenly </em>brought to the crime scene by the victim and who use <em>that </em>weapon under the circumstances shown here.” <em>Commonwealth v. Alex Wooten, </em>No. 2824, 2825/83, slip op. at 4 (Bucks County Court of Common Pleas, June 28, 1984) (emphasis in original).

Appellant does not contend that section 9712 is inapposite in the context of a conviction for voluntary manslaughter. The clear language of the provision certainly indicates otherwise. <em>See Commonwealth v. Bell, </em><a href="/pa/512/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="512 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="1800496" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0334-01">512 Pa. 334</a>, <a href="/pa/512/0333-02" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="516 A.2d 1172" data-case-ids="1800453,1800470,1800471,1800496" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0333-02,/pa/512/0332-01,/pa/512/0333-01,/pa/512/0334-01">516 A.2d 1172</a> (1986).

C.S. § 2503(b). The court heard and rejected testimony that appellant was justified in his actions. The court based its conclusion to a large extent on the excessive force used by appellant to effectuate the self-defense, noting that appellant had fired five shots at his victim.</p>

Although appellant may have been justified in gaining control of the weapon and firing a shot or two in the direction of his attacker in order to deter his advance, once that end was achieved appellant no longer could be perceived as a faultless actor. By continuing his use of the weapon, he became the aggressor. With each shot he fired, five in all, his conduct became less spontaneous and more calculated to effect an improper purpose. Thus, even though appellant did not introduce the weapon into the affray, we do not believe that the imposition of enhanced punishment for his conduct would thwart the legislative purpose of discouraging violent crimes effectuated by the use of firearms. <em>See Commonwealth v. </em>
