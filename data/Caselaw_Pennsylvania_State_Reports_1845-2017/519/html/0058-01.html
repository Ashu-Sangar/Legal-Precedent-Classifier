The basis for the court’s order was its conclusion that Collins had been denied effective assistance of counsel in the trial proceedings.

Between two and three o’clock that morning, she heard noises at the front of her house. Upon investigation, she discovered that her porch furniture had been thrown onto the adjacent sidewalk. Mrs. Barfield called the police, who helped her to return the furniture to the front porch. After the police left the scene, Mrs. Barfield and her daughter Diane remained at the front of the house, looking up and down the street. While the two females were thus stationed they saw a man walk by the house, a man Diane Barfield identified to her mother as Jay Collins, the appellee herein. Collins was from the neighborhood and was known to both of the Barfields. After the male had walked by, Mrs. Barfield’s daughter went back into the house; but Mrs. Barfield herself remained at the front door.</p>

This time, according to Mrs. Bar-field, the man stopped in front, drew from under his coat what appeared to be a rifle or shotgun, and aimed the weapon at her. When Mrs. Barfield started to retreat from the doorway, she heard a “tremendous blast.” Shotgun pellets came within a few inches of her head, penetrated the <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>screen door and lodged in the wall of the foyer. According to later police testimony, between twenty-five and fifty shotgun pellets were found in the wall. Fortunately, Mrs. Barfield was not physically injured.</p>
    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[226,544,1149,312]]]'>In reporting the shooting incident to the police, Mrs. Barfield identified her assailant as Jay Collins. She also provided them with a description of him as well as his address. About 7:00 a.m. the next day, June 22, 1983, the police arrested Collins at his home. The police also seized a blue trench coat, which they found in Collins’ bedroom.</p>
    <p id="b277-6" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[226,875,1151,631]]]'>At trial, Diane Barfield, the victim’s daughter, positively identified Jay Collins as the male who had walked past the front of the house shortly before the shooting. The victim, Mrs. Margie Barfield, was also positive in her identification of Collins as the shooter. In that regard, the elder Barfield disclosed that she had known the accused for several years and that he had gone to school with her children. She also pointed out that, when the accused aimed the weapon at her, he was standing no more than fifteen or twenty feet away and in lighting that enabled her to see him. As a further matter, she identified the coat seized by the police as being the one worn by the assailant.</p>
    <p id="b277-7" data-blocks='[["BL_277.6",277,[223,1525,1151,729]]]'>The defense attempted to demonstrate, through cross-examination, that Mrs. Barfield was mistaken or unreliable in her identification of Collins as the shooter. Defense counsel also presented an alibi witness, one Glenn Price. Mr. Price testified that he and the accused were at a neighborhood bar until about 1:30 a.m. on the morning of the shooting, and that from the bar they proceeded to a friend’s house to watch a video movie until about 3:00 a.m. At that time, according to Price, he and the accused departed the friend’s house and headed toward their respective homes. The testimony of this witness also revealed that the house in which the movie was shown and the house in which Collins lived were both within two blocks of Mrs. Barfield’s residence.</p>

The judge also found that the alibi witness, though credible, had not given testimony which precluded Collins from being the assailant. Consequently, the court adjudged the accused guilty of all charges.</p>
    <p id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[235,598,1150,683]]]'>Collins retained new counsel to press his post-trial motions. Included in the grounds advanced for a new trial was an assertion that Collins’ trial counsel had been ineffective. That claim was predicated on the failure of trial counsel to impeach Mrs. Barfield, the Commonwealth’s key witness, by bringing out on cross-examination that she had a particular reason to be biased or vengeful against the accused, arising from events that preceded the shooting incident of June 21, 1983. The source of this possible bias was the fact that, a few years before, Mrs. Barfield’s son had been convicted and imprisoned for the shooting death of a cousin of Jay Collins, on the strength of testimony provided by Jay Collins’ brother.</p>
    <p id="b278-6" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[230,1300,1152,903]]]'>At the hearing on the ineffectiveness claim, Collins’ former defense counsel admitted her pre-trial awareness of the homicide case involving Mrs. Barfield’s son and that it could have been a source of vindictiveness toward the entire Collins family. That notwithstanding, trial counsel put forth two reasons for not attempting to impeach Mrs. Barfield on a theory of antecedent bias or hostility: First, counsel felt that Mrs. Barfield appeared to be a credible and sympathetic witness, and that a suggestion of vengeance-motivated testimony would have been unavailing. Second, counsel was of the view that reference to the homicide case could have worked as a “two-edged sword” against her client, in that it could have given him a motive to harm Mrs. Barfield. According to trial counsel, the fact that Mrs. Barfield’s son shot and killed Jay Collins’ cousin may have been perceived as motivating the instant appellee to do the same thing to a member of the Barfield family.</p>

According to the trial court, that line of impeachment was the only possible basis for creating a reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt.

    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[219,640,1152,993]]]'>The Superior Court, in affirming the trial court’s decision, purported to apply our decision in <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

The Superior Court opined that the revenge theory, which had an undisputed factual predicate, was the only possible means of impeaching the credibility of the prosecution’s key witness, and that the decision not to pursue it could not be deemed reasonably designed to protect the accused’s interests. As for trial counsel’s explanation of her strategic choice, the Superior Court rejected it as being meritless under the circumstances. In this regard, the Superior Court reasoned that, since Mrs. Barfield seemed to be a credible and sympathetic witness, and had given testimony sufficient to convict the accused, the defense had little to lose in resorting to the vengeance theory as a basis for impeaching the witness’ testimony. Moreover, in the Superior Court’s view, the strategy forgone had a greater potential for success than the tactics counsel actually employed, <em>i.e., </em>reliance on a theory of misidentification and alibi.</p>

As noted, it was trial counsel’s judgment that the very same circumstances which might have infused Mrs. Barfield with an appetite for vengeance could have had the same effect on the defendant, and could have given him a motive for perpetrating the shotgun attack. Although the prosecution did not have to establish motive, such would be relevant and further evidence of guilt. <em>Commonwealth v.

It is to be kept in mind that counsel’s stewardship at trial is presumptively effective, and the burden of demonstrating that it was not rests upon the defendant. <em>Commonwealth v.
