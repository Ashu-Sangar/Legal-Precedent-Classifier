We granted the petition for allowance of appeal of the A.F. Shane Co., Appellant, in order to review the propriety of Superior Court’s reversal (Johnson, J. dissenting) of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas’ refusal to open a default judgment. There is clearly a conflict between the result in this case and our recent decision in <em>Schultz v. Erie Insurance Exchange, </em><a href="/pa/505/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="505 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1788897" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0090-01">505 Pa. </a><a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a><a href="/pa/505/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="505 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1788897" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0090-01">90</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="505 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1788897" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0090-01">477 A.2d 471</a> (1984).

    <p id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[217,488,1153,832]]]'>The underlying facts as revealed by the record indicate that this action was initiated by Appellant to recover equipment rentals from Kipin Industries, Inc., Appellee. The complaint was served on Kipin on November 26, 1985. Kipin took it to the law offices of Richard Neff, Esquire, who had been handling other legal matters for Kipin. On December 18 or 19, Kipin received notice, sent pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 237.1,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> that Shane intended to enter a default judgment against Kipin if an answer were not filed within ten (10) days. Peter Kipin, the president of the corporation, thereupon called Neff, learned that an answer had not been prepared, and went to Neffs office to retrieve the suit papers. Thereafter, he retained Janice Morrison, Esquire, to represent his corporation in the action. However, Peter Kipin neglected to give Morrison a copy of the Rule 237.1 notice or tell her about it.</p>
    <p id="b227-6" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[218,1347,1150,257]]]'>Ms. Morrison testified that he never gave her the ten day notice and never told her of the notice. Also, he sent her papers involving numerous lawsuits without bringing to her attention the urgency to act within ten days in the present proceeding.</p>

Morrison then departed for the Christmas holidays without filing the answer. She did not return to the office until December 27. The answer <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>was not immediately filed, however, because (1) counsel’s messenger was on vacation, and (2) counsel was unaware of the ten day notice pursuant to Rule 237.1. The answer was filed after the holidays on January 2, 1986. It contained averments that the lease had been terminated and that the rentals sued for in the complaint had accrued after Kipin had requested removal of the equipment. Unfortunately, a default judgment had previously been entered on December 30, 1985. A petition to open the default judgment was timely filed on January 8, 1986.</p>
    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[257,855,1150,460]]]'>In the petition to open, the only excuse offered for the entry of the default judgment was that “because of the holidays, [counsel] filed the ... [answer] two days after the time for taking default.” (Slip opinion, Wettick, J., p. 2). However, Ms. Morrison testified that she had returned to her office before the expiration of the ten day period and that she was in a position to, and would have, filed the answer on December 27, 1985, if she had known that a ten day notice had been sent on December 17, 1985.</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[255,1333,1150,357]]]'>Peter Kipin, on the other hand, testified that he believed that he had conveyed the ten day notice to Ms. Morrison, that he had notified her of the need to act by December 27, and that he had placed a telephone call to her office in which he informed the receptionist that the answer was due on December 27. Also, his testimony indicated that he had sent Ms. Morrison only the papers in this case.</p>

(Slip opinion at 3). Judge Wettick concluded that the ten day notice clearly alerted Appellee of the need to act and that Peter Kipin had a duty to give this information to counsel. His failure to do so constituted inexcusable neglect. The trial judge further concluded that even if he accepted Mr. Kipin’s testimony, excusable neglect would not be established because Ms. Morrison testified that she was <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>in her office on December 27, and could have filed the answer, but chose to wait until the messenger would return to work the following week. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed holding that Appellee’s default was reasonably explained and that the refusal to open the default judgment under the circumstances of this case constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>

In either case, and the testimony is conflicting on this point, excusable neglect was not established. This conclusion can hardly be described as incorrect based on the facts in this record, let alone an abuse of discretion. The Superior Court’s reversal of the decision not to open the default judgment was error. While appearing to adhere to the verbal formula set forth by this court in <em>Schultz, </em>the Superior Court blatently disregarded the substance of that decision and merely substituted its judgment for that of the chancellor.
