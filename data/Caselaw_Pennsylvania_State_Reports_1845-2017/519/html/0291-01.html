The victim described the assailant to the police and reported that he identified himself as Gallagher. Two weeks later, on December 10, 1977, the victim examined a photographic display containing the appellant’s picture and also faced him in a voluntary <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>one-on-one confrontation; in neither instance did she identify him.</p>

The appellant was then arrested on February 19, 1982, and charged with rape and numerous related offenses. Prior to his arrest, however, the statute of limitations had expired on all the offenses except involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Accordingly, he was tried only for the latter offense.</p>
    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[177,837,1153,1111]]]'>At his jury trial, the appellant contested his identification as the rapist. In order to downplay the victim’s repeated failures to identify appellant within weeks of the crimes and bolster her identification after four years, the Commonwealth presented Ann Burgess as an expert witness with respect to RTS. Burgess holds a master’s degree in psychiatric nursing and a doctorate in nursing science. Together with a colleague, Professor Lynda Holmstrom of Boston College, Burgess co-authored an article in the American Journal of Psychiatry which is credited with being the first study of victims of sexual attack to use the term “rape trauma syndrome.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Burgess’s qualifications included extensive teaching, research, writing, and forensic experience with the psychological effects found in rape victims. She described the symptomology of the syndrome, now accepted as a standard post-traumatic stress response disorder by the American Psychiatric Association. She then summarized her examination of the victim, stated her diagnosis that the victim suffered from RTS, and related her opinion of how the phenomena of RTS bore upon the identification process.</p>

On appeal, a divided panel of the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. The primary issue is whether Burgess’s testimony regarding RTS was admissible. We hold that the testimony was an <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>impermissible encroachment on the jury’s function of determining credibility, and reverse the judgment of sentence.</p>

The first is the acute phase, lasting days or weeks, during which the victim is emotionally overwhelmed and has difficulty performing ordinary functions; this is followed by a long term reorganization phase, lasting months or years, during which the victim deals with symptoms specific to the rape which must be integrated into the victim’s psychological experience to enable her to function at a precrisis level.

At that time, appellant had identified himself as Anthony Gallagher and had claimed to be “with the police.” Two weeks after the .rape, the victim was shown a photographic display containing appellant’s picture, and she was given the opportunity to see him in person at the police station. The victim testified that she could not look at appellant, even though she was in the safety of the police station, and that all she wanted to do was to get away from appellant. The face-to-face confrontation was not conducted as a formal line-up. The victim viewed appellant across a police captain’s desk. The victim told the police at that time that appellant looked, acted and talked like her attacker, but that his hair and mustache were not the same as her <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>attacker’s.

For example, she thought she saw her attacker everywhere, she slept fully dressed, and she circled the block carefully before entering her home. Anxious to see her assailant apprehended, the victim remained in contact with the police. Over four years after the attack and following a similar attack on another victim, the police again presented the victim with a photographic display. The victim made a positive identification of appellant at this time.</p>

The defense in the case was misidentification. Dr. Burgess offered no opinion or comment as to the victim’s truthfulness or the accuracy of her identification.
