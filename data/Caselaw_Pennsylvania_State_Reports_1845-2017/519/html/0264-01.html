His last position with the Department was that of a Housing Rehabilitation Specialist with the Urban Homestead Program operated by the Philadelphia Office of Housing and Community Development. Shortly after his layoff Mr. Horsley filed an application for retirement benefits by virtue of his membership in the Municipal Retirement System. Upon approval by the Board Mr. Horsley began receiving monthly retirement payments in the amount of $869.89.</p>

On the eve of trial Mr. Horsley pled guilty to two counts of the indictment, and on November 2, 1979, he was sentenced to five years probation and a $2,500 fine.</p>

Teti, a Deputy City Solicitor, and renewed its request for advice concerning the continued payment of retirement benefits to Benjamin Horsley. In a memorandum dated August 29, 1983, Teti advised the Board that Mr. Horsley fell within the ambit of Section 217. This determination was predicated upon a Formal Opinion from the Solicitor’s Office, filed on February 3, 1983, which determined, <em>inter alia, </em>that the disqualification provision of the ordinance was applicable to a retired employee for offenses committed during his or her employment with the City. Based upon this legal advice, which the Board was bound to follow pursuant to Section 8-410 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, the Board suspended benefits on September 1, 1983.</p>

First, appellant argues that the various functions performed by the City Solicitor’s office violated Mr. Horsley’s due process right to a fair hearing. Specifically she complains: (1) a Deputy City Solicitor, based upon the Formal Opinion rendered by the then acting City Solicitor, advised and recommended to the Board’s executive director that he initially suspend retirement benefits; (2) an Assistant City Solicitor was available as legal advisor to the panel during the hearing; and (3) the City Solicitor was a member of the Board that ultimately voted to continue suspension of benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> It is upon this procedural matrix that appellant asserts that there was an improper comming<a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>ling of adjudicatory and prosecutorial functions by the Board.

    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[256,461,1149,473]]]'>It should be emphasized that the hearing about which appellant complains was not a fact finding hearing.

Thus, it is primarily in a fact finding situation where the possibility of prejudice is most dangerous.

Appellant advances a rather preposterous argument that to accept her interpretation would encourage corrupt officials to retire before they get caught, thereby cleansing the system.

In this appeal appellant also contends that the Board’s action effected an unlawful forfeiture of a vested property right, and that the Board failed to provide written findings of facts and conclusions of law. We agree with the Commonwealth Court’s disposition of these issues and we need not address them in great detail. Regarding appellant’s "vested interest” argument, we emphasize that this case is <em>not </em>similar to <em>Bellomini v. State Employees' Retirement Board, </em><a href="/pa/498/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="498 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1776296" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0204-01">498 Pa. 204</a>, <a href="/pa/498/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="498 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1776296" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0204-01">445 A.2d 737</a> (1982) since the present disqualification provision was a part of the pension rules during the entire time of Mr. Horsley’s employment with the City. As for the Board’s lack of factual findings, this was a mere technical defect without substantial ramifications since there were no factual matters in dispute.</p>
