The Board, after finding that the appellant-licensee, Josephine E. Adair, trading as T &amp; R Grill violated the laws of the Commonwealth and/or the regulations of the Board relating to liquor, alcohol and malt or brewed beverages, revoked appellant’s restaurant liquor license. The appellant appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County and, after a <em>de novo </em>hearing on July 31, 1984, that court reversed the decision of the Board and imposed a fine of two hundred dollars ($200.00) in place of the order of revocation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On further appeal, this time by the Board, the Commonwealth Court reversed the lower court order and reinstated the Board’s order revoking appellant’s license. The Commonwealth Court held that the lower court may alter or modify action taken by the Board <em>only </em>when the lower court makes a finding of fact materially different from the findings of the Board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Commonwealth Court concluded that the lower court made no materially different finding of fact, therefore it had no authority to modify or change the penalty of revocation imposed by the Board. After reviewing the record we disagree, and now reverse.</p>

The appellant’s T &amp; R Grill was one of the many places he frequented.</p>
    <p id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[244,669,1158,1503]]]'>On April 19, 1982, Trooper Lagan arrived at the T &amp; R Grill at about 11:40 p.m. Working as a bartender that evening was Cindy McCormick, a young woman with whom Trooper Lagan had developed a relationship. He saw her socially after working hours 8 or 4 times a week. Trooper Lagan proceeded to the bar and had a conversation with Ms. McCormick. Ms. McCormick told him that she was upset because she and a friend put up $25 each to buy one-half (V2) gram of cocaine. After the purchase she and her friend discovered that they received only one-quarter (Vi) gram. Trooper Lagan asked Ms. McCormick about the availability of additional cocaine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> He indicated that he was interested in obtaining one or two grams. Ms. McCormick, reacting to Trooper Lagan’s inquiry, left the bar and checked with her friend who, at the time, was in the ladies restroom. She returned to the bar area and told Trooper Lagan that no more cocaine was available. She then handed him a package which contained five milligrams of cocaine — enough for one “snort.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Trooper Lagan offered to pay for the cocaine, but Ms. McCormick refused to accept anything for it. She gave the cocaine to him as a gift, motivated by her affection for him. She was under the impression that Trooper Lagan was her “boyfriend,” as her social and personal contacts with him led her to fall in love with him. Trooper Lagan, fulfilling his duties as a police officer, arrested Ms. McCormick and charged her with delivery of cocaine. Subsequently, she entered a plea of guilty to that charge.</p>

The lower court made these additional findings so that, following previous Superior Court and Commonwealth Court decisions, it could exercise its discretion and revise the penalty of revocation imposed by the Board. The lower court, in thus exercising its statutory discretion, concluded that under all of the circumstances of the case, the severe penalty of revocation was unwarranted.</p>

According to the Commonwealth Court, this was the only material fact in the case and, on this point, the lower court’s finding did not differ from that of the Board’s. Thus, the Commonwealth Court held that the Lower Court lacked the authority to change the penalty imposed by the Board.</p>

The language of the Code is clear and unambiguous. Its provisions do not require that the court make different findings or reach different conclusions in order to reject, alter or modify the conclusions and penalties of the Board.

The appellant raises two additional issues in this appeal: First appellant argues that she was denied due process of law because the citation issued by the Board was so vague as to prevent an adequate defense. The lower court dismissed this issue by stating that the appellant made no objection to the lack of specificity in the citation prior to the hearing before the Board. Further, the appellant participated in the hearing before the Board, heard all of the testimony offered to establish a violation, and was fully aware of the charge prior to the <em>de novo </em>hearing before the lower court. We find no error in the lower court’s ruling. Second, the appellant argues that the lack of specificity in the Board's opinion prevented the lower court from giving a meaningful review. The record shows that the lower court did order the Board to file an amended opinion containing more specific findings of fact and the Board complied, albeit minimally and late. Furthermore, the lower court conducted a hearing <em>de novo </em>and made its own findings and reached its own conclusions. Although we do not condone vague and non-specific opinions and orders, under the circumstances of this case we find little merit in appellant’s argument.</p>
