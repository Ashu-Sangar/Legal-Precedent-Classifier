The logic of this conclusion appears unexceptional. It is straightforward, and it is familiar to any practicing lawyer. It is deceptively alluring even though the logic produces a result that is at odds with the overriding purpose and intent of Section 8 of the Anti-Injunction Act. Our initial opinion was at war with itself, but the flaw in the logic of Part II thereof is not readily obvious. Upon due reflection, however, I have concluded that Part II comes to an erroneous conclusion because it improperly applies, without expressly saying so, the doctrines of <em>respondeat superior, </em>and vicarious liability to this situation. These are standard doctrines of agency law. They are, however, precisely the doctrines or types of analyses that we are <em>forbidden </em>to apply under Section 8 of our Anti-Injunction Act! To do so <em>sub silentio </em>was error. They crept into use because we chose to employ them in order to address the question of whether Local 107 “paiticipated” in the acts causing the injuries at issue. Under these facts, it was the wrong question to ask. While Section 8 of our statute and Section 6 of the federal statute both use the term “participation in” in apparent reference to a labor organization, surely that term was not meant to provide a back-door invitation to the courts to apply doctrines like <em>respondeat superior </em>which could not be applied directly; nor could it have been intended to be a back-door or loophole available for us to introduce doctrines whose use would effectively dismantle the statutes themselves.</p>

Congress merely aimed to curb such an abusive misapplication of the principle of agency. It did not mean to change the whole legal basis of collective responsibility.

A basis for liability which has entered into the warp and woof of our law, as is true of the responsibility of collective bodies for the acts of their agents, should not be deemed to have been uprooted by an enactment which merely emphasizes that basis and rules out its distortions. 1932 was too late in the day for Congress not to have known that unions, like other organizations, act only through officers, and that unions do not, any more than do other organizations, explicitly instruct their officers to violate the ...

Any organization such as a corporation, a partnership, or an unincorporated association (like Local 107), to the extent that it has a legal existence distinct from that of its members themselves, is a fictitious legal entity. As such, the organization itself can <em>only </em>act through its agent or agents. Officers are merely a special type of agent authorized to undertake specific types of activities. Any time that legal liability is imposed on such an organization, it is vicarious liability or liability based on <em>respondeat superior. </em>The organization is held liable for the acts or derelictions of its agents. Mr. Justice Frankfurter correctly notes that a principal abuse that occurred prior to the passage of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was that unions and their individual members were held liable as co-conspirators when other members engaged in unlawful activity. His contention that, by passing the Norris-LaGuardia Act, Congress had only attempted to modify or correct the application of agency principles in such cases, <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>rather than substantially curtail the application of such doctrines, did not prevail, however. The majority focused on the concept of “authorization” and limited the liability in labor disputes of employer or employee associations or organizations to those situations where unlawful acts were expressly authorized or necessarily followed from a granted authority, or where there was subsequent ratification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Nor can I find that the violent acts necessarily followed from the authority granted by the union to the members directly involved in the misdeeds. The union members involved had express authority to picket from their membership, nothing more. They certainly had no expressed or general authority to engage in violence that I can detect in this record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> I am mindful of Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s argument to the effect that under these standards, a large union would never deliberately authorize or formally and expressly vote to authorize the use of violence or other unlawful tactics that would later <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>give rise to a claim for damages. I agree that formal <em>de jure </em>authorization would seldom, if ever, occur in a large, well counseled union. Nevertheless, <em>de facto </em>authorization would always be a possibility, for example, where the union leadership informally ordered the use of violence without a formal meeting or formal vote. Be that as it may, there is no evidence here that these shootings, or the chaos that led to them, was authorized by the leadership of Local 107, either <em>de jure </em>or <em>de facto. </em>The fact that individual shop stewards, negotiating agents or a picket line manager were involved in the events leading to the shooting does not change the result. There is virtually no evidence that they were ordered or authorized in any way by the leadership, or the full 5,000 person membership of Local 107, to do what they did. There is no evidence whatever that they exercised, or were granted the discretion to exercise, the authority of the Local itself to engage in violence. Moreover, even if the individuals at fault here are to be considered officers of the Local, both Section 8 of the Anti-Injunction Act (as well as Section 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act) expressly excludes organizational liability for “the unlawful acts of individual officers,” as well as the unlawful acts of mere members or agents, unless the organization authorized the acts.

While we originally were of the opinion that Local 107 was liable under this language, which we held was to be applied with reference to the number of persons involved in the illegal acts, the status of these persons in the organization, and whether the organization was aware of and in a position to exercise control over such acts, I now recognize, as explained above, that we improperly adopted standards necessarily involving the agency law concepts of vicarious liability and <em>respondeat superior </em>to answer the question. Does the participation concept now retain any vitality aside from using agency law principles to apply it, however, and if not, are we reading a clause out of Section 8 of our statute? My review of cases in other jurisdictions with <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>respect to the concept of participation provides few guidelines. My reading of the language of our own statute, however, as well as that of the federal Act, inevitably draws me to the observation that neither statute is drafted as carefully as one might wish. I think it can be plausibly argued that the term “actual participation in” in our statute is meant to refer to the exposure to liability of an individual officer or member; and that an association or organization can only be found liable for damages if it authorized or ratified the unlawful acts. This certainly would be a more natural use of the English language, that is, to read the statute to the effect that individuals (but not legal entities themselves) participate in illegal activity. The statutes were drafted conjunctively, of course, and potential organizational liability was disposed of in the same sentence in which potential individual liability is also mentioned. Whether my reading is accurate or not (and it must be conceded that our statute recognizes that an association or organization may be “participating or interested in a labor dispute” — although this implies a formal, authorized, organizational type of participation), I, nevertheless, remain convinced on the basis of <em>United Brotherhood of Carpenters </em>that an organization’s participation cannot be determined under our statute by reference to principles of vicarious liability or <em>respondeat superior </em>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> What <em>is </em>left, however, is the possibility that the vast majority of a union’s members (or employer strike breakers) break rank with their leadership and spontaneously plan or engage in some sort of mob violence.

The courts were called upon to decide how LMRA should be applied where sections of it appeared to conflict with parts of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. In <em>Gibbs, <a href="/us/383/0715-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="383 U.S. 715" data-case-ids="6175285" data-case-paths="/us/383/0715-01">supra,</a> </em>one point of controversy was whether § 301 of the LMRA, which provides that unions be held vicariously liable under standards of agency law, superceded Section 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act — the section indirectly at issue in the instant case. Mr. Justice Brennan’s opinion concluded that Congress intended that Section 6 remain the applicrble test in those situations not specifically within the coverage of the LMRA. In a valiant effort to save the Norris-LaGuardia Act and to coordinate and render consistent the two statutes, Mr. Justice Brennan emphasized the evidentiary aspects of Section 6, holding that the "clear proof” standard of Section 6 meant that a plaintiff must do more than meet the ordinary civil burden of persuasion. The burden is less, however, than the criminal burden of "beyond a reasonable doubt.” This muddle, a result of the chilling effect of LMRA (Taft-Hartley), along with other qualifications in <em>Gibbs, </em>need not concern us, however, since we in Pennsylvania do not have our own version of Taft-Hartley that must be taken into account.
