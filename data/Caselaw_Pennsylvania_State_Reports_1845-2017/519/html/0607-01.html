Testifying that “voices” directed him to act, the Appellant also claimed to have been motivated by some alleged verbal provocation on the part of the victim. An armed security guard, who was a passenger on the bus, drew his weapon and pointed it at the attacker to prevent him from fleeing. Upon being subdued by armed police who arrived quickly at the scene, he was given an abbreviated rendition of <em>Miranda </em>warnings but nevertheless blurted out that “I did it; I’m glad I did it; I will get ten years for it but I hope he dies.” An autopsy revealed that the victim’s fingers and hands, had been mutilated in the defensive act of covering his head. The Appellant was read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings formally at police headquarters after which he confessed once again in writing to the killing. He was twenty-one years old at this time.</p>
    <p id="b830-5" data-blocks='[["BL_830.4",830,[251,1184,1152,637]]]'>Following his arrest and during trial, the Appellant was confined to mental hospitals under authority of the Mental Health Procedures Act, 50 P.S. § 7305 et seq. Because of prior mental illness, he also had been institutionalized as a patient before the killing. He was medicated during all legal proceedings against him. Two court hearings concluded that he was competent to stand trial. His attorney was not permitted to withdraw from the case despite testimony that the Appellant expressed a wish to be executed and that he did not want to be defended. In the midst of these proceedings, the Appellant also threatened witnesses, the prosecutor, and the jury in open court.</p>

Under <em>Regina v. M’Naghten, </em>10 Cl. and Fin. 200, 8 Fug. Rep. 718 (1843), insanity is a defense if the defendant, at the time of the act, was suffering from “such a defect of reason, a disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of his act or, if he did know it, as not to know that what he was doing was wrong.” This is the 'statutory language of 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 315(b).

He was found guilty of that murder and of possession of an instrument of crime. At the penalty stage, the Appellant instructed his defense counsel not to plead any mitigating circumstances. The penalty jury then found two aggravating circumstances under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7), “grave risk of death” to others, and (d)(8), torture, but no mitigating circumstances.

The present allegation derives from this same set of demands that he be executed, threat of non-cooperation with his attorney, the fact that he had been earlier treated for mental disorders, that he remained hospitalized in the care of psychiatrists since his arrest, and that his behavior during trial which included outbursts of laughter, threats to witnesses and the prosecuting attorney, and a public threat to kill members of the jury.

We are confronted, instead, with the circular argument that the sentence itself and the speed with which the jury arrived at a sentence (twenty-eight minutes) speak for themselves, i.e., the severe nature of the sentence can mean only that the jury was controlled by the threat and decided to eradicate its source in the interests of personal safety. That argument must fail. There is simply no reason advanced in this appeal to distrust the validity of the jury’s finding.

Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth v. Albrecht, supra, </em>this particular aggravating circumstance was affirmed where the defendant had been convicted of the intentional killing of his wife by arson which also had claimed the lives of his daughter and mother. <em>Stoyko’s, supra, </em>facts led to a finding of a grave risk of death to others where the defendant shot his victim in a car carrying other passengers.</p>

On the other hand, there are no objective facts which could be employed to justify a finding of torture. The Appellant’s conduct was aimed at killing his victim outright. The fact that the victim sought to defend himself by putting his hands over his head is not proof of torture. Without any factual evidence to demonstrate torture, we decide, therefore, to reverse the penalty jury on the specific finding of the aggravating circumstance of torture under § 9711(d)(8). Under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(l)(v), we affirm the death penalty where there is one aggravating circumstance but no mitigating circumstance.</p>

    <p id="b853-10" data-blocks='[["BL_853.11",853,[163,1145,1154,688]]]'>The first question is whether that issue can be fairly tried.

In determining that question a court cannot decide solely upon the conduct as alleged or conceded by the accused, i.e., that because the conduct itself outrages normal expectations the accused is incompetent to stand trial. There must be more than seeming bizarre methods; otherwise active criminal intent could be hidden simply by the method employed. Some evidence beyond the method employed must be presented, and one cannot avoid trial simply because they say they are insane or incompetent at the time of the crime.</p>

His bizarre behavior throughout trial did not indicate a man who sought to further his <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>own best interests. Instead, it evinced a man who viewed the trial as a means of hastening his demise. To cooperate with counsel would have hindered the attainment of that end. Were defendant able to choose that end of his own unaffected volition, I would have no qualms with the majority’s resolution of this appeal. <em>See Commonwealth v. Appel, </em><a href="/pa/517/0529-02" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="517 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1809864,1809879" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0529-02,/pa/517/0529-01">517 Pa. 529</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=589%20A.2d%20780" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="589 A.2d 780">589 A.2d 780</a> (1988) (holding that a defendant could seek the death penalty where his choice was voluntary). But this certainly was not such a case. To permit the judicial system to now serve as a tool for allowing this defendant to attain his. demented goal of self-annihilation is violative of the moral and legal dictates of our society which abhors suicide in any manner, even in cases of terminally ill persons whose death is viewed as merciful. Because appellant could not rationally choose to aid in his defense, I would find that appellant was not competent to stand trial in 1982 in this matter. Moreover, I would find that he had been completely deprived of his right to a fair trial because of his profound mental illness.</p>
    <p id="b864-5" data-blocks='[["BL_864.4",864,[252,1344,1151,904]]]'>It has been argued in contradiction to this position that a competency standard which would take into consideration the inability of a defendant to fathom his own best interest would be unmanageable. I must disagree. The inability of a defendant to act in such a way as to further his best interest, like the two recognized areas of incompetency, can only be found where a qualified mental health expert has testified in an unequivocal manner to the existence of this defect. For this reason, it will be no easier for a defendant to delay the criminal proceedings against him because of this mental defect than because of his inability to understand the nature of the proceedings or to assist counsel. This standard will simply add an additional inquiry to those presently demanded of a trial court in determining competency. I do not believe this to be an excessive burden in light of the grave constitutional ramifications of trying a mentally incompetent defendant.</p>

It can be said without argument that it is in the best interest of every man to live, and not to engage in conduct certain to bring about his own death. Although this proposition is general, I do not believe that that makes it impossible for a trial court to determine, during the course of the trial, that certain behavior on the part of the defendant would have no other effect than to assure him a sentence of death. Such was the case in the instant appeal. One cannot legitimately argue that appellant’s repeated outbursts, strewn with profanity and threats of violence to witnesses and jurors, would bring about any other sentence but death. The fact that the jury deliberated only 28 minutes on whether to enter a sentence which would deprive a man of his very life is clear testament to this.</p>

However, the credibility of a witness has always been in the province of the factfinder, <em>see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Seese, </em><a href="/pa/512/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="512 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1800481" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0439-01">512 Pa. 439</a>, 443, <a href="/pa/512/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="512 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1800481" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0439-01">517 A.2d 920</a>, 922 (1986), and we should not presume this defendant’s conduct contrived because some others’ might be. Moreover, where the record is devoid of any indication of incompetency up to that point, including expert testimony from mental health professionals, the trial court could be certain that this sudden destructive behavior was a product of fabrication, and could rule accordingly. That is not the instant case. Appellant’s threat to the jury was not an isolated incident, but was proceeded by a history of mental illness, numerous outbursts and instances of inappropriate behavior both during trial and at the time of arrest, a crime which manifested a very diseased mind, and the unequivocal testimony of a psychiatrist who had observed appellant on several occasions and predicted that this disruptive behavior would in fact occur.</p>
