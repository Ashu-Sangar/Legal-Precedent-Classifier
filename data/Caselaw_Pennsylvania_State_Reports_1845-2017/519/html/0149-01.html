He pulled back the shower curtain and, for ten to fifteen seconds, observed Appellee in front of him. He was clad in a ragged, off-colored shirt and red, cut-off sweat pants. Mr. Kosanovich saw no gun. He yelled. Appellee ran. Mr. Kosanovich called the police.

First, appellee matched the general description of the rapist. Second, the rapist also burglarized that victim’s home. Third, he displayed and threatened her with a small caliber gun. Fourth, appellee’s car was found after his arrest, only eight doors from the rape victim’s home. Fifth, appellee broke into a house only <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>two blocks away from his rape victim’s home, some three and one half hours later. Sixth, sightings from various residents in the neighborhood indicated that the rapist was still in the vicinity in the period between the rape and appellee’s arrest. Seventh, when appellee fled Mr. Kosanovich’s home, he ran to the adjacent woods where he was subsequently shot and captured. Eighth, several months subsequent to these events, within one hundred yards of the place of apprehension, a burglary tool box, a light weight blue jacket and a small caliber gun which the rape victim identified as being similar to the one used by her assailant were found. Ninth, after his apprehension while in a local hospital, appellee admitted to the police that he was in the neighborhood to “do some jobs,” i.e., commit some burglaries. Tenth, appellee’s blood type put him in a class of 14.4% of the black population who might have been the rapist.</p>
    <p id="b376-5" data-blocks='[["BL_376.4",376,[236,1226,1153,935]]]'>From all of the foregoing, a strong inference is raised that the rapist was the same man who broke into Mr. Kosanovich’s home. It strains credulity to suggest that there may have been another black man matching appellee’s general description and clothing in the same 14.4% class of “Type B secretors” who pulled another “job” two blocks away some three and one-half hours earlier. The cumulative effect of the various pieces of circumstantial evidence, considered with all reasonable inferences and conclusions drawn from that evidence, narrows the class of possible rapists to appellee. A critical link in this chain of circumstantial evidence is forged by the inference and logical conclusion that the first victim’s rapist/burglar remained in the neighborhood despite (or perhaps because of) the extensive police search, and that two blocks away several hours later, appellee was positively identified as breaking into a neighbor’s home, presumably either to rob it or to hide from the police.</p>
