Riding as passengers in the automobile with him were two of his friends, Wilfredo Colon and Miguel Rivera. The appellant ran through a stop sign at forty to fifty m.p.h. at the intersection of Franklin Street and Clearfield Streets. As the appellant proceeded south on Franklin toward the next intersection, both of his passengers told him to slow down. The appellant ignored their remarks about the speed of the car and ran through a <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>second stop sign, this one at the intersection of Franklin Street and Indiana Avenue. He violently struck the side of a Datsun automobile which was proceeding on Indiana Avenue through that intersection.</p>
    <p id="b336-5" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[232,535,1151,845]]]'>At the time of the accident, Philadelphia police officers were in the neighborhood on an unrelated matter and heard the noise generated by the force of the collision. The officers drove to the intersection of Franklin Street and Indiana Avenue where they observed a heavily damaged Datsun containing two unconscious male occupants and a green Chevrolet damaged in the front. The appellant was sitting behind the steering wheel of the green Chevrolet. Because of the obvious injuries to the occupants of the Datsun and the fact that they would have to be forcibly removed from the twisted vehicle, the investigating officers radioed for rescue personnel. When the rescue personnel arrived on the scene, they immediately went to work extricating the injured young men from the Datsun. Both of the occupants of the Datsun eventually died from the extensive injuries received in the accident.</p>
    <p id="b336-6" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[228,1399,1152,742]]]'>When the rescue personnel began their work the officers went over to the Chevrolet and there observed the appellant Gonzalez still sitting behind the steering wheel. The officers asked the appellant if he was hurt. The appellant responded that he was not injured. The officers then requested that he step out of the vehicle which he did. The officers asked the appellant what happened. The appellant replied that he was driving south on Franklin Street, went through a stop sign and struck the other car. (N.T., p. 12.) As the appellant gave this information to the officers, they noticed a strong odor of alcohol emanating from the appellant. The officers noticed that appellant’s eyes were watery and blood shot; that his conduct was stuporous and sleepy; and, he was unsteady and swaying. (N.T., p. 13.)</p>

The appellant was placed under arrest shortly after one o’clock in the morning. He was transported to the district station house and then eventually to the Police Administration Building.</p>
    <p id="b337-4" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[208,614,1151,582]]]'>At the Police Administration Building appellant was observed for twenty minutes and then given a breathalyzer test. It was 3:24 a.m. when the breath test was administered. Two samples were taken. The first sample registered a reading of .082 percent. The second sample registered a result of .087 percent. Next, the appellant was taken across the street to Metropolitan Hospital where he gave his consent to a blood test. Blood samples were withdrawn from the appellant at 3:44 a.m. Tests on the blood samples revealed a blood alcohol content of .09 percent.</p>
    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[208,1235,1151,522]]]'>The appellant was charged with and eventually tried for driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, two counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of homicide by vehicle, and two counts of homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence. At trial, the prosecution called as an expert witness, Corporal Thomas McGonigal, a police veteran of twenty-eight years. Corporal McGonigal was called to give testimony “relating back” the blood alcohol of the appellant to the time of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b337-6" data-blocks='[["BL_337.6",337,[207,1795,1151,582]]]'>Over the objection of the appellant, Corporal McGonigal was qualified as an expert. Over further objection of appellant, Corporal McGonigal testified concerning the absorption of alcohol into the human blood stream and the elimination rate of alcohol from the blood stream. He concluded by opining that based upon the appellant’s blood alcohol of .09 percent at 3:44 a.m., and assuming that his blood alcohol percentage was declining during the three hours that elapsed from the time of the accident to the time of the test, the appellant’s blood alcohol at the time of the accident could have been .125 percent.</p>

Appellant was found not guilty of homicide by vehicle. On the two counts of homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence, appellant was sentenced to a term of 3 to 6 years imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. On the two counts of involuntary manslaughter, appellant was sentenced to a 2V2 to 5 years term of imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently with each other and with the sentence for homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence. Sentence was suspended on the charge of driving under the influence. On appeal to the Superior Court, judgments of sentence for involuntary manslaughter were vacated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The judgments of sentence for homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence were affirmed.

The appellant responded that he was not injured. The officers then asked him what happened. Appellant answered by stating that he was driving south on Franklin Street, that he went through a stop sign and struck the other automobile. The trial court, citing <em>Commonwealth v.

He was the only one known to be involved in the accident who was conscious and able to talk to them. The officers made two logical inquiries of the appellant: Are you hurt and, what happened?</p>

Corporal McGonigal testified that the percentage of alcohol in the blood peaks when all of the alcohol that was ingested is absorbed into the bloodstream. Generally, it takes from 30 to 90 minutes for alcohol to be fully absorbed and reach its peak level. <em>Commonwealth v.

Corporal McGonigal testified further that in order to know when the appellant reached his peak alcohol level, it is essential to know when he consumed his last drink. The evidence fails to disclose when the appellant drank that last drink prior to operating his vehicle through the stop sign at Indiana Avenue and Franklin Street and ramming the Datsun. The appellant argues that since there is no evidence as to when that last drink was taken, we do not know if appellant’s blood alcohol was increasing or declining at the time of the <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>accident. Thus, appellant concludes that when Corporal McGonigal assumed that appellant’s blood alcohol level had peaked prior to the accident, the witness assumed a fact not in evidence rendering his testimony inadmissible.</p>

On the contrary, the Commonwealth contends that from the facts in evidence, a jury could infer that the appellant had reached his peak alcohol level prior to the accident. The Commonwealth points to the following evidence to support this contention: (a) Appellant had nothing to drink from the time he picked up his two passengers (Colon and Rivera) at 12:30 a.m.; (b) appellant was driving at an excessive rate of speed in a residential neighborhood; (c) he sped through two stop signs without slowing down; (d) his passengers stated that immediately prior to the accident, the appellant seemed to “be in another world,” with his mind “somewhere else”; (N.T. pps. 98 &amp; 157) (e) at the scene of the accident the investigating officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol emanating from the appellant; (f) the officer also observed that appellant’s eyes were watery and bloodshot, he was acting stuporous and sleepy, (g) he was swaying and sagging as he stood outside the vehicle, and (h) in the opinion of the police officers he was incapable of safely driving an automobil‘e.

All of the evidence that the Commonwealth claims supports the inference that appellant’s blood alcohol level had peaked prior to the accident is merely the traditional kind of testimony ordinarily introduced to establish that the accused was driving under the influence.

We agree. We, however, do not view the witness’ testimony as resting upon such assumption. The witness did not state that the appellant’s blood alcohol percentage at the time of the accident was .125. He stated that <em>if it was assumed </em>appellant’s blood alcohol content peaked prior to the accident, then it was possible that his blood alcohol percentage was .125 at the time of the accident. He went on to state that the only thing he could say for sure is that the appellant’s blood alcohol content was declining at the time of the test because the test was administered over three hours after the accident and the appellant had no alcoholic beverage to drink during that three hour period. (N.T. pps. 2-96 &amp; 2-99) The testimony the witness gave was based on the facts in evidence. Where the facts were deficient, the witness so stated.

The testimony of Corporal McGonigal was relevant in that it did tend to advance the inquiry as to a fact in issue, namely, whether the appellant was driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of § 3731(a)(1). There is no question that the result of the chemical test of appellant’s blood that showed a .09 percentage three hours after the accident was admissible.

The chemical test of the blood of appellant was taken 3 hours after the accident and it showed a blood alcohol percentage of .09. The evidence further indicated that alcohol is eliminated from the bloodstream at the rate of .015 per hour after reaching its peak level. Whether the appellant peaked just before the accident, shortly after the accident or ninety minutes after the accident, the fact finder could find that he was driving with alcohol in his system. Further, considering Corporal McGonigal’s testimony along with the evidence of appellant’s condition at the scene of the accident — the odor of alcohol about the appellant, appellant’s bloodshot and watery eyes, his stuporous and sleepy state, his swaying and sagging as he stood outside of his automobile — the fact finder could conclude that appellant was driving under the influence of alcohol. Just as the evidence of bloodshot eyes, stuporous conduct, unsteady posture and an odor of alcohol was relevant and admissible, the testimony of Corporal McGonigal was admissible and advanced the inquiry with respect to the charge against the appellant that he violated § 3731(a)(1) by driving under the influence of alcohol. That testimony, though, was inadmissible and not probative of the charge against the appellant that he was driving with a blood alcohol content of .10 percent or more in violation of § 3731(a)(4).
