We answer that question in the affirmative. The essential facts are as follows.</p>

USS manufactured steel products at the Lorain Works by the open-hearth method until 1971 and by the basic oxygen process method thereafter. Both methods produce slag, a mixture of metallic and non-metallic material, as a necessary by-product. Prior to September, 1961, <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>USS dumped its Lorain Works’ slag at the East Fill dump site on its premises.</p>
    <p id="b233-4" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[206,457,1150,586]]]'>Spang &amp; Company (Spang) is a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in Butler, Pennsylvania. Spang is successor in interest by merger to its former wholly owned subsidiary, Ferroslag Process Corporation. Spang developed and patented a commercially viable process for crushing and separating slag into metallic and non-metallic components. Recovered metal scrap can be reused in the steelmaking process or sold to third parties, and the non-metallic slag residue (“processed slag”) can be used and sold to third parties for use as aggregate, ballast and other construction purposes.</p>
    <p id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[205,1076,1151,641]]]'>USS and Spang (through Ferroslag) entered into a contract in June, 1960, which, through extensions and with various modifications, lasted until termination on February 28, 1982. Pursuant to contract, Spang built and operated a processing plant at the Lorain Work’s East Fill site which processed slag both from current steelmaking operations and from mining slag previously dumped in the East Fill, which had been, to a limited extent, processed by other contractors. In 1962, the contract was amended to provide for erection of a screening plant to “size” the processed slag to certain specifications and to load and weigh processed slag for sale to third parties.</p>
    <p id="b233-6" data-blocks='[["BL_233.6",233,[204,1749,1151,634]]]'>USS paid Spang upon delivery for the metal scrap recovered from the unprocessed slag, but the contract provided that USS would pay Spang for the non-metallic processed slag only upon sale by USS to third parties. During the 1961-1982 period, Spang’s operating records indicate it processed 7,731,468 tons of crushed and sized non-metallic slag, of which USS sold 5,849,378 tons to its customers. Some of the unsold processed slag was placed in a “buffer strip” at the Lorain Works to help keep down dust and noise that had been annoying residents of a nearby municipality. Other such slag was used for roadways and other construction purposes on the site.</p>

However, until 1969 no provision had been made for any payment to be made on processed slag unsold and remaining in USS’s inventory upon termination of the contract. In 1969, the following clause was added which, in substantially similar form through subsequent amendments, remained part of the contract throughout:</p>

However, the corporations extended the contract through February 28, 1982. A letter of October 23, 1981 from Spang to USS confirmed the terms of the extension agreement, and set “unit prices” for newly invoiced items in “the customary way,” except for a “30% surcharge” which would be refunded in the event USS executed an additional five year contract with Spang. This letter further specified:</p>

Spang’s intention was “that the surcharge apply only to those items which are associated with our current operations,” not to “products in inventory” (i.e., not to previously processed but <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>unsold non-metallic slag). By letter of December 14, 1981, USS confirmed the extension of the contract through February 28, 1982, stating: “The extension was issued in accordance with verbal agreements as confirmed in your letters of October 23, 1981 and November 11, 1981.”</p>

    <p id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[191,942,1150,364]]]'>USS did not pay Spang the invoiced claim for processed slag in inventory and, in fact, declined to make any payments for any of the processed slag in inventory. On September 2,1982, Spang filed a complaint in assumpsit for $4,176,358.00 plus interest in the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County. A non-jury trial before the Honorable George P. Kiester began in June 1984.</p>
    <p id="b235-6" data-blocks='[["BL_235.6",235,[189,1324,1151,737]]]'>The principle issue at trial was whether Spang had suffered any damages, and if so, how much damage. Spang introduced business records of its operating figures for the contractual period in question. These figures showed the amount of processed non-metallic slag that Spang had delivered to USS during the course of the contract (7,731,468 tons). From that figure, Spang subtracted the processed non-metallic slag that USS had sold to third parties during the course of the contract (5,849,378 tons) to arrive at the tonnage of 1,882,090 which Spang claimed remained in inventory at the Lorain Works. This processed slag included the 480,000 tons identified as remaining in the East Fill site, plus the slag placed in the buffer strip and on roads and for other uses throughout the site.</p>

Spang’s motion for post-trial relief requested alternative relief on the issue of damages only, arguing that the verdict “leaves Spang uncompensated for its proven injury and permits defendant____to retain the substantial benefits of its established wrongdoing,” and that this result was contrary to legal standards, was inequitable and was against the weight of the evidence. The alternative relief requested was: to enter judgment against USS in an amount determined by the court on evidence which Spang claimed was on the record and provided a reasonably certain measure of damages; to compel USS to render an accounting of processed slag in inventory; or to order a new trial with respect to damages only and/or allow Spang an opportunity to supplement the record.</p>

Holmes, <a href="/pa/486/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="486 Pa. 272" data-case-ids="1757609" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0272-01">supra;</a> Aiken Industries, Inc. v.

Far from an abuse of discretion, this was a just and eminently reasonable exercise of the trial court’s discretion and its authority to correct errors at trial.</p>

Superior Court found the <em>Dilliplaine </em>rationale (i.e., to encourage complete and thorough trial preparation, to provide the lower court with an opportunity to decide objections, exceptions, etc. in the first instance, to provide for more meaningful appellate review, etc.) analogous to the instant case, based on its reasoning that Spang had utterly failed to meet its burden of proving damages and should not be given a “second bite at the apple merely because the party failed to devour the apple at the first attempt.” The analogy fails, however, because Spang demonstrated on its first attempt the existence of substantial damages and offered extensive evidence providing the court with information from which it could have made a fairly reasonable approximation of the amount of processed slag for which USS was obligated to pay Spang.</p>

Superior Court initially remanded this matter to the lower court for clarification of its April 16, 1985 order. On July 1, 1985, that court "clarified” its previous order, stating that Spang’s motion for post-trial relief "is granted limited to the receiving of additional evidence on the issue of damages as explained in the opinion accompanying the order of April 16, 1985." Spang asserts that the instant appeal should be dismissed because USS did not file a new notice of appeal from the July 1, 1985 order which "superceded” the April 16, 1985 order. We find this hypertechnical argument to be without merit.</p>

This too is without merit. The lower court’s verdict of December 5, 1984 was entered on its docket, and all requisites for an appealable order have been met. Pa.R.A.P. Rule 301. Moreover, as the Honorable William F. Cercone correctly held in dismissing Spang’s motion to quash which it filed in <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>Superior Court, an appeal may be taken as of right from any order in a civil trial awarding a new trial.
