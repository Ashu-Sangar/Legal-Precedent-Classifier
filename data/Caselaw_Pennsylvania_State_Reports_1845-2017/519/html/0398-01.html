These types of harms usually associated with a public school teachers’ strike were not unknown or unimaginable when the legislature prohibited courts from interfering with such strikes unless or until a clear and present danger or threat to the public health, safety or welfare were presented, and the legislature could not have equated the former harm with the latter clear and present danger or thréat.

In fact, the majority transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary and renders the right to strike almost illusory for, as Judge Narick observes, school boards will be able to negotiate with recalcitrance secure in the knowledge that, as soon as the magic 180 day period is actually or nearly threatened, the board will be able to trot out the standard laundry list of inconveniences and disruptions normally associated with any strike by school teachers to obtain an injunction. The long overdue and well justified advances in some public school teachers’ careers conditions and salaries, which have come about only recently through Act 195 and the right to strike, may prove fleeting in light of today’s majority opinion. I urge the legislature to take prompt action to preserve the hard fought gains of this Commonwealth’s front line soldiers in the war against ignorance and anarchy.</p>

By focusing its attention on the inconveniences to the students which accompany the shortened duration of the school year caused by a teachers’ strike, the majority has effectively created a per se rule that the inability to schedule 180 days of instruction constitutes a clear and present danger to the health, safety or welfare of the public.</p>
    <p id="b629-4" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[231,950,1152,808]]]'>The student inconveniences detailed by the superintendent for the school district are the inevitable consequences of a strike which continues for such a period of time that it affects the 180 day requirement. By sustaining the grant of a preliminary injunction on the basis that those student inconveniences demonstrate a clear and present danger to the public, the majority has insured that injunctions will issue when the duration of the strike threatens the 180 day requirement. The majority is careful to emphasize that the economic threat of the loss of state subsidies is insufficient in itself to warrant the issuance of an injunction. This distinction is of no consequence. A teachers’ strike which lasts long enough to create that economic threat will always give rise as well to the student inconveniences which concern the majority.</p>
    <p id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[228,1791,1150,588]]]'>I do not equate the inconveniences to students with a “clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public.” Nor do I agree with the majority that the health and welfare of the student is not a concern separate from the legislative concern for the public at large. The disruptive effect of a teachers’ strike upon students is properly a matter for concern. In enacting the Public Employee Relations Act, (PERA), 43 P.S. §§ 1101.101-1101.-2301, however, .the Legislature weighed the competing interests which would be affected by the legislation in favor of permitting teachers to strike.</p>

The public at large does not share the individualized and personalized concerns of the student population. Nor are the terms synonymous. Nevertheless, the majority superimposes student inconveniences upon public welfare. In doing so, the majority places student inconveniences in a preeminent position and relegates the teachers’ right to strike to a secondary concern. This is contrary to the legislative intent.</p>
