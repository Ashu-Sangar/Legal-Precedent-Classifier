Miceli, Charles Minnich and Leander Krist, token claimants, appeal from a Commonwealth Court order affirming a decision of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board) that denied them, and all other similarly situated employees of Intervenor, Quaker Oats Company (Quaker Oats), unemployment compensation benefits. At stake in this appeal is the eligibility of the union employees of Quaker Oats for unemployment compensation <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>benefits for the weeks ending April 28, 1979 through May 26, 1979. During that time a labor dispute existed between Quaker Oats and the employee’s bargaining representative, the Cereal Workers Directly Affiliated Local Union No. 221, AFL-CIO (Union). The Board concluded that the claimants were ineligible for benefits because their unemployment for the relevant period was due to a strike rather than a lockout within the meaning of section 402(d) of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, Act of December 5, 1936, P.L. 2897, as amended, 43 P.S. § 802(d) (1964). The Commonwealth Court reached the same conclusion and affirmed the Board’s decision. Thus, we are faced with the question of whether the work stoppage during the period for which benefits are sought was the result of a strike or a lockout. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the work stoppage resulted from a lockout by Quaker Oats leaving the claimants eligible for benefits. We therefore reverse.</p>

    <p id="b733-5" data-blocks='[["BL_733.5",733,[176,1417,1153,634]]]'>In February, 1979, Quaker Oats and the Union were parties to two collective bargaining agreements. Together these agreements covered approximately 375 hourly production, maintenance, shipping and laboratory employees at the Quaker Oats production and distribution facilities in Shiremanstown, Pennsylvania. One of these agreements was due to expire on March 31, 1979 and the other on April 1, 1979. Negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement to replace the two agreements began in late February," 1979. Although the parties met at various times in February and March, they were unable to reach a new agreement before the existing ones expired.</p>

The memorandum of agreement provided further that the Union would not strike and Quak<a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>er Oats would not lock out the employees without 24 hours prior written notice to the other side. Quaker Oats and the Union continued negotiations and met in negotiating sessions on April 5, 9 and 17. No progress toward a new agreement was made at these sessions. On April 20 the parties met and Quaker Oats informed the Union that many of the employees were refusing to work overtime and if the refusals continued it would cause severe production problems in the plant. The Union indicated that it was unaware of any such problem and agreed to actively urge its members to accept overtime work. The Union carried out its promise in this regard. On April 25,1979, Quaker Oats and the Union held another bargaining session. At this meeting Quaker Oats raised questions concerning, (1) the employees refusal to work overtime, (2) an alleged concerted work slowdown by the employees and (3) incidents of alleged sabotage of equipment in the plant. On April 26, 1979, Quaker Oats delivered written notice to the Union that all employees represented by the Union would be locked out effective 7:00 o’clock a.m., April 28, 1979. Quaker Oats rejected the Union’s unconditional offer to continue to work and, in so doing, stated: “At this time we have no reason to expect that normal operations could be resumed should the plant be reopened.” (R.R. p. 253a.)</p>
    <p id="b734-4" data-blocks='[["BL_734.4",734,[238,1593,1152,778]]]'>The claimants, idled by the work stoppage, sought unemployment compensation benefits. Their applications were approved by the Office of Employment Security. Quaker Oats appealed and obtained a hearing. On August 23,1979, the appeal was heard by a referee. In a decision handed down November 20, 1979, the referee affirmed the determination of the Office of Employment Security allowing benefits. On appeal to the Board the referee’s decision was affirmed. On further appeal, the Commonwealth Court found that the referee’s decision lacked findings of fact needed to support its conclusion. The Commonwealth Court therefore reversed and remanded for additional findings of fact. <em>Quaker Oats Co. v.

Accordingly, the Board reversed the decision of the referee and denied unemployment benefits. The claimants appealed the Board’s decision to the Commonwealth Court which affirmed. <em>Miceli v.

Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, supra., </em>we had occasion to consider the burden of proof in unemployment compensation cases involving a work stoppage, where we said: “When ... the work stoppage takes the form of a strike, <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>the burden is upon the union to show that it made the initial ‘peace’ move by offering to continue the status quo.” <a href="/pa/430/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="430 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1915682" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0101-01">430 Pa. at 104</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=242%20A.2d%20454" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="242 A.2d 454">242 A.2d at 456</a>. Thus, where the Union membership votes to withhold services and the work stoppage is in the nature of a strike, claimants have the burden of showing that it was the employer who first refused to continue under the status quo. If such proof is produced, the withholding of services would not disqualify them for benefits. Conversely, where, as here, the work stoppage takes the form of a lockout, the burden is upon the employer to show that it was the claimants who first refused to continue operations under the status quo. It is logical and fair that the burden of proof be on the employer when the employer has locked out the employees. After all, in such a case, it is the employer who took the action that caused the work stoppage. If there is an explanation of that action involving evidence that the employer’s act was preceded by a refusal on the part of labor to maintain the status quo, then it is the employer’s burden to produce such evidence. The claimants should not be made to prove the negative of that proposition.</p>

Requiring the claimants to prove a negative in these circumstances is not a sound approach.

In order to support the finding, the evidence must establish that under the status quo, refusal of overtime work was not permitted. In other words, it must be shown that required overtime work was part of the pre-existing terms and conditions of employment under the expired bargaining agreements. Clearly, this is not the case. The expired agreements provide for voluntary overtime work which the individual employees were free to accept or decline. The fact that during the month of April, 1979, more of the employees than usual exercised their right to refuse overtime work does not establish an alteration of the status quo on the part of the claimants. The status quo was that the employees had the freedom to accept or reject overtime work. The claimants were operating within that status quo when overtime work was refused during April, 1979 even though the rate of refusal was higher than usually experienced.</p>

Our opinions in <em>Vrotney </em>and <em>Philco </em>limited the status quo to the pre-existing terms and conditions of employment which, as here, are embodied in the expired agreement. The Commonwealth Court’s departure from this relatively clear and simple rule was error. The Commonwealth Court said: “[T]he working of overtime by employees constituted one aspect of the status quo ...” We disagree. The pre-existing terms and conditions of employment provided for voluntary overtime work that could be accepted or declined by the individual employees. Nothing more may be required of them when the agreement expires. The Commonwealth Court in focusing on the amount of the overtime hours refused prior to the contract expiration as compared to the overtime refusal rate during the month of April after the contract expired introduced a new factor that never was part of the status quo. Observing that the refusal rate was higher in April than at previous times, the Commonwealth Court concluded that this amounted to an alteration of the status quo by the employees. Because under the terms and conditions of the expired contract overtime work was not required, that conclusion is in error. Furthermore, condoning a rule that would require courts to consider factors other than the previous terms and conditions of employment would only complicate the issue and is contrary to our policy to keep the standards regarding disruption of the status quo easy to apply on the administrative level.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

On remand, without any additional evidence being presented, the Board reversed itself, and the referee, and found that the claimants altered the status quo by acts of sabotage toward Quaker Oats’ equipment.

The parties stipulated that production delays and machinery breakdowns occurred at times prior to the contract expiration. Further, at the times of the alleged acts of sabotage, management personnel were present in the plant. Also present were outside independent contractors and their employees. Quaker Oats merely presented a summary of various instances of mechanical failure, equipment malfunction and production delays that occurred during April, 1979 along with its bare opinion that those instances constituted sabotage. The Board’s finding of sabotage based the in-. stances of mechanical failure, equipment malfunction and production delays, and Quaker Oats’ opinion is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>

The majority has taken the simple question of fact, <em>i.e., </em>whether there was a lockout or a strike, and transformed it into a mixed question of fact and law that can only further disrupt an area where disruption is at all costs to be avoided. The attempt to allow the employer, where there is a lockout, or the union, where there is a strike, to justify that lockout or strike under the terms of 402(d) is totally unwarranted. For the purposes of applying section 402(d), the question is not the legitimacy of the employer’s judgment in effecting a lockout, or the union’s justification in declaring a strike.

In those cases where the issue centers upon the nature of the work stoppage, it is legitimate to inquire into the motives of the respective sides in determining the character of the work stoppage. In this case, the Opinion seeks to establish the dangerous precedent of introducing into the <em>Vrotney </em>formula the justification, or lack of it, for a lockout and suggests its relevance in the ultimate determination as to the entitlement of the employees to unemployment compensation benefits. Once it is deter<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>mined that the resulting work stoppage was a result of a strike or a lockout, any further inquiry as to why the particular side acted in such a manner is irrelevant.</p>

      <p id="b746-7" data-blocks='[["BL_746.7",746,[319,1625,1086,624]]]'>The effect of the latter argument is to interject a good faith element in the <em>Vrotney </em>formula. The initial acceptance of the <em>Vrotney </em>standard was based on its easy application on the administrative level and at the same time it served the basic policy concerns involved. <em>Vrotney </em>was designed to encourage the continuation of the work relationship under terms previously agreed to by the parties during that difficult period between the expiration of the old agreement and before the new terms of employment had been agreed upon---- Moreover, the administrative units involved in the compensation eligibility decision would have little difficulty in resolving the simple factual question of who first departed from the terms of the expired agreement____ Once we complicate that decision with requirements of ascertaining the good faith or the justification of a party altering the former terms, we create a standard infinitely more difficult to administer, without a corresponding benefit being derived for such a modification.</p>

It should not be interpreted, however, to require an employer to establish in the first instance that its activities did not result from a lockout. The burden of proof of establishing eligibility for benefits rests with the claimant. Upon presentation of sufficient evidence to indicate that the work stoppage resulted from a lockout, the burden of persuasion may shift to an employer, but the burden is not placed upon the employer in the first instance. To the extent that the majority opinion may be interpreted otherwise, I must disagree.</p>
