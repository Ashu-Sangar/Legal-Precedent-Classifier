Moreover, Article I, section 28 requires that “equality of right under the law shall not be denied or abridged.” This mandate precludes us from being content with any procedural safeguard which is inherently ineffective in preventing any type of prohibited discrimination in the jury selection process. I agree with Mr. Justice Marshall that “[mjerely allowing defendants the opportunity to challenge the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges in individual cases will not end the illegitimate use of the peremptory challenge.” <em>Id. </em>476 U.S. at 105, 106 S.Ct. at 1727 (Marshall, J., concurring). Failure to effectively secure the rights guaranteed under Article I, section 26 denies the legitimate expectation of fairness and perpetuates the frustration that minorities have already too long endured.</p>

There ^ rere 14 persons of the black race in the panel from which the selection was made. Only one black juror served as a juror in this case. The arbitrary nature of the concept of peremptory challenges renders it impossible to effectively prevent its use as a discriminatory tool. The willingness of this Court to accept the nondiscriminatory explanation given by the Commonwealth further emphasizes the inadequacy of this remedy. Nor does the fact that it may have been unconsciously injected in this case mitigate the evil involved. This was recognized by Justice Marshall in <em>Batson:</em>

Challenges for cause were designed to assure fair and impartial fact finding tribunals and have adequately served that purpose. Peremptory challenges provide only the gratuitous introduction of an arbitrary element into the process. Because of their inherent arbitrary character, their continued use in criminal trials by either the Commonwealth or defense should no longer be condoned. The mischief is exacerbated when it is permitted in capital trials. Its use by the Commonwealth, to the detriment of the civil rights of a citizen, is unquestionably inappropriate under Article I, section 26 of our Constitution.</p>

The situation was further exacerbated by an attempt to burn the premises to cover these horrendous acts.
