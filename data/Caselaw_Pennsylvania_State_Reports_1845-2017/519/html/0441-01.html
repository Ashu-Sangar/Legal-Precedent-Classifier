After an extensive and at times exasperating colloquy, the Appellant waived his right to a jury trial and pled guilty to three counts of first degree murder and one count of possession of an instrument of a crime with intent to employ it criminally. The Appellant then waived his right to have a jury impaneled for the sentencing proceeding, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(b), and requested disposition by a three judge panel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After reviewing all the evidence, the sentencing panel found two aggravating circumstances, that the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense while committing the subject offense and that the defendant had been convicted of another state offense committed at the time of the offense at issue for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable. The sentencing panel also found two mitigating circumstances, that the appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions and that he was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disburbance at the time of the offense. Weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the panel determined that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and imposed the death sentence.</p>

After separating in December of 1983, the Mosers were divorced on September 13, 1984. The Appellant was quite distraught over the divorce, resulting in him becoming increasingly depressed as well as resentful and angry.

Prior arrangements had been made for the Appellant to take the girls from the church after the services and spend the afternoon with them. On that day, the Appellant placed his rifle in the back of his Toyota hatchback and backed his car into a parking place in the church parking lot. By backing his car into a parking place, the rear of his automobile was protected from view by shrubs and trees. After the church services, Donna and Joanne changed into casual clothing and met the Appellant and their mother in front of the Appellant’s vehicle. A few words were spoken and then Appellant’s ex-wife started walking back to the church. Joanne entered"Appellant’s automobile and sat in the back seat. Donna was standing in front of the automobile. Appellant then walked to the back of his car, removed the rifle and shot Joanne in the head. As a result of the noise, Mrs. Moser turned around and screamed “Oh my God.” At that instant, the Appellant aimed and shot Mrs. Moser in the chest. The Appellant <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>turned again, took aim and shot Donna in the head. Having shot his ex-wife and two daughters, the Appellant then placed the rifle at his side and fired into the air.

There is no question that the Appellant committed the killings as evidenced by his plea of guilty. Furthermore, there is ample evidence to establish the grave risk of harm to those other than the victims. A ballistics expert testified that the range of the Appellant’s rifle was 500 yards. Even at that distance, the rifle would have an estimated velocity of 963 foot pounds of energy. A mere 58 foot pounds of energy is considered disabling. Testimony was also provided by various parishioners situated throughout the immediate area. Although some of the <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>witnesses were not in the line of fire, others were. With regard to one witness positioned in an automobile parked next to the Appellant’s car, and another witness approximately 150 feet in front of the Appellant, behind Mrs. Moser and within the direct site of the Appellant, there is no question that the Appellant presented a risk of harm.

The rifle purchased by the Appellant is designed primarily to be used for big game hunting, such as deer, moose, bear, and other animals of that size. The Appellant was aware of this because he advised the proprietor of the gun shop where the rifle was purchased that he was buying the rifle for deer hunting. In addition, the Appellant’s plan was set at the conclusion of <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>church services in a parking lot in which it is not unreasonable to presume people would be walking.

Finally, the Appellant made arrangements for returning of his employer’s keys, which demonstrated his awareness of the probable result of his actions. Even knowing that a person was parked beside him and that parishioners were walking within the area of his rifle’s deadly capabilities, the Appellant embarked on his plan.

The sentencing panel as the trier of fact heard evidence from two psychiatrists. The court appointed psychiatrist testifying on behalf of the Appellant testified that at the time of the shootings, the Appellant’s capacity to conform his conduct to the law was impaired by mental illness. The Commonwealth’s psychiatrist agreed that the Appellant was suffering from severe emotional distrubances but disagreed with the conclusion that the Appellant lacked the appropriate mental capacity. The sentencing panel found the Appellant’s evidence did not meet the less stringent requirements of the preponderance of the evidence in establishing the Appellant’s lack of mental capacity. The sentencing panel concluded that the Appellant fully appreciated the nature of his actions and had the ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.

He argues that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances mandating life imprisonment. In <em>Commonwealth v. Fahy, </em><a href="/pa/512/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="512 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1800478" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0298-01">512 Pa. 298</a>, <a href="/pa/512/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="512 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1800478" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0298-01">516 A.2d 689</a> (1986), we stated that <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a><a href="/pa/512/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="512 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1800478" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0298-01">512 Pa. at 317</a>, <a href="/pa/512/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="512 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1800478" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0298-01">516 A.2d at 698</a>. Our review of the record supports the sentencing panel’s determination as to the aggravating circumstances. There is no indication that the sentence is the result of any prejudice or other arbitrary factor. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(h)(3)(i). In making its determination the sentencing panel considered the mitigating circumstances it found, but concluded that the gravity of the offense and the aggravating circumstances outweighed the existing mitigating circumstances. As such, this alleged error is meritless.</p>
