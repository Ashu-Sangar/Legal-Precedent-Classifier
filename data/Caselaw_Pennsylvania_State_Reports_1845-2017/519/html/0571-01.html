In connection with the murder conviction, a separate sentencing hearing was held, as required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711, and appellant was sentenced to death. This direct appeal ensued.</p>

    <p id="b797-5" data-blocks='[["BL_797.4",797,[188,386,1154,1285]]]'>The incident from which the convictions arose was one in which a thirty-three year old woman was abducted, raped, and stabbed to death while on her way home from work. On December 15, 1981, at approximately 4:00 p.m., Mrs. Linda Craig departed from a shopping mall where she was employed as a salesperson. She did not arrive at home on time, and, shortly thereafter, her husband and another family member began to search for her. Police were soon notified of Mrs. Craig’s disappearance, and Mrs. Craig’s husband began riding with an officer in a patrol car to further the search efforts. The officer and Mr. Craig found Mrs. Craig’s automobile, a light-colored Chrysler Cordoba with a brown landau roof, parked alongside a desolate roadway in Chichester, Pennsylvania. The automobile was not locked, and the keys were still inside. Mrs. Craig’s pocketbook was on the passenger side, and the console was covered with traces of blood and hair. The next morning, a passerby found Mrs. Craig’s severely beaten body, partially covered by fresh snow, lying in a pool of blood in a nearby church parking lot. The body was partially undressed, and was badly beaten and bruised all over. Six deep stab wounds had been inflicted into vital organs of the chest. Examination of the body and its clothing revealed that the victim had also been raped.</p>

    <p id="b797-7" data-blocks='[["BL_797.6",797,[187,1787,1151,365]]]'>The first pretrial issue is whether the Commonwealth impermissibly withheld from the defense materials which should have been disclosed during discovery. Appellant alleges that portions of various police reports were deleted from the photocopies which were turned over to his counsel, and that the deletions contained material which the Commonwealth was obligated to disclose.</p>
    <p id="b797-8" data-blocks='[["BL_797.7",797,[184,2172,1150,198]],["BL_798.1",798,[235,312,1150,586]]]'>We cannot accept this argument due to appellant’s failure to refer to anything in the record which supports his claim that he received anything less than the full disclosure to which he was entitled under Pa.R.Crim.P. 305. At the <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>commencement of trial, defense counsel made no motion for further discovery or for court inspection of materials allegedly withheld, nor was any such claim raised in post-verdict motions. If, as alleged in appellant’s brief, the Commonwealth withheld portions of police reports, it would be for the trial court, in the first instance, to entertain the question whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue access to the excised material. On the record certified to this Court on appeal, however, there is no support for the allegation that appellant did not receive full discovery under Rule 305.</p>
    <p id="b798-5" data-blocks='[["BL_798.4",798,[234,918,1150,629]]]'>The second pretrial issue is whether the trial court erred in denying appellant’s request for a change of venue, or, alternatively, in denying his request for sequestration of the jury during the trial on the basis of the extensive and allegedly inflammatory publicity surrounding the murder and the trial.

Daugherty, </em><a href="/pa/493/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="493 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="8732463" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0273-01">493 Pa. 273</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="493 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="8732463" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0273-01">426 A.2d 104</a> (1981) and <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b798-6" data-blocks='[["BL_798.5",798,[235,1572,1149,468]]]'>The authorities cited by appellant involved publicity so greatly exceeding the media coverage of this crime and appellant’s trial that we see no basis to apply the holdings in those cases here. The record contains no evidence of extensive, pervasive, or inflammatory reporting which would have required a change of venue or sequestration of the jury; there is thus no justification for the conclusion that the trial judge’s rulings on these questions constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>

In the present case, the evidence of appellant’s guilt is sufficiently strong as to leave no question that guilt has been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, we find no merit in appellant’s contention that, if certain items of evidence were excluded from consideration as having been improperly admitted, the weight of the evidence would then be insufficient. As discussed infra, none of the evidence introduced at trial was improperly admitted.</p>
    <p id="b799-4" data-blocks='[["BL_799.4",799,[183,876,1152,412]]]'>The evidence linking appellant to the crime consisted of, inter alia, the following. Expert testimony established that the rape in question had occurred not more than three hours before the victim’s death, and an analysis of body fluids revealed that the perpetrator had type AB or type B secretions. Such individuals constitute thirteen percent of the male population, and appellant was proven to be a type B secretor.</p>
    <p id="b799-5" data-blocks='[["BL_799.5",799,[177,1317,1155,1066]]]'>There was also testimony from one of the victim’s coworkers, Natalie Barr, that on numerous occasions during the week prior to the crime, appellant had been lingering around the victim’s sales booth at the shopping mall. Appellant exhibited suspicious behavior in the vicinity of the booth, repeatedly coming to the booth and asking the prices of the same merchandise over and over again. The victim had mentioned to her husband that a man was stalking her and staring at her near the booth. Also, Franklin Kaminski, a worker at an adjoining sales booth, testified that the victim had pointed out a man who had been staring strangely at her and scaring her, and the worker recognized appellant as being that man. Further, the Commonwealth introduced evidence that the victim bore a significant resemblance to appellant’s former girlfriend, who had undergone a tumultuous and physically confrontational breakup with appellant during the week before the crime. An inference was created thereby regarding appellant’s motive for focusing attention on the victim and for taking violent actions against her.</p>
    <p id="b800-4" data-blocks='[["BL_800.3",800,[258,324,1150,368]]]'>
      <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>Three days after the crime, appellant demonstrated a suspiciously detailed knowledge of the crime when he visited the sales booth where the victim had been employed, mentioned the victim, and stated, “I heard that she was raped.” At that time, details of the crime had not been released to the public, and the fact that the victim had been raped was not public knowledge.</p>
    <p id="b800-5" data-blocks='[["BL_800.4",800,[256,710,1150,1067]]]'>In the following months, while appellant was being held in the maximum security section of a prison, awaiting trial on unrelated éharges, he made a number of incriminating statements to prison officials and detectives. First, on January 12, 1982, he told Sergeant Murphy, who served as a corrections officer at the prison, and the prison warden that he knew the person responsible for the murder of the saleswoman at the shopping mall. Appellant said that he had taken the person to the mall, and that the person later told him of having murdered the saleswoman. Appellant made similar statements to detectives who were then summoned by the warden. He told detectives that the individual responsible for the crime was his “friend,” James Brisbois, and that Brisbois admitted raping and stabbing the victim and abandoning the victim’s car in Chichester, Pennsylvania. Appellant also said that Brisbois described the car as being a light tan Chrysler Cordoba with a brown landau roof. Law enforcement authorities had not previously released to the public any information about a rape or about the victim’s car having a brown landau roof.</p>
    <p id="b800-6" data-blocks='[["BL_800.5",800,[254,1796,1151,581]],["BL_801.1",801,[207,312,1151,580]]]'>Detectives investigated appellant’s story regarding the culpability of Brisbois, but found that it would have been physically impossible for Brisbois to have been at the crime scene at the relevant time, and, further, Brisbois consented to a blood test which established that he was not the person who had raped the victim. Detectives confronted appellant with this information on January 27, 1982, and, in response, appellant admitted that he had fabricated his earlier statements, and also recanted his earlier story that Brisbois was responsible for the crime. In addition, he told detectives that his relationship with a girlfriend had recently terminat<a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>ed, that he believed he should have killed her, and that he “wanted to destroy the whole world.” A detective then asked several times whether appellant had killed the saleswoman from the shopping mall. After a brief period of silence, followed by an assertion by appellant that he never meant to kill anyone, the following question was posed: “Why did you do it? Why did you kill her?”' Appellant replied, “Why do you think?” The detective responded, “I think you just snapped out,” but appellant made no further reply and soon declined to continue the discussion, stating, “I’ve said too much already.”</p>
    <p id="b801-5" data-blocks='[["BL_801.4",801,[205,911,1150,525]]]'>On February 1, 1982, appellant asked to speak to the corrections officer with whom he had previously discussed the case. He told the officer that he had lied to the detectives, and, when asked why he had not told the truth, appellant said, “But I can’t. I’ll incriminate myself.” Nevertheless, appellant proceeded to tell the corrections officer that he and a “buddy” had abducted the woman from the shopping mall, and that, after appellant raped her, the buddy stabbed her to death. Prison officials then summoned detectives to interview appellant again.</p>
    <p id="b801-6" data-blocks='[["BL_801.5",801,[203,1454,1151,529]]]'>• Appellant told the detectives that he would like to tell them about the crime but expressed reservations about doing so. A detective said, “You didn’t mean to do it, Nick. Things just got out of hand; didn’t they?” Appellant replied, “Yeah, they did. They really just got out of hand.” Declining to discuss the case further, appellant stated, “Anything that I would tell you would hurt me____ I don’t want to tell you something that’s going to put me in jail.” Finally, appellant offered to tell everything he knew, but only if a plea bargain could be arranged.</p>
    <p id="b801-9" data-blocks='[["BL_801.6",801,[202,2002,1149,365]],["BL_802.1",802,[236,304,1151,674]]]'>While in prison, appellant spoke on numerous occasions to a fellow inmate, Charles Cataleno, and made certain highly incriminating statements to him. Aside from asking Cataleno various legal questions about the crime of murder, appellant became very emotional about the murder of the saleswoman from the shopping mall, and said, “If I had the chance again, I never would have killed her.” He also <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>stated, “[T]hey found my blood in her vaginal area.” Appellant then asked Cataleno whether such evidence was sufficient to support a conviction. Appellant expressed concern that all of his alibi witnesses would be forced to commit perjury on his behalf at trial, and urged Cataleno to join the ranks of those willing to testify falsely at trial to aid in his defense. He asked Cataleno to lie about conversations between Cataleno and the corrections officer with whom appellant had discussed the case. Finally, appellant told Cataleno that he was engaged in an attempt to blame someone else for the murder, because the individual to be blamed needed to be “paid back” for previous wrongful actions.</p>
    <p id="b802-5" data-blocks='[["BL_802.4",802,[234,1006,1150,364]]]'>In summary, the present conviction was supported by scientific evidence linking appellant to the rape of the victim, testimony regarding appellant’s behavior toward the victim in the week preceding the crime, and numerous incriminating statements made by appellant to various individuals. We are satisfied that this evidence was more than sufficient to support the jury’s verdict of guilt.</p>
    <p id="b802-6" data-blocks='[["BL_802.5",802,[231,1394,1152,576]]]'>The first allegation of trial error is that an important Commonwealth witness, a detective, should have been sequestered prior to his testimony regarding incriminating statements made to him by appellant. The detective was permitted to hear the testimony of Charles Cataleno, a fellow prisoner of appellant, who testified that appellant had made inculpatory statements to him during his pretrial incarceration. Appellant implies that the detective, upon hearing Cataleno’s testimony, was likely to mold his own account to accord with that of the prisoner. This argument is totally without merit.</p>
    <p id="b802-7" data-blocks='[["BL_802.6",802,[230,1990,1148,364]],["BL_803.1",803,[206,313,1149,207]]]'>The record includes the extensive testimony of Detective Martin at appellant’s preliminary hearing and suppression hearing regarding the inculpatory statements made by appellant. His trial testimony was consistent with his prior sworn testimony at the preliminary hearing and the suppression hearing.

Accordingly, we hold that the trial judge was well within his discretion to deny appellant’s request that Detective Martin be sequestered in order to prevent the fabrication of false testimony.</p>

With the exception of the final factor, this test supports the admission of the convictions of robbery and theft. The offenses are crimen falsi bearing directly on honesty or truthfulness, and both were recent convictions. The offenses did not constitute appellant’s entire criminal history, and evidence of the two convictions was not so extensive that it cast appellant’s character in such a bad light as to impute a strong propensity towards criminal behavior. Moreover, although one of the crimes charged in this trial was robbery, far more attention was focused on the offenses of kidnapping, rape, and murder, so there was no strong connection between the criminal history and the crimes for which appellant was on trial. The age and circumstances of appellant did not present unusual or distinctive problems for the defense. The Commonwealth’s case, while amply sufficient to sustain a conviction, cannot be characterized as overwhelming; the defense did not rely solely on appellant’s testimony, but included the testimony of thirteen other witnesses, twenty-three exhibits, and stipulations. The defense, therefore, clearly possessed the means of presenting its version of the events through witnesses other than appellant. As to the fifth factor, the Commonwealth possessed, and used, limited alternative means of undermining the defendant’s credibility such as his prior inconsistent inculpatory statements made to Cataleno and law enforcement officers. On balance, however, application of the <em>Roots </em>test justifies the trial court’s discretionary decision to permit introduction of appellant’s crimk nal record to impeach his credibility as a witness.<a class="footnotemark">1</a>

The first of these is the claim that it was error to inform the jury, during the guilt phase, of the sentences applicable to first, second and third degree murder. The record indicates that the court did so inform the jury, but at the appellant’s request, it also instructed the jury not to consider the penalties in its deliberation as to the degree of guilt. The 1978 death penalty statute, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711, does not require that the jury be informed of the penalties for the various degrees of murder, as the earlier death penalty statute had, but it also <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>does not prohibit such an instruction.

With respect to the robbery charge, appellant asserts that it was error for the court not to have defined “theft” as an element of robbery. “Theft” is commonly understood as stealing, and the court’s recitation of theft as an element of the crime of robbery is adequate. With respect to kidnapping, the court’s charge set out the elements of kidnapping, and was also sufficient. There is no merit in this claim.</p>

The trial court charged the jury as follows: “If the defendant intentionally used a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim’s body, you may infer from this that the killing was intentional____ When a deadly weapon is intentionally used against a vital part of the human body, malice may be inferred to exist.” Appellant’s claim is the court should have instructed the jury that while an inference of malice or intent is permissible from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body, such an inference should not be drawn if there are circumstances which negate the inference. In this case, appellant kidnapped the victim, raped her, and stabbed her repeatedly. There are no circumstances in the case which negate the inference of malice.</p>

In this case two witnesses testified concerning appellant’s presence in the mall both before and after the murder. One witness, Natalie Barr, who worked at the victim’s sales booth, testified that appellant made certain comments to her about the murder and rape shortly after the crimes occurred. This witness positively identified appellant at trial as the man who had spoken to her, although at the preliminary hearing, she identified appellant but was not “positive.” The other witness, Mr. Kaminski, identified appellant as the man the victim was afraid of and who had been staring at her at the mall. Like Ms. Barr, he positively identified appellant at trial, although he “had somewhat of a doubt” when, prior to trial, he had selected appellant’s photograph from a photo array. He explained that the reason for his doubt was that appellant’s appearance in the photograph was different than his appearance at the mall. In neither case did the witness <em>fail </em>to identify the appellant.

Also, appellant concedes that notice of the prosecution’s intention to seek the death penalty in this case was given to defense counsel two weeks prior to trial. Under these circumstances, we perceive no violation of due process.</p>
    <p id="b821-6" data-blocks='[["BL_821.5",821,[182,1304,1156,975]]]'>Appellant further contends that trial counsel was ineffective at the penalty stage for not presenting expert psychiatric testimony in an effort to establish mitigating circumstances. Counsel presented the testimony of appellant, and of appellant’s mother, at the penalty hearing, and this testimony did reveal appellant’s history of mental and emotional problems. In addition, during the guilt determination phase of trial, the defense introduced through thé testimony of various lay witnesses evidence of appellant’s drug use, mental disorders, and suicide attempts. Appellant contends this constituted an inadequate attempt to prove as mitigating circumstances certain deficiencies in appellant’s mental and emotional state. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2), (3), (8) (mitigating circumstances). Pursuant to a remand order of this Court, an evidentiary hearing was held on this claim of ineffectiveness in January, 1987, and, subsequently, relief was denied by the court below. Examination of the record reveals that the denial of relief was proper.</p>

However, as the court below properly noted in dismissing this claim, at the time of appellant’s trial in 1982 indigent defendants in this Commonwealth were not constitutionally entitled to free assistance of court-appointed experts. <em>See Commonwealth v. Box, </em><a href="/pa/481/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="481 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1747320" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0062-01">481 Pa. 62</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="481 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1747320" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0062-01">391 A.2d 1316</a> (1978). Indeed, it was not until three years after appellant’s trial that the Supreme Court of the United States held that, in certain very limited circumstances, indigent defendants are entitled to have cost-free access to psychiatric experts. <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em><a href="/us/470/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="470 U.S. 68" data-case-ids="11298833" data-case-paths="/us/470/0068-01">470 U.S. 68</a>, <a href="/us/470/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="470 U.S. 68" data-case-ids="11298833" data-case-paths="/us/470/0068-01">105 S.Ct. 1087</a>, <a href="/us/470/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="470 U.S. 68" data-case-ids="11298833" data-case-paths="/us/470/0068-01">84 L.Ed.2d 53</a> (1985). Counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failure to predict changes in the law, <em>Commonwealth v. Garrity, </em><a href="/pa/509/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="509 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="1795394" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0046-01">509 Pa. 46</a>, 55, <a href="/pa/509/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="509 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="1795394" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0046-01">500 A.2d 1106</a>, 1111 (1985), and, hence, defense counsel cannot be faulted for acting in accordance with the law as it existed at the time of trial.</p>
    <p id="b822-5" data-blocks='[["BL_822.4",822,[223,1323,1155,1054]]]'>Further, the evidentiary hearing revealed the types of psychiatric records and expert testimony that counsel allegedly should have presented at the penalty hearing. The court below properly determined, however, that appellant failed to meet his burden of establishing prejudice attributable to counsel’s failure to present such evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Clemmons, <a href="/pa/505/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="505 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1788891" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0356-01">supra.</a> </em>Not only would such evidence have been to an extent repetitive of evidence of appellant’s mental problems adduced from lay witnesses, but it may also have had a detrimental effect on the defense effort to avoid imposition of the death penalty in that it would have portrayed appellant as a highly dangerous person who would be likely to kill again. For example, the records and testimony included fear-inspiring descriptions of appellant as an “anti-social” person who “gains instant gratification” and suffers from “a severe personality disorder,” and as one who is a “moderate to severe drug user.” Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that there is a likelihood that prejudice accrued from the failure to introduce such evidence.</p>

Our review has focused upon cases where there was present the aggravating circumstance set forth in subsection (d)(6) (killing during the perpetration of a felony), and where not one but multiple other concurrent felonies were involved, or where rape or kidnapping were involved, such being the circumstances of the present case where the murder was accompanied by a kidnapping, rape, and robbery. Based upon the sentences imposed in those cases, no excess or disproportionality in the sentence imposed upon appellant is evident. Further, the record does not provide any basis for belief that the sentence imposed was the “product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(i). Accordingly, the sentence must be affirmed.</p>
