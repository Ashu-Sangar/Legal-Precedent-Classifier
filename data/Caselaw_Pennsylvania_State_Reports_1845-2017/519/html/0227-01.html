Shortly after midnight on June 10, 1984, George Hade, while riding his motorcycle, was struck by a van driven by an uninsured motorist. At the time of the accident Hade was employed <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>as a tractor trailer operator. As a result of the accident Hade suffered multiple fractures and injuries, including a severe ankle fracture, which, in the opinion of his physician, rendered him substantially impaired and totally unable to work as a tractor trailer operator.</p>
    <p id="b445-4" data-blocks='[["BL_445.4",445,[193,612,1151,525]]]'>At the time of the accident Hade’s motorcycle, along with his three automobiles, were covered by four motor vehicle liability insurance policies issued by Nationwide. These policies provided that Hade had uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $15,000.00 per policy. In April of 1984, two months prior to the accident, Hade requested his agent to increase his liability coverage to $100,000.00 per policy. The crux of this appeal pivots on the determination of whether Hade also instructed his agent to increase his uninsured motorist coverage to the same amount.</p>

Appellant, on the other hand, argued that the arbitrators must confine themselves to the stated terms of the insurance policies and restrict recovery to $60,000.00 which represented the limit of the stacked policies. Since, as customary, no written opinion accompanied the award, it is difficult to determine the exact basis of the arbitrators’ decision.</p>
    <p id="b446-4" data-blocks='[["BL_446.5",446,[272,1023,1152,843]]]'>On appeal the Superior Court rejected the contention that $300,000.00 was excessive and affirmed the amount of the award. The court found that the award in large part was compensation for the agent’s misleading conduct which resulted in appellee’s misunderstanding as to the extent of his coverage. Additionally, the court stated that any issue related to coverage is within the scope of the arbitration clause, and that a dispute is only outside the clause if it can be said with “positive assurance” that the clause never intended to encompass such an issue. Moreover, the court held that under the facts of the case it could not say with “positive assurance” that the agreement to arbitrate disputes over coverage did not include the misleading acts of appellant’s agent; and since the agent’s conduct went directly to the issue of coverage, the court found a rational relationship between the two and upheld the award.</p>

    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[237,693,1152,459]]]'>The insurance policy in this case provided that the arbitrable issues would extend to disputes relating to an insured’s right to recover damages or to the amount of damages. Allegations of negligent and/or intentional misrepresentations of an agent in obtaining additional coverage are obviously beyond the scope of the arbitrators’ authority under this policy. Such allegations require the arbitrators to consider evidence outside the stated coverage limits of the policy itself.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[232,1170,1153,671]]]'>Where the parties have clearly agreed to arbitrate matters, then every reasonable effort should be made to enforce such an agreement. This will effectuate the unmistakable intent of the parties. In compelling the parties in this case to arbitrate an issue, absent an agreement between them to arbitrate that issue, the Superior Court erred. The Superior Court’s perceived justification for allowing the arbitrators to decide the issue of misrepresentation and to compensate the insured for an agent’s acts is judicial economy. Economy may not be sought, however, at the expense of justice. The Superior Court’s holding deprives litigants of their right to proceed before our courts in instances where arbitration was not contemplated.</p>
    <p id="b450-6" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[231,1857,1150,512]]]'>Subsequent to its decision in this case, the Superior Court again addressed the identical issue in <em>Ostroff v. Keystone Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/357/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="357 Pa. Super. 109" data-case-ids="657149" data-case-paths="/pa-super/357/0109-01">357 Pa.Super. 109</a>, <a href="/pa-super/357/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="357 Pa. Super. 109" data-case-ids="657149" data-case-paths="/pa-super/357/0109-01">515 A.2d 584</a> (1984). In <em>Ostroff, </em>the arbitration clause was similar to that presented herein and stated, “If we and a covered person disagree whether that person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle ... either party.may make a written demand for arbitration.” Interpreting this provision, the Superior Court stated,</p>
    <blockquote id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.3",451,[251,315,1108,520]]]'>
      <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>Therefore, the question before us is whether the arbitrators only had authority to interpret the terms of the policy itself or whether they also had authority to consider external evidence of fraud and misrepresentation and, if finding such evidence to be credible, in effect enlarge the coverage provided by the terms of the policy. We believe that the arbitrators were limited to interpreting the terms of the policy and that consideration of tort theories to enlarge the coverage limited on the face of the policy was improper.</blockquote>

    <p id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[208,915,1151,310]]]'>I agree with the Superior Court’s analysis in <em>Ostroff </em>and would apply it to the present case. Confronted with its conflicting analysis in this case, the Superior Court attempted to distinguish it on the basis that the appellants in <em>Ostroff </em>had continually sought arbitration on the terms of the policy itself. This is a distinction without a difference.</p>
    <p id="b451-7" data-blocks='[["BL_451.6",451,[207,1244,1149,471]]]'>The Superior Court’s attempted distinction defies the principle of law that the parties cannot confer jurisdiction upon a forum. To the extent that the Superior Court’s disparate treatment of <em>Ostroff </em>and the parties before us is based upon the parties’ theory of their case, it is improper. More likely, however, the Superior Court’s decision in <em>Ostroff </em>was intended to avoid perpetuation of the error made in this case. With that action, I heartily concur and would consistently apply that analysis to this case.</p>
