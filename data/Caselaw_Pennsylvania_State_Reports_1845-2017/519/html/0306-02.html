An arbitration panel found in favor of Gene’s Restaurant.

It is perfectly reasonable to assume that Appellant purchased this policy to protect itself from lawsuits arising from such occurrences which, after all, are not unheard of in an establishment that serves food to the public. As long as it can be reasonably argued that the definition contained in this policy covers the attack on Mrs. Aschenback, and there is no doubt in my mind that the argument is at least plausible, then under our law the policy should be most strongly construed against the insurance company and in favor of the insured.</p>
