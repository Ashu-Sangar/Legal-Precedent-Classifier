O’Neil (Appellees) and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The issue presented by this appeal is one of first impression: whether the trial court abused its discretion by denying class certification solely because of its determination that the class members’ average claims ($13.61) were disproportionately small in comparison to expenses and fees of the litigation and, therefore, the requirements of Pa.R. <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>C.P. 1708(a)(7) were not met. Appellants contend that the Superior Court exceeded its permissible scope of review and substituted its judgment for that of the trial court. We do not agree. For the reasons set forth herein, we conclude that class certification should not have been denied and, accordingly, affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.4",432,[246,645,1153,1108]]]'>This action was commenced by the filing of a class action complaint against Appellants by the representative Plaintiff/Appellees alleging that during 1979, 1980 and 1981, the County erroneously deducted social security contributions from sick pay benefits paid to county employees. After the error was discovered, the County entered into a contract with CTA, Ltd. to obtain a refund of the overpayments from the federal government. Under this contract, the County agreed to pay CTA twenty-five (25%) percent of the amount recouped in exchange for CTA’s services. When the County obtained its refund from CTA, it then refunded to the Appellees the amounts erroneously withheld, less the 25% fee which the County paid to CTA. By filing the class action complaint, Appellees sought to recover the 25% fee (totaling, with interest, approximately $150,000.00) which the County had deducted from their refunds and paid to CTA. Appellees alleged that the County’s payment of their funds to CTA constituted a breach of the contract between the employees and the County embodied in an Employee Benefit Plan Booklet and summarized in an Employee Benefits Summary Sheet.</p>

Appellees contend that the particulars of their case demonstrate that the costs of prosecuting the action would be minimal. The burden of proof in class certification proceedings is on the party seeking certification. <em>Klemow v.

All class members are present or former employees of Appellants and have already been located by the County when the refund was paid, thus there should be little or no cost in locating class members and minimal costs for notice and distribution of recovery.

It is apparent that the trial court denied certification because the individual class members’ recovery would be small. This approach contravenes the proportionality requirement of Rule 1708(a)(7) and, if applied generally, would limit class actions to those cases where individual recoveries would be substantial, thereby depriving class actions of any practical value. A class action on behalf of over 10,000 public employees who alleged that they have been wrongfully subjected to a 25% charge against their sick benefits by their employer is not “trivial” or de minimus. Since it is clearly demonstrated <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>that the potential costs would not consume the recovery, we conclude that the Superior Court acted properly in reversing the trial court’s denial of class certification and affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>

Grouping small individual claims as a class does not make them more important than small individual claims that cannot find similar claims to join with to create a class. I fear that the interest generated in the recovery of small monetary claims has less to do with laudatory ideals of seeking justice for the “underdog”, than with practical concerns of creating fees. The conduct of the Appellant in this case was not of such a nature that compelling refunds would be desirable as a matter of public policy. It must be recognized that the individual members of the class would not be left without a forum to pursue their claims if the action is not certified as a class. If one’s reaction to requiring the individuals to seek recovery in a small claims court is that the individuals will not pursue their claims because the recovery is not worth the individual’s effort, I must respond that the same is true of expending judicial effort. What is sought here has little to do with the policy of vindicating of individual rights.</p>
