He was sentenced on May 6, 1982, to one to two years of confinement for the convictions on the assault charges and given a suspended sentence on the reckless endangerment charge.

The following month, on January 12, 1984, he was again arrested in Montgomery County and charged with robbery, possession of an instrument of crime, terroristic threats, simple assault, theft by unlawful taking-disposition, and unauthorized use of an automobile.</p>

Finally, it noted that whereas appellee asserted no actual prejudice to his defense at the hearing, he nevertheless suffered some “technical prejudice” by virtue of the fact that the hearing was not conducted until almost six months after the expiration of the probationary period. It therefore found the underlying claim of arguable merit and that there was no reasonable basis for counsel’s failure to pursue it.

In <em>Brown </em>the issue was whether the Commonwealth could attempt to revoke a person's probation following the person’s acquittal on the charge which formed the basis of the alleged parole violation. This Court, applying principles of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel, answered the question in the negative. However, although the court noted that the probationer’s speedy hearing right had been violated, the court did not hold that such a violation by itself constituted grounds for relief.</p>

Since appellee pled guilty to the charges which constituted the probation violations, there was no issue of lost witnesses or lost evidence. In addition, appellee was already incarcerated as a result of convictions on the December, 1983, and January, 1984, charges. Therefore, this was not a situation where a person was subject to incarceration as a result of any delay in the revocation of probation hearing. These factors render hollow any claim of prejudice, and provide small reason for rulemaking.</p>

As the majority notes in footnote 4, appellant was incarcerated for other offenses at the time his probation on the 1980 burglary conviction expired. Therefore, there was no undue restraint placed upon appellant’s liberty because of the Commonwealth’s failure to hold the probation revocation hearing within the time prescribed by Pa.R.Crim.P. 1409. Appellant being unable to show actual prejudice as required by our recent decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b225-6" data-blocks='[["BL_225.6",225,[209,1041,1150,1107]]]'>Were it not for Mr. Marchesano’s incarceration at the time his probationary period ended, I would be unable to agree with the conclusion reached by the majority of this Court and of the Superior Court that the delay constituted a “technical prejudice.” As this Court noted in <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa/503/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="503 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1785956" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0514-01">503 Pa. 514</a>, 525, <a href="/pa/503/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="503 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1785956" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0514-01">469 A.2d 1371</a> (1983), a revocation of probation hearing involves the question of whether the probationer will or will not be denied his liberty. Given the fundamental right the Commonwealth seeks to deprive the probationer of, this Court has mandated in Rule 1409 that any hearing for the purpose of revocation be held “as speedily as possible.” A failure to hold the revocation hearing within the prescribed period can never be properly deemed inconsequential, especially where the hearing is not held until after the expiration of the probationary period. Each day that a probationer must live with the specter of a further deprivation of his liberty beyond that period permitted by Rule 1409 is intolerable, just as it is intolerable for a criminal defendant to remain charged after his right to a speedy trial has been violated.</p>
