There are generally two types of cases dealing with the issue of consolidation. One type concerns the consolidation of different offenses involving the same defendant. The other type concerns the consolidation of different defendants involved in the same offense. The instant case is unusual in that it has elements of both types of consolidations. Appellee concedes that it would certainly have been proper for the Commonwealth to have joined the intimidation case against the co-defendant with the rape case against him because the evidence of the facts underlying the intimidation case would have been admissible at the trial of the rape case anyway. Similarly, Appellee asserts that it would have been proper for the Commonwealth to have joined the rape case against the co-defendant with the rape case <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>against himself as they were alleged to have participated in the same offenses.</p>

The prejudice asserted by the Appellee because of the failure to sever concerns his defense which was mistaken identity. The only evidence in the case incriminating him was the identification at trial by the victim. Appellee contends that the evidence of intimidation by the co-defendant could <em>only </em>have had the effect of corroborating the victim’s identification of the Appellee.

The <em>Morris </em>Court, likewise, declined to adopt the American Bar Association’s standard providing for an absolute right to severance of offenses because a rule requiring automatic severance would impose an undue burden on the administration of justice without providing any real benefit to the defendant. <em>Id,., </em><a href="/pa/493/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="493 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="8731729" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0164-01">493 Pa. at 175</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="493 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="8731729" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0164-01">425 A.2d at 720</a>.

The Superior Court erred in finding a manifest abuse of discretion here. In denying the motion to sever, the trial judge properly considered that the trial was likely to be lengthy (it took five days). He also properly considered the burden on the young victim in having to testify in two separate lengthy trials if he granted the motion. He also determined that curative, cautionary instructions could adequately dispel any prejudicial effect on the Appellee from the introduction of evidence on intimidation relating to his co-defendant. Judge Guarino also noted that the evidence pertaining to the intimidation charge unmistakably and unequivocally pointed to the co-defendant only. The evidence of witness intimidation against the co-defendant consisted of statements made by the co-defendant to the victim at the hospital where he had been brought by the victim’s uncle. Appellee’s claim that he was unfairly prejudiced by this evidence is particularly unconvincing in light of the fact that he made use of it in his own defense. He argued that the uncle and a friend were the real culprits, and that the uncle brought the co-defendant to the hospital in order to divert suspicion from himself. We cannot say that the possible prejudicial effect of the testimony on intimidation is more harmful than the prejudicial effect that we habitually tolerate in joint trials where evidence is introduced against only <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>one of the defendants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Such evidence is plainly admissible and allowing a joint trial in such a case is not an abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth v.
