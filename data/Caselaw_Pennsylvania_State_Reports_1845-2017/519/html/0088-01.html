The victim, Charles Chiloro, Jr. (“Chiloro”), was selling drugs, cocaine and marijuana, at his parents’ home in Harrisburg. At the time of the killing, Chiloro’s parents were in Florida, but returning soon. Devers went to the house to purchase some cocaine. Thereafter, Chiloro’s body was found by his girlfriend. The cause of death was strangulation resulting from an electrical cord as well as the loss of blood. There was a stab wound in Chiloro’s back and multiple slash and stab wounds around his body. There was blood all over the house. Drug paraphernalia and marijuana were left in the home, but cocaine and some $11,075 in cash were taken.</p>

Each section included a list of enumerated factors to be “accorded weight” in the selection of that sentence. When these sections were replaced in 1980 by 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9721(a), which restated the five sentencing alternatives, and § 9721(b), which did away with the enumerated factors in favor of a scoring system, language was retained which still requires a statement on the record of the reasons for the sentence.</p>

On the contrary, sentencing must result both from a consideration of the nature and circumstances of the crime as well as the character of the defendant. The sentencer has broad discretion to choose a penalty from sentencing alternatives and the range of permissible confinements, provided the choices are consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense, and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant.

In <em>Martin, </em>Mr. Justice Roberts (later Chief Justice) wrote for the majority that pre-sentence reports are of enormous value in providing the court with relevant defense information for consideration in sentencing, and called for changes to amend our rules: “We are therefore requesting that the Criminal Procedural Rules Committee prepare a recommendation for the Court amending Rule 1403 to require that, whenever a sentencing court fails to order a pre-sentence report in any of these situations, it shall place in the record its reasons for dispensing with such report.” <em><a href="/pa/466/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="466 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1714943" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0118-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/466/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="466 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1714943" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0118-01">466 Pa. at 135</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="466 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1714943" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0118-01">351 A.2d 650</a>.

This evaluation completed, the court must examine the facts, as it has determined them to be, in light of the statutory guidelines for sentencing.

Although Judge Spaeth in <em>Wicks </em>noted that this court has never required the sentencing judge to specifically cite or utilize the exact language of the Sentencing Code, the result strongly intimated that such a practice would be all but required unless, on appeal, this court could glean from the words of the trial court that the Code was indeed considered. Instantly, the majority reiterates and enlarges on the technicalities of sentencing, resolutely marching, to a cadence set by <em>Wicks, </em>down a path which must eventually lead to a requirement that a sentencing judge quote chapter and verse of the Sentencing Code in order to satisfy our standard. As I was not on the <em>Wicks </em>panel, I had no voice in its outcome, although I harbored grave doubts as to its rationale. Here, however, I am permitted a word on the tortured course the majority travels, and that word is “ridiculous.” I do not read <em>Commonwealth v. Kostka, </em><a href="/pa/475/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="475 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1734117" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0085-01">475 Pa. 85</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="475 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1734117" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0085-01">379 A.2d 884</a> (1977), <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="AAW" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[192,1743,1153,418]]]'>Judge Price was correct, for the technical punctiliousness of those cases erected a cathedral of philosophical speculation far beyond what we ever intended in <em>Riggins. </em>Today, of course, ordering of pre-sentence reports is the practice everywhere. We are indebted to <em>Martin-Riggins </em>for teaching the judiciary that a convicted defendant cannot be sentenced on the basis of the crime alone and that a full pre-sentence report informs the sentencing procedure.</p>

Where pre-sentence reports exist, we shall continue to presume that the sentencing <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>judge was aware of relevant information regarding the defendant’s character and weighed those considerations along with mitigating statutory factors. A pre-sentence report constitutes the record and speaks for itself. In order to dispel any lingering doubt as to our intention of engaging in an effort of legal purification, we state clearly that sentencers are under no compulsion to employ checklists or any extended or systematic definitions of their punishment procedure. Having been fully informed by the pre-sentence report, the sentencing court’s discretion should not be disturbed. This is particularly true, we repeat, in those circumstances where it can be demonstrated that the judge had any degree of awareness of the sentencing considerations, and there we will presume also that the weighing process took place in a meaningful fashion. It would be foolish, indeed, to take the position that if a court is in possession of the facts, it will fail to apply them to the case at hand. For that reason, <em>Wicks </em>and its voluminous progeny represent an intolerable deviation from our original intent on this issue.</p>

The trial court did order and review a pre-sentence report. It also reviewed numerous letters dealing with Appellant’s character____ The problem is not that the court had insufficient information before it. Rather, the court failed to make a meaningful explanation of which facts it considered to be significant and what weight it allotted to these factors.” (p. 13).
