The trial court predicated its order on the fact that the plaintiffs had received payments pursuant to the uninsured motorist coverage in the automobile insurance policy of one of their group. The court reached a legal conclusion that the settlement was such as would preclude the plaintiffs from obtaining any further recovery under The Pennsylvania Insurance Guaranty Association Act, and, for that reason, precluded them from proceeding against the alleged tortfeasor.</p>

With Mrs. Bethea in her car were several passengers.

In the context of defending Forbes, the Association moved the trial court to order the case “discontinued and ended.” The Association’s argument in support of its motion began with the following <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>premise: that the plaintiffs, by settling with Lois Bethea’s insurer for less than the policy limits of her uninsured motorist coverage, had failed to “exhaust” their rights under that policy, and thus, by force of the “exhaustion” requirement in section 503(a) of the Insurance Guaranty Act, they could not successfully pursue a claim under that statute. Based on that premise, the Association arrived at a conclusion that the plaintiffs lost the right to proceed further against defendant Delmus Forbes. The trial court embraced that reasoning and, accordingly, entered an order terminating the lawsuit. The Superior Court, affirming with a seven-line opinion, cited no authority for the result reached.</p>

It is clearly within the realm of possibility that Mr. Forbes, the alleged tortfeasor in the instant matter, injured the plaintiffs to an extent that exceeded the uninsured motorist coverage in the GEICO policy.

Additionally, the uninsured motorist Act provides that whenever an insurer makes payment under uninsured motorist coverage because of the insolvency of the tortfeasor’s insured, the insurer making such payment shall have no right to reimbursement against the insured of the insolvent insurer. These provisions establish a means of recovery for those who are injured by a driver who, at the time of the injury had proper insurance coverage, but who, after the accident lost that protection due to the insolvency of his insurer. The provisions also afford a measure of protection to the insured driver whose insurance coverage evaporates when his carrier becomes insolvent. The uninsured motorist carrier is barred from seeking reimbursement from that driver whose insurer is unable to meet its obligations. Thus, the injured party has an insurance fund to look to for payment of damages, and the tortfeasor who had insurance but lost it through no fault of his own is not left entirely exposed. These provisions which provide a minimum measure of protection nonetheless leave many injured victims <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>without adequate compensation. For example, in a situation where there is no policy containing uninsured motorist coverage available to the injured party, there is no source of funds other than the tortfeasor himself. Similarly, where an injured victim does have an uninsured motorist policy to look to for payment, but whose damages far exceed the uninsured motorist limits, that victim would generally be stuck with the inadequate limits even though the tortfeasor’s policy of insurance with the insolvent carrier had limits that would have been sufficient to provide adequate compensation.</p>

The Act requires that every insurance company authorized to write property and casualty policies in Pennsylvania participate in the Association. 40 P.S. § 1701.201(a). Under the Act, the Association is required to pay covered claims of an insolvent insurer which are more than $100 and less than $300,000. Generally, there is no circumstance where the Association is obliged to pay an amount which exceeds the policy obligation of the insolvent insurer. Further, the Act provides that a claimant under a policy of an insolvent insurer who has a claim against an insurer other than the insolvent insurer, shall be required to exhaust his right under that policy before looking to the Association.

In further support of the argument that appellants' settlement of their uninsured motorist claims for less than policy limits is not "exhaustion” of their rights under 40 P.S. § 1701.503, appellee cites several cases from other jurisdictions, including: <em>Vokey v. Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em><a href="/mass/381/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="381 Mass. 386" data-case-ids="816159" data-case-paths="/mass/381/0386-01">381 Mass. 386</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=409%20N.E.2d%20783" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="409 N.E.2d 783">409 N.E.2d 783</a> (1980); <em>Hickerson v.

        <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>
        <em>Guaranty Fund, </em><a href="/ill-app-3d/52/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="52 Ill. App. 3d 237" data-case-ids="3386562" data-case-paths="/ill-app-3d/52/0237-01">52 Ill.App.3d 237</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Ill.%20Dec.%2081" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="10 Ill.

I have reviewed these cases and find that they did not consider the specific issue raised in the instant case. I agree with the observation made in <em>Vokey </em>that these cases generally stand for the notion that the collateral source rule has no application to the recovery of uninsured motorist proceeds in these situations, and such proceeds are to be offset against any recovery obtained from the Guaranty Fund.</p>
      <p id="b655-14" data-blocks='[["BL_655.2",655,[254,2139,1114,232]]]'>The appellee also cites <em>Prutzman v. Armstrong, </em><a href="/wash-2d/90/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="90 Wash. 2d 118" data-case-ids="1104392" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/90/0118-01">90 Wash.2d 118</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=579%20P.2d%20359" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="579 P.2d 359">579 P.2d 359</a> (1978) where the court did hold that settlement of an uninsured motorist claim for less than policy limits was inadequate to constitute exhaustion under the Washington Insurance Guaranty Act. For the reasons I have set forth above, I reject the rule adopted by the state of Washington in <em>Prutzman, </em>and would hold to the contrary.</p>
