Agate Street is a paper street <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>forty feet wide which was entered on the plan of the City of Philadelphia but was never opened to the public.

Superior Court held that the forty year statutory period applied only to “manorial lands” located within Philadelphia and remanded for a determination of whether the land in question was “manorial.” If Agate Street were located on “manorial” land, the applicable statutory period would be forty years; if it were located on nonmanorial land, the applicable holding period would be twenty-one years. This Court initially granted Supermarkets’ petition for allowance of appeal from Superior Court’s order, but then determined that the appeal was improvidently granted and remanded the case to <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>the Court of Common Pleas for proceedings pursuant to Superior Court’s opinion.</p>

He also found that some time around 1948 Tioga took control of a gate controlling access to Agate Street by putting its lock on the gate, and maintained the lock until approximately 1978, when the gate was removed. The court found that during the thirty year period between 1948 and 1978 Tioga controlled ingress and egress from Agate Street, with the exception of a spur railroad line which entered Agate Street from Supermarket General’s property approximately 150 feet north of the gate (Agate Street runs north and south) and continued northward alongside Tioga’s property line and beyond it.</p>
    <p id="b285-5" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[188,1189,1155,991]]]'>The Chancellor also found that Tioga used Agate Street from 1948 through 1978 for its entire forty feet width from the gate northward for 150 feet, where the railroad spur entered the street, and then for a width of thirty feet from that point north for a further distance of 194 feet 9.5 inches. Although the court found that Tioga’s possession was “actual, open, notorious, exclusive and continuous” for a period in excess of the required twenty-one years, it determined that Tioga had failed to establish that its use or possession of Agate Street was hostile or adverse to the true owner of the land. The court, therefore, entered a Decree Nisi denying Tioga’s claim to title of Agate Street through adverse possession. Both parties filed exceptions to this decree and the court en banc affirmed. Tioga appealed the en banc court’s order and Superior Court affirmed, <a href="/citations/?q=362%20Pa.%20Super.%20630" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="362 Pa.

The elements of seisin, in other words, were both possession <em>and </em>the claim of a freehold estate to the land in question. When one was “disseised” from his land by a person who ousted him, prior to the year 1381, he could recover seisin by forcible entry, and after that date, by making a peaceable entry to the land. Moynihan, <em>supra, </em>88. <em>See also </em>II Coke, <em>Institutes of the Laws of England </em>(London, 1823), Sect. 448. If this form of self-help was not practicable, actions at law were available, but they were also hazardous, for if the plaintiff selected the wrong writ, or if the pleadings did not match the writ or proof, the plaintiffs action was terminated with prejudice. Moynihan, <em>supra, </em>89, 91 n. 2. By the fifteenth century, the development of the action in ejectment made the technicalities of seisin and the real actions obsolete. Moynhian, <em>supra, </em>90-91.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[259,1279,1152,1093]]]'>The modern law of adverse possession, thus, derives from historical developments leading up to the creation of the action for ejectment. In fact, many commentators regard the availability or non-availability of an action in ejectment as dispositive of whether an adverse possession claim will succeed. In Powell’s <em>Law of Real Property, </em>for example, we are told that “[t]he theory upon which adverse possession rests is that the adverse possessor may acquire title at such time as an action in ejectment by the record owner would be barred by the statute of limitations.” Powell, § 1012(2). In <em>Am Jur </em>we find that adverse possession “aims at the repose of conditions which the parties have suffered to remain unquestioned long enough to indicate their acquiescence therein.” “Adverse Possession,” § 4 at 794 (1936). Similarly, <em>The American Law of Property </em>states that the “basic question” in adverse possession cases is “whether the true owner had a right of action in ejectment against the wrongful possessor____” § 15.4, p. 774 (Vol. 3, 1952). The emphasis in modern law, thus, is on the statute of limitations which bars an action for ejectment. Perhaps this view is best summarized as follows:</p>
    <p id="b287-3" data-blocks='[["BL_287.3",287,[228,334,1112,888]]]'>
      <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>According to the dominant view among commentators on the law of real property, the requirements for acquiring title by adverse possession come down to a simple test. Has the adverse possessor so acted on the land in question as to give the record owner a cause of action in ejectment against him for the period defined by the statute of limitations? It matters not what the motives or the state of mind of the possessor are. What matters is the possessor’s physical relationship to the land over a sufficient length of time. Of course, if the possessor has the record owner’s permission, that changes the picture. The possession is then no longer hostile in a legal sense, and no right to title will accrue to the possessor. But this, the argument runs, is precisely because the record owner has no cause of action against one whom he has permitted to occupy the land. The special situation shows the correctness of the underlying test.</p>
    <p id="b287-4" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[225,1236,1110,516]]]'>The attractions of this view of adverse possession are great. It is securely tied to the statute of limitations, the foundation of the doctrine, which defines the period after which the record owner will lose his cause of action to recover the land from the trespasser. This view provides a workable test. By excluding inquiry into the possessor’s state of mind, it confines attention to external and verifiable facts. It may even promote the settling of land titles and the alienability of land by more easily resolving disputes over title.</p>

There are, however, sound reasons to avoid entanglement with attempting to discern the mental state of adverse possessors. For one thing, discerning the mental state of an adverse possessor is, at best, an exercise in guesswork; and at worst, impossible. Beyond that, application of objective tests as to whether the land was adversely possessed promotes use of the land in question against abandonment. Also, as Justice Holmes points out in a letter to William James, the use of objective, as opposed to subjective tests, may involve an essentially equitable consideration that a person who has put down his roots on land develops an attachment to the land which is deserving of protection:</p>

We hold, therefore, that if the true owner has not ejected the interloper within the time allotted for an action in ejectment, and all other elements of adverse possession have been established, hostility will be implied, regardless of the subjective state of mind of the trespasser.</p>
