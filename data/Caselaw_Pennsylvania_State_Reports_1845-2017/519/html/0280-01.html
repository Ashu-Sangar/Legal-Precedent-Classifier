None of the matters have yet been adjudicated by the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (Board) and there has been no recommendation of discipline by the Board to this Court.

This request was predicated on a pending disciplinary matter in that jurisdiction involving New Jersey clients, in which the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order placing Petitioner on temporary disability inactive status in New Jersey. This transfer to inactive status was based upon alleged physical and emotional difficulties and is to continue pending the final resolution of the ethics proceeding. The issue of Petitioner’s capacity to practice law has been linked by her psychiatrist to injuries she received in an automobile accident and complications therefrom which have placed her in an exhausted mental state. Disciplinary Counsel has indicated its intent to make disclosure of the evidence it possesses relative to Petitioner’s misconduct in the representation of the New Jersey client and relative to her previous statements concerning her medical condition claiming that it is obligated to do so by Pennsylvania DR 1-103(B). Petitioner objected to such disclosure and filed the instant petition with this Court on March 18, 1988. Disciplinary Counsel replied in writing the same day and arguments were held on the motion before Mr. Justice McDermott on March 25, 1988. At that proceeding, Disciplinary Counsel agreed to preserve the confidentiality of Petitioner’s records pending a ruling by the full Court.</p>

The newspaper sought permission to have its personnel inspect and photograph records of the disciplinary proceeding. This Court held that it was not a violation of freedom of the press to deny the newspaper access to court records of disciplinary proceedings concerning matters which were non-criminal and nongovernmental in nature, where the proceedings were conducted with the expectation of all concerned that unless public discipline were imposed the proceedings would re"main confidential. An impoundment order was in accordance with standard practice and the lawyer involved desired that confidentiality be maintained. <em><a href="/citations/?q=848%20A.2d%20376" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="848 A.2d 376">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/465/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="465 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="1712696" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0104-01">465 Pa. at 117-118</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=348%20A.2d%20382" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="348 A.2d 382">348 A.2d 382</a>-383.</p>

Additionally, even where the charges brought against a lawyer have merit, it is often the case that the misconduct demands discipline of no greater magnitude than private reprimand. As a primary objective of such a minor penalty is the rehabilitation of the lawyer (in addition, of course, to the protection of the public interest), confidentiality may be considered essential to ensure that rehabilitative efforts are not thwarted <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>by disclosures which may be prejudicial. Thus, when McLaughlin as a private practitioner appeared before the court of common pleas to answer allegations of a noncriminal nature concerning his private practice, he did so with the expectation, fully warranted, that unless public discipline were imposed, i.e. public censure, suspension or disbarment, the proceedings would remain confidential.</blockquote>
