        "text": "OPINION\nJUSTICE NEWMAN.\nIn this case, we determine the insurance coverage applicable where an accident victim who has elected the limited tort option on her own vehicle is injured while a passenger in a car insured under the full tort option. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court, which held that the victim is bound by her selection of the limited tort option.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn December 8, 1995, Sherry Robinson Hoffman (Sherry) was a passenger in a van that her mother owned and that her fianc\u00e9, Glenn Hoffman (Glenn), was driving when Kathleen Troncelliti (Appellee) turned left into its path. Glenn and Sherry (collectively, Appellants) both sustained injuries.\nAt the time of the accident, Sherry was single and residing in the home of her mother, Maudie Robinson (Robinson). Robinson insured her van with a policy from the Allstate Insurance Company. Robinson was the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d in this policy, and she had elected the full tort option. Sherry was living in the home of her mother and was an \u201cinsured\u201d under her mother\u2019s insurance policy. However, Sherry owned her own vehicle and was the \u201cnamed insured\u201d under a separate policy of insurance for that vehicle for which she selected the limited tort option.\nAppellants instituted a personal injury action against Appellee. Prior to trial, the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (trial court) ruled that the full tort option of the insurance policy of Sherry\u2019s mother applied, pursuant to section 1705(b)(2) of the MVFRL.\nThe MVFRL provides for an election of tort options, whereby each insured chooses between a \u201climited tort\u201d option and a \u201cfull tort\u201d option, as follows:\n1705(a) Financial responsibility requirements.\u2014\n(1) Each insurer, not less than 45 days prior to the first renewal of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall notify in writing each named insured of the availability of two alternatives of full tort insurance and limited tort insurance described in subsections (c) and (d). The notice shall be a standardized form adopted by the commissioner and shall include the following language:\nNOTICE TO NAMED INSUREDS\nA. \u201cLimited Tort\u201d Option \u2014 The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania give you the right to choose a form of insurance that limits your right and the right of members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses, but not for pain and suffering or other nonmonetary damages unless the injuries suffered fall within the definition of \u201cserious injury\u201d as set forth in the policy or unless one of several other exceptions noted in the policy applies----\nB. \u201cFull Tort\u201d Option \u2014 The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also give you the right to choose a form of insurance under which you maintain an unrestricted right for you and the members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses and may also seek financial compensation for pain and suffering and other nonmonetary damages as a result of injuries caused by other drivers....\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(a) (emphasis added).\nSection 1705(b)(2) provides that:\nThe tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all insureds under the private passenger motor vehicle policy who are not named insureds under another private passenger motor vehicle policy. In the case where more than one private passenger motor vehicle policy is applicable to an insured and the policies have conflicting tort options, the insured is bound by the tort option of the policy associated with the private passenger motor vehicle in which the insured is an occupant at the time of the accident if he is an insured on that policy and bound by the full tort option otherwise.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(b)(2). The import of the ruling of the trial court meant that Sherry was entitled to seek compensation for her non-economic losses because the full tort coverage of the policy of her mother was applicable. Had the court ruled instead that the limited tort selection applied, Appellants would have had to establish that Sherry suffered a \u201cserious injury\u201d in order to recover non-economic damages.\nFollowing a trial, the jury entered a verdict of $30,000.00 in favor of Appellants. Post-trial motions were denied, and Judgment was entered on the verdict. In its Opinion of April 24, 2001, the trial court held that because Sherry lived -with her mother and the accident occurred in her mother\u2019s vehicle, Sherry was bound by the policy associated with that vehicle, which provided full tort coverage. Sherry was not limited by the tort option of the policy in which she was the named insur\u00e9d.\nAppellee appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that the trial court misconstrued section 1705(b)(2). On April 16, 2002, the Superior Court affirmed the Judgment of the trial court as to Glenn, but reversed as to Sherry. The court reasoned that pursuant to the clear language of that section, Sherry\u2019s status as a named insured under her own policy bound her to her election of limited tort coverage, which required her to demonstrate a serious injury in order to recover non-economic . damages. Hoffman v. Troncelliti, 799 A.2d 68 (Pa.Super.2002). The court vacated the Judgment entered in favor of Sherry and remanded the matter for a new trial with the appropriate burden of proof. An Application for Reargument before the court en banc was denied on June 19, 2002.\nWe granted allowance of appeal in order to address the interpretation and application of section 1705(b)(2) where an injured passenger is both an insured under one policy and a named insured under another and those policies have conflicting tort options.\nDISCUSSION\nThe interpretation of section 1705(b)(2) by the trial court conflicted with that of the Superior Court. Further, when the Superior Court arrived at its decision, it rejected its holding in Berger v. Rinaldi, 438 Pa.Super. 78, 651 A.2d 553 (1994), allocatur denied, 544 Pa. 641, 664 A.2d 971 (1995). Because the appropriate construction of section 1705(b)(2) poses a question of law, our standard of review is plenary. Sahutsky v. H.H. Knoebel Sons, 566 Pa. 593, 782 A.2d 996 (2001).\nSection 1705(b)(2) contains two sentences, which read:\nThe tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all insureds under the private passenger motor vehicle policy who are not named insureds under another private passenger motor vehicle policy [\u201cSentence One\u201d].\nIn the case where more than one private passenger motor vehicle policy is applicable to an insured and the policies have conflicting tort options, the insured is bound by the tort option of the policy associated with the private passenger motor vehicle in which the insured is an occupant at the time of the accident if he is an insured on that policy and bound by the full tort option otherwise [\u201cSentence Two\u201d].\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(b)(2) (bracketed language and emphasis added).\nIn reversing the Order of the trial court, the Superior Court applied the facts to Sentence One, did not consider Sentence Two, and reasoned as follows: (1) Robinson was a \u201cnamed insured\u201d on the policy for her van; (2) she elected the full tort option; (3) this tort option \u201capplied to all insureds under [her policy] who were not named insureds under another private passenger motor vehicle policy;\u201d (4) Sherry was a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under another private passenger motor vehicle policy; therefore, (5) the full tort option purchased by Robinson did not apply to Sherry, an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy of Robinson, because Sherry was a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under her own policy. In order to reach this conclusion, the Superior Court committed two errors. First, in looking only at Sentence One, the court ignored the fact that section 1705(b)(2) contains Sentence Two, as well. Second, the court rejected its own recent interpretation in Berger of this statutory section, recasting that as dicta. Hoffman, 799 A.2d at 70.\nWhen the trial court interpreted section 1705(b)(2), it read Sentence One together with Sentence Two, and relied on Berger to support its conclusion. In Berger, a son was injured in his mother\u2019s car and owned his own registered motor vehicle, which he did not insure. Under the MVFRL, he was deemed to have selected the limited tort option. The accident victim lived with his mother, as a resident of her household, and his mother had insured the car in which he was injured pursuant to a policy providing the full tort option. In resolving the question of which coverage applied, the Superior Court in Berger construed Sentence Two of section 1705(b)(2) to mean that the injured individual was entitled to full tort insurance. The court stated that:\nWe construe section 1705(b)(2) as describing two, mutually exclusive scenarios. Such an interpretation is necessary to avoid surplusage----The latter portion of the section [Sentence Two] clearly applies to situations where there exists two insurance policies, containing conflicting tort options. In contrast, the former provision [Sentence One] ... applies to circumstances in which only one insurance policy is involved.\nBerger, 651 A.2d at 557 (internal citations omitted). In the instant case, the trial court found that:\n[t]he present case falls squarely within the language of [Sentence Two]. Sherry Hoffman is named insured under a policy providing for the limited option, and an insured under the policy providing for the full tort option. Therefore, she is bound by the tort option of the policy associated with the vehicle in which she was an occupant [her mother\u2019s car].\nFor the reasons that follow, we determine that the trial court correctly applied the holding in Berger to the facts before it. A plain reading of the statute reveals that the two sentences apply to two different situations: (1) where there is only one applicable policy; and (2) where there is more than one policy and the policies have conflicting tort options. Sentence One begins with a broad statement of the applicability of the option elected by the named insured. Sentence Two begins with the phrase \u201cin the case where.\u201d This introductory phrase describes a situation different from the one in Sentence One. Sentence Two then sets forth a scenario where there are two or more conflicting policies and instructs how that situation is to be resolved. Sentence Two states that the solution is to apply the tort option covering the vehicle in which the party was injured, so long as that person is an \u201cinsured\u201d under that policy. The formula is clear \u2014 where there is only one insurance policy, Sentence One applies; where there is more than one policy with conflicting tort options, Sentence Two determines the applicable coverage.\nThe issue before us is purely one of statutory construction. As we have repeatedly stated, \u201cwhen statutes have a bearing on the outcome of a case, we begin by analyzing the express words of the statutes. When the statute is clear, we need go no further to discern the intent of the legislature.\u201d KmonkSullivan v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 567 Pa. 514, 788 A.2d 955, 959 (2001) (internal citations omitted).\nIn reviewing this matter sub judice, the principles of statutory construction guide us:\n\u00a7 1921. Legislative intent controls\n(a) The object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\n(c) When the words of the statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other matters:\n(7) The contemporaneous legislative history.\n(8) Legislative and administrative interpretations of such statute.\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921. Pursuant to section 1921(a), we must give effect to all of the relevant provisions, which include both Sentence One and Sentence Two. The Superior Court failed to do this, by going no further than Sentence One, once it determined that Sherry was a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under another policy. The interpretation of the court fails \u201cto give effect to all [of section 1705(b)(2)\u2019s] provisions,\u201d as expressed by the principle of statutory construction at 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a).\nThe trial court correctly recognized that Sentence Two specifically addresses the scenario in the instant matter; i.e., where there is more than one insurance policy and where the policies have conflicting tort options. Sentence One describes a situation where there is only one policy. Sentence Two describes a different set of circumstances, where more than one policy is involved. Under rules of statutory construction:\n[w]henever a general provision in a statute shall be in conflict with a special provision in the same or another statute, the two shall be construed, if possible, so that effect may be. given to both. If the conflict between the two provisions is irreconcilable, the special provisions shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision shall be enacted later and it shall be the manifest intention of the General Assembly that such general provision shall prevail.\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1933. The trial court correctly relied on the interpretation of Sentence Two that the Superior Court made in Berger, where that court stated that the legislature is presumed to have intended to avoid mere surplusage; thus, whenever possible, courts must construe a statute so as to give effect to every word contained therein. Berger, 651 A.2d at 557.\nWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). The words of section 1705(b)(2) are clear. Appellee and the Superior Court support their positions on the basis of their views of the \u201cspirit\u201d of the MVFRL, while paying little heed to its words. While Appellee says that \u201c[t]he statute, and particularly the critical first sentence, could not be more clear,\u201d it contends that the legislative history focuses on cost-savings. Brief of Appellee at 4. The argument that finding in favor of Appellants will defeat the legislative intent of cost reduction is a current that runs throughout the Brief of Appellee and the Opinion of the Superior Court. Appellee cites Windrim v. Nationwide Insurance Company, 537 Pa. 129, 641 A.2d 1154 (1994), where our Court stated that \u201c[i]n passing the [MVFRL], the Legislature was primarily concerned with the rising consumer cost of automobile insurance, created in part by the substantial number of uninsured motorists who contributed nothing to the pool of insurance funds from which claims were paid.\u201d Id. at 1156 (citing Allen v. Erie Ins. Co., 369 Pa.Super. 6, 534 A.2d 839, 840-41 (1987)). While this is true, Windrim involved the construction of an exclusionary provision in an insurance contract, not an interpretation of section 1705(b)(2). This Court emphasized in that case that \u201c[a] clear and unambiguous contract provision must be given its plain meaning....\u201d Windrim, 641 A.2d at 1157 (internal citations omitted).\nAppellee has not identified any legislative history with respect to Sentence Two of section 1705(b)(2). While Appellee and the Superior Court both focused their attention on the MVFRL legislative history with respect to cost savings, they have disregarded other equally important aspects of the MVFRL. A goal of the statute was to \u201cencourage[] the purchase of insurance by all owners.... \u201d Windrim, 641 A.2d at 1157. Robinson purchased insurance for her van and elected the full tort option, paying the higher premium that accompanies that choice. Sherry resided with Robinson and was an \u201cinsured\u201d under her mother\u2019s policy. Sherry complied with the dictates of the MVFRL by insuring her own automobile, which was not involved in the accident, with the limited tort option. Robinson paid more for her more-inclusive coverage.\nGiven that the words of the statute are clear, the foray of Appellee into the legislative history is not necessary. Section 1921(c) provides that:\nWhen the words of the statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other matters:\n(7) The contemporaneous legislative history.\n(8) Legislative and administrative interpretations of such statute.\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c). We believe that the Superior Court erred with its apparent focus on potential cost savings as opposed to an interpretation of section 1705(b)(2) in its entirety.\nFurther, we presume that \u201cthe General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd ... or unreasonable.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1). As the trial court indicated, the Superior Court\u2019s interpretation leads to an absurd result; i.e., that a motorist who does not insure his own vehicle is covered by the full tort option when he is injured in a full tort vehicle, whereas a driver who has purchased limited tort option on his own vehicle is precluded from that coverage in the same situation. This is an absurd result, which we do not believe the legislature intended.\nFinally, we note that unlike statutes specifically required to be construed strictly, the MVFRL is to be accorded a liberal construction, in favor of the insured. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(c). Case law and legislative history reflect this orientation, as well. The determination of the Superior Court penalizes both of the insureds in this matter. First, it punishes Robinson, who has paid a higher premium for the full tort insurance to include her daughter and, second, it denies Sherry, who has complied with the financial responsibility requirement of the MVFRL by buying insurance for own vehicle, the benefit of full tort coverage under the policy of her mother.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this case, the Superior Court erred in vacating the Judgment with respect to Sherry and determining that she is bound by the limited tort option. In so doing, the court violated principles of statutory construction when it ignored the clear language articulated at Sentence Two of section 1705(b)(2). For that reason, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court.\nJustice EAKIN files a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellants were married on May 4, 1996.\n. The Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(f) (MVFRL), defines a \"named insured\u201d as \"[a]ny individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(f).\n. The MVFRL defines an \u201cinsured\u201d as \"[a]ny individual residing in the household of the named insured who is: (1) a spouse or other relative of the named insured; or (2) a minor in the custody of either the named insured or relative of the named insured.\" 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(f).\n. The jury awarded $25,000.00 to Sherry and $5,000.00 to Glenn.\n. \"An owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle who does not have financial responsibility shall be deemed to have chosen the limited tort alternative.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(a)(5).\n. \u201cThe Commonwealth will not contain the rising costs of automobile insurance by awarding the full tort option to plaintiffs who have paid limited tort premiums.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 5. \"While it provides no part of the basis for our decision today, it merits mention that our interpretation of the terms of the statute is consistent with the legislative purpose of reducing premium costs for motor vehicle insurance.\u201d Hoffman, 799 A.2d at 71.\n. \u201cThe MVFRL also established a new method of deterring people from failing to insure their vehicles. See House Journal, Dec. 13, 1983 at 2148 ... It eliminates those abuses of the [original no-fault bill] system.\u201d Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company v. Hampton, 935 F.2d 578, 581 (3d Cir.1991).\n. Appellants support this interpretation, noting that \"during the debate on the proposed amendments to the MVFRL, it was observed that 'in virtually every circumstance where there is a question about [which] coverage will apply, ihere is a conscious attempt to rule in favor of the full tori, alternative.\u2019 \" Brief of Appellants at 9 (citing House Legislative Journal, p. 214, February 7, 1990).\n. With respect to which tort option shall apply in any given case, Representative Hayden, who supported the enactment of the 1990 amendments to the MVFRL, stated that \"in virtually every circumstance where there is a question about [which] coverage will apply, there is a conscious attempt to rule in favor of the full tort alternative.\u201d Berger, 651 A.2d at 557 (citing House Legislative Journal, p. 214, February 7, 1990).",

        "text": "JUSTICE EAKIN\nDISSENTING.\nBecause I believe the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1705(b)(2) is improper, I dissent.\nIn interpreting the meaning of a statute, this Court must begin with the words of the statute, which, if unambiguous, govern the interpretation of this provision. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). The statute being construed contains, as the majority discusses, two sentences dealing with two different scenarios. However, in interpreting the statute, the majority fails to acknowledge that the second sentence discusses the rights of \u201cinsureds,\u201d not \u201cnamed insureds.\u201d Since Sherry is a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under her own policy, the second sentence cannot apply to her.\nThe General Assembly defined the term \u201cinsured\u201d under the general definition section of the MVFRL. It states that the term \u201cinsured\u201d includes:\n(1) An individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance.\n(2) If residing in the household of the named insured:\n(i) a spouse or other relative of the named insured; or\n(ii) a minor in the custody of either the named insured or relative of the named insured.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1702. Generally, a \u201cnamed insured\u201d is also an \u201cinsured;\u201d however, in \u00a7 1705, the General Assembly separated the above definition into two different definitions:\n\u201cInsured.\u201d Any individual residing in the household of the named insured who is:\n(1) a spouse or other relative of the named insured; or\n(2) a minor in the custody of either the named insured or relative of the named insured.\n\u201cNamed Insured.\u201d Any individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance.\nId., \u00a7 1705(f). Thus, in interpreting \u00a7 1705, these terms have very distinct meanings.\nApplying the definitions provided in \u00a7 1705(f), Sherry was a \u201cnamed insured\u201d on the insurance policy that covered her own vehicle. When purchasing that policy, Sherry selected the limited tort option, which allows her to pay a lower premium in exchange for a limited recovery in case of an injury. See id., \u00a7 1705(d). Sherry is also an \u201cinsured\u201d under her mother\u2019s full tort insurance policy because she resides in the household of the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d her mother, and is a relative of that \u201cnamed insured.\u201d\nThe second sentence of the statute, which the majority holds is applicable in this situation, states:\nIn the case where more than one private passenger motor vehicle policy is applicable to an insured and the policies have conflicting tort options, the insured is bound by the tort option of the policy associated with the private passenger motor vehicle in which the insured is an occupant at the time of the accident if he is an insured on that policy and bound by the full tort option otherwise.\nId., \u00a7 1705(b)(2). This language does not apply in Sherry\u2019s situation because she is not an \u201cinsured\u201d under more than one policy. She is the \u201cnamed insured\u201d on one policy and an \u201cinsured\u201d on a second policy, her mother\u2019s. The majority erroneously applies the generic definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under \u00a7 1702 to this situation.\nSentence one applies to Sherry\u2019s situation. It states:\nThe tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all insureds under the private passenger motor vehicle policy who are not named insureds under another private passenger motor vehicle policy.\nId., \u00a7 1705(b)(2). Clearly, the tort option elected by Sherry\u2019s mother would apply to Sherry if she were not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under her own policy. However, Sherry chose limited tort coverage for herself, and she should be bound by that decision.\nThe majority takes exception with this interpretation because it does not comport with the Superior Court\u2019s holding in Berger v. Rinaldi, 438 Pa.Super. 78, 651 A.2d 553 (1994). In that case, an uninsured motorist was in an accident while driving his mother\u2019s car. The mother had elected full tort coverage; and, because he lived in her home, the son was an insured under his mother\u2019s policy. Pursuant to \u00a7 1705(a)(5), the son was deemed to have elected limited tort coverage because he was uninsured. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(a)(5). However, the Superior Court held he could recover under his mother\u2019s full tort policy because \u201cBerger was an \u2018insured\u2019 for all intents and purposes; Berger\u2019s mother elected the full tort alternative; and Berger was not a named insured under any other policy of insurance.\u201d Berger, at 557 (emphasis added).\nThe Superior Court, in its opinion, stated that sentence one, \u201ccontrary to the dicta in Berger ... resolves the instant controversy in direct and certain fashion.\u201d Hoffman v. Troncelliti, 799 A.2d 68, 70 (Pa.Super.2002), appeal granted, 572 Pa. 742, 815 A.2d 1042 (2003). The language characterized as dicta, the same language the majority characterizes as a holding, states: \u201cWe construe Section 1705(b)(2) as describing two,, mutually exclusive scenarios. Such an interpretation is necessary to avoid surplusage.\u201d See id., at n. 1; see also Berger, at 557. The court continued by stating, \u201cThe latter portion of the section [sentence two] clearly applies to situations where there exists two insurance policies, containing conflicting tort options. In contrast, the former provision [sentence one] ... applies to circumstances in which only one insurance policy is involved.\u201d Berger, at 557 (internal citations omitted). The majority mischaracterizes this language as a holding; it is clearly dicta, as the case called for the application and interpretation of sentence one, not sentence two, because there were not two conflicting insurance policies in question in Berger.\nAs the foregoing shows, the proper interpretation of the plain meaning of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(b)(2) results in Sherry being bound by the terms of her limited tort insurance policy. Thus, in order to recover, Sherry must prove that she sustained \u201cserious injuries\u201d in order to recover for non-monetary damages. See id., \u00a7 1705(d). I believe the Superior Court properly reversed Sherry\u2019s award of damages and remanded for a new hearing in order to determine if her injuries were serious in nature. As such, I respectfully offer my dissent.",
