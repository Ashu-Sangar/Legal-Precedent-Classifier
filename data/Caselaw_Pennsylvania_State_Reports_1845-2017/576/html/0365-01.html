Constitutional challenges are of two kinds: they either assail the statute on its face, or as applied in a particular case. To qualify for the exception to the exhaustion doctrine, “the attack must be made to the constitutionality of the statute or regulation as a whole, and not merely to the application of the statute or regulation in a particular case.” <em>Giffin v. Chronister, </em>151 Pa.Cmwlth. 286, <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a><a href="/pa-commw/151/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="616 A.2d 1070" data-case-ids="1438735" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/151/0286-01">616 A.2d 1070</a>, 1073 (1992).

Accordingly, facial challenges to a statute’s constitutionality need not be raised before the administrative tribunal to be reviewed by an appellate court; challenges to a statute’s application, however, must be raised before the agency or are waived for appellate review. As previously mentioned, requiring “as applied” challenges to be heard at the administrative level permits the agency to exercise its expertise and develop the factual record necessary to resolve the claim.</p>

While the Commonwealth Court may well have implicitly observed this distinction in practice, we now make it express: for the purposes of § 703(a), the waiver exception that exists for claims “questioning the validity of a statute,” 2 Pa.C.S. § 703(a), applies only to facial challenges to a statute’s constitutionality; such claims need not be raised before the administrative agency to be preserved for appellate review. Conversely, claims challenging a statute’s application to the facts of a particular case must be raised before the agency or are waived.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Given this rule, administrative agencies must address “as applied” claims.</p>
    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[280,1161,1154,884]]]'>It is both sensible and efficient to permit administrative agencies to address constitutional challenges to a statute’s application. First, the agency is given an opportunity to interpret the statute it is charged with administering to avoid an unconstitutional application. Second, agencies currently decide challenges to the constitutionality of regulations; administrative competency is not an issue. Third, agencies are better situated than the courts to develop agency-specific issues, and to find facts. Fourth, refusing to consider constitutional challenges to a statute’s application allows litigants to circumvent the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine before seeking judicial review. In this case, the constitutional claims appellant raised concerned the application of the GCA to appellant’s case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Accordingly, the AL J had jurisdiction to consider appellant’s claims.

While ordinarily this would be correct, it overlooks two inconvenient facts: the distinction between facial and “as applied” challenges under § 703(a) was not expressly established at the time of appellant’s hearing, and the ALJ specifically disclaimed — both before and at the hearing — having jurisdiction to hear any of appellant’s constitutional claims. The ALJ went so far as to advise appellant, “[tjhose arguments would be more appropriately made, if necessary, to the Commonwealth Court, since we do not have the mandate to consider constitutional issues.” N.T., 7/19/00, at 19; R.R., at 61.

However, I feel compelled to note that, as an equitable matter, I do not believe that Appellant should be prohibited from possessing a hunting rifle when his only criminal offense of record was that of stealing a $3.38 case of beer over forty years ago and any such crime, if committed today, would not constitute a felony that would give rise to a state or federal disability. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. §§ 3903(b)(2), 106(b)(8) (together classifying theft of less than $50 as a third degree misdemeanor with potential imprisonment of one year or less.) It simply strikes me as unfair that an individual who stole a case of beer anytime after the enactment of the 1972 Crimes Code is free to possess a hunting rifle today, whereas Appellant, who committed the very same crime, but did so in the even more remote past and <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>has lived a completely crime-free life since, is statutorily prohibited from doing so.</p>
