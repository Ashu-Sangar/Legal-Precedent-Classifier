Claimant did not submit to the interview, so employer filed a petition with the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation to compel his submission, pursuant to 77 P.S. § 651(a).

First, the language of § 512(2) required vocational experts to be approved by the Department before the interview. Next, the interpretation effectively divested insurers of the authority to require claimants to submit to interviews because, as a precursor to an interview, insurers would have to petition the WCJ to qualify a vocational expert. Finally, the Bureau has not promulgated a regulation authorizing the WCJs to qualify <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>vocational experts.

Further, the Department has delegated the responsibility of promulgating regulations to the Bureau.

Upon review, the statute clearly does not require an interviewer to be either pre-approved, certified, or sanctioned by the Department — it only required the interviewer to be “approved.” Based on this legislative command to approve experts, the Department, through the Bureau,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> promulgated regulations concerning the minimum qualifications necessary “to be an expert approved by the Department.” 34 Pa.Code § 123.202.

This approach is consistent with the Department’s stated purpose of ensuring “the level of expertise and professionalism required to conduct earning power assessment interviews----” <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pa.%20Bull.%203141" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="27 Pa.

However, if an insurer has engaged in bad faith selection of an unqualified interviewer, claimants may seek the imposition of penalties. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 991(d).

If the employe does not live in this Commonwealth, then the usual employment area where the injury occurred shall apply. If the employer has a specific job vacancy the employe is capable of performing, the employer shall offer such job to the employe.

The use of “may” in this statutory section indicates that the <em>insurer </em>is the decider and, in its discretion, may consider the use of a vocational interviewer “approved by the department.” Conspicuously absent from this section is language indicating that the claimant need not be compelled to interview with a vocational expert that is not “approved by the department.” Accordingly, this section does not support the conclusion of the Commonwealth Court that a vocational expert that is “approved by the department” must conduct a vocational interview sought by an employer pursuant to Section 314.</p>

Because of the finality of a compromise and release, the General Assembly wanted to ensure that the <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>substantive rights of a claimant were protected and this Section is not relevant to the matter before us.</p>
    <p id="b360-4" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[294,418,1155,736]]]'>In the instant matter, Employer filed a Petition to Compel Interview pursuant to Section 314. Employer did not seek to suspend, modify, or terminate benefits in any way and, thus, did not affect the substantive rights of either Claimant or the insurer. It is beyond cavil that a vocational interview cannot result in the cessation of any benefits. Sections 306(b) and 449(d) address different determinations involving earnings assessments that are not at issue before this Court. I believe that the appropriate resolution of this matter lies in the close examination of Section 314, its relationship to the rest of the Act 57 amendments, and the present procedural posture. Within this framework, as I have discussed previously, Section 314 does not require the use of a vocational counselor that is “approved by the department.”</p>
    <p id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.6",360,[293,1178,1153,898]]]'>The General Assembly simultaneously amended all three sections through the provisions of Act 57. The fact that only one of these three sections (dealing with compromise and release), which does not govern a Petition to Compel an Expert Interview, contains the new requirement that vocational counselors be approved by the department before a Petition may be granted,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> militates against the proposition that the section addressing the failure of a claimant to attend a vocational interview, should be read to contain that language. Had the General Assembly intended that vocational experts be approved before a Section 314 Motion to Compel may be granted, it would have so stated. Because Section 306(b) does not mandate a different result and because Section 449 is not relevant to the matter <em>sub judice, </em>I believe that the legal analysis concludes with the application of Section 314 and we are unable to reach the parameters of the phrase “approved by the department.”</p>

      <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>Thus, in the instant matter, because the Employer filed its Petition to Compel Vocational Interview pursuant to Section 314, the Commonwealth Court misinterpreted the “approved by department” language of Section 306(b)(2).

Although Section 306(b) also contains the language “approved by the department,’’ the insurer may, on a discretionary basis, seek an evaluation by a vocational interviewer approved by the department. However, the failure of an insurer to utilize a vocational interviewer approved by the department is not fatal to a determination of partial disability benefits.</p>
