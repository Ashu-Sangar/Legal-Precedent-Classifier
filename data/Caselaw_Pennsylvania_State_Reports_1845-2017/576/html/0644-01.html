Jerome retrieved a Cricket disposable butane cigarette lighter from his mother’s purse. It is uncontested that this butane lighter lacked any child-resistant feature. Jerome’s five year old brother, Neil Williams (“Neil”), observed Jerome use the lighter to ignite some linens. The fire spread to the rest of the family’s apartment.

The trial court reasoned that “[t]he term ‘intended use’ necessarily entails the participation of the Intended user’.” <em>Id. </em>at 17 (citation omitted). Since a two year old child was not the intended user of a cigarette lighter, the trial court found that Appellants could not be liable in strict liability.

      <em>Azzarello </em>did not, however, answer whether the “intended use” doctrine necessarily encompassed the requirement that the product need be made safe only for its “intended user”. While we have never addressed that question in a strict liability design defect matter, we have explicitly resolved it in a strict liability failure to warn context. <em>See Mackowick v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em><a href="/pa/525/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="525 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1823764" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0052-01">525 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/pa/525/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="525 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1823764" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0052-01">575 A.2d 100</a> (1990). In <em>Mackowick, </em>an electrician, who was one of the plaintiffs in the suit, was injured when electricity arced from a capacitor. The plaintiffs argued that the electrical capacitor was defective because the manufacturer failed to place a warning on the capacitor regarding the dangers of live, exposed electrical wires.</p>
    <p id="b715-4" data-blocks='[["BL_715.5",715,[141,1032,1156,419]]]'>We rejected this argument. We reasoned that a product need be made safe only for its intended user. <em><a href="/pa/525/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="525 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1823764" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0052-01">Id.</a> </em>at 102 and 103. We noted that the electrical capacitor was intended to be accessed and used only by qualified electricians, and not general members of the public. As experienced electricians are aware of the danger of live, exposed electrical wires, we concluded that the product was safe for its intended user even absent such a warning.</p>
    <p id="b715-5" data-blocks='[["BL_715.6",715,[139,1491,1156,527]]]'>While <em>Mackowick </em>was a failure to warn case, we find that the principle it enunciated is equally applicable to design defect cases. In fact, we cannot perceive how it could be confined exclusively to the failure to warn context. <em>Mackowick </em>stands for the proposition that a product is not defective so long as it is safe for its intended user. Whether the product is allegedly defective due to a lack of a warning, or because its design was ill-conceived, the standard that the product need be made safe only for the intended user appears to be equally applicable.</p>
    <p id="b715-6" data-blocks='[["BL_715.7",715,[138,2048,1155,309]],["BL_716.1",716,[282,314,1153,251]]]'>Yet, there are two primary arguments against utilizing the intended user standard as part of the strict liability design defect test that we must address. The first was articulated by the Superior Court in its opinion below. One of the Superior Court’s reasons for rejecting Appellants’ argument that a product is not defective if it is safe for the intended user was <a id="p654" href="#p654" data-label="654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*654</a>that such an argument “harkens back to privity principles that were expressly abrogated by the adoption of products liability law.” <em>Phillips, </em><a href="/a2d/773/0802-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="773 A.2d 802" data-case-ids="11092185" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0802-01">773 A.2d at 811</a>. The Superior Court viewed utilization of the intended user standard as effectively rolling back the clock.</p>
    <p id="b716-4" data-blocks='[["BL_716.5",716,[283,611,1154,909]]]'>This concern is phantasmic. The Superior Court is correct in concluding that the concept of privity of contract has no place in our strict liability law. <em>See Azzarello, <a href="/pa/480/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="480 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1745082" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0547-01">supra.</a> </em>Yet, a declaration that a product is nondefective for strict liability purposes if it is safe for use by its intended user does not reanimate the privity requirement. For parties to be considered to be in privity, a contractual relationship must exist between them. <em>See Salvador v. Atlantic Steel Boiler Co., </em><a href="/pa/457/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="457 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="477689" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0024-01">457 Pa. 24</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20903" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="319 A.2d 903">319 A.2d 903</a>, 904 n. 1 (1974). The intended user doctrine, however, requires no such contractual relationship. For example, in terms of the butane lighter, any adult who borrowed the lighter from the person who purchased it could be considered an intended user, regardless of the fact that such an adult had no contractual relationship with the manufacturer or distributor of the lighter. Thus, we reject the argument that the intended user doctrine will somehow pollute strict liability with privity requirements.</p>

She asserts that the intended user test is artificially narrow. In its stead, she proposes that we examine whether the actual user — whether he was the intended user or not — was a reasonably foreseeable one. Appellee states that since it was reasonably foreseeable that a small child may play with a butane lighter, and that grievous damages could result if a child safety device were not placed on the lighter, then strict liability should still attach even though the child was not the intended user.</p>

A decided majority of courts and commentators, however, have come to recognize that this proposition cannot be justly sustained in theory in relation to strict products liability cases predicated on defective design; moreover, it is demonstrably incongruent with design-defect strict liability doctrine as it is currently implemented in Pennsylvania trial courts and in federal district courts applying Pennsylvania law. Furthermore, while the parties to the litigation underlying this appeal may not have expressly developed the approach of the products liability segment of the Third Restatement as such in their submissions, the Restatement position represents a synthesis of law derived from reasoned, mainstream, modem consensus. Particularly in light of perva<a id="p665" href="#p665" data-label="665" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*665</a>sive ambiguities and inconsistencies in prevailing Pennsylvania jurisprudence in this area, I view this appeal as an opportunity to examine the range of readily accessible, corrective measures.

Perhaps, however, the key words in this formulation are “in theory.” In practice, manufacturers consciously choose how to design their products. Asking whether the product is reasonable tends to circle back to asking whether the manufacturer used due care in designing it.

It does not, however, "clearly and concisely” express the concept of "defect,” because it fails to instruct the jury how to determine whether a product is "safe” or "unsafe” for its intended use. Obviously, the court could not have meant "safe” to mean incapable of causing injury, both because every product is capable of causing injury under some circumstances, and because such a meaning would create exactly the type of automatic liability that the court said the law must preclude. Yet, the instruction contains no language that effectively serves the same "critical” function as the unreasonably dangerous requirement under section 402A or the cost-benefit instructions approved in <em>Barker [v.
