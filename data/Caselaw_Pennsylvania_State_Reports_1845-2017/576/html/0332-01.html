As this testimony makes clear, Mr. Turner never once met with Appellant in person before his trial on capital charges. In fact, Mr. Turner testified that he could only specifically recall one telephone conversation with Appellant, and that conversation lasted just twenty minutes to one-half hour. It should go without saying that no lawyer, no matter how talented and efficient, can possibly forge a meaningful relationship with his client and obtain adequate information to defend that client against first-degree murder charges in a single thirty-minute telephone conversation. Although a lawyer can always learn certain information from his client over the telephone, we simply would be discounting the gravity of a death penalty case were we to say that a lawyer representing a defendant in such a case has done his job effectively when he has spent only limited time on the telephone with his client. Indeed, the very nature of a capital case, typically quite involved and always subjecting the defendant to the possibility of death, clearly necessitates at least one in-person meeting between a lawyer and his client before trial begins. Without such a meeting, there is little to no hope that the client will develop a fundamental base of communication with his attorney, such that the client will freely share impor<a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>tant information and work comfortably with the lawyer in developing a defense plan. Moreover, only a fáce-to-face meeting allows an attorney to assess the client’s demeanor, credibility, and the overall impression he might have on a jury. This is of particular importance in cases in which the client may take the stand in his defense or at the penalty phase in an attempt to establish the existence of particular mitigating circumstances. As Appellant was deprived of the benefits of a face-to-face meeting here, it is clear that Appellant’s ineffectiveness claim has arguable merit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

During the post-trial hearing, when Mr. Turner attempted to explain why he never went to Holmesburg to speak with Appellant, Mr. Turner conceded that he had not been “looking forward to spending any time alone with Mr. Brooks,” apparently because Appellant’s previous attorneys had indicated to Mr. Turner that Appellant was “contentious.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> N.T., <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>7/16/1996, at 21, 27. Moreover, Mr. Turner stated that he thought it would be better to limit in-person contact with Appellant so as to avoid a potential conflict in their relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 27, <a href="/a2d/737/1188-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="737 A.2d 1188" data-case-ids="11574788,11574916,838547,838584" data-case-paths="/a2d/737/1188-01,/a2d/737/1188-02,/pa/558/0411-01,/pa/558/0412-01">737 A.2d 1188</a>. Mr. Turner also rationalized to the court that although he had intended to visit Appellant at Holmesburg a few days before the trial, he did not have time to follow through on his intention, noting: “now, I apologize for being busy, but I am. I have a full schedule.” N.T., 1/8/1992, at 28. We agree with Appellant that these explanations do not support a finding that Mr. Turner had a reasonable basis for failing to meet with him. General fear of a potential conflict in the lawyer-client relationship and a busy schedule simply cannot serve as a reasonable basis for failing to have personal contact with a client prior to that client’s trial on capital charges. To the contrary, failure to do so is “simply an abdication” of the most basic expectations of defense counsel in a capital case. <em>See Perry, </em><a href="/pa/537/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="644 A.2d 705" data-case-ids="775500,7873291" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0385-01,/a2d/644/0705-01">644 A.2d at 709</a>.</p>

This type of argument addressing prejudice at least makes a minimal attempt to tie trial counsel’s pre-trial lapse to the actual conduct of the trial.

As the Majority notes, appellant represented himself at critical stages of the proceedings (with appointed counsel acting as stand-by counsel), including portions of the suppression hearing, opening statements at trial, and the first day of trial. Although appellant requested permission to represent himself, the record makes clear that he did so only because of the total breakdown in the attorney-client relationship occasioned by counsel’s failure to meet with him, to return phone calls, or to respond to written communications. Majority op. at 334-35 n. 3, 839 A.2d at 247 n. 3 (summarizing appellant’s representations below). Trial counsel’s testimony demonstrated that there was no valid reason for his keeping his client beyond arm’s length and failing to foster even a minimal professional level of attorney/client relationship. Obviously, <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>instances of client dissatisfaction with counsel are legion and generally, as a rule, provide no ground for relief. It is not a “denial” of counsel anytime a criminal defendant is dissatisfied with his court-appointed attorney and asks to represent himself as a consequence. But, in this instance, there was a basis in fact for appellant’s dissatisfaction and an objectively reasonable (as opposed to subjective) belief that the attorney-client relationship was not salvageable, a basis stemming from counsel’s failure to meet with appellant at all prior to commencement of the capital trial. In my view, this is one of those rare “circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.” <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046.

The Majority's <em>per se </em>rule seems to require the actual physical presence between the lawyer and client and overlooks the reality tha1 there may be other adequate methods by which to accomplish the goals of a "face-to-face” meeting through evolving telecommunication methodologies or by intermediaries. I would not foreclose the use of such technology or intermediaries to satisfy that which the Majority attempts to mandate by a <em>per se </em>rule. In addition, there may be instances where the defendant himself refuses to meet with counsel.</p>

In all cases, capital or not, counsel is presumed effective and it is up to a defendant to prove otherwise by showing: (1) the underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) the particular course of conduct pursued by counsel did not have some reasonable basis designed , to effectuate his interests; and, (3) but for counsel’s ineffectiveness, there exists a reasonable probability that the outcome of the challenged proceeding would have been different. <em>Pierce, </em>at 194-95.</p>
    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[278,840,1160,951]]]'>The majority may be read as establishing a standard in capital cases that differs from that of other cases, a distinction which is unnecessary, in my judgment. Failing to meet with a client in a capital case may be ineffective in nearly every scenario; failing to meet on a disorderly conduct charge may be more easily explained. Either situation, however, may be evaluated under <em>Pierce. </em>It is important that the law be consistent; the constitution does not afford some lesser right to effective counsel on those charged with non-capital crimes. The right to counsel inures to the capital defendant, the felon, and the misdemeanant alike. Stewardship of capital counsel is always the most carefully scrutinized conduct of all, and rightly so, but proper scrutiny is available under the prevailing standards of <em>Pierce; </em>ignoring the <em>Pierce </em>factors in favor of a <em>per se </em>rule is unnecessary. Insofar as it suggests different standards of scrutiny for capital cases, it will be only the first entry on a list of <em>per se </em>rules we will be asked to create, a concept that seems unwise as well as unneeded.</p>

Surely, no one today can doubt that a defense lawyer must, at a minimum, have face-to-<a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>face contact with his client pre-trial to effectuate effective representation. While all participants in the criminal justice system have their separate responsibilities, the trial judge and the district attorney must be particularly sensitive to ensuring the rights of the criminal defendant, even if defense counsel himself is not as vigilant.</p>
