      <em>Willet </em>involved claims of medical negligence against appellant Andrew J. Willet, M.D. and the appellant hospital at which Dr. Willet worked (the “Hospital”).

Meanwhile, the Hospital had two policies with PHICO Insurance Company, a basic policy for $200,000 per occurrence and a $8,000,000 excess policy. Prior to trial, the plaintiff made a settlement demand of $3,000,000. In response, PMSLIC and PHICO each tendered their primary policy limits of $200,000, the CAT Fund tendered its $1,000,000 limit on behalf of the Hospital and $300,000 on behalf of Dr. Willett, and then PHICO offered $800,000 from the Hospital’s excess coverage. However, the $2,500,000 settlement offer still fell short of the $3,000,000 demand, and the CAT Fund refused to tender any additional coverage. Accordingly, the case went to trial and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the amount' of $4,000,000.

According to Dr. Willet and the Hospital, the CAT Fund was in exclusive control of the settlement negotiations during that time period, because it withheld coverage that, if offered, would have settled the case, so that no delay damages would have been. imposed. This Court agreed that such allegations, if proven, were sufficient to establish a valid claim for indemnity, because under traditional indemnity principles, a loss will be shifted from “one who has been compelled, by reason of some legal obligation, to pay a judgment occasioned by the initial negligence of another who should bear it.” <a href="/a2d/702/0850-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="702 A.2d 850" data-case-ids="11894828,17460" data-case-paths="/a2d/702/0850-01,/pa/549/0613-01">702 A.2d at </a>854 (citing <em>Builders Supply Co. v.

Thus, unlike the situation in <em>Willet, </em>Walsh’s primary insurance had not been exhausted such that the burden was shifted to the CAT Fund to contribute the next dollar amount to the settlement. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1301.701(d) (1995) (repealed) (CAT Fund pays settlements “to the extent that [the] health care provider’s share exceeds his basic coverage insurance”). Walsh nevertheless contends that the CAT Fund was in exclusive control of the settlement as it was pursuant to the CAT Fund’s direction that PIC did not tender its policy limits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> In this regard, Walsh primarily points to the testimo<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>ny of Timothy McCarthy, Chairman of the Board of PIC, who testified that PIC desired to tender its policy limits prior to trial, but acceded to the CAT Fund’s direction that it not do so.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> R.R. at 636a-37a.

R.R. at 635a-6a. Thus, McCarthy testified that it was the CAT Fund that controlled whether the case settled, at least in the immediate period prior to the case actually going to trial.

The Act expressly recognizes that the basic coverage carrier may enter into its own settlement with a tort claimant. That PIC may have acceded to a request to refrain from offering its limits did not divest PIC of control over negotiations. The significant and admitted fact is that, unlike <em>Willet, </em>PIC <em>never </em>made any offer to the opposing party to settle. What Walsh ignores is the obvious fact that the withholding of PIC’s own coverage, whether at the <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>request of the CAT Fund or not, was an act by PIC of meaningful control of the negotiations.</blockquote>

Moreover, contrary to Walsh’s apparent belief, the trial court’s conclusion that a $737,301.86 bond was appropriate did not automatically increase PIC’s liability to the Estate to $737,301.86. Although the court calculated the $737,301 by adding delay damages and post-judgment interest to PIC’s $200,000 liability, there is no indication that it did so based on a legal conclusion that PIC was actually liable for such delay damages and post-judgment interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Moreover, the fact that the court <em>doubled </em>the sum of the coverage limit, delay damages and interest to reach the security requirement makes it crystal clear that the court did not intend the amount of the bond to be coterminous with PIC’s liability.

Significantly, the CAT Fund does not dispute its liability for such interest from the date of the verdict to the date of payment, apparently recognizing that the <em>Montgomery Hospital </em>cases are controlling. In fact, the CAT Fund’s counsel specifically stated to the Commonwealth Court at oral argument on the cross-motions for summary judgment that the CAT Fund is “clearly ... liable for post-judgment interest on the amount of our coverage.... ” 1/24/01 Hrg. Transcr. at 33. Likewise, the CAT Fund concedes in its brief to this Court that it will pay “its proportionate share” of the post-judgment interest for the “specified time period.” CAT Fund Brf. at 29. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth Court denied Walsh’s motion for summary judgment in its entirety, including that piece which requested interest on the <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>$1,000,000 liability. Given the CAT Fund’s concession and the clear legal precedent in this regard, it was clearly erroneous for the court to deny interest on the $1,000,000 liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the Commonwealth Court’s order and remand the case to the Commonwealth Court for calculation of the amount of post-judgment interest owed on the $1,000,000 and entry of judgment in favor of Walsh in the appropriate amount.</p>

Accordingly, contrary to Walsh’s contention, <em>Incollingo </em>did not create a general rule that all insurers are required to pay interest on more than their prorata share of judgments, and it certainly cannot be read to impose such an obligation on the statutorily-created CAT Fund. We therefore agree with the Commonwealth Court that <em>Incollingo </em>simply “has no application to this case,” 4/26/01 Commw. Ct. Op. at 6, and this aspect of Walsh’s claim for interest fails.</p>
