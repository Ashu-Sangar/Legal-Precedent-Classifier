After the game, Hasan and Montrell returned to the neighborhood where Hasan lived, at Montrose Street and Hall Place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Montrell had previously lived in the same <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>neighborhood and returned there after the game to visit some of his relatives. Hasan and Montrell exchanged differing views as to the merits of certain basketball players. The exchange of opinions became heated and Montrell slapped Hasan. Before the two men became further engaged in • a physical dispute, friends intervened to separate them, and Montrell walked away from the area. Hasan called the Philadelphia police to report the physical encounter between himself and Montrell. A patrol car was dispatched to the scene, and Hasan explained to Officer Revell that Montrell struck him during an argument. As Hasan was not in need of medical attention, the officer explained that the matter would be a summary offense and directed Hasan on how to proceed with a private complaint. The discussion between Hasan and Officer Revell concluded at approximately 9:30 p.m.</p>

As Montrell approached the group he observed Appellant fire a gun twice in the direction of Derrick. Montrell immediately turned away from Appellant and began to run. As he was running Montrell heard three more gunshots. Montrell was shot in the left shoulder. Montrell turned back towards the direction of the gunfire and saw Jamika lying on the ground and heard her crying. Montrell flagged down a car driven by a friend and was transported to a nearby hospital. The cause of death for both Derrick and Jamika was a gunshot wound to the chest, fired at close range, from the same gun that injured Montrell.</p>

Taking into account the strong preference set forth in <em>Grand </em>to postpone review of all ineffectiveness claims to the collateral process, and the limitation of the exception allowed in <em>Bomar </em>to consider only those ineffectiveness claims where the lower court conducted a hearing and provided a full consideration of the issue, we believe the claims raised in this case are best left to the collateral stage. Because the post-trial judge in this case was not also the trial judge, he did not have the benefit of observing trial counsel in action, there was no hearing on the allegations of ineffectiveness, and, as noted previously, there are subtle yet important differences in the claims as raised below and as now raised before this court.

The issue of mental retardation was touched upon in passing, but it was not the focal point of the testimony of the witness, nor was it a central focus of either direct or cross-examination.

The question of mental retardation is of similar degree to the questions of competency to stand trial or insanity that occasionally arise in criminal jurisprudence. Just as in those situations, due process is satisfied by placing the burden of proof on the party attempting to prove incompetency or insanity. <em>Commonwealth v. duPont, </em><a href="/pa/545/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="545 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="465183" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0564-01">545 Pa. 564</a>, <a href="/pa/545/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="681 A.2d 1328" data-case-ids="465183,7868001" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0564-01,/a2d/681/1328-01">681 A.2d 1328</a> (1996) (a defendant is presumed competent to stand trial and must prove his incompetency by a preponderance of the evidence); <em>Commonwealth v.

The dissent contends that the evidence as recited above is not overwhelming when considered through application of the harmless error standard articulated in <em>Young. </em>Respectfully, <em>Young </em>is distinguishable. Unlike the defendant in <em>Young, </em>who not only denied any involvement in the murder, but also offered an alibi defense, Appellant concedes his presence at the scene, and his voluntary decision to place himself there in order to discuss the earlier "slapping” incident with Montrell. Additionally, in this case, there is evidence that the same gun fired all of the shots resulting in the two homicides and the aggravated assault. The dissent implies that by finding this evidence overwhelming we are making credibility assessments. Contrary to that belief, no assessment of credibility is required in viewing this uncontradicted evidence. Further, the dissent notes that the evidence we are relying upon is circumstantial and this court has not previously relied upon circumstantial evidence when evaluating under a harmless error configuration whether the evidence was overwhelming. In response, we note that this court has always relied upon circumstantial evidence when evaluating challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and thus there is no impediment to considering the uncontradicted circumstantial evidence when conducting a harmless error analysis. <em>See, Commonwealth v.
