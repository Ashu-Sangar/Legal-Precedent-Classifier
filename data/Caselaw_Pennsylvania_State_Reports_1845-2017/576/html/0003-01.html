Unlike the prior claim, this claim can be reviewed, since here, Appellant’s claim regarding the prosecutor's statements are taken completely out of context. Although all of Appellant's claims raise similar concerns under <em>(Craig) Williams </em>regarding the lack of pre-dismissal notice, we will not remand those claims that involve questions of law which can be resolved on the existing record.</p>

      <em> </em>For my part, I remain of the view that consistent application of the criminal procedural rules as developed in <em>Williams </em>would further the interests of justice both by identifying ineffective approaches by counsel to post-conviction litigation at the earliest stage, and providing the fullest opportunity for a post-conviction petitioner’s one instance of state collateral review to be a meaningful one.</p>
