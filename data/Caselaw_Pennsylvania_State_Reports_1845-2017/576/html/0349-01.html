The stigma attached to offspring born out of wedlock subsequently eroded from the absence of any rights at all, to all the rights and privileges of children born as a result of an actual marriage, -with few exceptions. One of the rights bestowed on both legitimate and illegitimate children alike is the right to support, pursuant to the Act, when their father dies from a work-related injury. However, implicit in this right is the fact that the child is the legitimate or illegitimate child of the injured worker. This determination must be made as a condition precedent prior to filing the claim for support benefits, not, as here, during the proceeding itself. My esteemed colleague sees the instant matter as an eligibility issue, and I believe that he is correct. Eligibility for benefits is all that the WCJ is empowered to decide. The claimant child must bring to the WCJ proof of parentage in the form of a paternity determination that legitimizes his or her claim to support.</p>

It is the employee’s right to benefits and the corresponding provision for death benefits that provide the injured worker’s family a right to relief. The operative presumption here is that a member of the injured workers’ family must make application for those benefits. That presumption is satisfied, pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 5102, when the court of common pleas renders its paternity determination.</p>

There is a similar risk in workers’ compensation petitions that is made even greater by the informality of the proceedings. While it should be axiomatic that a person who claims to be the child of a decedent has the burden of <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>proving that the decedent was his or her parent, no documentary evidence of paternity was introduced in the instant matter.</p>
    <p id="b426-4" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[274,490,1166,1541]]]'>I believe that the General Assembly and this Court have declared that the appropriate place in which to prove paternity is the court of common pleas. The determination of paternity is really a biological question to be resolved for the purpose of enforcing a civil duty, <em>i.e. </em>the obligation to support the child, wholly unrelated to the workplace injuries and loss of earning power of the workers’ compensation arena. The safeguards surrounding paternity actions should be even greater with the death of the putative father, not relaxed as in a workers’ compensation proceeding. As the Superior Court has stated, the “claims of paternity made after the lips of the alleged father have been sealed by death are in that class of claims which must be subjected to the closest scrutiny and which can be allowed only on strict proof so that injustice will not be done.” <em>Estate of Hoffman, </em><a href="/pa-super/320/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="320 Pa.

This is not accomplished by having a workers’ compensation judge determine paternity within the informality of a death benefits proceeding, outside the purview of the statutory guidelines. The initial WCJ afforded Patricia Rossa an opportunity to litigate the issue of paternity in the appropriate forum. She failed to do this over a period of several years and patently ignored her opportunity to have a proper paternity determination rendered. Accordingly, I believe that this Court should reverse the Order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
