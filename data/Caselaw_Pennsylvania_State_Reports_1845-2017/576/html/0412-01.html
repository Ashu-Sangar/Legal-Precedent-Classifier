Notes of Testimony (hereinafter, “N.T.”) 9/30/96 at 139-140. Ms. Zablocky testified that at 5:30 P.M., her mother told her that someone had left a box in the front of the house. <em>Id. </em>at 140-141. Because the trash had just been picked-up earlier that day, the father of Ms. Zablocky (Mr. Zablocky) went out to look at the box. After looking in the box, he yelled into the house that there was a baby in the box. Ms. Zablocky called 9-1-1. <em>Id. </em>at 141. Her father shouted, again saying that the baby was dead. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Zablocky testified that she told the 9-1-1 operator that there was a box in front of her house with a dead baby in it. <em>Id. </em>The Zablockys waited for police to arrive and Mr. Zablocky stood near the box to make sure that no one disturbed it. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Zablocky described the box as a television box and identified it in court. <em>Id. </em>at 145-146. At approximately 5:45 or 5:50 P.M., the Zablockys flagged-down a police officer, who stayed with the box until other officers arrived. <em>Id. </em>at 141. Ms. Zablocky later asked police if she could look in the box. An officer briefly lifted the lid. Ms. Zablocky told the jury that she saw a child’s body on its side and a little head with a green trash bag on top. <em>Id. </em>at 148-149.

The fact that the statement does not reflect that Appellant said that giving the statement was going to be hard for him, that he asked the Detectives to be patient because he wanted to get this right, or that he was crying during certain parts of the confession does not invalidate the statement.</p>

Other evidence indicates that there was no preconceived plan because Mr. Banachowski had difficulty contacting authorities. In fact, Mr. Banachowski first wrote a letter to an Assistant District Attorney in January of 1995, but received no reply. It was not until later that year when Mr. Banachowski wrote the second letter to District Attorney Lynne Abraham, in which he explained that he was disgusted with the violent acts Appellant claimed to have perpetrated against Barbara Jean, that the Commonwealth contacted him.</p>

That is, Mr. Banachowski can testify as to what Appellant said, but the statement of what the mother purportedly said to Appellant must also meet a hearsay exception.
