      <em>See </em>42 Pa. C.S. §§ 9795.4(a), 9795.1.

Briefly, after a defendant is convicted of a predicate offense, but before he is sentenced, the trial court directs the Board to make an initial assessment as to whether he should be classified as a sexually violent predator, that is, whether he suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder making him likely to engage in future “predatory sexually <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>violent offenses.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9792. The Board makes this assessment based upon various statutorily-prescribed, risk-related criteria and guidelines, as well as any other generally-applicable standards established by the Board. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.4(b). After the Board issues its recommendation, the district attorney may request a hearing before the trial court to determine whether the individual should be adjudicated as a sexually violent predator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The individual and the district attorney are “given notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.4(e)(2); each may offer and cross-examine witnesses, including expert witnesses, and the defendant additionally retains the right to be represented by counsel, appointed if necessary. At the conclusion of the healing, the court determines whether the Commonwealth has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is a sexually violent predator. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.4(e)(3). If the court so concludes, the individual is subject to lifetime registration, notification, and counseling; otherwise, he is deemed an “offender,” and is subject to registration only, for a period of either ten years or the remainder of his life, depending upon the predicate offense and/or the number of convictions. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1; <em>Williams II, </em><a href="/pa/574/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="574 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="588032" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0487-01">574 Pa. at 497-98</a>, <a href="/a2d/832/0962-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="832 A.2d 962" data-case-ids="9088607" data-case-paths="/a2d/832/0962-01">832 A.2d at 967-68</a>.</p>

In applying this test, the court stated initially that the Commonwealth and the defendant each has a compelling interest in ensuring that an accurate determination is made regarding whether the defendant is a sexually violent predator: the Commonwealth has a compelling interest in protecting its citizens through prompt notification, and the registrant has a compelling interest in avoiding notification and counseling if he is not a sexually violent predator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> As to the second element, the court concluded that there is a substantial risk of error due to the <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>procedures used, because determining whether the individual is a sexually violent predator constitutes a “subjective factual determination which is subject to substantial uncertainty.” Trial Court op. at 7. Finally, the court noted that utilization of a reasonable-doubt standard would be more burdensome to the Commonwealth, but stated that this extra burden was outweighed by its effect of lowering the risk of error to the individual. Accordingly, the trial court held that nothing less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt would satisfy the demands of the Due Process Clause. <em>See id.</em>

    <p id="b169-4" data-blocks='[["BL_169.5",169,[146,849,1157,1068]]]'>Presently, the Commonwealth contends that trial courts regularly weigh psychological evidence and make factual findings based upon such proof “without insurmountable difficulty” in a wide range of contexts less likely to be guided by objective standards, such as in competency hearings, child custody matters, and insanity determinations. It argues that, if the trial court’s concern is that judicial subjectivity may lead to erroneous decisions, this is equally true whether the burden is beyond a reasonable doubt or clear and convincing evidence. Finally, the Commonwealth notes that the only precedent cited by the trial court to support its conclusion consisted of this Court’s decisions in <em>Williams I </em>and <em>Commonwealth v. Butler, </em><a href="/pa/563/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="563 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1366994" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0324-01">563 Pa. 324</a>, <a href="/a2d/760/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="760 A.2d 384" data-case-ids="11184535,1366994" data-case-paths="/a2d/760/0384-01,/pa/563/0324-01">760 A.2d 384</a> (2000). It avers that the statutes challenged in those cases were deemed defective because they shifted the burden to the defendant to prove that he was not a sexually violent predator <em>(Williams I) </em>or a “high risk dangerous offender” <em>(Butler)-, </em>the Commonwealth argues that, in neither case was the standard of proof at issue, and hence, the trial court’s reliance upon those decisions was misplaced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Briefly, the function of a standard of proof is to instruct the factfinder as to the level of confidence that society believes he should have in the correctness of his conclusion; furthermore, different standards of proof reflect differences in how society believes the risk of error should be distributed as between the litigants. Thus, the most stringent standard — beyond a reasonable doubt — is applicable in criminal trials due to the gravity of the private interests affected; these interests lead to a societal judgment that, given the severe loss that occurs when an individual is erroneously convicted of a crime, the public should bear virtually the entire, risk of error. The preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, by contrast, reflects a belief that the two sides should share the risk equally; for this reason, it is applicable in a civil dispute over money damages, where the parties may share an intense interest in the outcome, but the public’s interest in the result is “minimal.” <em>Addington, </em><a href="/us/441/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="441 U.S. 418" data-case-ids="1780484" data-case-paths="/us/441/0418-01">441 U.S. at 423</a>, <a href="/us/441/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="441 U.S. 418" data-case-ids="1780484" data-case-paths="/us/441/0418-01">99 S.Ct. at 1808</a>; <em>Williams I, 557 </em>Pa. at 306, 733 A.2d at 604.

In that matter, the Court analyzed a New York statute under which the state could terminate the rights of parents in the care and custody of their children upon a finding, by a “fair preponderance of the evidence,” that the child in question was “permanently neglected.” The Court determined that the preponderance standard was constitutionally deficient because the consequences of an erroneous decision were far greater to the individual than to the state, and thus, the parties should not be asked to share equally the risk of error. <em>See Santosky, </em><a href="/us/455/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="455 U.S. 745" data-case-ids="11307633" data-case-paths="/us/455/0745-01">455 U.S. at 768</a>, <a href="/us/455/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="455 U.S. 745" data-case-ids="11307633" data-case-paths="/us/455/0745-01">102 S.Ct. at 1402</a>. Then, drawing from the analysis in <em>Addington, </em>the <em>Santosky </em>Court also rejected the proposition that the state should be held to a reasonable-doubt standard in termination proceedings. In this regard, the Court reasoned that such proceedings, like commitment proceedings, also require the factfinder to evaluate medical and psychiatric testimony and to decide issues — such as lack of parental motive, absence of affection, and failure of parental foresight and progress — which are often difficult to prove to an extremely high level of certainty.
