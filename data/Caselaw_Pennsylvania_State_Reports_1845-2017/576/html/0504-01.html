A plain reading of the statute reveals that the two sentences apply to two different situations: (1) where there is only one applicable policy; and (2) where there is more than one policy and the policies have conflicting tort options. Sentence One begins with a broad statement of the applicability of the option elected by the named insured. Sentence Two begins with the phrase “in the case where.” This introductory phrase describes a situation different from the one in Sentence One. Sentence Two then sets forth a scenario where there are two or more conflicting policies and instructs how that situation is to be resolved. Sentence Two states that the solution is to apply the tort option covering the vehicle in which the party was injured, so long as that person is an “insured” under that policy. The formula is clear — where there is only one insurance policy, Sentence One applies; where there is more than one policy with conflicting tort options, Sentence Two determines the applicable coverage.</p>

Rinaldi, </em><a href="/pa-super/438/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="438 Pa. Super. 78" data-case-ids="710872" data-case-paths="/pa-super/438/0078-01">438 Pa.Super. 78</a>, <a href="/a2d/651/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="651 A.2d 553" data-case-ids="12256723,710872" data-case-paths="/a2d/651/0553-01,/pa-super/438/0078-01">651 A.2d 553</a> (1994). In that case, an uninsured motorist was in an accident while driving his mother’s car. The mother had elected full tort coverage; and, because he lived in her home, the son was an insured under his mother’s policy. Pursuant to § 1705(a)(5), the son was deemed to have elected limited tort coverage because he was uninsured. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(5). However, the Superior Court held he could recover under his moth<a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>er’s full tort policy because “Berger was an ‘insured’ for all intents and purposes; Berger’s mother elected the full tort alternative; and Berger was <em>not a named insured under any other policy of insurance.” Berger, </em>at 557 (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[288,540,1153,1066]]]'>The Superior Court, in its opinion, stated that sentence one, “contrary to the <em>dicta </em>in <em>Berger ... </em>resolves the instant controversy in direct and certain fashion.” <em>Hoffman v. Troncelliti, </em><a href="/a2d/799/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="799 A.2d 68" data-case-ids="9411244" data-case-paths="/a2d/799/0068-01">799 A.2d 68</a>, 70 (Pa.Super.2002), <em>appeal granted, </em><a href="/citations/?q=572%20Pa.%20742" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="572 Pa. 742">572 Pa. 742</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=815%20A.2d%201042" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="815 A.2d 1042">815 A.2d 1042</a> (2003). The language characterized as <em>dicta, </em>the same language the majority characterizes as a holding, states: “We construe Section 1705(b)(2) as describing two,, mutually exclusive scenarios. Such an interpretation is necessary to avoid surplusage.” <em>See id., </em>at n. 1; <em>see also Berger, </em>at 557. The court continued by stating, “The latter portion of the section [sentence two] clearly applies to situations where there exists two insurance policies, containing conflicting tort options. In contrast, the former provision [sentence one] ... applies to circumstances in which only one insurance policy is involved.” <em>Berger, </em>at 557 (internal citations omitted). The majority mischaracterizes this language as a holding; it is clearly <em>dicta, </em>as the case called for the application and interpretation of sentence one, not sentence two, because there were not two conflicting insurance policies in question in <em>Berger.</em>

    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.6",580,[285,1635,1154,473]]]'>As the foregoing shows, the proper interpretation of the plain meaning of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(b)(2) results in Sherry being bound by the terms of her limited tort insurance policy. Thus, in order to recover, Sherry must prove that she sustained “serious injuries” in order to recover for non-monetary damages. <em>See id., </em>§ 1705(d). I believe the Superior Court properly reversed Sherry’s award of damages and remanded for a new hearing in order to determine if her injuries were serious in nature. As such, I respectfully offer my dissent.</p>
