Taylor, which sought Penn DOT accident reports, safety studies, and accident investigations for the purpose of preparing his defense in a criminal prosecution. The courts below construed the privilege not according to its plain language, but in a narrower fashion dictated by the courts’ view of the statute’s alleged purpose. So construed, the courts held that the statutory privilege did not extend to the request made by Taylor.

On the merits, the court explained its reasoning in a subsequent opinion. The court recognized that the statute “plainly and unambiguously prohibits both the discoverability and admission of such information in any proceeding.” Slip op. at 3.

Penn DOT argues that the courts below were not free to ignore that plain language and essentially rewrite the statute to better serve what the Superior Court viewed as the statute’s purpose. Proceeding to the constitutional question avoided by Superior Court’s construction of the statute, Penn DOT argues that, under this Court’s precedents, the statute is constitutional.</p>

Appellee argues, however, that principle is inapplicable here because § 3754(b) does not “explicitly state” that it applies in criminal cases. Appellee argues that, as an evidentiary privilege, § 3754(b) should be narrowly construed. Appellee further contends that, if the statute is deemed to shield the information he requested, it violates his due process right since it would deprive him of access to material in the possession of a governmental third party that might advance his criminal defense. Appellee argues that his interest in obtaining evidence that might help his criminal defense sufficiently outweighs the interest served by the privilege that, for the statute to withstand constitutional scrutiny, it must be construed as permitting disclosure here.</p>

      <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>In reading subsections (a) and (b) together, it is clear that the privilege set forth in subsection (b) relates to the purpose set forth in subsection (a), which is to improve traffic safety by empowering PennDOT to conduct investigations and safety studies. In other words, the protections created by subsection (b) exist to serve the purposes enunciated in subsection (a). Given this statutory construct, I agree with the Superior Court that the privilege set forth in subsection (b) is limited and may be given effect only to the extent necessary to further the purpose of allowing PennDOT to obtain accurate and honest information in its efforts to increase traffic safety without fear of incurring civil liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

It is absolutely clear, at least in my view, that withholding facts and data from Appellee for use in the preparation of his defense against the criminal charges lodged against him does nothing to improve traffic safety. Thus, I disagree with the majority that the privilege at issue here is absolute and wholly protects Penn-DOT from disclosing all of the information Appellee seeks.</p>

Trial Ct. Order, 3/9/98, at 2. I would also limit PennDOT’s disclosure to facts and data, and exclude all non-factual material from discovery. As now-President Judge Del Sole reasoned in his concurring and dissenting opinion below, facts and data gathered in accident investigations and safety studies do not, in and of themselves, subject PennDOT to the burdens of civil litigation. Rather, it is the opinions and conclusions formed by its employees and experts in reliance on those facts and data that expose PennDOT to potential civil liability, and therefore, it is those opinions and conclusions, rather than the <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>facts and data themselves, that must be protected from disclosure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>
