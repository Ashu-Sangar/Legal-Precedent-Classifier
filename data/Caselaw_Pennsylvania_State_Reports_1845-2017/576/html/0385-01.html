There is no question that protecting the elderly, disabled, and infirm from being victimized is an important interest in this Commonwealth and that the General Assembly may enact laws that restrict who may work with these individuals. Further, barring certain convicted criminals from working with these citizens may be an effective means of protecting such citizens from abuse and exploitation. However, the criminal records chapter does not create an absolute bar on the employment of convicted criminals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Rather, the immediate effect of the chapter was merely to prohibit the employment of convicted criminals who were not then working in a covered facility or who had obtained a new job in a covered facility less than a year before the effective date of the chapter, <em>i.e., </em>July 1, 1998. <em>See </em>35 P.S. <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>§ 10225.508 (requiring criminal record checks of all applicants and all employees who worked at a covered facility for less than a year, but exempting from checks any employees who worked at a covered facility for more than a year). As such, the chapter no doubt permitted innumerable individuals with disqualifying criminal records to continue working with the purportedly protected population solely because they had maintained a job in a covered facility for the year preceding the effective date of the chapter. Moreover, many of these same individuals no doubt continue to work with the elderly, disabled, and infirm today, in spite of the General Assembly’s apparent conclusion that convicted criminals pose an unacceptable risk to that population.</p>

Here, it is clear that no such real and substantial relationship exists. If the goal of the criminal records chapter is, as the Commonwealth Parties allege, to protect the Commonwealth’s vulnerable citizens from those deemed incapable of safely providing for them, there was simply no basis to distinguish caretakers with convictions who had been fortunate enough to hold a single job since July 1, 1997, <em>ie., </em>a year before the effective date of the chapter, from those who may have successfully worked in the industry for more than a year but had not held one continuous job in a covered facility since July 1, 1997.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a>

However, if convicted criminals who had been working at a covered facility for more than a year as of July 1,1998, were capable of essentially rehabilitating themselves so as to qualify them to continue working in a covered facility, there should be no reason why other convicted criminals were not, and are not, also capable of doing the same. In fact, according to the factual backgrounds provided by the Employees, many of the Employees worked successfully in covered facilities for years. <em>See supra </em>n. 9. Similarly, almost all of them gained the trust of their former supervisors at the covered facilities where they worked, as is apparent by the fact that their supervisors submitted declarations in which they averred that they would rehire the Employees if they could under the OAPSA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a>

In <em>John’s Vending Corp., </em>this Court considered whether the Secretary of Revenue properly revoked John's Vending’s wholesale cigarette license pursuant to a statute that provided that a license could not be <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>issued to a corporation if a 50% shareholder had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. John’s Vending’s license had been revoked because a 50% shareholder had been convicted of possessing and selling alcohol as well as possessing and selling opium derivatives between fifteen and twenty years earlier. In considering whether the revocation was proper, this Court initially noted that it was reasonable for the General Assembly to include a provision in the statute concerning the character of the persons being licensed to sell cigarettes. <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20358" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="309 A.2d 358">309 A.2d at 361</a>.

With regard to substantive due process challenges brought under the Pennsylvania Constitution, the rational basis test is that announced by this Court in <em>Gambone. </em>Although the due process guarantees provided by the Pennsylvania Constitution are substantially coextensive with those provided by the Fourteenth Amendment, a more restrictive rational basis test is applied under our Constitution. <em>See Pastor, </em><a href="/citations/?q=272%20A.2d%20487" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="272 A.2d 487">272 A.2d at 490-91</a> (explaining that Pennsylvania courts have analyzed due process challenges under rational basis test “more closely’’ than the United States Supreme Court).

In his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Cappy states that this Court should not rely on the one year exemption created in section 508(1) to find the criminal records chapter unconstitutional as applied, because the Employees and RHD did not specifically argue that this exemption was irrational in their pleadings. However, in conducting a due process analysis to determine if the chapter’s restrictions on the Employees’ right to employment are indeed rational, as the Commonwealth Parties argue, it is necessary to look at the entire effect of the restrictions and thus, the rationality of the one year exemption was appropriate for consideration. Moreover, as acknowledged by Chief Justice Cappy, the Employees and RHD directly argued during the preliminary injunction hearing that the Act was irrational based on the one year exemption. <em>See </em>N.T., 8/31/2000, at 8. ("Then the Act itself, and this is one of the reasons we think the Act is irrational, is it has a grandfathering clause, so even though the Commonwealth says my clients and others are such a great threat that we can’t have them working with the most vulnerable people of society, it’s okay for them to work with the most vulnerable people of society if they were still at a job they were at for 365 days of the year before July 1, 1998, i.e., the effective date of the Act.”).

    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.6",469,[141,451,1153,515]]]'>I agree that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to appellees and I join Mr. Justice Nigro’s learned Majority Opinion in its entirety. I write separately only to briefly note my view that, in addition to the constitutional infirmity in the legislation so well articulated by the Majority, the lifetime ban which arises from the broad class of prior convictions covered by the amended Older Adults Protective Services Act (OAP-SA), 35 P.S. § 10225.101 <em>et seq., </em>has no rational relationship to the legitimate, desired end of protecting the elderly, disabled and infirm from victimization.</p>
    <p id="b469-6" data-blocks='[["BL_469.7",469,[140,1000,1155,523]]]'>There unquestionably are certain criminal offenses which are of such severity that all reasonable persons might agree that a lifetime ban from this type of employment is both rational and, indeed, required. Some debts to society cannot be entirely repaid. But it is difficult to discern a rational basis for automatically deeming an ancient conviction for theft (see appellee Curry) or for simple possession of a controlled substance (see appellees Nixon and Sharp), for example, as eternally and retroactively prohibiting otherwise qualified care workers from continued employment in these facilities.</p>
    <p id="b469-7" data-blocks='[["BL_469.8",469,[140,1548,1153,631]]]'>In this regard, I would contrast the current version of the statute with the previous version, which imposed a ten-year limitation upon the criminal background check. A ten-year restriction on collateral effects of certain convictions is not unknown in the law. Thus, for example, the Rules of Evidence permit impeachment by evidence of convictions of <em>crimen falsi </em>but limit the impeachment to situations where not more than ten years have elapsed “since the date of the conviction or of the release of witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date,” with an exception permitted if the probative value of the conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.

Erecting a hiring roadblock to the inflow of proven criminal offenders is not unconstitutional simply because others already beyond the roadblock were not forced out.
