Following investigation, Appellant, Raymond Johnson (“Appellant” or “Johnson”), was charged with criminal homicide and related offenses, and a warrant was issued for his arrest, followed by a fugitive warrant. Johnson was finally taken into custody in New York in February of 1998. <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>The Commonwealth provided notice of its intention to seek the death penalty, and a jury trial ensued in September, 2000. In the guilt phase, the Commonwealth proffered, <em>inter alia, </em>eyewitness- accounts identifying Johnson as the killer, and Johnson presented alibi witnesses, although he did not himself testify. The jury returned a verdict of guilt, <em>inter alia, </em>on the charge of first-degree murder, and, following a penalty hearing, rendered a death verdict. The jurors found that the aggravating circumstance entailing involvement, association or competition with the victim in the sale, manufacture, distribution or delivery of illegal drugs, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(14), outweighed mitigating factors concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of the offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). New counsel was appointed for purposes of direct appeal; after the filing of an initial brief, an additional substitution of counsel occurred, accompanied by the filing of a supplemental brief raising additional claims.</p>

Johnson also raised several other issues and claims in the argument section of his brief, most of which are interrelated with those set forth in the statement of questions presented. Further, in his supplemental brief, Johnson argued that the initial jury selection process was tainted due to a racially imbalanced jury pool, and that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to: object to the district attorney’s questioning of Starks during the defense case concerning his brother’s arrest for murder in an unrelated criminal case; request an instruction that life imprisonment means life imprisonment without the possibility of parole; and investigate, develop, and present mental health and personal history mitigation evidence.</p>

He described his participation in drug trafficking with Combs in the local area, and Combs’ concern with another group, headquartered at 437 Schuylkill Avenue, which had begun to compete for area sales. According to Cook’s account, on two consecutive days, he and Combs confronted Starks, who they suspected was a member of the rival group; on the second occasion (the afternoon of the killing), accompanied by Branford and in the vicinity of 437 Schuylkill Avenue, Cook demanded to speak with Starks’ supplier. Starks left and returned a short time later with Johnson. Johnson and Combs then entered a breezeway, while Cook remained on the sidewalk in a position that allowed him to observe the men as they talked. After a few moments, he saw Johnson pull a gun from his waist, extend his arm, and shoot Combs in the abdomen. Cook testified that he then fled, and, as he was running, noticed another member of Johnson’s group, known only as Izod or Ike, in the vicinity. Cook also described his later encounter with Johnson and Starks while the three were incarcerated in Berks County Prison, which he interpreted as a warning against his incriminating Johnson in the killing.</p>

Ramsey indicated that Johnson experienced problems with Combs for some time prior to the murder, which, she believed, resulted from the fact that Johnson and Izod, whom she described as Johnson’s “right-hand man,” were selling drugs in proximity to Combs’ operations. She recalled overhearing conversations between Johnson and Izod on the subject, during which Johnson would “get mad, and [say] he was going to handle that. And they didn’t know who they were playing with.” She was also present during a confrontation between Combs and Izod that occurred approximately two weeks before the murder, which, she ex<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>plained, “was basically about turf.,..

Ramsey recalled Johnson placing several calls from a nearby telephone booth throughout the day and receiving separate visits from Starks (whom Ramsey also identified as selling drugs for Johnson) and Izod; during the latter’s visit she overheard the two discussing “something about handling that.” Ramsey later learned that something had occurred on Schuylkill Avenue and, upon investigation, received a message to page Izod and Johnson. She recounted that, upon responding to the page, Izod informed her that “we did them n_s. You didn’t think we would, but we did. There is not going to be a problem.”</p>

The detective also detailed his efforts to locate Johnson in both Reading and New York, testifying that he: contacted Johnson’s friends and relatives in Reading; checked addresses that Johnson was known to frequent; and traveled to New York, where he spoke with more of Johnson’s friends and relatives.

Although Johnson concedes that Combs was angry that drug sales were being diverted by someone at that location, he argues that the Commonwealth’s evidence failed to establish that Combs knew the identity of the competitor. In this respect, Johnson discounts several, discrete aspects of the Commonwealth’s evidence, such as Ramsey’s testimony, which tended to show competition in drug trafficking, as lacking in specificity and concreteness. Furthermore, he suggests that the Commonwealth’s case was weakened by the inability of prosecution witnesses to recount the conversation between Johnson and Combs that transpired immediately prior to the killing.</p>

Ramsey indicated, however, that Johnson was specifically aware of the competition between his and Combs’ groups. Combined with the evidence that Johnson was summoned to the scene of the killing when Combs and Cook approached Starks (who was linked to Johnson’s drug trafficking via Ramsey’s testimony) and Cook asked to meet with Starks’ supplier, as well as the statement from Izod (as recounted by Ramsey) implicating himself and another in the killing, the evidence is sufficient to support the inference that the murder was related to the established drug-trade competition. We do not read Section 9711(d)(14) as requiring the degree of specificity in the geographic boundaries of each competitor’s drug-sale activities which Appellant seems to suggest is necessary, or as precluding satisfaction of the Commonwealth’s burden, in whole or in part, by evidence that is circumstantial in character.</p>

Johnson acknowledges that such evidence, while generally inadmissible to demonstrate character attributes, <em>see </em>Pa.R.E. 404(b)(1), may be properly admitted where it is relevant to establish motive. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2). He also recognizes that the Commonwealth’s theory of the case was that Combs was killed in connection with a territorial rivalry among drug traffickers. However, in a manner similar to his argument concerning the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the Section 9711(d)(14) aggravating circumstance, Johnson claims that the Commonwealth’s evidence was too attenuated to support the use of the drug-sale rivalry motivation as evidence of his guilt. For example, he asserts that the Commonwealth failed to establish at trial that either Ramsey or Starks was involved in a drug organization run by Johnson that had a rivalry with Combs in the vicinity of 437 Schuylkill Avenue. In particular, Johnson argues, Ramsey indicated that Starks never told her where he sold drugs for Johnson, thus diminishing any probative value of drug rivalry at the Schuylkill Avenue location. Furthermore, Johnson contends, it was not established at trial that Starks knew of any rivalry between Johnson and Combs, was part of such, or was in any manner connected to the possible motive for the victim’s death. Johnson notes that the victim’s drug trafficking collaborator, Cook, who summoned Starks’ supplier to the scene of the killing, was not aware whom Starks would bring. Even assuming that the evidence was properly admitted, according to Johnson, the trial court erred in failing to issue a cautionary, limiting instruction during the course of Ramsey’s testimony. Although Johnson acknowledges that the court did include in its general charge after the close of the evidence an admonition that the jurors should consider other-crimes testimony solely for the purpose of evidencing motive,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> he contends <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>that this simply could not serve as an adequate substitute for a contemporaneous charge. In this regard, Johnson emphasizes the prejudicial impact of other-crimes evidence, and the importance of Ramsey’s testimony to the prosecution, particularly since the jurors twice requested to hear it repeated during their deliberations.</p>
    <p id="b101-4" data-blocks='[["BL_101.7",101,[138,654,1155,758]]]'>On consideration of the above, we conclude that the Commonwealth’s reliance on evidence of Johnson’s involvement in drug trafficking to establish his motive was permissible under governing evidentiary precepts. Again, Appellant offers no support for his position, interwoven into several of his arguments, that the Commonwealth was bound to establish specific geographic boundaries for the activities of each of Johnson’s and Combs’ groups to demonstrate the fact of their competition. It is enough, in our view, that prosecution testimony showed a diversion of drug sales from Combs’ group to Johnson’s, knowledge on the part of both men that there was competition (albeit that Combs may not have been aware of Johnson’s identity as his competitor), and Johnson’s awareness that Combs was his rival.</p>

Although Johnson’s argument contains a near concession that the Commonwealth effectively demonstrated an illegal drug conspiracy (“[a]t best, the Commonwealth established a conspiracy between Izod and [A]ppellant to distribute drugs”), he discerns no material significance from such fact. Further, Johnson contends that the Commonwealth failed to meet the second and third requirements of the coconspirator exception (demonstration that the statement was made during the course of the conspiracy and in furtherance of the common design), particularly as Izod’s comments were made after the occurrence of the shooting.</p>

It is axiomatic that simply because a statement falls within an exception to the hearsay rule does not make this statement per se admissible; only statements which are relevant are admissible in court. In this vein, the introduction of statements from an uncharged conspiracy, thus, might be precluded by application of general rules of the admissibility of evidence. <em>See id.; </em>Pa.R.E. 402.</p>
