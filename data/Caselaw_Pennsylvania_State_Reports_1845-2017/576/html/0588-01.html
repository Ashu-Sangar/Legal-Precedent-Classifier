Appellant’s maximum term of incarceration was calculated to expire on June 20, 1994. He was released on parole in 1987, and continued on parole despite being charged with driving under the influence (DUI), 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(1), and reckless driving, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3736(a), in 1990, with a subsequent conviction for disorderly conduct, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5503(a), in 1993. The Board declared him delinquent in June of 1994, and revoked his parole as a convicted parole violator on August 22, 1996, based upon his conviction for a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> His new expiration date for parole was recalculated as June 17, 2002.

His parole violation maximum date was then recalculated as October 28, 2004. On December 4, 2001, Appellant filed a timely petition for administrative relief in which he claimed that the Board erred in calculating his parole violation maximum date by failing to give him credit for all of the time that he had served pursuant to the Board warrant. In particular, Appellant averred that, because the new sentence imposed was forty-eight hours time served, with a consecutive one-year probationary period, his original sentence should have been credited for the remaining time spent in custody from June 1, 2000 to July 19, 2001. That is, Appellant requested allocation of all excess custody time that could not be credited toward the sentence he received for his most recent DUI conviction (48 hours) and during which period the Board also detained him.</p>

Rather than being an ad hoc exercise of clemency, parole is an established variation on imprisonment of convicted criminals. Its purpose is to help individuals reintegrate into society as constructive individuals as soon as they are able, without being confined for the full terms of the sentence imposed. It also serves to alleviate the cost to society of keeping an individual in prison. The essence of parole is release from prison, before the completion of sentence, on the condition that the prisoner abide by certain rules during the balance of the sentence.</blockquote>

Although the General Assembly enacted statutory provisions relating to credit for time served, it has not addressed the permutations that arise when applying credit for time served in the parole revocation context.

      <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>Generally, upon conviction of a crime carrying a sentence of two years or more (“state time” as opposed to “county time”), an individual comes under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, which maintains jurisdiction over the inmate while he is in prison. Pursuant to Pennsylvania law, the maximum term represents the sentence imposed for a criminal offense, with the minimum term merely setting the date after which a prisoner may be paroled. <em>Commonwealth v. Daniel, </em><a href="/pa/430/0642-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="430 Pa. 642" data-case-ids="1915766" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0642-01">430 Pa. 642</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=243%20A.2d%20400" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="243 A.2d 400">243 A.2d 400</a> (1968). When the minimum prison term expires, an inmate becomes eligible for parole and makes application to the Board, requesting a grant of parole. If parole is granted, or a term of probation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> has been imposed, the individual is removed from the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections and placed under the jurisdiction of the Board.

A sentence can be defined as the judgment formally pronounced by the court upon a defendant who has been convicted in a <em>new </em>criminal prosecution and which imposes the term of punishment to be served. <em>Rivenbark v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, </em><a href="/pa/509/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="509 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1795390" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0248-01">509 Pa. 248</a>, <a href="/pa/509/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="509 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1795390" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0248-01">501 A.2d 1110</a> (1985). By way of comparison, backtime is “that part of an <em>existing </em>judicially-imposed sentence which the Board directs a parolee to complete following a finding[,] after a <em>civil </em>administrative hearing!,] that the parolee violated the terms and conditions of parole,” and before the parolee begins to serve the new sentence. <em>Krantz v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, </em>86 Pa.Cmwlth. 38, <a href="/citations/?q=483%20A.2d%201044" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="483 A.2d 1044">483 A.2d 1044</a>, 1047 (1984); <em>see also McCaskill v.

Therefore, service of backtime relates to the original sentence from which <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>an offender is paroled and is unrelated to any sentence required for a conviction on other criminal charges.</p>
    <p id="b658-4" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[276,462,1164,1516]]]'>An offender on state parole is in the legal custody of the Board until that offender completes the service of his maximum sentence or until the Board recommits the offender as a parole violator. 37 Pa.Code § 63.2. <em>See also, Commonwealth ex rel. Sparks v. Russell, </em><a href="/pa/403/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="403 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1299502" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0320-01">403 Pa. 320</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.2d%20884" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="169 A.2d 884">169 A.2d 884</a> (1961) (where this Court noted that offenders released from confinement on parole remain in the legal custody of the Commonwealth and remain under the control of the Commonwealth until the expiration of the maximum sentence). If the offender is recommitted, he or she is returned to the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, regardless of whether the recommitment is for a new sentence or to serve a period of backtime. Pursuant to Section 331.21a(a.l), 61 P.S. § 331.21a(a.l), if an offender is subsequently arrested while on parole, an automatic Board detainer is applied, which subjects the offender to possible consequences for violations of parole that will be decided by the Board in a subsequent proceeding. Further, where a parolee is arrested while on parole, the Board is permitted, at its discretion, to place a detainer against the parolee that will “prevent the parolee from making bail, pending the disposition of the new charges or other action of the court.” 37 Pa.Code § 65.5(2). The detainer under these circumstances is an outstanding parole-violation charge and essentially constitutes an untried indictment, information, or complaint that is to be resolved at a probation revocation hearing. Therefore, when an offender is held on new criminal charges as well as a detainer lodged by the Board, we believe that the offender is confined for both offenses.</p>

This Court disagreed and held that, when a parolee is incarcerated on new criminal charges and does not post bail or has his bail revoked, time spent in jail is not credited to the parolee’s original sentence on recommitment as a convicted parole violator because the parolee was not incarcerated solely on the Board’s warrant.

      <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>The reason often given for the failure to apply credit for time served within circumstances similar to the instant matter, is that the Constitution neither permits nor requires the establishment of “penal checking accounts.” The concern is that prisoners, while not in confinement, could set up some sort of escrow into which they would deposit time spent awaiting trial on both a board warrant and pending charges, or that time served on unrelated charges later declared invalid could be deposited into that account to be subsequently withdrawn and applied toward a future sentence. As one court aptly noted, to allow an individual to accumulate time credits might mean that the situation could arise wherein an individual might have “banked” several years of prison time to apply to a sentence for a crime that he has not as yet committed or for which he has not yet been prosecuted. <em>United States ex rel. Smith v. Rundle, </em><a href="/f-supp/285/0965-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="285 F. Supp. 965" data-case-ids="2830786" data-case-paths="/f-supp/285/0965-01">285 F.Supp. 965</a> (E.D.Pa.1968). Our decision in the instant matter does not create a “penal checking account.” It merely provides for the allocation of all periods of confinement: (1) where confinement is the result of both a Board warrant and pending criminal charges; (2) where there is no period of incarceration imposed; (3) where the charges are nolle prossed; (4) or the parolee is acquitted. Accordingly, we hold that, where an offender is incarcerated on both a Board detainer and new criminal charges, all time spent in confinement must be credited to either the new sentence or the original sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> We further hold that the indigency of a detainee in failing to satisfy the requirements <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>for bail is not determinative as to whether the offender receives credit for time served.</p>

Such a disparity can have no conceivable penological justification. There are two purposes for awarding pre-sentence credits: (1) eliminating the unequal treatment suffered by indigent defendants who, because of their inability to post bail, may serve a longer overall confinement for a given offense than their wealthier counterparts; and (2) equalizing the actual time served in custody by defendants convicted of the same offense. These purposes are not met when an indigent detainee is denied credit for serving time on both a Board detainer and new criminal charges solely because the detainee does not have the financial resources to satisfy bail requirements. To the extent that decisions in this Commonwealth have held to the contrary, they are disapproved.</p>
