Grady (“Mr.Grady”) and his wife, Diana Grady (collectively, “Appellees”) commenced a lawsuit against the appellant, Frito-Lay, Inc. (“Frito-Lay”). In their <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>complaint, Appellees alleged that Mr. Grady ate several Doritos brand Tortilla Chips (“Doritos”) that Frito-Lay designed, manufactured, and sold; that Mr. Grady felt as though chips had lodged in his throat; that Mr. Grady sought emergency hospital care; that medical procedures showed that Mr. Grady suffered an esophageal tear that resulted in serious physical injuries; and that the Doritos Mr. Grady had eaten caused the esophageal tear. Alleging further that Frito-Lay’s Doritos are unsafe and defective because they fracture into hard, sharp fragments that are capable of lacerating the esophagus when eaten, Appellees set forth claims in negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty.</p>
    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[142,958,1159,408]]]'>When the pleadings closed, Frito-Lay filed Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, asserting that Appellees failed to produce evidence sufficient to satisfy their burden of proving that the Doritos had a defect; that the Doritos were improperly designed and manufactured; and that the Doritos caused Mr. Grady’s esophagus to tear. Frito-Lay further alleged that expert testimony was necessary to prove each of these issues.</p>
    <p id="b611-6" data-blocks='[["BL_611.6",611,[143,1396,1156,523]]]'>In their response to Frito-Lay’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Appellees filed two expert reports. One of the reports (the “Beroes Report”) was prepared by Charles Beroes, Ph.D., P.E., an associate professor emeritus of chemical engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. In his report, Dr. Beroes stated that Doritos possessed “several hidden-hazardous physical-strength and physical-shape properties” and described the tests he had performed on several types of Doritos, including Doritos that came from the bag of chips that Mr. Grady had eaten, to quantify these propensities. (Beroes Report at 2).</p>

In these tests, Dr. Beroes held a Dorito in his hand and pressed its triangular tip down on a platform gram balance that was covered with a pad until the chip snapped. He calculated the downward force needed to break each Dorito in grams, converted that force to pounds, and set forth “the average pressure that developed] under the chip tips” and “the average breaking force [he had] applied to <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>the tips”. (Beroes Report at 5, 7, 9). Dr. Beroes summarized this series of tests as establishing that “[l]arge pressures result when a few pounds of force are applied to the triangular shaped chips. The chip points were able to endure high pressures before fracturing. The sharp triangular chips can readily pierce the esophagus when driven into the walls of the esophagus by peristaltic action.” (Beroes Report at 3).</p>
    <p id="b612-5" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[289,714,1154,689]]]'>In a second series of tests, Dr. Beroes measured the time it took saliva to soften Doritos. These tests were conducted in the same manner as the dry chip test, except that Dr. Beroes used Doritos that he had wetted with saliva by holding them in his mouth for 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, and 60 seconds. According to Dr. Beroes, these tests showed that “the tips of the triangular chips did not soften sufficiently to prevent laceration of the esophagus after 60 seconds of exposure of saliva. Each triangular chip fractures into smaller triangular chips with sharp tips. These tips resemble spears. Enormous pressures occur on these needle sharp tips which can lacerate almost any tissues in the digestive tract.” (Be-roes Report at 10.)</p>
    <p id="b612-6" data-blocks='[["BL_612.6",612,[285,1439,1154,687]]]'>Based on his tests, Dr. Beroes concluded that the Doritos were dangerous and defective because they broke into smaller triangular chips that were too sharp, too thick, and too hard for safe passage in the esophagus. He also opined within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that Frito-Lay failed to warn of the dangers of eating Doritos; that it failed to conduct the appropriate safety studies; that it failed to produce and sell Doritos with uniform compressive strength and hardness; that Doritos were not fit for safe consumption; that Doritos were negligently designed and manufactured; and that their uneven and dangerous characteristics caused Mr. Grady’s esophageal tear and resulting injuries.

In a Motion to Preclude Plaintiffs’ Expert, Charles S. Beroes, From Testifying With Regard To The Ultimate Issues Of This Case, Frito-Lay alleged that Dr. Beroes’ opinions with regard to ultimate issues were inadmissible because they were based on conflicting and unreliable evidence. And in a Motion To Preclude The Testimony of Plaintiffs’ Expert, Charles S. Beroes, Frito-Lay alleged that Dr. Beroes’ testimony regarding Doritos’ physical characteristics was inadmissible because it did not meet the rule announced in <em>Frye v.

Indeed, it was the impression of this member of the Court that Beroes’ methodology smacked of a high school science fair project and did not <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>bear any relationship to the reality of the mastication and consumption of foodstuffs.

    <blockquote id="b627-6" data-blocks='[["BL_627.6",627,[186,1723,1114,365]]]'>(1) “Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether a theory or technique is scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact will be whether it can be (and has been) tested. Scientific methodology today is based on generating hypotheses and testing them to see if they can be falsified; indeed, this methodology is what distinguishes science from other fields of human inquiry.”</blockquote>

Publication (which is but one element of peer review) is not a <em>sine qua non </em>of admissibility; it does not necessarily correlate with reliability, and in some instances well-<a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>grounded but innovative theories will not have been published. Some propositions, moreover, are too particular, too new, or of too limited interest to be published. But submission to the scrutiny of the scientific community is a component of ‘good science,’ in part because it increases the likelihood that substantive flaws in methodology will be detected.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[329,698,1115,204]]]'>(3) “Additionally, in the case of a particular scientific technique, the court ordinarily should consider the known or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique’s operation.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b628-6" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[327,921,1112,475]]]'>(4) “Finally, ‘general acceptance’ can yet have a bearing on the inquiry. A reliability assessment does not require, although it does permit, explicit identification of a relevant scientific community and an express determination of a particular degree of acceptance within that community. Widespread acceptance can be an important factor in ruling particular evidence admissible, and a known technique which has been able to attract only minimal support within the community may properly be viewed with skepticism.”</blockquote>

However, we need not consider these factors, because the technique the Gradys sought to introduce, crushing nacho chips with one’s finger and a Styrofoam block, could not assist a jury in <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>determining any fact in issue. As noted by Judge Eakin (now, Mr. Justice Eakin) in his dissent in the Superior Court, these tests wholly fail to account for the processes of mastication. How fast and effectively a person chews, the characteristics of teeth used, how teeth differ from a finger and a Styrofoam block, and how saliva would break down the chip are important questions that Dr. Beroes fails to consider. By not recognizing these inherent limitations in the methods of Dr. Beroes, the Gradys have not presented reliable evidence regarding the effect the nacho chips in question could have had on the esophagus of Carl R. Grady. Thus, albeit based on different grounds, I must concur with my colleagues that the trial court did not err in excluding the testimony of Dr. Beroes.</p>

Indeed, taken to an extreme, such a formulation could be read to suggest that a plaintiff in these circumstances would need to identify a scientific community centered on Doritos chewing.
