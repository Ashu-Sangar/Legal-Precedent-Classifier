In the present collateral proceedings, however, Appellant asserts that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to investigate and obtain evidence of mental health problems and substance abuse contained in a mental health evaluation and pre-sentence report prepared in connection with Jackson’s sentencing for his involvement in the offenses with Appellant. Alternatively, Appellant asserts that such evidence was in the Commonwealth’s possession, was exculpatory and, consistent with <em>Brady v.

Thus, I do not believe that the Court’s prior ruling addressed the merits of the present issue. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(a)(2) (stating that an issue is previously litigated where there has been a ruling on the merits).</p>

In support, Appellant has proffered affidavits from a psychiatrist and a psychologist, indicating that such mental impairment was in the nature of organic brain damage, was of long-standing nature, and affected his impulse control, reasoning, and judgment. Furthermore, Appellant argues that evidence of his difficult childhood and mental impairment was available to trial counsel and reflected in his school and juvenile records. Because the ruling on direct review did not touch upon the propriety of presenting this evidence, I would not deem such claim previously litigated.
