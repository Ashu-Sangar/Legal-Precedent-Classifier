In <em>Surrick, </em>Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Nix, -writing for a majority of the Court, synthesized from a large body of law in this and other jurisdictions, “a useful analytic method” to be employed in the judicial assessment of the validity of zoning enactments. The tri-partite method begins with an examination of the subject municipality’s location in or outside of “the path of urban-suburban growth.” For communities in the path of such growth, the analysis proceeds to an examination of the present state and stage of the community’s development. Finally, with respect to communities in the path of growth and not yet highly developed, the analysis concludes with an assessment of the degree to which the challenged regulations have the effect of excluding higher-density, multi-family residential uses.</p>

A number of the appellees herein invite this Court, in the light of such innovations and of newly recognized and ascendant land use policy objectives such as the protection of environmentally sensitive lands, agricultural activities and prime agricultural soils and the elimination or mitigation of urban and suburban sprawl, to abrogate either the obligation under <em>Surrick </em>to provide for a proportionate share of the regional need for higher-density, multi-family development or the availability of punitive “definitive relief’ under the rule of our decision in <em>Casey v. Zoning Hearing Board of Warwick Township, </em>328 A.2d at 469. We decline this invitation. As we will shortly explore in detail, the analytic method described in <em>Surrick </em>is sufficiently flexible in its proper application to accommodate the evolution of public land use priorities and concerns.

The term "sprawl” is typically used to describe development that is inefficient in its use of land (i.e. low density); constructed in a "leap frog” manner in areas without existing infrastructure, often on prime farmland; automobile dependent, and consisting of isolated single use neighborhoods requiring excessive transportation. Statistics underscore the extent to which sprawl is a pressing problem throughout this Commonwealth. Between 1960 and 1990, while the population of Pennsylvania’s largest metropolitan areas grew by 13%, their developed land area nearly doubled. Between 1970 and 1997, Pennsylvania lost 24,000 farms representing 25% of the total state farm acreage, to development. <em>See </em>Executive Order 1999-1 issued January 5, 1999. <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>Between 1982 and 1997, developed land in Pennsylvania increased by 41.3% while the population remained essentially constant. During this period 94% of the development occurred on land previously used for farming. 1999 Land Use Report at A-l. Pennsylvania ranks fifth in the nation (behind Texas, Georgia, Florida, and California) in the rate of land conversion due to development. National Resources Conservation Service “State Rankings by Acreage and Rate of Non-Federal Land Developed: 1982-1997”. An excellent introduction to the problem of sprawl in Pennsylvania and the need for multimunicipal land use regulation, with an emphasis on the region here at issue, can be found in Thomas Hylton's Save Our Land, Save Our Towns (1995 R &amp; B Books, Harrisburg, Pa.).</p>

Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that we need not decide that issue today because the evidence also established that the JZO did not create an exclusionary result in all of the townships or in the CM District in Upper Makefield Township.</p>
