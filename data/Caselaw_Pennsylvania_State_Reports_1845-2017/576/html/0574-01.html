Indeed, Appellant framed his mandamus petition around the notion that, regardless of the circumstances, he was entitled via statutory mandate to maintain his position and compensation pending a removal hearing and final decision. He did not raise the theory that he was entitled to greater pre-deprivation process (such as a hearing by the actual fact-finder) in relation to any interim suspension, nor has he presented such theory in his appellate brief to this Court.</p>

In my view, this statutory provision clearly precludes the board of school directors from taking any disciplinary action against a superintendent that effectively results <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>in a removal without first holding a hearing. As suspending a superintendent and denying him his contractual right to pay and benefits is, for all intents and purposes, a removal, I agree with Judge Pellegrini that the statute prohibits such a suspension absent “a full blown due process hearing.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Further, contrary to the findings of the Commonwealth Court below, I believe that Appellant’s ability to appeal from the Board’s decision following his termination hearing, which occurred two months after his suspension, was not a complete and adequate remedy from the Board’s wrongful deprivation of his salary and benefits for that two month period.</p>

The majority finds that the board of school directors has the right to make such suspensions pursuant to section 211 of the Code, which vests school districts with powers that are necessary to carry out provisions of the Code. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 2-211. However, in my view, section 10-1080 limits the board's powers under section 211 insofar as it specifically requires the board to conduct a hearing before terminating a superintendent or effectively terminating him by suspending him without pay. Thus, I do not believe that section 211 alone is dispositive regarding the board's inherent disciplinary powers.</p>
