But the issue here is not whether <em>any </em>zoning district designation could be appropriately applied to the Golf Club’s lands but whether the AG District designation can be so justified. It turns reason and land planning precepts on their head to assert, as the zoning board’s decision implies, that this tract’s <em>restricted, agricultural zoning </em>is justified by its ready access to the region’s primary arterial roads on every hand. Apart from a bare assertion that it is so, neither the zoning board nor the courts below have offered either reason or authority to support the proposition, essential to the propriety of the decision here reviewed, that the location of these highways makes agricultural zoning appropriate for this tract while the properties on the opposite side of the same roadways are appropriately zoned and developed for intense, commercial use.

Our decision with respect to Realen’s reverse spot zoning challenge makes it unnecessary to decide this novel issue. We will note, however, that the zoning board’s fact finding in this case includes particularly troubling examples of the difficulty Realen describes. For example, the zoning board here found as a pivotal fact that “[t]he subject property can be used and developed with single family detached dwellings, which are permitted by right on the subject property.” Factual Finding No. 68, zoning board’s decision at 10. The Township’s expert land planner testified during the course of the board’s hearing just to the contrary including the direct conclusion that none of the uses permitted by right on the tract are “practical.” R.R. 460a. Realen’s expert witnesses testified unambiguously that single-family detached homes are not a feasible use for this intensely developed, commercial area of the Township. <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>
      <em>See </em>R.R. 391a-393a. Therefore, the zoning board’s conclusion must be predicated on disbelief not only of the testimony of the challenger’s experts but of the Township’s experts offered in support of the ordinance as well.</p>

In indicating (again, contrary to the findings of the Board) that single family residential development is not a feasible use for the property, the majority again relies on the evidence most favorable to Appellant, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, 576 Pa. at 136-37, 838 A.2d at 731-32 (citing testimony from Appellant’s expert witness), and omits the evidence favorable to the Township. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., at 682 (testimony of John E. Rahenkamp) (‘‘It's obviously not an ideal site for large lot single-family homes. <em>Could it be used for that, yes. </em>But its not an ideal use.” (emphasis added)). The Commonwealth Court’s approach, on the other hand, took into account both lines of evidence and properly determined that their reconciliation rested squarely within the ambit of the fact-finder. <em>See Realen, </em><a href="/a2d/799/0938-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="799 A.2d 938" data-case-ids="9415928" data-case-paths="/a2d/799/0938-01">799 A.2d at 942-43</a>.</p>

Again citing only Appellant’s evidence, the majority also goes to some lengths to demonstrate that Township officials had and/or have a strong preference that the Property remain in its present, largely open state, including by way of reference to the comprehensive plan and various efforts undertaken, over the years, in furtherance of the open-space objective. However, the substantial evidence discussed above, accepted by the Zoning Hearing Board, also supports its inference that, regardless of 'the personal preferences of Township officials, there was an appreciation among the members of the governing body who enacted the controlling zoning ordinance that it would be unduly restrictive to limit the Property to its existing, albeit desirable, use.</p>
