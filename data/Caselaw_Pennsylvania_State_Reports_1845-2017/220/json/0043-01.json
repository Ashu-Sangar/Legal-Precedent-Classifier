But there was testimony that the street was dark and that the curtains of the car were down; that there was no headlight and the car could not be seen at the point where it was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to look, and that it could not be heard because of the noise of trains and mills in the immediate vicinity. This testimony carried the case to the jury. The rule stated in Carroll v. Penna. Railroad Co., 12 W. N. C. 348, is from its nature applicable only to clear cases where there is no reasonable doubt of the facts or the inferences to be drawn from them: Doyle v. Traction Co., 214 Pa. 382.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
