    "head_matter": "Hershey v. New York & Cleveland Gas Coal Company, Appellant.\nWill \u2014 Devise\u2014Life estate \u2014 Fee simple estate.\nTestator by his will directed as follows: \u201cI give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife the use and control of all our house, situate on the old homestead farm all the contents such as household goods of all kinds, also the orchard and vineyard and garden; also privilege to keep one or two cows and a horse on said farm, my son to furnish pasture, hay and feed for the same on said farm to have all the above described so long as she remains my -widow, also to have ten sheep with the above. I give, devise and bequeath to my son, the farm known as the old homestead farm and all that appertains thereto his heirs and assigns forever (excepting what is devised to his mother during her life as above specified, at her death, to the same to be sold and money divided\u2014 equally five shares. . . .\u201d Held, (1) that the clause in the -will relating to a sale was meaningless and should be disregarded; and (2) that the son took an estate in fee simple in the land subject to the life estate or interest of the widow.\nArgued Feb. 19, 1908.\nAppeal, No. 40, Oet. T., 1908, by-defendant, from judgment of.C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., Jan. T., 1908, No. 658, for plaintiff on case stated in suit of Harry W. Hershey v. The New York & Cleveland Gas Coal Company.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Mestrezat, Potter and Elkin, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated to determine marketable title-to real estate.\nSharer, J., filed the following opinion;\nThe action is for the purchase money of coal which the plaintiff agreed to sell to the defendant and which defendant declines to pay for, because, it says, that the title of plaintiff to the coal is not a fee simple free of incumbrances. It is admitted that the coal and the land under which it lies belonged to John Hershey, deceased ; that the title of the plaintiff depends upon a devise by John Hershey to him, the will of John Hershey being made a part of the case stated. The provisions of the will which relate to the land in question are \u25a0 as follows:\nFirst, a provision for the wife of the testator in these words:\n\u201c I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, Elizabeth Hershey, the use and control of all our house situate on the old homestead farm all the contents such as household goods of all kinds also the old orchard and vineyard garden ; also privilege to keep one or two cows and a horse on said farm my son Harry to furnish pasture, hay and feed for the same on said farm to have all the above described as long as she remains my widow.\u201d\nA later clause of the will is as follows :\n\u201c I give, devise and bequeath to my son Harry Hershey the farm known as the Old Homestead Farm and all that pertains thereto his heirs and assigns forever (excepting what is devised to his mother during her life as above specified, at her death, to the same to be sold and money divided \u2014 equally 5 shares.\u201d\nThe original will, being made a part of the case stated, as we understand it, was exhibited to the court by counsel, and by an inspection of it, it appears that the word, \u201c to,\u201d before the words, \u201c the same,\u201d is written over the line, the words, \u201c to have,\u201d being crossed out under it, and the words, \u201c to be,\u201d after the word, \u201c same,-\u201d were inserted after the succeeding words were written, and the words, \u201c equally 5 shares,\u201d are also inserted above the line.\nThe coal in question is part of the homestead farm. It does not appear from the case stated whether the widow of John Hershey is living or not, but it is agreed that the matter shall be decided without reference to her life estate, if she has any, in the garden, orchard and vineyard, which puts the case, as we understand it, as if the widow were now dead.\nIt is claimed by defendant that the words, \u201c at her death to the same to be sold and money divided,\u201d may apply to the farm itself, and amount to a devise of the farm to the plaintiff in fee as a trust to sell it and divide it into five shares. We are unable to see that the clause can have any such meaning. It seems to us that the clause as it stands is entirely meaningless, although we have no doubt that the scrivener, after properly enough excepting from the devise to Harry what had already been given to the widow, tried to insert a direction as to what was to be done with the property so excepted, which could only refer to the household furniture which she had been given for life, and which the scrivener no doubt meant by the words, \u201c all that pertains,\u201d to the old homestead. The will having by express words given a fee to Harry in the farm, subject to the life estate or interest of the widow, and no other disposition of the farm being made, and the will containing no residuary clause, we are clearly of opinion that there is nothing in the clause in question to cut down the estate in fee in any way, or to impress it with any trust. Being of opinion, therefore, that so far as appears by the case stated the plaintiff has a good title in fee simple, it is ordered that judgment be entered for plaintiff according to the agreement of the parties for $1,505, with interest from February 21, 1907.\nThe court entered judgment for plaintiff for $1,505 on case stated.\nError assigned was in entering judgment for plaintiff on case stated.\nWm. E. Sehoyer, with him Lyon, Hunter \u00e1e BurTte, for appellant.\nAlfred M. Lee, for appellee.\nApril 20, 1908 :"
