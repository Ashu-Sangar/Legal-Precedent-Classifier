The grounds of defense were that no definite contract had been made; that the contract set out in the bill was for an interest in land and void under the statute of frauds; and that there was no jurisdiction in equity because of an adequate remedy at law. The decree in favor of the plaintiff is based on the findings of fact by the court that a sale of the timber was made; that the parties contemplated the immediate severance and removal of the timber from the land; that the timber was purchased by the plaintiff for use in carrying on his business and that it had a special value to him because of its character and because of the scarcity of timber of the kind in the section where his business was conducted.</p>

In the last of these cases it was said by our Brother Mestbezat : “ To justify us in reversing the finding of a chancellor on a question of fact, as we have often said, clear and plain error must be pointed out. It is not sufficient that our conclusions would be different oji the testimony brought up on the record.” Because the correctness of the findings has been challenged, we have examined the testimony as we should in the case of a nonsuit or the refusal to direct a verdict for the defendant, to determine whether there was testimony which, if believed, sustains them.

Rutter, 1 Leading Cases in Eq. 1099. Ordinarily a complete remedy may be had in an action at law for the breach of such a contract as that.under consideration, but in this case we have the finding that the timber had a special value to the plaintiff for the use for which he bought it because of its quality and because of the difficulty of procuring such timber in the locality in which his business was conducted. The case does not differ in principle from that of Vail v. Osburn, <a href="/pa/174/0580-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="174 Pa. 580" data-case-ids="878536" data-case-paths="/pa/174/0580-01">174 Pa. 580</a>, where a contract to cut and deliver bark to a tannery from trees in proximity to it was enforced.</p>
