Said company was in sore need of money, was threatened with financial disaster for want thereof, which would have resulted in the sacrifice of all or the greater part of plaintiff’s investment therein as above. Plaintiff said that he had no money to loan to said company to save his said investment, and thereupon applied to me for that purpose. lie proposed to me that if I would loan to said company the sum of $1,250, taking its note therefor at one year, before which time he said it would be easily able to pay it, he would sell to me 200 shares of its stock for the sum of $1,250 and take my note therefor, which note I would not be called upon to pay except out of and from the moneys to be repaid to me by said company in payment of its note held by me as aforesaid.

The inducing promise of the appellee was not intended to be incorporated in the note any more than the stock consideration which the appellant received, but, when the promise was broken, the right of the maker was to defend on its breach, for the same reason that he could defend for failure of consideration. When this defense prevails in a suit between the original parties to an obligation, its terms are not only contradicted, but set aside. Failure of consideration is, nevertheless, a defense, and so is a broken promise, if it induced the obligation.</p>

It may be conceded that no fraud was practiced upon the appellant by the appellee when he received the note, and that at that time he honestly intended to keep his promise as to how it should be paid; but, however honest and upright his intention may then have been, if, to procure an unfair advantage to himself, he now attempts to exact payment from the appellant in violation of his promise, without which the note would not have been given, he is guilty of a fraud, against which the appellant may defend; and the latter is not defending on the ground that the plaintiff had agreed that he would not use the note as a note,'but that he is attempting to use it differently from the use which he promised he would make of it.</p>

In the first case the question of' a promise as the inducement to the execution of the obligation was not involved. The affidavit of defense was held to be insufficient because there was nothing but an averment of a contemporaneous agreement that the note should not mature absolutely in six months, according to its terms. The question here involved was not in that case. The other two, instead of justifying the judgment against the appellant, rather support his defense. In Phillips v. Meily, <a href="/pa/106/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="106 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="455579" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0536-01">106 Pa. 536</a>, we said: “ The <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>cases in this state in which parol evidence has been allowed to contradict or vary written instruments, may be classed under two heads: 1st. Where there was fraud, accident or mistake in the creation of the instrument itself, and 2d. Where there has been an attempt to make a fraudulent use of the instrument, in violation of a promise or agreement made at the time the instrument was signed, and without which it would not have been executed. To the latter class belong Renshaw v. Gans, 7 Barr, 118 ; Rearich v.

Barrett, in reversing the court below and directing judgment to be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, it was said: “ The affidavit contained no averment that the defendant was induced to sign the note by reason of the oral stipulation, and this was sufficient in itself to warrant the entry of judgment for the plaintiff: Martin v.

Surely, the testimony of a single witness, and he the defendant, ought not to be sufficient tocontradict and set aside <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>his deliberate promise in writing to pay on a fixed day, absolutely, a certain sum of money.” In Homewood People’s Bank v.

The plaintiff there was not allowed to recover, because he had declared on a written agreement, and on the trial, to meet a defense set up, undertook to show a parol contemporaneous agreement on the part of the defendant, without averring or attempting to prove that it had’been omitted from the written one by fraud, accident or mistake.</p>

The exceptions, indeed, have in many instances almost eaten out the heart of the rule itself; but it is not altogether abolished, as may be seen in Martin v. Berens, 17 P. F. Smith, 459, where, in an elaborate opinion, our'late lamented brother, Mr. Justice Williams, exhaustively states the exceptions to the rule. But from Hurst’s Lessee v. Kirkbride, decided in 1773 — reported by Chief Justice Tilghman in Wallace v. Baker, <a href="/binn/1/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Binn. 610" data-case-ids="1787893" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0610-01">1 Binn. 610</a> — down to the present time, this court has uniformly held, that where at the execution of a writing a stipulation has been entered into, a condition annexed, or a promise made by word of mouth, upon the faith of which the writing has been executed, that parol evidence is admissible, though it may vary and materially change the terms of the contract. Mr. Justice Williams recognizes this in his opinion in Martin v. Berens, for he says, speaking of the case then be<a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>fore the court: <em>‘ </em>Here there is no allegation in either affidavit that the defendants were induced to execute the lease on the faith of the alleged parol agreement.’ It would be an affectation of learning to cite all the cases which establish this principle, but to those contained in the argument of the counsel of the plaintiff in error, may be added Miller v. Henderson, 10 S. &amp; R. 290, which is instar omnium, but may be noticed as a case on all fours with the one now before the court: ” Greenawalt v. Kohne, <a href="/pa/85/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="85 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="440522" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0369-01">85 Pa. 369</a>. “ Ho principle is better settled than that parol evidence is admissible to show a verbal contemporaneous agreement, which induced the execution of a written obligation, though it may vary or change the terms of the written contract. Therefore it was competent .for the defendant to prove, if he could, that it was agreed before and at the time he signed the bond, that it should not be resorted to until after the security of the mortgage was exhausted, and that the security of the mortgage was lost through the plaintiff’s negligence: ” Juniata Building Association v. Hetzel, <a href="/pa/103/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="103 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="449118" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0507-01">103 Pa. 507</a>. “ The existence of a contemporaneous parol agreement between the parties under the influence of which a note or contract has been signed, which is violated as soon as it has accomplished its purpose in securing the execution of the paper, may always be shown when the enforcement of the paper is attempted. It is a plain fraud to secure the execution of an instrument by representations as to the manner in which payment shall be made, differing in important particulars from those contained in the paper, and, after the paper has been signed, attempt to compel literal compliance with its terms, regardless of the contemporaneous agreement without which it would never have been signed at all.
