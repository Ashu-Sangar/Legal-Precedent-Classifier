In 1887 the legislature passed a general law applicable to all boroughs, which allowed them to go beyond their limits for the purpose of procuring water, and in pursuance of that act the defendant borough established another pumping station at Milltown, and it is for the damages which the plaintiff says he incurred by reason of this taking that this suit is brought.</p>

In order to determine what the difference in loss was, it is necessary to know exactly what was the condition of this property in 1897. The plaintiff himself has testified on that point, and we turn to his testimony. He says : “ I realized the loss in my water<a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>power in 1895. Those two years I spoke of I was dreadfully handicapped, and had serious loss from the fact of not being able to run the mill.” It is admitted, I believe, that up to 1895 there was no perceptible loss of water-power. “ In 1895 and 1896 we were suffering a great deal of loss from not having sufficient power to operate the mills, not even enough in 1895 and 1896 to operate the flour mill alone half time in dry seasons. We were losing by having to go into the market to buy flour with which to supply the contracts,” and so forth. Again : “We were able to run up to 1895 ; 1895 the night miller and also the day miller were both losing time during that time.” He had previously said: “ The water was noticeably decreasing from 1883, along there. We noticed the decrease in water and knew the cause, and yet we had sufficient to run the mill, but we foresaw the increased consumption or taking of West Chester was <em>going </em>to ruin the power.” The question was asked: “ Tell us in 1897 how you found the water for running your mill before you put a gasoline engine in at all. A. We had not water sufficient to run the flour mill more than half time a great deal of the time ; sometimes a little more,” and so forth. “ The sawmill was standing a good part of that time, only when there was a wet day, or something of that kind. In 1896 or 1897 we partially abandoned that, but we allowed the logs to come to the mill and saw them up as we could.” Again : “ From 1895 to 1903 there was a great deal of the time that the flour mill would not make twelve hours out of the twenty-four, with the mill not running in the summer seasons, and a great deal of the time in winter time. I was away from the place a great deal.” Here he said : “ Q. How many hours are you able to run your mill ? A. It is a varying thing. From six hours out of the twenty-four to probably twelve; it depends on the season, and on the summers in ordinary stages, you could not hardly do that. There are times you can run full.”</p>

In that year, if I am correct, he put in a gasoline engine, this for the purpose of restoring part of his power, showing in addition that he had sustained a loss of power up to that time. On this question the defendants have introduced the testimony of a witness named Brinton, who testi<a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>fled that in a conversation with the plaintiff he was told that the reason for putting in that gasoline engine was on account of the drought and the flood. This conversation is denied by the plaintiff, who says that he never made any statement of that kind.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b525-3" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[200,637,1174,1068]]]'>In 1897 the new taking took place under which the defendants are allowed to take 1,250,000 gallons of water away. Consider how much additional damage will be done as effected by this additional right to take. Has experience demonstrated any material damage to this power measured by what has been taken since 1897 ? According to Mercer, who was the engineer for the defendant company for the years commencing 1895 to 1900, the highest quantity taken, as I have it, was 716,933, but he testified that during the period of nine years and six months, if I am not mistaken, the pumping at Milltown was only for 121 days. During the rest of the period covered b} these years the loss, according to the testimony, was the same as in 1897 or after. The question for you then is to decide how did the damage that had already taken place at Milltown affect this property. If, during the balance of the period, exclusive of the 121 days, the pumping was all done from Fern Hill, you would have to say, in the best manner possible, how this mill was damaged any more after 1897 up to this time than it was before, remembering that up to this time the defendants have not yet taken 1,-250,000 gallons daily.</p>

But even if that has shown no loss, you are still to remember that the defendants are entitled to take 1,250,000 gallons. Therefore, although no appreciable loss of power can be attributed to Milltown with the quantity already taken, yet, with the right to take the whole 1,250,000 gallons, if the value of the property is diminished, plaintiff is entitled to recover whatever that may be, as measured by the difference in market value before and after 1807.] [3]</p>

In this case you are not to punish the defendant for anything it has done, because it has taken it by lawful means.

Water Company, <a href="/pa/176/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="176 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="882208" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0223-01">176 Pa. 223</a>. In that case the water company limited its appropriation of water to 2,000,000 gallons each day, and Justice Williams said (p. 227): “ The attention of the jury should have been drawn strictly to the question, how much has this property been reduced in value by reason of the appropriation and withdrawal from the stream of the 2,000,000 gallons of water? Anything tending to obscure, or divert attention from, this well settled measure, of damages should have been avoided.”</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[285,1087,1175,248]]]'>In the present case, as the second resolution limited the right of the defendant to 1,250,000 gallons daily, and the charge of the court limited the damages to the withdrawal of that amount, the ruling was squarely within the principle laid down in Lee v. Water Co., <a href="/pa/176/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="176 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="882208" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0223-01">176 Pa. 223</a>.</p>
    <p id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[286,1343,1174,1065]]]'>Counsel for appellant complains of the trial judge for confining the jury in the assessment of damages, to the taking of the water at Militown, and excluding the taking at Fern ITill. We think the trial judge was clearly right in so doing. The taking at Fern ITill was before appellant had any title to the property in question. It is settled in Pennsylvania, as stated in the opinion in Losch’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/109/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="109 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="542238" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0072-01">109 Pa. 72</a>, that <em>“ </em>damages being in the nature of a trespass for injury done to the land, do not pass by a subsequent conveyance thereof. The damages were a personal claim of the owner when the injury occurred. They do not run with the land nor pass by the deed, although not specifically reserved.” To the same effect are Warrell v. Wheeling, etc., R. R., <a href="/pa/130/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="130 Pa. 600" data-case-ids="568998" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0600-01">130 Pa. 600</a> ; Tenbrooke v.

In his twelfth assignment of error, appellant complains of the affirmance of defendant’s thirteenth point for charge, by which the jury were instructed that plaintiff would not be entitled to have his damages increased because of delay in settlement, “ if the jury find his demand was so exorbitant and unreasonable as to make payment of his reasonable damages impossible.” No fault can be found with this instruction as a sound proposition of law. The evidence showed that in the action of trespass brought in 1904 by appellant against the defendant, he laid his damages at the sum of $20,000, and in the testimony in the present case the same amount is claimed. The jury found the actual damages to have been $2,800. Such a discrepancy might well be deemed sufficient to warrant the jury in refusing to allow any additional sum for the delay in making settlement.</p>
