    <p id="b82-10" data-blocks='[["BL_82.13",82,[306,1496,1180,908]]]'>It has been earnestly argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury because there was a failure to prove that the defendant had not done all that was required of it to make the place of work safe, according to the usage and custom of the business in which it was engaged, and because the plaintiff’s husband assumed an obvious risk connected with his work and arising from it, of which he had full knowledge. A careful examination of the testimony leads us to the conclusion that this contention cannot be sustained on either ground. There was testimony tending to show that both the general manager of the defendant’s works and the superintendent of the factory where the accident happened, had causa to know, notwithstanding the reports of inspection, that the boiler was unsafe. And it was not so clearly shown that the plaintiff’s husband had charge of the boiler, and had knowledge of its condition, that the court could have considered this as established by the testimony.</p>

      <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>The second assignment of error, however, calls for a reversal of the judgment. In addressing the jury the plaintiff’s counsel said : “ It is nothing to the glass company what this verdict should be; it is the insurance company that will pay the verdict. It is the fact that the president of the United States is advocating the abolition of this kind of insurance, because Lhe existence of this kind of insurance is against public policy because it leads to a neglect of their duties by the employers. Remember, this company does not pay the verdict. Mr. Anderson has no interest in this case. The only man who has an interest in this case is Mr. Rodgers.”</p>
    <p id="b83-3" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[153,954,1180,1273]]]'>This was an invitation to find a verdict on false grounds, and it is open to the objections named in the opinion in Saxton v. Pittsburg Railways Co., <a href="/pa/219/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="219 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1002806" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0492-01">219 Pa. 492</a>. In Walsh v.

In Manigold v. Traction Co., <a href="/ad/81/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="81 A.D. 381" data-case-ids="5009175" data-case-paths="/ad/81/0381-01">81 N. Y.
