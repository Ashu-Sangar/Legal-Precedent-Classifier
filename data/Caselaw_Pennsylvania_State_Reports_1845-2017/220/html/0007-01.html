If the power to relocate a street were given, then it must necessarily follow that the act of relocation would annul and do away with the former location, as the re-establishment of the grade of a street repeals the former, and must of necessity repeal the former grade established. But this ordinance does not contemplate the doing away of the former location of Virgin alley. Virgin alley is established to-day as it has been for generations, an open, improved and traveled highway, unaffected, so far as the public is concerned, by the ordinance of July 1, 1908.</p>

      <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>The term “to lay out a street” is essentially a preliminary step to the establishing of a new highway: Foster v. City of Boston Park Commissioners, <a href="/mass/133/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="133 Mass. 321" data-case-ids="2150966" data-case-paths="/mass/133/0321-01">133 Mass. 321</a>. The natural and ordinary meaning of the phrase is to fix the boundaries and to establish the location of something that has not been fixed or established before. But, as we have said, Yirgin alley was an established street, graded, paved, curbed and used by the public for many, many years prior to the passage of this ordinance. In any aspect which we will view the term “ to lay out ” or “ to locate ” the purpose to be gained by the city in the passage of this ordinance is not to locate a new street or to relocate a street, but to widen an existing street. The purpose is to widen Yirgin alley, now Oliver avenue, to the width of forty-four feet. The city has this power given to it by the legislature, and there are only two ways by which a municipality may change the lines of an existing street, and that is by widening or straightening. This the city can do by passing a proper ordinance to widen Oliver avenue, but the passage of such an ordinance would be the taking of the plaintiff’s property, and the city would be compelled immediately to compensate the plaintiff in damages.</p>
    <p id="b41-5" data-blocks='[["BL_41.4",41,[184,1511,1178,814]]]'>And this brings us to a contemplation of the whole purpose and evil of this ordinance. The city is evidently not prepared at the present time to widen Oliver avenue, and it attempts by the passage of this ordinance to prevent any additional improvements being made upon the property, which lies between the proposed northerly line and the present northerly line of Oliver avenue pending the passage of an ordinance for such widening. As we have stated above, this street extends across some of the most prominent business thoroughfares of the city. The property taken from the plaintiff at the corner of Smithfield street and Oliver avenue is very valuable business property. If this ordinance be allowed to stand it ties up the property of the plaintiff for an indefinite period, prevents any improvements being made upon his property, interferes with the leasing of his property for any extended term, and is a serious cloud upon his title.</p>

Whether it be by provision in the same ordinance by which the street is opened, or by a separate ordinance first adopted, the lines of the street must be fixed, its location adopted by the city; in other words, the street must be laid out before it can be opened, because there is nothing on the ground by which the street boundaries may be fixed in the opening except by the ordinance of location. Such power is not essential to the widening of a street, and such power was not given to municipalities by the legislature. Therefore, it is a matter for consideration by the courts of the purpose of the legislation and the injury which it will entail to the plaintiff.</p>

The manifest purpose the city had in view in passing the ordinance was, as clearly disclosed in the ordinance itself, to ultimately widen Yirgin alley.

By an ordinance, passed about six months prior to the ordinance in question, the city authorized the widening and opening of Yirgin alley from Liberty avenue to Smithfield street, and the assessment of damages caused by the grade of the street. Instead of extending this ordinance to that part of the alley between Smithfield and Grant streets, and thereby authorizing the widening of the alley, as was done in the part of it between Liberty avenue and Smithfield street, the city passed the ordinance in question which is entitled “ An ordinance re<a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>locating the northern building line of Virgin alley, from Smith-field street to Grant street.” As said by the learned trial judge in his opinion, “if this ordinance be allowed to stand it ties up the property of the plaintiff for an indefinite period, prevents any improvements being made upon his property, interferes with the leasing of his property for any extended term, and is a serious cloud upon his title.”</p>
    <p id="b44-5" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[284,746,1183,1004]]]'>Notwithstanding the title of the ordinance, it is simply an ordinance for the widening of Virgin alley between Smith* field and Grant streets. The “ relocating the northern building line of Virgin alley ” is widening Virgin alley for the distance between the present and the proposed northern line. This difference is declared in the ordinance to be twenty-four feet, and the width of the alley is simply enlarged to that extent ; or the alley is widened, in the language of the ordinance itself, “ by taking a strip of ground twenty-four feet in width from the properties on the northern side of Virgin alley.” The alley remains as it has existed for many years, and it is not proposed in the ordinance to change its location or to vacate it. Its southern line is to remain as it ever has been, and the purpose of the ordinance is simply, as its title declares, to locate the northern line of the alley by a line parallel with and twenty-four feet distant from the present northern line of the alley. These are the facts of the case as declared by the ordinance itself. It is in effect, therefore, and may be said to be an ordinance to widen Virgin alley between Smithfield and Grant streets.</p>

The city, therefore, is not driven to invoke the aid of any implied powers, nor, as we have seen, can it invoke them so long as there is express statutory power authorizing it to accomplish its purpose. There is an abundance of legislation conferring ample power upon the city to locate, lay out and open streets; to widen, straighten, extend and vacate streets; and to grade, pave, curb, macadamize and otherwise improve streets. So long as this authority exists, so long must it be strictly pursued. Nor can the municipality evade a compliance with the method pointed out for exercising the authority. Whenever the municipality desires authority to act, it must proceed in the manner which the facts of the case require. Its council cannot escape the provisions of the statute or ignore the course of procedure directed by the statute by simply declaring in the ordinance a purpose other than the facts disclose. The facts must determine what method the city shall pursue to accomplish its purpose, and those facts requiring it to proceed in the manner provided in certain legislation, the provisions of the legislation will determine the course of procedure.</p>
