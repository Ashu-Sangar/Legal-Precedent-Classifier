If its interposition is a necessity, then it may be invoked with all its legal consequences. Before the rule can operate, however, in the case of a will, the purpose of a testator must be ascertained. Until this is done there is no room for the application of the doctrine. The intent of the testator being ascertained, then so far, and only so far, as there is a necessity to carry that into effect will there be conversion, though an actual sale of the land has taken place. The doctrine is not an inexorable rule of law to control the inheritance of estates, or to defeat the intestate laws of the state which direct the disposition of the estates of the dead. It is not an inheritance law, nor is it a rule, enforcible at law or in equity, by which a court can divert the transmission of real property from the inheritable channel provided by the laws of the commonwealth. It is simply a fiction, a creation of equity, to carry into effect the purpose in the disposition of his real estate which a testator has expressed in his will and which, without its application, would be defeated.</p>

      <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>The doctrine of equitable conversion is a creature of equity, and is wholly unknown to the law. It is based on the familiar maxim that what ought tobe done will be considered or treated as already done. It is now a well-recognized rule of equity jurisprudence, and is in constant application in courts exercising chancery jurisdiction. The master of the rolls states the principle in Fletcher v. Ashburner, 1 Bro. C. C. 497 (1779), a leading case on the subject, as follows (p.499): “Money directed to be employed in the purchase of land and land directed to be sold and turned into money are to be considered as that species of property into which they are directed to be converted.” The rule is operative whether the direction is contained in a will or other instrument of writing. Its sole purpose, however, as declared in text-books and the adjudicated cases, is to effectuate the intention of the testator or parties to the instrument. The crucial test in the application of the doctrine always is, whether it is absolutely necessary to carry out the purpose and object of the testator or settlor. If its interposition is a necessity, then it may be invoked with all its legal consequences. Before the rule can operate, however, in the case of a will, the purpose of the testator must be ascertained. Until this is done there is no room for the application of the doctrine. The intent of the testator being ascertained, then so far, and only so far, as there is a necessity to carry that into effect will there be conversion, though an actual sale of the land has taken place. The doctrine is not an inexorable rule of law to control the inheritance of estates, or to defeat the intestate laws of the state which direct the disposition of the estates of the dead. It is not an inheritance law, nor is it a rule, enforcible at law or in equity, by which a court can divert the transmission of real property from the inheritable channel provided by the laws of the commonwealth. It is simply a fiction, a creation of equity, to carry into effect the purpose in the disposition of his real estate which a testator .has expressed in his will, and which, without its application, would be defeated. These principles are well settled and are recognized by the courts in the application of the doctrine.</p>

The sole purpose of the doctrine, in the case of a will, being to effectuate the intention of the testator, it cannot be invoked when his intention fails or is incapable of accomplishment. The reason of the rule then ceases, and the rule itself no longer obtains. This principle is as well settled, on reason and authority, as the doctrine of equitable conversion itself. It is the logical consequence of the doctrine which cannot be applied-unless there is an existing purpose of the testator to be carried into effect. The testator’s intention in regard to the disposition of his property, as declared in his will, having failed, an alternative, undisclosed intention cannot take its place, and the doctrine of equitable conversion be invoked to carry it into effect. The court is not at liberty to surmise what the intention of the testator would have been, and what disposition he would have made of his property if he had anticipated the failure of the disposition which he makes in his will. He is dead, and no one can speak for him and declare an alternative intent in the disposition of his property. Any <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>other purpose than that named in the will is necessarily unknown, and the doctrine of equitable conversion cannot be applied to carry out his unknown intention. lienee the necessity for enforcing the rule, stated bjr Mr. Scott, afterwards Lord Eldon, in his argument in the leading English case of Ackroyd v.

It was held that the surviving child of the daughter, subject to the life interests of the widow and father, took the lapsed share as heir, and the residue as sole devisee. In the opinion of the court below in that case, which we adopted, it is said (p. 361): <em>“ </em>But the intention to effect a sale was auxiliary to another and paramount intention- — -to effect a convenient transmission of testator’s property to the devisees. The one intent affected the means, and the other the end, and if, for any reason, the means were useless towards attaining the end, the lesser intent should be discarded. The purpose of a sale, and therefore of a conversion, was that the estate might be divided; if there was no necessity for a division the purpose fell and the estate remained unconverted.”</p>

The leading case is Ackroyd v. Smithson, 1 Bro. C. C. 503, 1 Wh. <em>&amp; </em>T. Lead Cas. in Equity, 1171. The elaborate argument of Mr. Scott, afterwards Lord Eldon, convinced Lord Chancellor Thurlow and firmly settled the doctrine in that jurisdiction, that where a testator directs his real estate to-be sold and the proceeds to be applied to a special purpose, which wholly or partially fails, the undisposed of beneficial interest will go to his heir at law and not to his next of kin, although the land may have been actually converted into money. In Ripley v. Waterworth, 7 Ves. Jr. 425 (1852), the court says (p. 435): “ There is an obvious difference from all the cases, which establish this general principle, that where a person dealing with his own property only has directed a conversion for a particular special purpose, or out and out, but the produce to be applied to a particular purpose, when the purpose fails, the intention fails; and this court regards him as not <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>having directed the conversion.” In stating the principle announced in the adjudicated cases in his opinion in Hill v. Cock, 1 Vesey &amp; Beam, 173 (1830), Lord Eldon said (p. 175): “Where a testator means with regard to a particular purpose, to convert his real estate into personal, if that purpose cannot be served, the court will not infer an intention to convert the estate for any other purpose, not expressed.” In Taylor v. Taylor, 3 De G. &amp; M. <em>&amp; </em>G. 190 (1853), it was held that where one of the beneficiaries died in the lifetime of the testator his share of the proceeds of sale was to be decreed real estate and went to the heir at law. Lord Cranworth, delivering the opinion, said (p. 195): “ The rule is established by the cases of Digby v. Legard, 3 P. Wms. 22, n., and Ackroyd v. Smithson, that if a testator disposes of his property, realty and personalty, as a mixed fund, and as to part of it his will cannot take effect, the heir at law will take so much as was the produce of real estate, upon the principle that the heir at law cannot be disinherited without express words.” And in 1864 it was determined by the House of Lords in Bective v. Hodgson, 10 H. L. C. 656, that in the application of the principle ruled in Ackroyd v. Smithson it is immaterial whether the conversion directed by the will has or has not actually taken place; that so far as the beneficial purpose fails the real estate or the money, as the case may be, retains its original character for the purpose of ascertaining the ownership of it.</p>

It is conceded, as held in Ackroyd v. Smithson, 1 Bro. C. C. 503, and Taylor v. Taylor, 3 De. G. M. <em>&amp; </em>G. 190, that where real estate is directed to be sold and the proceeds to be paid to certain individuals, and one of the beneficiaries dies in the lifetime of the testator, that as to his share a conversion does not take place, and it goes to ‘the heir at law. We are unable to distinguish between such a case, and where the purpose fails subsequent to the death of the testator and prior to the time when tbe actual conversion can take place. The reason of the rule would clearly extend it to the one case as well as to the other. If the conversion fail, because the purpose of the testator fails and hence cannot be carried out, it logically follows, we think, that there is, no- conversion if the purpose of the testator fail prior to the time when the actual conversion of the property can take place. The doctrine is a fiction to aid the testator in the accomplishment of his purpose, and when the purpose ceases for any cause and at any time, it necessarily follows that the fiction becomes inoperative and cannot be invoked to accomplish something which cannot be done.</p>

Whether the present case falls within the qualification is the determining question here. A conversion directed by a testator is a conversion only for the purposes of the will; when the purpose is limited and special the conversion takes place only so far as it may be consistent with and is related to the purpose indicated. It is universally allowed that when the purpose or object of the conversion fails, the estate remains unconverted to the extent of such failure. But what is meant by failure of purpose or failure of object? Both by text-writers and in the adjudicated cases these terms are used interchangeably, and each may be regarded as the other’s equivalent. We ean perhaps turn to no authoritative definition of either, yet an examination of the cases will show a fixed and definite meaning which has never been departed from. This much maybe safely affirmed, that in every adjudication where failure of purpose or object has been allowed to defeat a positive direction to sell, failure was held to mean failure in the gift itself by lapse or other certain avoidance, the payment of which was the object and purpose of the direction. In no case has the qualification been applied where the gift had become effective by the vesting in the donee. In the leading and initial case of Ackroyd v. Smithson, 1 Bro. C. C. 503, the disposition of money to arise from the sale of the real estate was originally completed, but lapse by the death of two of the residuary legatees in the lifetime of the testator caused the failure of the disposition as to their two shares, which, although actually converted into money, resulted to the heir at law as undisposed real estate. This case established the rule, since invariably followed, in cases <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>of lapsed gifts. It was in turn followed by cases where the qualification was applied to defeat the general rule, on the ground that the gift was illegal and therefore failed, as where the gift offended against the rule relating to perpetuities. It Avas applied also where the gift failed because it Avas made to depend on a contingency that never happened; and to cases where the direction was to sell for the purpose of paying debts Avhich the testator subsequent to the making of his will had himself paid. These cases define the limits of the qualification as fixed by English authorities, and nothing can be found in our oavii cases that gives countenance to any wider application. While the qualifying doctrine has frequently been recognized in our cases, it has rarely happened in Pennsylvania that the qualification has been applied to defeat or avoid a positive direction to sell. Luffberry’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/125/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="125 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="563942" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0513-01">125 Pa. 513</a>, is an instance Avhere it Avas applied, on the ground that a charitable gift for the payment of Avhich the property directed to be sold Avas void, because the testator did not survive the statutory period required in such case.

This latter case is supposed to make for appellants’ contention; but an examination Avill show that it is in no respect a divergence from the rule as we have stated it to be. In that case, following the direction to sell upon the death of the widow, Avas a gift of the proceeds of the sale to testator’s two children, Sarah. K. and George W., “ if they be living, or the issue of such of them as may be deceased.” George W. died in the lifetime of the testator; Sarah survived the testator, but died during the life tenancy, leaving a husband and two children. The husband, as life tenant of the undivided fourth in the realty, petitioned for an order of sale, and a division of the proceeds agreeably to the provisions of the Avill. The petition was denied because the admitted purpose of the direction to sell Avas to effect a convenient division and transmission of testator’s property, and inasmuch as the share of George W. had lapsed, he having died in the testator’s lifetime, with the result that the entire estate passed to Sarah 3L there was an entire failure of purpose, and the conversion Avas therefore avoided. The lapsing of the gift to George W. Avas the determining factor, as is fully indicated in the opinion of the court beloAV, upon Avhich the decree dismissing the petition was <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>affirmed. Referring to the fact that the retention of the quality of the estate which the testator intended to transmute into another different quality, may work a radical change in the interests of his beneficiaries, the learned judge says: <em>“ </em>But that consideration can have no weight when we reflect that what has happened was outside of his contemplation altogether. He supposed that more than one person should share the residue. How can we, with any show of propriety, speculate upon what, if he had foreseen the actual event, he would or would not have done either by way of preferring the heir on the one hand or the next of kin on the other ? The share which is in controversy lapsed by operation of law. Its disposition cannot be referred to an intention of the testator, because he had no intention with regard to it.” The case of Yerkes v. Yerkes, <a href="/pa/200/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="200 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="924326" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0419-01">200 Pa. 419</a>, also relied upon by the appellants, ife not in point. The ground upon which the decision there rests is, that the direction to sell was not imperative and peremptory, and consequently did not work a conversion. "Whatever other cases there are in Pennsylvania, where a direction to sell has been avoided because of failure of purpose, it may confidently be affirmed, that upon examination each will be found to rest upon the insufficiency of the will to make effective some particular disposition of all or part of testator’s estate. In the present case there was no failure of the gift, and therefore no failure of purpose, notwithstanding the fact that before actual conversion of the land others had succeeded to the rights of the beneficiaries named in the will. Immediately upon the death of the testator the gift which was the proceeds of the sale, vested in the two daughters. It comes to nothing that they never had actual enjoyment of it; it vested in them, and was theirs to do with as they pleased. As was said of a similar bequest in Morrow v. Brenizer, <a href="/rawle/2/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="2 Rawle 185" data-case-ids="1820587" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0185-01">2 Rawle, 185</a>, it vested as money, not by the magic of a fiction, and contrary to the dictates of common sense, but by the express provisions in the will which impressed upon it that particular character. Here, as there, it requires a fiction to make it anything else. It is a mere assumption to say that the testator’s purpose contemplated nothing but equality of division between his two daughters. Had they or either of them died leaving issue, it would hardly be pretended that the testator’s provision did not have <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>regard to division among such issue. Neither gift nor the incident of sale was made dependent upon their having issue. Admitting that the purpose of the direction was for distribution of the proceeds of sale, there is nothing in the will that gives support to the theory that no distribution was intended except in the event of the two daughters .surviving the period of sale.</p>

The plain logic of it is, that notwithstanding a testator has directed in unequivocal and unconditional terms that his real estate be sold, that this direction is to be wholly disregarded if by reason of the happening of certain events after testator’s death a sale is unnecessary to effectuate a purpose, not expressed in the will, but one which to the judicial mind seems to have been the purpose the testator had in view in directing the sale.</p>
