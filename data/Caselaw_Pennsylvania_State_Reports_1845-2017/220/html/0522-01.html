Clause (k): <em>“ </em>The trust hereby created shall cease immediately upon the sale by the trustees of my shares of the capital stock of the J. E.

    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[169,1354,1178,661]]]'>It will be observed that under clause (k) there are three ways in which the trust may be terminated. But each of those ways contemplates its termination not later than the death of the survivor of the testator’s two children, and hence earlier than the date fixed in the succeeding clause. Whether it should be terminated in the manner provided in clause (k) was, by clause (1) left to the unanimous judgment of the trustees. If in their judgment it was unwise for any reason to terminate the trust and divide the estate as provided in clause (k), they were authorized to continue the trust as provided in clause (1). It is, therefore, apparent that, under neither clause, could the limitation upon the life of the trust be extended beyond the restriction provided in clause (1).</p>

The controlling language is : “ This trust shall continue during the life of the survivor of my grandchildren, who may be living at the time of my death, or until such time, although one or more of said grandchildren be living, as the said trustees shall unanimously agree that it will be wise and safe to terminate said trust.” As contended in appellant’s brief, <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>this enlarges the duration of the trust declared in clause (k). If, therefore, in the judgment of the trustees it is unwise to divide the estate at the death of the testator’s surviving child as provided in clause (k), the trust shall continue during the life of the survivor of his grandchildren who may be living at the testator’s death. The death of the surviving grandchild who was living at his grandfather’s death fixes the utmost limit of the trust, and under this clause of the will it must terminate upon the happening of the event. But the trust may be sooner terminated under the alternative provision of the clause. It is to continue during the life of a surviving grandchild, “ or until such time, although one or more of said grandchildren be living,” as the trustees may unanimously determine it is wise and safe to terminate it. The trustees, therefore, are not obliged to await the death of the surviving grandchild to terminate the trust and vest the estate. They may end it while any or all of the grandchildren who were living at the testator’s death are still living. The “ said grandchildren” named in the alternative provision of this clause of the will refer to the grandchildren mentioned in the previous clause who are those living at the death of the testator. In no contingency, therefore, can the trust be extended beyond the life of a surviving grandchild who was living at his grandfather’s death. Hence it must be terminated within a life in being at the death of the creator of the trust. At that time, the remainder of the estate will vest in those entitled to it under the will. This trust, therefore, does not offend the rule against perpetuities or the statute that prevents accumulations beyond the life or lives in being and twenty-one years thereafter.</p>

It is simply a declaration by the testator of his purpose in making the “ previous dispositions ” of his property. His principal object was, as he states, to preserve his interest in the Dayton Company for his children and descendants. It is true, he says, that his object is to continue the trust “ as long as possible,” but that does not avoid or change the prior clauses of the will wherein he creates and limits the trust, but is merely an expression of his <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>desire that the property be continued in his descendants as long as it can legally be done.</p>
