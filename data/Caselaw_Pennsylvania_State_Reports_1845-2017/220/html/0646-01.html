    <p id="b679-8" data-blocks='[["BL_679.9",679,[179,702,1177,1581]]]'>On March 27, 1905, the plaintiffs filed their bill in this court, setting forth that on July 11,1902, Eugene F. White and Robert S. Maison, M. D., had entered into a contract with the city of Chester. This contract stipulated for the construction of a smallpox hospital within the city, or within three miles therefrom, for the reception and treatment of persons afflicted with smallpox in said city under the rules and regulations of the board of health, and upon certain compensation therein prescribed. This agreement provided for a term of two years. The hospital was erected by White and Maison, and the term of the contract had expired, and the necessity for its continuance had ceased. The hospital buildings were about to be removed by White and Maison from their present location to some other locality in the city of Chester, and that the effect thereof would be to endanger public health. The prayer in this bill was for an injunction to prevent the removal of the said buildings and their contents along any of the public highways of the city. The locality where the buildings were erected is within the corporate limits of the city of Chester. After this bill was filed, to wit: on March 31, 1905, an injunction preventing the removal of the said buildings along said public highways was issued. On May 18, 1905, the defendants filed an answer substantially setting forth that the buildings had been erected upon ground which they had leased for the purpose. The lease had expired. The buildings and contents had cost them about $12,000. They could not be removed from the demised property except over a public highway or highways of the city. They could be removed without endangering public health, and that if they were enjoined from removing them such prohibition would amount to a confiscation of their property.</p>

This is not an appeal from the decree itself — if it were, it comes too late to avail — but an appeal from the order of the court below refusing to vacate and strike off the decree. Admitting the right of the appellants to be heard as interveners, since it was allowed by the court below, such right allows them to do only that which the original party in whose shoes they stand might do ; they are subject to the same limitations and restrictions. Can it be pretended that the city of Chester, having received the benefit of so much of the decree as required the destruction of the defendant’s property, could now come in and attack the validity of the decree, in order to escape the liability imposed on it by the decree, to make compensation for the property destroyed at its instance? If it would be inequitable to allow such demand on the part of the city, it would be none the less so to allow it at the instance of these intervening taxpayers. The decree was moulded to express what at the time was supposed to be the agreement of the parties. The effort in the court below on part of the appellants, was to show that the city authorities had not expressed their assent to the entering of the decree by municipal ordinance, and that therefore the decree, in so far as it charged liability upon the city, and embraced other things than the relief prayed for in the original bill, was invalid and should be vacated. The time to set up such defense was before anything was done under the decree to the advantage of one side or the prejudice of the other. The decree directed defendant’s property to be destroyed for sanitary considerations within thirty days. On the last day of this period the property was destroyed in obedience to the decree. The appellants did not seek to intervene until afterwards. In refusing to vacate the decree the learned judge said: “ It would be manifestly an illegal, unjust and inequitable exercise of judicial authority to decide that the decree of March 26, 1907, should be revoked after the defendants have incurred the loss of their property, and thus deprive them of the advantage of the other parts of the decree.” In this expression of view we fully concur.</p>
