      <em>a. </em>For the first quarter of the year 1907 the plaintiff’s receipts from passenger traffic between points within this state (i. e., exclusive of interstate traffic) were $3,070,935.55.</p>
    <p id="b133-7" data-blocks='[["BL_133.13",133,[183,1261,1173,302]]]'>
      <em>b. </em>Of these receipts the sum of $1,084,982.37 came from the sale of excursion tickets at the average price of 2.406 cents per mile. The sum of $595,997.31 came from the sale of excursion tickets at the average price of 2.109 cents per mile; $399,254.60 from commutation tickets at 1.46 cents per mile, and $990,701.27 from mileage tickets at two cents per mile.</p>

      <em>c. </em>As nearly as can be ascertained through a careful application of a rule of apportionment approved by railroad experts and in actual use by most of the large railroads of the country, the approximate cost to the plaintiff of handling its intrastate passenger business during the first three months of the present year was $2,921,607.91.</p>
    <p id="b133-9" data-blocks='[["BL_133.15",133,[187,1877,1170,560]]]'>
      <em>d. </em>In the year 1906 the proportion borne by the receipts from intrastate passenger traffic for the first quarter to the total of such receipts for the whole year was 20.8 per cent. The proportion of the expenses connected with that branch of the plaintiff’s business for the first quarter of the year to the year’s total expenditure was 24.7 per cent. These proportions are practically (in each case) the same as the average for the previous ten years. Hence they may be fairly taken as the basis of a calculation of the probable receipts, expenditures and profits of the plaintiff on its intrastate passenger business for the year 1907 at the rates at present established.</p>

      <em>e. </em>Calculated upon this basis, the receipts on this class of business for 1907 will probably be $14,764,113.22, and the operating expenses will probably be $11,828,372.11. The amount of taxes apportionable to the plaintiff’s intrastate passenger business under the usual and reasonable rule will probably be $380,350.86. The deduction of this sum from the amount of the difference between probable receipts from this business for 1907 and its probably cost as ascertained above leaves as the probable surplus of receipts over all expenditures the sum of $2,555,390.25 net.</p>

      <em>f. </em>Since most of the facilities employed by the plaintiff in handling its freight business are used in carrying on its passenger traffic, and as the same tracks, stations, etc., are employed for the handling of the intrastate passenger traffic that are used in its intrastate passenger business, the amount of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company’s investment in the business last mentioned can be approximated only by apportionment. Under a rule of apportionment reasonable in itself and in general use for such purposes, the plaintiff’s books show an investment in property required to conduct this branch of its business amounting to $53,600,598.74, of which $21,051,795.96 represents mortgage or otherwise funded indebtedness, giving rise to a yearly interest charge of $894,701.33. The sum of $32,548,802.78, therefore, approximately represents the amount of money contributed by the plaintiff’s stockholders, plus the amount set aside from surplus earnings in past years, actually invested in the intrastate passenger business. It is to be noted that the par value of the shares and bonds of this corporation includes nothing but the sum which it actually received of them in cash.</p>

      <em>g. </em>Upon the actual investment of $32,548,802.78 of its own money, the plaintiff’s probable earnings for 1907 from the intrastate passenger business, viz.: $2,555,780.82 less the year’s probable taxes, would yield a return of 5.1 per cent, on the basis of the rates charged at present.</p>

      <em>h. </em>The business of carrying suburban passengers is remunerative to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, even at the low rate at which commutation tickets are sold them, because the cost of such business in proportion to the number of passengers carried is much less than the cost of the ordinary passen<a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>ger traffic, and because the carrying of commuters produces incidentally much business at higher rates of fare. It is improbable that the doing away with commutation tickets and the exaction of a two cents per mile fare from those who have been using such tickets, would serve to increase the net profits of the plaintiff, since, in all likelihood, such a change would so reduce the number of suburban riders and the amount of higher rate business that such passengers incidentally bring to the company as to practically offset the increase of receipts due to the increase of fare.</p>

      <em>i. </em>The bases of several of the calculations above referred to are deduced from ,the experience of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company during the past few years. During that time the amount of business done has been very great. Should it fall off, as is not an unlikely occurrence, the expense of operating the plaintiff’s railroad would not decrease in the same ratio in which-its receipts would diminish. Moreover, the cost of operating the road shows a marked tendency to increase through the general increase of wages and the price of materials.</p>

      <em>j. </em>Assuming that no change is made in the price of commutation tickets and that all other fares in excess of two cents per mile are reduced to that rate, the profits of the plaintiff for 1907 upon its intrastate passenger business, calculated upon the same bases that are employed in the calculations above, would probably be reduced to $1,527,406.25, which after payment of interest charges would be a return of but 1.94 per cent upon the company’s investment of $32,548,802.78.</p>

To this there is advanced on behalf of the defendant the particular objection that no evidence has been presented to show the results of the plaintiff’s freight business; that its intrastate passenger business is so combined with its intrastate freight business as to be indistinguishable in their joint result; that greater profits on the one kind of traffic may make up for the lowering of profits on the other, and that, therefore, before it can be said that the act under consideration regulates the plaintiff’s business unreasonably, the whole of that business must be considered, freight <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>traffic with passenger traffic. This objection we think is overcome by the following considerations :</p>
    <p id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[307,463,1174,798]]]'>1. Men who understand the railroad business thorough^ and on whose opinion in relation to the subject we may with confidence rely, declare that intrastate passenger traffic may readily be distinguished from the rest of the plaintiff’s business by the application of certain rules developed by experience and-approved by general use; second, the legislature itself, in the very act now under discussion has, for purposes of regulation, attempted to segregate the passenger traffic of the railways and to deal with it as if it existed as a thing apart from all else; third, if pushed to its logical result the argument advanced would justify a law requiring that the railroad companies of the state should -carry all intrastate passengers without charge and look to their freight business for reimbursement of expenses, and for a return on their investment in the business, which, of course, is the reductio ad absurdum.</p>
    <p id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[301,1280,1178,1115]],["BL_137.1",137,[193,382,1177,600]]]'>It is further and more generally objected by the defendant that the plaintiff invites the court in this case to leave the domain of fact, where it has to guide it, the testimony of witnesses who have seen the things that they describe and to enter the realm of speculation where all evidence is mere guesswork, and where probability is the nearest approach to reality and truth that can be found. This objection seems at first sight-more formidable than it really is. Antithesis always arrests attention. In an inquiry, however, as to conditions resulting from the operation of a regulation not yet in force, nothing but probabilities can be expected. Such a situation is not one with which the law is unfamiliar. It has never required mathematical proof of the facts with which it deals. Most verdicts rest on the likelihood (not the certainty by any means) that witnesses will tell the truth under oath. Nevertheless, judgments are entered solemnly on such verdicts. And this is in accordance with the common practice of mankind in the affairs of daily life. No plan for future conduct was ever formed that was not based upon the probability as to what circumstances would develop at the time for its performance. There is nothing more uncertain than human life, but the study of the probabilities of its duration has made <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>the insurance of lives a safe and profitable business. It may well be doubted that the business of life insurance has received more careful attention than has been applied by intelligent students to the traffic of the country’s railways. To such experts what seems to others mere chance and guesswork becomes reliable forecast. In our opinion, the approximations and probabilities worked out upon a broad foundation of established facts by men of experience and sound judgment, testifying under oath, may properly be considered a safe ground on which to base judicial action. Having such testimony before us we feel justified in accepting and acting upon the probabilities which it establishes.</p>

    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[191,1051,1178,351]]]'>1. Under the rule laid down by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Brymer v.

    <p id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[188,1410,1180,598]]]'>2. Since the reduction to the rate of two cents per mile fixed by the act of April 5, 1907, of all fares now established on a higher basis, would probably have the effect of reducing the profits of the plaintiff from its intrastate passenger business to a sum equivalent to less than two per cent on its investment in the facilities necessary for carrying that business on ; and since a return so small is not fair remuneration for the use and risk of its property, Brymer v. Butler Water Co., <a href="/pa/179/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="179 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="886975" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0231-01">179 Pa. 231</a>, the regulation attempted by the legislature in that act must, so far as it relates to the plaintiff and for so long as the present conditions continue, be adjudged to be unreasonable.</p>

This question must be answered in the negative. It is, of course, not to be disputed that when, under its constitutional power to regulate commerce among the states, congress has undertaken the regulation of interstate <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>railroad rates, the legislature of Pennsylvania has no authority to meddle with that matter.

Interpretatio fienda est ut res magis valeat.quam pereat. A statute is to be construed in connection with a constitutional provision in pari materia. The act with which we are concerned is, therefore, to be regarded as intended to apply only to that part of the passenger business of the railroads over which the legislative power of regulation extends, and since that business is not so confused with interstate passenger traffic as to be insusceptible of separate regulation, we hold that the act is not invalid for the reason last suggested.</p>

    <p id="b138-5" data-blocks='[["BL_138.5",138,[277,1393,1173,343]]]'>1. As a regulation by the legislature of the rates of fare for passengers on the lines constructed by the plaintiff under the act of April 13, 1846, between Harrisburg and Pittsburg and between Pittsburg and Erie, the act violates an existing contract between the plaintiff and the commonwealth, and so contravenes article I, sec. 10, of the constitution of the United States.</p>

No business man in 1816, even if now, went into a new and extensive venture of uncertain outcome without the hope of more than common interest. Because his judgment or foresight was good is no reason that he should be shorn of his profits in the result. What is a fair profit is a complicated and difficult question, but there are certain elements that are plainly to be regarded to avoid injustice, such as the original investment, the risks assumed at that time, the returns as compared with other enterprises as nearly similar as may be, the cost of maintenance and improvement, the prospects of increase and the present value in view of the preceding elements. Injustice is done by anything that fails to consider these, and to deal equitably with the private as well as the public interests involved. It is not necessarily regulated by what others would now make the venture for, under the present circumstances and with present knowledge. The public having long reaped the incidental profits from the development of the country by the enterprise and venture of capital, in the increased value of land, the opening of new and wider markets for crops and manufactures and the facility of intercourse and exchange for persons and property, the courts should not now ignore this aspect of the subject in considering the question of injustice to the corporators.

The intelligent business of the world is done in that way. Every merchant and manufacturer examines and ascertains the unprofitable branches of his business with a view to reducing or cutting them off entirely, and there is no reason why a railroad or other corporation should not be permitted to do the same thing as long as its substantial corporate duties under its franchise are performed. While the public has certain rights which in case of conflict must prevail, yet it must not be forgotten that even so-called public service corporations are private property organized and conducted for private corporate profit. And unless necessary for the fulfillment of their corporate duties they should not be required to do any part of their business in an unbusinesslike way with a resulting loss. If part is unprofitable it is neither good business nor justice to make it more so because the loss can be offset by profit on the rest. To concede that principle would, as the court below indicated, permit the legislature to compel the carriage of passengers practically for nothing though the inexorable result would be that freight must pay inequitable rates that passenger travel may be cheap. The corporation is entitled to make a fair profit on every branch of- its business subject to the limitation that its corporate duties must be performed even though at a loss. What is a fair profit is, as already said, a highly complicated and difficult question.

With deference to the majority, I regard these reasons as wholly inadequate to justify such action, and especially so in view of the fact that there are now pending in the courts of common pleas of the state and awaiting the decision in this case other cases brought against other railroad companies <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>with similar charters to restrain the enforcement of the act of 1907. The question is raised at the very threshold of the appeal by the third assignment of error wherein the appellant alleges that the trial court erred in holding that “ by its act of incorporation, April 13, 1846 (P. L. 312), the Pennsylvania Railroad Company received from the commonwealth the right to demand from its passengers such tolls or fares within certain maxima therein specified, as to its president and directors shall seem reasonable, with immunity from interference by any public authority with the rates that it may thus establish.” Roth parties, as the record discloses, regard the question as the most important in the cause and have discussed it at length. It is obvious that if such immunity exists under the charter, the question of reasonableness of the rate fixed by the act of 1907 does not arise and need not be decided. The very first important question, therefore, which confronts this court upon the record is whether the charter act of 1846 gives the plaintiff company immunity from rate legislation or supervision by the state, and I submit that the parties are entitled to an answer by this court, and that the reasons assigned for declining to decide it are entirely insufficient. It is of the utmost importance, both to the people of the common wealth and the plaintiff company, that the question be settled finally by this court and, having been raised by the pleadings and decided by the trial court, it should now be finally adjudicated by this court. The suggestion that counsel did not discuss a part of the charter is no ground for the court not determining the plaintiff’s rights under its charter. The oversight of the defendant’s counsel in this respect cannot defeat the right of the plaintiff or the defendant to have a decision of the vital question in the case. If, however, by reason of this fact, the majority of the court are not prepared to dispose of the question, then the proper course, and the one universally followed, is to order a reargument and direct the counsel to discuss the question. This is the well-established practice in this court, and uniformly adopted in such cases.</p>

It will be observed that there is no clear and explicit language in this.provision that shows an intention on the part of the state to deny itself the right to exercise its power of supervision over the rates established by the company. The discretionary power lodged with the president and directors is to establish reasonable rates within the maximum limit, and the plain inference is, in the absence of language declaring the contrary, that the state retains its inherent supervisory power to protect the public against arbitrary and unreasonable rates. We are not dealing with private parties to a contract, but with parties, one of which possesses sovereignty with the right to exercise it over quasi public corporations, unless that party clearly and explicitly disables itself from so doing by its contract. The presumption, as we have seen, is against the abdication of such power and in favor of its retention by the state. To delegate it to a corporation or to refuse to exercise it would be simply an abdication of sovereignty; and that is never presumed : Railroad Co. v. Hecht, <a href="/us/95/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="95 U.S. 168" data-case-ids="3382995" data-case-paths="/us/95/0168-01">95 U. S. 168</a>.

S. 307</a>, 325. The promotion of the public welfare is the purpose of government, and to accomplish the purpose the sovereignty of the state remains with the state itself. The supervision of transportation rates on a railroad is a question which involves the welfare, comfort and convenience of the public, and if these are to be safeguarded and secured, and unquestionably they should be, the power to do so is one of sovereignty and must be exercised by the commonwealth. A public corporation, like a railroad, being a creature of the commonwealth has rights conferred upon it by which it exercises a part of the power of the state under state supervision, and hence it is, that enjoying those rights, it is subject to the commonwealth to the <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>extent that the state may control and regulate its affairs so far as the welfare of the public may demand. In the exercise of this authority by the commonwealth, the corporation is amply protected by constitutional provisions which will not permit its property or its corporate rights to be destroyed or invaded. Those provisions require that supervisory action must be taken by the state in a way that will do no injustice to the stockholders of the corporation. It is the imperative duty of the courts to see that the constitutional right of protection of property is as rigidly enforced in favor of a corporation as it is in the case of an individual, and a failure in either instance would be a grave dereliction of judicial duty. It is not to be assumed that any court in the commonwealth will neglect or refuse to perform this duty.</p>

I believe the power to supervise rate charges of a quasi public corporation, like a railroad company, is a police power of the state, and that the legislature has no authority to abridge it or to delegate it to a corporation or to any other body. Section 3, article XYI, of the present constitution declares that “ the exercise of the police power of the state shall never be abridged, or so considered as to permit corporations to conduct their business in such manner as to infringe the equal rights of individuals or the general well-being of the state.” This section of the constitution is simply declaratory of the implied power of the state as it existed under all former constitutions of the commonwealth. Such power need not be reserved or declared in the written constitution of an American state, because it exists without such declaration. This principle is recognized both by the state and federal courts. See Com. v. Interstate Consolidated Street Railway Co., <a href="/mass/187/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="187 Mass. 436" data-case-ids="833889" data-case-paths="/mass/187/0436-01">187 Mass. 436</a> ; s. c., <a href="/us/207/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="207 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="3640230" data-case-paths="/us/207/0079-01">207 U.

The legislature of the state, therefore, had clearly the right to supervise or regulate the passenger traffic on the plaintiff company’s road under the police power inherent in the commonwealth. As we shall hereinafter see, the company, by its formal declaration, expressly made itself subject to the police power of the state.</p>

In ascertaining a reasonable rate for the transportation of passengers, the company has no right to segregate the passenger traffic and exclude the other sources of revenue. The railroad is an entity, its being is created by a charter granted by the commonwealth declaring it “ a public highway for the conveyance of passengers and the transportation of freight; ” it acts as a body, its tracks are all owned and used by the corporate entity, and its stockholders receive their dividends from the net proceeds of its entire traffic. Why, then, in ascertaining a reasonable rate for passenger traffic should the revenue from that traffic alone be considered ? The stockholders are the owners of the corporate franchises, as well as of the corporate property generally, and a fair income from the investment is what they are entitled to receive ; hence they have no right to compel the passenger traffic on their road to paj^ a rate of transportation which, when considered with the return from the freight and other traffic, would make an exorbitant or unfair rate to them on their investment. Their investment is in the corporate franchise and property, and the income from that investment necessarily comes from the freight as well as the passenger traffic, and, in determining what is a fair and reasonable return on their investment, it necessarily follows that the receipts or revenues from all sources should be considered. This view is strengthened by the fact that it is impossible to accurately determine what revenue the company receives from each of the several sources. The trackage, the stations, the offices and other property are owned, not by the freight department nor by the passenger department of the road, but by the company itself, and hence, in making a division of the receipts and expenditures, it is wholly impracticable to ascertain accurately and definitely the receipts from either of the several sources of revenue. As the net revenues from all sources go to the stockholders, constituting the return <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>on their investment, and the property from which those revenues are derived is the property of the stockholders, the fair rate or recompense for the investment in that property belongs to the stockholders, and should be counted on the entire traffic.</p>

It is said that a constitution is for the <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>millions, and hence should be construed as they understand it. The acceptance declares that the company <em>“ </em>accept all of its provisions and particularly the provisions of the sixteenth and seventeenth articles thereof.” It is difficult to see how any part of the instrument is without this language; or if the language does not include every part of the constitution, how any acceptance could be drawn which would render a corporation subject to all the constitutional provisions. It is said, however, that section 10 of article XYI only authorizes the general assembly to alter, revoke or annul an existing charter revocable at the adoption of the constitution, or any charters that might thereafter be created, and that the charter of the plaintiff company was not revocable when the present constitution was adopted and hence its acceptance of the constitution gives no authority to the legislature to alter, revoke or annul its charter. But this is a very narrow view indeed of the effect of the plaintiff’s acceptance of the constitution. It would permit it to play fast and loose with the instrument which no court of equity, whose assistance the plaintiff now invokes, should tolerate in any corporation. It says broadly: “¥e accept every provision of the constitution,” but when the state proceeds to act upon its acceptance and enact legislation affecting it, it claims that it is not subject to a part of the instrument authorizing such legislation and asks a court of equity to annul the legislation. It is manifest, I think, that if the present contention of the corporation is correct, the action of the directors in accepting the constitution was taken in bad faith, and with an intention to reap the benefits of subjecting itself to the whole constitution while not rendering itself amenable to legislation affecting it adversely. The manifest intention of section 10 of article XYI is, upon the acceptance of the instrument by a corporation, to make the coi’poration subject to all its provisions in the same manner and to the same extent as though the incorporation had taken p]ace subsequent to the adoption of the constitution. The tenth section must be read in connection with the second section, wherein the legislature is prohibited from altering or amending the charter of an existing corporation or legislating for such corporation save upon the condition that the corporation should thereafter hold its charter subject to all the provisions of the constitution. A rail<a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>road company, existing at the adoption of the constitution, may secure the benefit of future legislation' as pointed out in section ten of article seventeen of the instrument, which provides: “No railroad .... company, in existence at the time of the adoption of this article, shall have the benefit of any future legislation by general or special laws, except on condition of complete acceptance of all the provisions of this article.” Here, as we have seen, if the language of acceptance, filed by the plaintiff company with the state department, is to have its usual and ordinary meaning, the company accepted specifically the provisions of the sixteenth and seventeenth articles and also “ all of its (constitution’s) provisions.” It will therefore be observed that the plaintiff company in order to invoke the protection of the present constitution and secure the benefit of any subsequent legislation was required to declare its complete acceptance of the seventeenth article. It went further, however, and accepted all the provisions of the constitution and specifically the sixteenth article, in section ten of which, the general assembly is authorized to alter, revoke .or annul any charter, then existing, revocable at the adoption of the constitution, or that might thereafter be granted.</p>

The company practically concedes that a two-cent rate is reasonable by selling a mileage book for $20.00 which entitles the passenger to travel on its road 1,000 miles, or at the rate of two cents per mile. It is settled law that the burden of showing the rate named in the act to be unreasonable or confiscatory was upon the company, but the burden was not met. The average of all passenger fares, now collected by the company, is 1.907 cents per mile or .093 cents less than the rate specified in the act of 1907. The commutation rate is 1.046 cents per mile, while one way tickets are sold at 2.406 cents per mile and a round trip ticket 2.109 cents per mile. It is clear, I think, that under the evidence in the case, considering only the revenue from the passenger traffic, that the rate as fixed by the act of 1907 is not unreasonable, much less' confiscatory.</p>

In adopting its estimate, the court took into consideration only the anticipated earnings from passenger travel, without regard to the earnings from any other source. In considering the effect of legislation, the interests of the stockholders of the railroad are beyond question to be fairly protected ; but so long as the earnings of the road from all sources <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>produce a satisfactory return upon the capital invested, the exact proportion which may result from the operation of any particular department would seem to be immaterial. It is not to be expected that railroad companies will earn the same percentage of profit in every department, or upon all classes of business which they may conduct. It may readily happen that the proper discharge of its duty to the public in furnishing an adequate service, may require a railroad to perform some particular service at a low price, or even at a loss; and yet the returns from the business as a whole may be entirely satisfactory.</p>

If the estimate accepted by the court below is correct, as to the probable amount of the reduction in earnings, which will be caused by the new statute, it would not reduce the total amount more than one-third of one per cent, and it would leave a net annual return, based upon last year’s business, of more than eleven per cent per annum upon the entire capitalization. Legislation permitting such a return as this can hardly be termed confiscatory, or even fairly regarded as tending in that direction. In judging the reasonableness of a rate, the interest of the party for whom the service is performed must be recognized, as well as that of the party performing the service.. The proposition that the state may impose a comparatively low rate upon a particular portion of the business of a railroad, provided the company is able to earn a fair profit upon its business as a whole, is supported both by reason and authority. For example, in Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railroad Company v. Minnesota, <a href="/us/186/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="186 U.S. 257" data-case-ids="3623460" data-case-paths="/us/186/0257-01">186 U. S. 257</a>, it was contended that a certain rate of freight prescribed by the state railroad commission, upon coal in car load lots, was unreasonable, because it was alleged, if the same rate were imposed upon all merchandise, the road would not pay its operating expenses. But it was there distinctly pointed out by the supreme court of the United States that it might well be that other existing rates might be sufficient to earn a large profit for the company even though little came from the particular source in question. <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>And the power of the state was sustained to reduce the rate upon a particular article provided the company was able to earn a fair profit upon its entire business.</p>

This was done in the case of passenger rates in Brabham v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co., 11 Interst. Com. Rep. 464 (1905). In the opinion in Artz v. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co., 11 Interst. Com. Rep. 458 (1905), a case of passenger rates, it is said (p.-462): <em>“ </em>The reasonableness of the passenger fare upon a particular part of the defendant’s system must be determined with some reference to the system as a whole.”</p>

Under this rule the entire earnings of the plaintiff company within the state should have been considered in the present case. Had this been done, it would without doubt have appeared that the rate imposed by the act of 1907, will not prevent the company from earning a fair profit upon its entire business.

I avoid the question for the reason that in my opinion it is in nowise involved in the present case. ISTor do I think it necessary to attempt a vindication of the right generally of the legislature to regulate the charges of railroad companies for transportation. Whatever difference of opinion there may be as to the policy of such legislation, there can be none as to the power of the legislature in this regard, when exercised within constitutional limitations. If anything can be regarded as settled by multiplied uniform decisions, both federal and state, this power ought to stand clear of impeachment. I shall assume it. The contention of the plaintiff in the court below, and repeated here, is that the particular enactment, the subject of present inquiry, the act of April 5, 1907, entitled “ An act to regulate the maximum rate and minimum rate to be charged for transportation of passengers by railway companies,” etc., transgresses constitutional limitations so far as it is made to apply to the plaintiff, in that it violates a contract between the state and the corporation, by which the right was granted to the latter to charge, at the discretion of its president and board of directors, as much as three and one-half cents per mile for each passenger carried ; and again, in that the rate fixed by the act for such transportation would be unremunerative to the company, with the result that to compel its observance would in effect be a taking of the company’s property without making just compensation. These are the questions, and the only questions, involved in the case. I shall consider them briefly.</p>

But I am of opinion that no such contract has been shown in this case. The act of April 13, 1846, which it is insisted is the plaintiff company’s charter, is but a part of <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>that charter. Before the conditions on which the right of the parties named in the act to become incorporate depended could have been complied with, indeed, on the very same day the act was approved, a supplement thereto was likewise approved. Upon the argument of the case this supplementary act was called to the attention of counsel, but for some unexplained reason it was passed over as of no importance in the inquiry. The fact that counsel chose to ignore it does not relieve us from the duty of considering it, except as we concur in the finding by the court below to the effect that the prescribed rate is less than compensatory. Holding to the view that such finding is without warrant, there can be no proper determination of the case except as it is considered. Its consideration is thus forced upon us. I cannot but regard the supplement as essential a part of the charter as the original act. When it was passed the corporation had no existence; the original act did not create it, but merely indicated a mode or manner by which it might thereafter be created. When subsequently letters patent were issued creating the corporation, the acceptance of these letters was the voluntary subjection by the corporation of itself to the provisions of both acts. The corporation had no right of election as between them ; both together constituted the law of its organization. It was under no contract obligation to accept the letters patent, was at perfect liberty to refuse them, but, having accepted them, it must be held to have accepted them with full knowledge of and acquiescence in whatever restrictive legislation then existed. By this supplement the right of amendment and alteration is reserved in unmistakable language. It provides : <em>“ </em>That nothing in the act to which this is a supplement can be so construed as in anywise to impair the right of the legislature to pass such additional laws as may be deemed expedient in furtherance of the objects contemplated by said act, and for the better enforcement of the provisions thereof.” How can it be asserted in the face of this distinct and unqualified reservation of power that the act of April 5, 1907, violates the terms of the contract between the state and the corporation ? As I have already pointed out, when the supplement became a law the corporation did not exist. If it be said that the contract was with the parties named in the act for the benefit of the corporation <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>thereafter to succeed, the answer to that is, that before their assent or acceptance could have been expressed in anyway, before they did anything under the act, or paid a dollar on the faith of it, the supplement was in force. Not only so, but a reading of the act makes it very clear that the act committed the state to nothing except as the preliminary conditions prescribed were complied with. Until these conditions were met no contract relation could arise ; until then the act was nothing more than an offer to incorporate on certain conditions which the parties named could accept or reject as they pleased. Certainly, in a dispute between individuals no contract could be inferred except as mutual agreement was shown ; a proposition made by one to another is wholly within the control of the one making it, for withdrawal or amendment, until the moment of its acceptance by the other. Why should not the same rule apply where the effort is to hold the state bound by a contract ? The construction I contend for does no injustice either to the corporation or the parties named in the act. The latter entered upon the woi’k of securing subscriptions of stock as required, knowing that the supplement had passed; and every individual subscriber is held to knowledge of the same fact.</p>

The power reserved is the power to pass such additional laws as may be deemed expedient in furtherance of the objects contemplated by the act.. Can there be any question as to what these objects were? It will not be contended that the object of the act was to confer benefit or advantage on the corporation. That it would derive' profit was contemplated of course; but this was an inducement, not to the passage of the act, but to enlist the corporation in the work of accomplishing the objects the legislature had in view. These objects were purely of a public character, the building of a great highway across the state for the advancement of the interests of the state in manifold ways, not the least of these being the rapid and convenient transportation of persons and goods at reasonable cost. To secure these ends to the general public for all time, the legislature reserved to .itself the power to pass such additional laws as might there<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>after be required. The act of April 5, 1907, is a legislative conclusion, which' we have no right to disturb, that in order to secure to the public transportation at reasonable cost, an additional law was required. The act itself is clearly within the scope of the reservation. This course of argument may not be as convincing to others as to myself; but if it be enough to raise a doubt as to the correctness of the plaintiff’s contention, the doubt is to be resolved in favor of the state, not against it. This rule will not be questioned.</p>

In an issue such as this, the burden of proving that the maximum rate fixed by the act would not yield what the law regards as just compensation for the service rendered, rests upon the plaintiff; and this burden is not discharged except as the evidence adduced to prove the fact alleged is strong enough to support a judicial determination in favor of the plaintiff, not on the overcoming of an adverse presumption, nor yet on a preponderance of proof, but on the ground that the facts alleged have been established beyond reasonable doubt. I do not state it too strongly, for upon this one'fact rests this contention. If the fact be as averred by the plaintiff, the unconstitutionality of the act follows necessarily ; and, therefore, it is that the proof required to establish the fact must measure up to-this high standard before it can. avail. Speaking of the power and duty of the court to declare a law void when it violates the constitution, Tilghmak, O. J., in Bank v. Smith, 3 S. &amp; R. 63, says, “It is a point on which I am well satisfied; but at the same time it is certain that it is a power of high responsibility, and not to be exercised but in cases <em>free from doubt.”</em>

I would not have burdened this opinion even to the extent of the above citations, but to put in stronger light the impotence and insufficiency of the finding of fact by the court below to sustain the plaintiff’s contention. Written across the very face of the court’s finding is an admission that it is based, not on facts ascertained, but upon a mere probability. I quote the finding : “ 2. Since the reduction to the rate of two cents per mile fixed by the act of April 5, 1907, of all fares now established on a higher basis would probably have the effect of reducing the profits of the plaintiff from the interstate passenger business to a sum equivalent to less than two per cent on its investment in the facilities necessary for carrying that business on; and since a return so small is not fair remuneration for the use and risk of its property: Brymer v.

How indifferent this ruling is to the <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>rights of a co-ordinate branch of government, contrasted with the jealous regard for such rights shown in the cases I have cited, and what a departure it is from those settled principles governing judicial determination in questions of this character universally recognized, need not be here remarked upon, except to say, that receiving the sanction of this court the case will establish a precedent fraught with extreme danger. Others may see their way clear to sustain this finding by the court and the nullifying decree based thereon, but for myself I cannot. An examination of the evidence in the case will show that it but feebly supports the finding even as to the probability. To me it is not convincing in any degree, for the reason that the calculation by which it is sought to establish the probability is based, not on ascertained facts, but upon arbitrary assumptions and apportionments, the fairness and accuracy of which cannot in the nature of things be established with any degree of certainty. A common capital has supplied common facilities for the transportation of passengers and freight. How can it be determined, with any degree of exactness, how much of that capital is invested for the carriage of passengers and how much for the carriage of freight ? Both are carried on the same roadbed, over the same bridges, the same rails, and in many cases are discharged at the same stations. How can there be any apportionment of expenses, for service, insurance, taxes, and a dozen others things which have been met out of the common fund, except an arbitrary one to suit the purposes and convenience of the company in connection with its accounts ? Any calculation by such method must start with and proceed on the assumption of facts which, as I have said, cannot in the nature of things be established. If it be said that the plaintiff is shut up to such method of proving the fact it complains of, and that unless it be allowed to show it in this way, it is helpless against legislative injustice, a sufficient answer would be — show this to be so, and the company will at least be in better position to insist upon the method adopted. I think it quite evident that it is not so. The question whether a given passenger rate will yield a compensatory return for the particular service rendered, may be curious and interesting, but the fact, however it be, can be of no practical value in determining the larger question of whether the state is con<a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>fiscating the company’s property by compelling it to observe such rates. If the rate be less than compensatory in itself, yet if the entire net income of the company derived from both branches of its business in the operation of its road, is sufficient to yield to the company a reasonably fair return on its capital, is the company in any position to claim that injustice is being done it ? Let us see — If the whole income derived from both branches of the company’s business yields a compensatory retürn on the whole capital, and one branch be shown to have been conducted at the loss, it would seem to follow necessarily that in conducting the other branch, the company had exacted from the public rates which were more than compensatory, and, therefore, unreasonable and unjust. If the fact be so — I do not say that it is — then the plaintiff company is here with one outstretched hand appealing to a court of equity to protect it against legislative injustice, while with the other it is working injustice like unto that of which it is complaining, against the people whose servant the legislature is. If it be not so, it is within the power of the company, at no inconvenience to itself, and by the simplest process, to acquit itself of all suspicion in this regard. Were a court of equity, dealing only with conscionable demands, to insist that the company at least make a reasonable effort to do so, would it be requiring too much ? Certainly not; it is the judicial conscience that is to be satisfied before the relief asked for can be given. I have said that it was in the power of the company to demonstrate, if it chose to do so, that the prescribed passenger rate is not compensatory, if indeed such be the fact. Let us assume the freight rates of the company to be compensatory and nothing more — the only assumption that is required to be made, and the plaintiff will certainly not insist that it is an unwarranted one. Let the total net income from both sources of revenue for a given period, be reduced by whatever sum will represent the difference between the net passenger income on the basis of the company’s rates and the rate prescribed by the act. If the result be a reduction of the total net income below what would be compensatory to the plaintiff, it wül show unmistakably that the fault is in the prescribed rate. If the working hypothesis employed for this solution be established as the fact, namely, that the freight <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>rates were simply compensatory and nothing more, the plaintiff will have made out a case upon which no court of equity would turn its back. Until this is done, it would be the extremest indulgence to allow that the plaintiff’s evidence establishes even a case of reasonable probability.</p>

The position here taken is to my mind wholly untenable. By express constitutional provision the right is conferred upon the general assembly to alter, revoke or annul any charter of incorporation whenever, in their opinion, it may be injurious to the citizens of the commonwealth. The power here given subjects every corporation to legislative regulation and control, even to extinguishment, and the legislature is made the sole judge as to when occasion arises for its exercise. The provision that the power is to be so exercised that no injustice shall be done the corporators, in no way qualifies the right of the legislature to determine for itself when and to what extent', in any given case, it shall exercise the power. The injustice the constitutional provision avoids, is confiscation, — the forfeiture of the property and property rights of the corporation to the public without due compensation ; it contemplates something that can be judicially determined by settled principles, and measured by established legal standards, with a view to reimbursement or indemnity. Under the provision referred to, the power of the legislature to pass such' legislation as it may deem necessary to protect the people of the commonwealth from corporate oppression, can never become a judicial question where provision is made for full compensation for any injury that may result. The position taken in the majority opinion is away in advance of anything asserted by the plaintiff.. Its contention, upon the argument of the case, was that the act of April 5, 1907, was confiscatory, in that it would require the company, without indemnity from the state, to ren<a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>der a public service at less than compensatory rates. This contention gave it a standing in court; on the bare contention that the legislation was unjust to it in any other sense, it could have none. As I have tried to show, its proof failed to make good its contention, and it is, therefore, not entitled to the relief prayed for.</p>

For the passage of the law in question we have no responsibility and I express no opinion in regard to its policy, or the wisdom of its provisions. I recognize the duty resting on the court in every case where the power of the legislature to enact a law is called in question, to maintain the supremacy of the constitution, and declare void the act of assembly that violates it. But this high power invested in the court, as has been said, is attended with high responsibility. It is to be exercised only when the legislation transgresses an expressed constitutional restriction, or one necessarily implied, <em>“ </em>palpably, plainly, and in such maimer as to leave no doubt or hesitation on our minds.”</p>
