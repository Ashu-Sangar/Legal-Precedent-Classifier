It was said in Cassel v.

Assurance Co., <a href="/pa/183/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="183 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="896157" data-case-paths="/pa/183/0334-01">183 Pa. 334</a>; Garman v.

Without question a change in the name of partners or the adding of the names of partners omitted by mistake or the name of another administrator or trustee or of a use plaintiff would be allowed after the bar of the statute. The principle on which such amendments are allowed should govern in this case. In Railroad Co. v.

His commissions on sales were approximately $12,000 a year. On account of the plaintiff’s illness his son had gone into this territory as his father’s representative and had been so employed three months before he was killed. The accounts of both companies were kept as before in the plaintiff’s name, but the commissions were paid by one of the companies to his son, who handed them to him. Ho definite arrangement had been made as to what the son was to receive for his services. Testimony was admitted and the case was submitted to the jury on the theory that the son was entitled to all the commissions earned from sales. There was error in this. The business was the plaintiff’s, in which his son assisted him. He had created it and controlled it, and owned it as fully and derived as much from it after his son’s death as before. His pecuniary loss was not the value of the business, but the value of his son’s assistance in carrying it on.</p>
