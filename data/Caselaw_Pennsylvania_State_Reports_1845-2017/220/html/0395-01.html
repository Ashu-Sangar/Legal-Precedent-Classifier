The bill was dismissed for the reason, among others, that the trust created by the will should be upheld as long as any of the testator’s children survived, to give effect to his intention that the husband or wife of a deceased child should be excluded from any participation in his estate.</p>

It directed that the whole income should go to the testator’s children and grandchildren and that in no way whatever should the husband or wife of a deceased child receive any portion of the estate. It took away the restricted interest before given to the husbands and wives of deceased children and deprived them of any interest in any event in his estate.
