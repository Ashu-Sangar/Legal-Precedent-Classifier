In such a case either party has the right in the exercise of good faith to pay what he deems proper for the stock, and the other party must pay one-half of the money expended. If it appears that the stock is not procurable in the market, and that its pecuniary value is not readily ascertainable, the contract may be specifically enforced.

    <p id="b454-6" data-blocks='[["BL_454.8",454,[281,739,1176,502]]]'>The court below found the following contract to have been entered into by the parties : “ Ray T. Sherman, the plaintiff, and R. F. Herr, the defendant, on August 20, 1906, mutually and verbally agreed with each other- to procure by purchase the 150 shares of stock of A. G-. Stauffer and the 150 shares of stock of W. A. Wengert in said Calcite Quarry Company for their mutual benefit, the purchase to be made by either of them, as opportunity might offer, and after being so purchased the said shares were to be equally divided between them, each paying one-half of the purchase price.”</p>
    <p id="b454-7" data-blocks='[["BL_454.9",454,[279,1249,1177,502]]]'>There was ample evidence before the court to support this finding. At least three disinterested -witnesses in addition to the plaintiff and the admissions of the defendant sustain the contract as found by the court. The responsive answer of the defendant to the bill was, therefore, overcome by the testimony on the part of the plaintiff. In fact, the defendant’s own admissions when on the witness stand tend to contradict his answer filed to the plaintiff’s bill. The learned judge was clearly right in finding the contract to be as he has stated it in his opinion.</p>
    <p id="b454-8" data-blocks='[["BL_454.10",454,[279,1759,1175,451]]]'>There was no lack of mutuality in the contract. Sherman and Herr agreed to buy the 300 shares of stock owned by Stauffer and Wengert, and divide the shares between them. Either party was to make the purchase as opportunity might offer, and each was to pay one-half of the purchase price. The contract was, therefore, mutual, and the mutual promises constitute a valuable consideration and make the contract valid : Berger’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/96/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="96 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="494662" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0443-01">96 Pa. 443</a> ; Fitzsimmons v.

It is true there was no specific price fixed by the parties in their agreement at <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>which the stock was to be purchased. This, however, was not necessary to the validity of the contract. The stock was to be purchased for the mutual benefit of the parties, and either was authorized to make the purchase whenever there was a favorable opportunity. The price at which the purchase was made fixed the price which the one making the purchase was to receive from the other party. The main and important feature of the agreement was the purchase of the stock, both parties being willing to pay the price at which it could be obtained. Each party, therefore, was unrestricted as to the price he should pay the owner of the stock, and the other party was bound to accept it at the price at which, in good faith, the purchase was made. Either party making the purchase had the right to enforce contribution from the other for the one-half of the money expended to obtain the stock. The contract as to price, therefore, is capable of being made certain, and hence the maxim id certum est quod cerium reddi potest is applicable.</p>

It appears from the findings of the court that the stock is not procurable in the market and its pecuniary value is not readily ascertainable. It further appears that the stock is of peculiar value to the plaintiff in order that he may obtain a proper and legitimate control over the management of the corporation. In such cases, the court will require the party to specifically perform the contract and deliver the stock: 26 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 122; Leach v.
