Jutte &amp; Company, one of the defendants, and were claimed by the plaintiffs. The Colonial Trust Company, administrator, filed an answer to the effect that they did not know whether the bonds belonged to the plaintiffs or not. C. J ntte &amp; Company, the other defendant, answered the bill admitting the possession of the bonds, and their willingness to turn them over either to the plaintiffs, or the other defendant as the court should direct. The court after hearing and argument entered a decree dismissing exceptions to adjudication and directing that the bonds should be delivered to the plaintiffs.</p>

The transactions were conducted in such loose and unbusinesslike manner that after the death of the principal parties it is difficult, if indeed it is possible for others to unravel them with entire confidence in the accuracy of the conclusions reached. The findings of the learned judge below are the result of careful examination and while the evidence on which they rest was meager, we cannot say that it was insufficient.</p>
