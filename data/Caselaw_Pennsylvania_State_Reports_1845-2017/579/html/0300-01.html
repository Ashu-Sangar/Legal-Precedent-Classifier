Appellee put the vehicles on a facially-legitimate car lot and sold them to unsuspecting victims. To accomplish the thefts, appellee typically targeted a dealership, where he would feign interest in a vehicle, and have an accomplice distract the salesperson while appellee wrote down the key code to the ignition. Later, appellee would go to a locksmith, have a key made based upon the key code number, and steal the vehicle after the dealership closed. Occasionally, he would simply test drive a vehicle and stop at the locksmith’s shop to have a key made.</p>
