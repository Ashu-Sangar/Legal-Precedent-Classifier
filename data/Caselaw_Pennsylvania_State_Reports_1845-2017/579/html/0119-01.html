Prison authorities placed appellant in the prison’s Restrictive Housing Unit (RHU) for a period of 120 days. When appellant was released from the RHU, he stated to the correctional officer who had found the marijuana that he knew it was Chapman who had “snitched” on him and that he would “take care of it.” N.T. 3/27/87, at 200.

Greer, who weighed between 195 and 200 pounds, held the 130-pound Chapman on his bed while appellant used an eight-inch long homemade knife to stab his victim fifteen times in the chest, back, face and leg. In the frenzy of the attack, appellant also inflicted errant stab wounds upon himself and Greer. Blood that was consistent with Greer’s blood-type was splattered on a pair of Chapman’s trousers hanging in the cell, and on the sleeve of the jacket worn by appellant at the time.</p>

Hill noticed blood dripping from Greer’s arm. As appellant reached Hill’s location, he thrust the knife he was carrying into Hill’s hand and told him to get rid of it. Hill placed the knife in a bag, which he disposed of in a trash can on his way to breakfast. A correctional officer who observed Hill placing the bag in the can later testified that he thought it odd that Hill did not just <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>toss the package in the can, but rather, “placed” it there.

Appellant, meanwhile, had returned to his cell and was seated on a stool with a handkerchief wrapped around his hand when another inmate, Joseph Ezzo, stopped to inquire whether appellant was going to his prison job that morning. According to Ezzo’s testimony, appellant answered that he was not, and further volunteered that he had just killed Chapman. At that point, prison authorities had been alerted to Chapman’s murder and had ordered inmates back into their cells. Moments later, Ezzo informed a correctional officer that appellant had admitted to the killing. The correctional officer then went to appellant’s cell and observed a one-inch gash on the palm of appellant’s hand.</p>

At his insistence, appellant represented himself during substantial portions of the trial. Eventually, however, he agreed to permit appointed stand-by counsel, Alonzo Burney, Esquire, to take over. Following a penalty hearing, at which trial counsel did not present mitigating evidence, the jury returned a sentence of death on March 31, 1987.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This Court affirmed the judgment of sentence on May 10, 1990. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant requested that the then Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Defender Association<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> be permitted to represent him as post-conviction counsel and the PCRA court, per Judge O’Brien, granted appellant’s request.</p>

The Commonwealth filed a timely answer. The Commonwealth alleged, <em>inter alia,- </em>that it was prejudiced in responding to appellant’s specific claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present mitigation evidence at the penalty phase—noting the nine years that had passed since appellant’s conviction—and requested a hearing limited to that issue. Judge O’Brien ordered a hearing to consider the Commonwealth’s claim that it was prejudiced. Judge O’Brien also issued a Notice of Intent to Dismiss without a hearing regarding appellant’s remaining claims. Appellant’s counsel requested the expansion of the evidentiary hearing to include expert and lay testimony on the “deplorable conditions on death row in Pennsylvania” and appellant’s alleged borderline mental retardation and other psychological impairments. The request was denied.</p>

On the basis of trial counsel’s testimony, Judge O’Brien vacated the sentence of death and ordered a new sentencing hearing. Appellant’s guilt phase claims were dismissed. In a brief two-page opinion filed on May 15, 1998, Judge O’Brien failed to address the guilt phase claims individually, instead adverting to the Commonwealth’s answer, and then, noting, without referring to any particular claim, that “[t]he Court denied petitioner relief for the reasons that his claims were alternatively insufficiently pled, were without merit, had been previously litigated or were not <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>preserved at a time when the petitioner acted as his own counsel.” PCRA slip. op. at 2.</p>

The Commonwealth did not appeal the grant of penalty phase relief. On June 10, 1998, the Honorable Gerard M. Bigley of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County granted the Commonwealth’s request for a Stay or Supersedeas of the penalty phase retrial pending the outcome of appellant’s appeal. The next day, the Superior Court quashed appellant’s appeal without prejudice, noting that it was “constrained to remand this matter to the trial court with the directive that the trial court conduct a sentencing hearing and impose a judgment of sentence upon appellant.” Slip, op at 4. The panel further noted that, in the event the trial court should impose a sentence of death upon appellant for a third time, this Court, rather than the Superior Court, would have jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>

A review of trial counsel’s closing argument in its entirety demonstrates that counsel adequately discussed the Commonwealth’s burden of proof, the presumption of innocence and the degrees of homicide, the deficiencies and weaknesses in the Commonwealth’s evidence, and the defense theory. To that end, trial counsel noted that the Commonwealth’s key witnesses were fellow inmates who had violated the law, and reminded the jury that they were free to disbelieve them. Counsel suggested that two key Commonwealth witnesses, Hill and Ezzo, may have received favorable treatment for their cooperation with authorities and asked the jury to take this into account when considering the truthfulness of their testimony. Moreover, counsel reminded the jury that Hill’s testimony provided the sole link between appellant and the “shank” used to kill Chapman, but that Hill was the only person who had actually been seen with the murder weapon. Counsel further observed that the Commonwealth had failed to investigate Hill, despite his admitted disposal of the murder weapon, and argued that authorities may have rushed to judgment by focusing their investigation exclusively upon appellant. Finally, counsel asserted that the Commonwealth’s theory regarding appellant’s <em>motive—ie., </em>that Chapman was a snitch—was undermined by the fact that appellant had promised Ezzo that he would not hurt him, and indeed did not hurt him, even though he knew Ezzo was himself a “snitch” who had implicated appellant in the murder.</p>

Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 909 requires an evidentiary hearing, unless it can be said, <em>inter alia, </em>that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(b). Appellant has alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in the failure to present witnesses at trial, and has submitted an evidentiary proffer which includes affidavits from five witnesses which, if credited by a fact finder, would implicate another individual as the killer.
