The Commonwealth Court appears to reason in the body of its opinion that the mere fact that the trial court determined Devereux to be "best suited” to K.C.'s and H.B.’s needs is sufficient to establish that it considered all potential in-state options. <em>See also </em>Devereux’s Brf. at 19 ("In issuing its orders to send the children to Texas, the court presumably determined that the Texas placement, and no other, was the placement best suited to the children’s individual needs—that phrase in itself states that, in the court’s judgment, no other placement, in or out of Pennsylvania is as well suited; the Texas program is the best suited.”). However, the court also suggests in a footnote that, as a factual matter, the trial court must have been advised of all available placement options, because the statute requires that it be advised of all available beds. <a href="/a2d/797/1037-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="797 A.2d 1037" data-case-ids="9435749" data-case-paths="/a2d/797/1037-01">797 A.2d at </a>1041 n. 9. Specifically, the court notes that section 6353(c) of the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6353(c), requires DPW to notify the courts of available secure beds for serious juvenile offenders and available general residential beds for children adjudicated delinquent, and asserts that given this provision, the trial court must have been advised of "all available beds for delinquent children.” <em><a href="/a2d/797/1037-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="797 A.2d 1037" data-case-ids="9435749" data-case-paths="/a2d/797/1037-01">Id.</a> </em>However, as DPW points out in its brief, section 6353(c) is inapposite here as it does not require DPW to report the availability of beds for <em>inpatient psychiatric setvices, i.e., </em>the type of bed that K.C. and H.B. required here. Moreover, we note that section 6353(c) does not require DPW to keep the courts continually apprised of the changing availability of beds, but rather, merely requires it to provide the court with a report regarding the availability of beds <em>"immediately after the Commonwealth adopts its budget." </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6353(c) (emphasis added). Accordingly, even if the report included information about beds for inpatient psychiatric services, the trial court could not possibly rely on this snapshot of availability to determine on an ongoing basis whether beds are empty at particular facilities, much less whether the facilities with empty beds are equipped to serve the individual needs of any particular juvenile requiring placement.</p>

We also recognize that out of context, this dicta could be read to suggest that in the instant case, the trial court would have abused its discretion by ordering placement at Devereux if that placement were nonreimbursable and there were an equally effective and reimbursable in-state option. However, unlike the hypothetical situation considered in <em>Tameka M., </em>which necessarily contemplated the juvenile court being presented with two options, one reimbursable and one not, the record here does not establish that the trial court was presented with a placement option for which DPW reimbursement was necessarily available. Moreover, in <em>Tameka M., </em>the financial implications of the two placement options were squarely presented to the juvenile court because Children and Youth Services explicitly objected to the nonreimbursable placement. Under those circumstances, it is understandable that the trial court would abuse its discretion by failing to consider the relative financial implications of the two placement options presented to it. In contrast, <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>in the instant case, there is simply no evidence in the record suggesting that any party asked the trial court to consider whether DPW funds would be available to pay for the selected placement and thus, it could not be considered an abuse of discretion for the trial court to fail to consider the availability of DPW reimbursement as a factor in its placement decision.</p>

Notably, DHS filed an amicus brief in the Commonwealth Court and did not assert that it had exhausted all of its in-state options in compliance with 55 Pa.Code § 1151.50(a)(2)(ii). Rather, it merely argued that "[e]ven if there was some technical non-compliance with the applicable regulations,” DPW should be equitably estopped from denying payment for the services rendered to K.C. and H.B. because Devereux "reasonably relied” on DHS’s representations that it had been "unsuccessful in locating in-state placement for these children.” DHS’s Commw.

Devereux appears to argue that it is simply unfair to deny it reimbursement for the services it rendered to K.C. and H.B., because Medical Assistance “is the only legitimate source of payment” and thus, absent reimbursement by DPW, the facility will not be compensated for its considerable services. Devereux’s Brf. at 13. Significantly, we agree with Devereux that it deserves to be paid for the services it rendered to K.C. and H.B. pursuant to the trial court’s commitment orders. Furthermore, we in no way fault Devereux for the lack of <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>record documentation establishing that in-state placement options were exhausted before K.C. and H.B. were placed at Devereux.</p>
      <p id="b456-5" data-blocks='[["BL_456.2",456,[313,713,1121,1616]]]'>However, in denying Devereux reimbursement from DPW here, we are merely applying the plain terms of DPW's regulation, the validity of which Devereux does not challenge. <em>See supra </em>n. 9. Moreover, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that we were at liberty to ignore that regulation based on our own concerns regarding Devereux’s ability to obtain compensation elsewhere, we cannot accept Devereux's assertion that it does not have any other source of compensation. As explained above, the Public Welfare Code clearly provides that state and local county governments will contribute to the costs of necessary care for children adjudicated delinquent under the Juvenile Act, and that available funding from “other existing or future private, public, local, State or Federal programs,” including the Medical Assistance Program, are merely the first sources that should be tapped <em>if </em>they are available. 62 P.S. § 704.2; <em>see also id. </em>§ 704.1; <em>Tameka M., </em><a href="/pa/525/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="525 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1823740" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0348-01">525 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/pa/525/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="525 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1823740" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0348-01">580 A.2d 750</a> (accepting without question that DPW regulations prohibit reimbursement for dependent child's Montessori schooling and concluding that county children and youth services must therefore pay for placement). Indeed, the record here makes clear that before Devereux became certified as a Medical Assistance provider and therefore became eligible to apply for reimbursement from the Medical Assistance Program, DHS reimbursed it for its services. <em>See </em>Testimony of Carolyn Villarubia, Executive Director of the Devereux Treatment Network, R.R. at 249a-250a (stating that prior to Devereux's Medical Assistance certification, placements were county-funded through DHS); Supplemental Information of Appellant Devereux at 2, ¶¶ 6-7, R.R. 51a ("Prior to August, 1997, Devereux provided services to juveniles from Pennsylvania through contracts with local county children and youth agencies.... In Philadelphia, the responsible children and youth agency is [DHS], with which Devereux had a contract.”); 5/29/97 letter from DHS to Devereux, R.R. at 36a (stating that DHS “has approved placement of [K.T.] into [Devereux's] program at a per diem rate of $362.00 retroactive to March 26, 1997”). Moreover, to the extent that the record provides any indication as to how the trial court expected Devereux to be paid for the services rendered here, it suggests that the court anticipated that DHS would pick up the tab. <em>See 4/SQ/91 </em>Memorandum from Naomi Post, Deputy Chief of Family Court’s Juvenile Branch to A.J. Kierans, Director of Court and Community Services for DHS, R.R. at 131a (requesting "special contract" for placement of K.C. at Devereux for expected duration of 9-12 months at a per diem rate of $362.00). Under these circumstances, it seems apparent that if DPW funds are not available to pay for K.C.'s and H.B.’s placements, either DHS or some other state or local source must pay Devereux for its services.</p>

While DPW contends that the court concluded that the treatment was compensable regardless of whether it was medically necessary or not, <em>see, e.g., </em>DPW's Brf. at 15 ("[T]he Commonwealth Court ruled that the common pleas placement order supplanted <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>the 'medical necessity' requirement for K.T.’s continued stay at Devereux.”), Devereux argues that the court found that the treatment was "medically necessary.” <em>See, e.g., </em>Devereux’s Brf. at 7 ("[T]he Commonwealth Court ruled correctly that, until the Common Pleas Court ruled otherwise, K.T.'s placement at Devereux remained medically necessary. ...").</p>

Moreover, we will not presume that the Commonwealth Court’s finding that K.T. was not "suitable for an alternate type or level of care” due to the existence of the unmodified commitment order is the equivalent of finding that the treatment was <em>"medically </em>necessary.” Indeed, the DPW regulations themselves make clear that the inquiry as to whether a patient is "suitable for an alternate type or level of care" pursuant to 55 Pa.Code § 1151.48(a)(15) is not wholly coterminous with the inquiry as to whether or not the patient's treatment is "medically necessary.” <em>See </em>55 Pa.Code § 1151.48(b) ("[T]he Department will not pay inpatient psychiatric facilities for services or items provided in conjunction with the provision of a service or item in subsection (a) <em>even if the attending physician or hospital utilization review committee determines that the stay was medically necessaiy.”) </em>(emphasis added).</p>

Finally, when Devereux appealed the denial of payment to the Commonwealth Court, it argued that it was improper for DPW to deny payment for K.T.’s treatment based on a lack of medical necessity, <em>see </em>Devereux’s Commw.

In this regard, there are strong cost control factors governing availability of MA Program funding. Additionally, in terms of reimbursement decision making, although certainly a degree of deference is due in favor of a common pleas court directing treatment, I do not believe that DPW should be deemed bound by the placement determination (to which it is not a party), at least in the absence of extraordinary circumstances.

Under the rubric of either provision, MA Program funds are simply unavailable, so long as DPW’s finding is grounded in substantial evidence. In this regard, Devereux has conceded the suitability of an alternate level of care and the lack of actual medical reasons to support the continued placement, but has merely advanced the legal argument that its services must be deemed to remain medically necessary for MA reimbursement purposes even after a prescribed coarse of treatment has been completed <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>unless and until an alternative, suitable placement for the juvenile can be made.
