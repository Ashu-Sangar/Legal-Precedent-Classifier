Marcone alleging that Mr. Marcone has acted in violation of our July 1995 order suspending him from, <em>inter alia, </em>the practice of law. In determining whether the ODC’s Petition should be granted, we are necessarily required to analyze the issue of whether an attorney who has been suspended from the practice of law by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania may nevertheless maintain a law office in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for purposes <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>of practicing before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Marcone was admitted to the practice of law in Pennsylvania on June 4, 1968.

Evidently, Mr. Marcone remains admitted to practice before that federal district court. By order dated November 26, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, however, suspended Mr. Mar-cone for four years and until his reinstatement to the practice of law by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

Thus, pragmatically speaking, to permit within our Commonwealth’s borders without regulation the maintenance of a law office by a suspended attorney, dedicated to an “exclusive” federal practice, in which such counseling could take place, would be to leave our citizens vulnerable to misguidance and exploitation. Related thereto, limiting the concept of the practice of law to Pennsylvania law, exclusive from federal matters, would be virtually impossible to apply and enforce, <em>Kennedy, </em><a href="/md/316/0646-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="316 Md. 646" data-case-ids="2037331" data-case-paths="/md/316/0646-01">561 A.2d at 208</a>, and would defeat our mandate of protecting the public from incompetent or unethical practitioners.

Furthermore, the statutes and rule offered by Mr. Marcone fall far short of establishing that the federal enactments are so comprehensive that they demonstrate that Congress has intended to occupy regulation of the field to the exclusion of our state. Simply because federal statutes allow for the promulgation of rules, and permit one to conduct cases by counsel in federal courts, certainly does not evidence a Congressional intent to divest state courts of their authority to regulate the practice of law by suspended attorneys within their borders. Likewise, while under the local rules for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania an attorney may be reinstated to “practice before this court notwithstanding the refusal of a state court to reinstate the attorney to practice,” E.D.Pa.R.Civ.P. 83.6 VII(I), this does not evidence an intent to prohibit our Court from regulating the maintenance of a law office by a suspended attorney for the proffering of himself to the public or for client consultation and advice.

While ODC’s reliance upon <em>Ginsburg </em>is justified, our decision in that appeal is of somewhat limited value because the Court’s per curiam opinion offers scant analysis as to the underpinnings of its decision. Furthermore, the Court in <em>Ginsburg </em>spoke to the admission of an attorney to practice, and this discussion carries less weight today due to the advent of federal bar admission requirements and the discipline of attorneys practicing before federal courts, which did not exist at that time, and which left such admission requirements and attorney regulation solely to the states. <em>Ginsburg </em>certainly remains, however, consistent with our determination today regarding the maintenance of a law office by a suspended attorney.</p>

Mr. Marcone relies upon <em>In re Desilets, </em><a href="/br/279/0925-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="291 F.3d 925" data-case-ids="9414334,9433278" data-case-paths="/br/279/0925-01,/f3d/291/0925-01">291 F.3d 925</a> (6th Cir.2002) in support of his conclusion that it is solely for the federal courts to regulate the lawyers admitted to federal practice. Mr. Marcone's reliance on <em>Desilets </em>is misplaced for a number of reasons. First, that decision dealt with whether an individual was an “attorney” for purposes of the bankruptcy code with respect to practice in a Michigan federal bankruptcy court and did not deal with the maintenance of a law office in a state by a suspended attorney. The <em>Desilets </em>court concluded that federal standards control admission to the federal bar. Nothing herein is contrary to this principle. Second, that decision did not deal with an attorney that was suspended from the practice of law in the state in which he wished to practice. Indeed, the attorney at issue was admitted to the bar of the state of Texas. Finally, to the extent that <em>Desilets </em>can be read to be contrary to our decision today, we are not bound by the decisions of lower federal courts. As noted above, we find that the discussions of the practice of law contained in <em>In re Peterson, </em><a href="/br/163/0665-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="163 B.R. 665" data-case-ids="6112096" data-case-paths="/br/163/0665-01">163 B.R. at </a>673 and <em>In re Lite Ray Realty Corp., </em><a href="/br/257/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="257 B.R. 150" data-case-ids="11139777" data-case-paths="/br/257/0150-01">257 B.R. at 155</a>, more accurately reflect the realities of the practice of law and bankruptcy law in particular.</p>

Florida, </em><a href="/us/373/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="373 U.S. 379" data-case-ids="11718478" data-case-paths="/us/373/0379-01">373 U.S. 379</a>, <a href="/us/373/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="373 U.S. 379" data-case-ids="11718478" data-case-paths="/us/373/0379-01">83 S.Ct. 1322</a>, <a href="/us/373/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="373 U.S. 379" data-case-ids="11718478" data-case-paths="/us/373/0379-01">10 L.Ed.2d 428</a> (1963). <em>Sperry </em>dealt with a lay person who represented patent applicants before the United States Patent Office. The United States Supreme Court held that the state of Florida could not prohibit this layperson from representing individuals with respect to patent applications. The Court’s decision was based upon a federal statute which specifically permits the Commissioner of Patents to authorize practice before the Patent Office by non-lawyers. Unlike the situation at bar, <em>Speny </em>dealt with the ability of a layperson, expressly authorized by federal statute, to work in a specialized area of federal law—patent law, before an agency, the Patent and Trademark Office, which had a long tradition of regulating practitioners before it. <em>Sperry, </em>373 U.S. at 387-90, <a href="/us/373/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="373 U.S. 379" data-case-ids="11718478" data-case-paths="/us/373/0379-01">83 S.Ct. 1322</a>. Thus, it is clearly distinguishable from the circumstances in this case regulating a suspended attorney's maintenance of a law office and does not compel a result different from the one we reach today.</p>
