The Viscose Corporation operated twenty-four hours a day and employed more than 2,500 people. Currently, the former site of the Viscose Corporation is now the Crawford County Industrial Park, which houses a variety of small commercial businesses and offices.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The remainder of the restricted tract is bounded by wooded land to the northwest, the Cussewago Creek to the south and west, and the City of Meadville to the east.</p>

The closest alcohol-serving establishment is the Fire Department’s current social hall, which is located in Vernon Township, approximately one-half mile from the restricted lots. In addition, there are two bars located within two miles of the restricted tract.

The trial court determined that the restrictive covenant prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages was valid and enforceable. Specifically, the court concluded that “[b]ecause [Appellants] will realize substantial benefit from the enforcement of this restriction, and because the restriction has not been rendered obsolete by change in the neighborhood, [the Fire Department] is not entitled to the relief sought.” Trial Court ■ Opinion, August 29, 2001, at 8. The Fire Department also argued that the principles of estoppel, waiver, and laches rendered the restrictive covenant invalid and/or unenforceable. However, the trial court concluded that these doctrines were not applicable in an action to quiet title or for declaratory relief, and refused to reach the merits of these arguments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

First, the Superior Court concluded that the trial court erred in limiting its consideration of Appellants’ “immediate neighborhood” to those parcels subject to the restrictive covenant. The court explained that the presence of three liquor-serving establishments within two miles of the restricted tract did not support Appellants’ contention “that they experience none of the effects of the sale of alcohol.” Superior Court Memorandum Opinion, December 23, 2002, at 8. Next, the court found that conditions in the neighborhood had changed, such that the restrictive covenant no longer had significant value to Appellants. In reaching this conclusion, the Superior Court relied upon the existence of other alcohol-serving establishments within the immediate neighborhood. Moreover, the court noted that sixty-eight of the seventy-seven owners within the Culbertson Subdivision signed the Limited Release of Restrictions. The Superior Court also explained that all of the property owners who testified stated that they did not rely upon the alcohol restriction when purchasing the property. <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>As for the Fire Department’s third issue, which concerned the applicability of the doctrines of estoppel, waiver, and laches to the present matter, the Superior Court declined to address the merits of this issue because it reversed the Judgment of the trial court based upon the Fire Department’s first two claims of trial court error.</p>
    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[151,613,1153,468]]]'>Ultimately, the Superior Court concluded that the restrictive covenant, dating back to 1946, was a nullity and, accordingly, reversed the Judgment entered by the trial court in favor of Appellants. Thereafter, Appellants filed an Application for Reargument or Reconsideration, which the Superior Court denied by Order dated February 25, 2003. On August 6, 2003, we granted allowance of appeal to determine whether the Superior Court erred in reversing the Judgment of the trial court.</p>

Appellants assert that the Superior Court, in reaching its decision, failed to discuss or apply several relevant decisions of this Court. Moreover, Appellants contend that the Superior Court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the trial court, and in doing so, failed to provide the appropriate deference to the factual findings of the trial court.</p>

The Fire Department maintains that the purpose of the covenant has been materially altered or destroyed by changed conditions in the immediate neighborhood, such that a substantial benefit no longer flows to Appellants by enforcement of the restriction. According to the Fire Department, the existence of three alcohol-serving establishments within the immediate neighborhood of the restricted tract renders the covenant a nullity. Moreover, the Fire Department stresses that approximately <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>ninety percent of the lot owners within the Culbertson Subdivision waived the restriction, and not a single Appellant relied upon the restriction when purchasing his or her home or property.</p>

Moreover, changes in the commercial nature of the immediate neighborhood, namely, the closing of the nearby Viscose Corporation, did nothing to impair the significance of the alcohol restriction. As <em>Benner </em>recognized, changed conditions outside of the restricted tract do not necessarily impair the value of an alcohol restriction to the residents of the restricted tract.

Moreover, the Superior Court noted that Appellants testified that they did not rely upon the restrictive covenant when purchasing their property. However, the restriction clearly benefits Appellants by hindering the nuisances that inherently result from the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, the factual record reflects that alcoholic beverages have never been sold within the restricted tract since the covenant was signed in 1946. As in <em>Benner, </em>the trial court had competent evidence before it to conclude that the entire restrictive plan had not been abandoned and that the alcohol restriction still had significant value to Appellants.

As we have emphasized, changed conditions within an immediate neighborhood, as a matter of law, do not invalidate a restrictive covenant. Here, we have concluded that the trial court properly considered changed conditions to the immediate neighborhood in validating the alcohol restriction. If the Superior Court presumed that the trial court erred in failing to consider changed conditions beyond the restricted tract, but within the immediate neighborhood, it should have refrained from outright reversing the Judgment of the trial court. When faced with similar factual circumstances in <em>Deitch, </em>we ordered a remand so that the trial court could properly assess changed conditions outside of the restricted tract, but within the immediate neighborhood. <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a><a href="/pa/460/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="460 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="482883" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0394-01">333 A.2d at 785</a>.

      <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>The Majority, like the trial court, focuses on the fact that there are presently no establishments with liquor licenses within the specific confines of the Culbertson Subdivision and dismisses the presence in the immediately adjoining neighborhood of two bars and the Fire Department’s existing social hall, which is located a mere 2,000 feet from the parcel on which the Fire Department seeks to build its new truck room and social hall. The Majority concedes that these three alcohol-serving establishments are located within the immediate neighborhood of the Culbertson Subdivision, “but outside of the restricted tract,” then concludes that these three establishments do not impair the utility of the restriction to the owners of the restricted properties. Op. at 379-80, 855 A.2d at 882. In one breath, the Majority states that it must consider not only the restricted tract but also the surrounding neighborhood and notes that three other alcohol-serving establishments exist in the immediate neighborhood. Then, in the next breath, the Majority essentially determines that the presence of those other establishments is irrelevant to its inquiry because the only relevant area is the Culbertson Subdivision itself.</p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[267,1378,1161,723]]]'>The Superior Court, on the other hand, set forth the same legal principles and applied them in a more straightforward fashion. That court found that the trial court record did not support a finding that the Culbertson Subdivision owners experienced none of the effects of alcohol sales, given that the record established the presence of three alcohol-serving establishments located within two miles of the subdivision. Thus, the Superior Court held that the immediate neighborhood had changed with the introduction of the three establishments, and that the trial court erred in restricting consideration of the immediate neighborhood to the restricted tracts. This finding, in my view, establishes the first prong of the test for discharging a restrictive covenant, i.e., that the original purpose is materially altered by changed conditions.</p>
    <p id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.6",510,[267,2122,1156,200]],["BL_511.1",511,[163,285,1157,361]]]'>Moving to the second prong, the Superior Court held that the restriction no longer possessed significant value to the subdivision owners based upon the fact that 68 of the 77 owners agreed to execute a release of the covenant, that three <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>additional owners chose not to defend themselves in this action, and that all of the appellees who refused to sign the release testified and admitted that they had not relied upon the covenant when purchasing their properties. I would find that the Superior Court properly concluded that this record evidence establishes that the covenant lacks significant value to the owners of the restricted tracts.</p>
    <p id="b511-4" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[160,680,1166,956]]]'>Because restrictive covenants interfere with property owners’ free use and enjoyment of their property, such covenants are not favored by courts. <em>Mishkin v. Temple Beth El of Lancaster, </em><a href="/pa/429/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="429 Pa. 73" data-case-ids="1913506" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0073-01">429 Pa. 73</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20800" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="239 A.2d 800">239 A.2d 800</a> (1968). Thus, in an appropriate case, our courts will invalidate restrictive covenants that have outlived their usefulness, which is what I believe the record demonstrates has occurred in this case. I agree with the Superior Court that the existence of three alcohol-serving establishments in close proximity to the Culbertson Subdivision constitutes a material alteration or change of the original purpose of the restrictive covenant. That 71 of the 77 purportedly affected owners find no value to the covenant and the other six did not rely upon the covenant in purchasing their properties is a clear signal that the covenant lacks significant value to the subdivision owners at this time. Anachronisms need not persist for their own sake. Accordingly, I would affirm the Superior Court’s decision discharging the restrictive covenant in this case.</p>
