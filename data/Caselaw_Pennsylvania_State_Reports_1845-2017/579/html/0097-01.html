Prior to the commencement of the 1997-98 school year, Merrell applied for an advertised position with the School District as a social studies teacher. He was not selected. In 1999, Merrell again applied for an advertised position, this time advancing to the fourth step of the School District’s five-step hiring process. By letter dated April 28, 1999, the School District informed Merrell that it had appointed another candidate. The School District did not specify the reasons for not selecting Merrell. Subsequently, on May 10, 1999, counsel for Merrell wrote to the School District Superintendent, requesting that the School District reconsider its decision to hire another candidate for the upcoming school year because Merrell was entitled to preference in employment by virtue of the Veterans’ Preference Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The officer challenged the determination of the Commonwealth Court that the letter constituted an adjudication from which he had not timely appealed. The challenge was grounded on the basis that he had been denied an opportunity to be heard. This Court essentially agreed that the letter announced a final determination of the officer’s property rights, but concluded that the Administrative Agency Law “expressly requires an agency to supply an aggrieved party notice of a hearing and an opportunity to be heard.” <em>Callahan, </em><a href="/pa/494/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="494 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1769117" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0461-01">431 A.2d at 948</a>. Therefore, <em>Callahan </em>represents a three-step process to determine whether an agency letter constitutes an adjudication. Initially, the determination must be made as to whether actual property rights are implicated. Next, there must be an assessment as to whether the letter constitutes final agency action. Finally, if the letter has satisfied the first two steps, it is an adjudication, but it is not a <em>valid </em>adjudication if there is an absence of notice and an opportunity to be heard; an invalid adjudication does not trigger a claim limitations period. Implicit in our decision was the determination that Officer Callahan had a property interest in the Heart and Lung benefits that he had been receiving and that the decision to terminate those benefits was an adjudication within the meaning of 2 Pa.C.S. § 101. Thus, in <em>Callahan, </em>the first two steps were not at issue, though Officer Callahan’s compliance with these two steps was obvious within the text of our Opinion. Significantly, the Court did not conclude that the letter was not an adjudication, but was careful to note throughout its analysis that the letter in <em>Callahan </em>was not a <em>valid adjudication. </em>The third analytic step was absent, rendering the termination letter an adjudicatory nullity.</p>

In the enactment of the statute, a coordinate branch of government, whose members were chosen by the people to represent them, has given expression that veterans are to be given preference in employment once they meet the qualifications established for consideration. Within its enactment, the General Assembly has provided for a point-bonus preference for those veterans required to take and pass a civil service examination and for <em>a </em>tie-breaking preference for candidates <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>with comparable qualifications. In the instant matter, the preference had not yet ripened because Merrell did not succeed in reaching the final level of consideration. The applicants remaining after the close of the fourth stage, the point at which Merrell was removed from consideration, were those considered qualified for the open teaching position. Therefore, Merrell was not among the most qualified candidates for the position. The Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that the preference had become a constitutionally protected property interest. On remand, Merrell will have the opportunity to demonstrate his qualifications and, if he is able, show that there was a flaw in the process that precluded the ripening of his interest, antagonistic to precepts of the Veterans Preference Act.</p>

Without an interest of this sort that is apparent on the face of a prehearing record, the lead Justices’ approach seems to be that there can be no adjudication and, correspondingly, no available judicial review of an agency disposition. <em>See </em>Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, 579 Pa. at 108-11, 855 A.2d at 720-21 (“Without an absolute preference in employment, Merrell does not have a property right to preference in employment such as to render the letter of April 28th an adjudication.”).</p>

The General Assembly has crafted a statutory scheme by which various rights and entitlements can be adjudicated in a manner that comports with constitutional due process norms. <em>See, e.g., </em>2 Pa.C.S. §§ 504, 553 (requiring notice of a hearing and an opportunity to be heard as a <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>prerequisite to a valid adjudication).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> In conformance with those norms, a critical aspect of the scheme is the provision for judicial review. <em>See generally </em>73A C.J.S.

Indeed, in the administrative arena the United States Supreme Court applies a presumption that a decision of an administrative body is subject to judicial review, in the absence of a clear showing that the legislature intended to preclude it. <em>See, e.g., Bowen v.

    <p id="b245-6" data-blocks='[["BL_245.7",245,[152,1846,1155,468]],["BL_246.1",246,[267,268,1155,510]]]'>I am concerned that the lead opinion’s conclusion that the preference had not yet “ripened” because Merrell had not reached the final stage of consideration will provide an easy avenue for employers to circumvent the precepts of the Veterans’ Preference Act. The Act does not require that a veteran reach the final stage of consideration in order for the preference to be triggered. Section 7104(a), 51 Pa.C.S. § 7104(a), relating to non-civil service employment, provides: “Whenever any soldier possesses the requisite qualifications and is eligible <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>to appointment to or promotion in a public position, where no such civil service examination is required, the appointing power in making an appointment or promotion to a public position shall give preference to such soldier.” Under the plain language of the Act, Merrell’s right to the preference arose when he applied for the teaching position. As a result, the April 28, 1999 letter fits the statutory definition of an adjudication and the letter triggered Merrell’s thirty-day period in which to appeal the decision to the Common Pleas Court, which he failed to do.</p>
    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[263,810,1158,1155]]]'>The School District contends that the Commonwealth Court’s finding that the April 28, 1999 letter was not a valid adjudication based upon this Court’s decision in <em>Callahan v. Pennsylvania State Police, </em><a href="/pa/494/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="494 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1769117" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0461-01">494 Pa. 461</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="494 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1769117" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0461-01">431 A.2d 946</a> (1981), is in error because the Commonwealth Court misstated our holding in <em>Callahan. </em>I agree with the School District that the Commonwealth Court misread the <em>Callahan </em>decision as stating that an adjudication that is invalid is not subject to the thirty-day limitation period for filing an appeal. In <em>Callahan, </em>as the School District notes, the agency letter notified the appellant that his Heart and Lung Act benefits would be terminated at a future date. This Court held that the actual date of termination, rather than the notification date, triggered the thirty-day appeal period. Here, irrespective of the merits of the decision, the School District’s April 28, 1999 letter comprised the sole action on the part of the School District. There was no future date on which the School District would take further action with respect to Merrell. The letter notified Merrell that the School District had already acted by appointing another candidate. The letter was, therefore, the triggering event for the thirty-day appeal period.</p>
    <p id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.6",246,[262,1999,1154,202]]]'>I also find persuasive the School District’s argument that, because the School District would be taking no further action on his application, Merrell was obligated to appeal within thirty days:</p>
    <blockquote id="b246-6" data-blocks='[["BL_246.7",246,[305,2218,1111,95]],["BL_247.1",247,[198,273,1114,521]]]'>Unlike the police officer in <em>Callahan </em>who had not been deprived of his existing right at the time that he received <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>his letter, Merrell definitively knew that he had not been selected for the job and that no further action would be taken with regard to his application. Nonetheless, on July 21, 1999, eighty-four (84) days after receiving the letter from the District, Merrell filed his Complaint with the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. Merrell, having already received notice of the Board’s action, and having no reason to wait for further action, had no reasonable basis to sit on any right that he had to appeal the District’s decision to hire another candidate.</blockquote>
    <p id="b247-5" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[155,827,1152,88]]]'>Appellants’ Brief at 31-32. On this record, in my view, the School District is correct.</p>
    <p id="b247-6" data-blocks='[["BL_247.6",247,[154,949,1157,314]]]'>For these reasons, I would find that the April 28,1999 letter constituted an adjudication from which Merrell had thirty days to mount any challenge. Merrell failed to do so in a timely manner. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the Common Pleas Court order dismissing Merrell’s complaint.</p>
