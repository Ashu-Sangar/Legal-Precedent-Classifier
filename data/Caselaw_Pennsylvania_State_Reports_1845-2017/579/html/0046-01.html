We have stressed that a claim not raised in a PCRA petition cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.

The Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that a PCRA court judge is to hold a hearing where a PCRA petition raises any material issues of fact. Pa.R.Crim.P. 908(A)(2); <em>see also Commonwealth v.

Where a PCRA court determines that a hearing is required as to only some, but not all, of the issues raised in the PCRA petition, a hearing may be limited as to those issues; there is no requirement that a hearing be held as to all of the issues raised in the PCRA petition. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The <em>McGill </em>decision was crafted to cut through this confusion and articulate, with precision, the method by which a petitioner preserves and proves a layered ineffectiveness claim.

Such a conviction does not negate Appellant’s intent to commit a criminal act.

The lead opinion today <em>sua sponte </em>converts a preserved claim of layered counsel ineffectiveness for failing to assert that appellant was mentally incompetent to stand trial into the underlying claim of incompetence itself—a claim which I believe is waived under the plain language of Section 9544 of the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541 <em>et seq., </em>because it was not raised either before appellant’s second trial or on his direct appeal therefrom. In so doing, the lead opinion inadvertently resurrects the capital case relaxed waiver rule which this Court abrogated on PCRA review in <em>Commonwealth v.

These cases provide no authority for the lead opinion’s decision to negate the PCRA waiver provision; to resurrect relaxed waiver on PCRA appeals; or to declare that belated, court-raised claims of competency to stand trial are beyond the constitutional power of the General Assembly to deem waivable. Although the lead opinion ultimately denies relief upon the waived claim it raises and decides, the rule that it would craft, and the violence such a rule would do to the PCRA and our recent precedent compels me to register my respectful disagreement.</p>

Instead, the PCRA is written logically: claims are deemed waived if there existed a fair opportunity to litigate the claims before final <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Since this Court has deemed competency claims to be non-waivable on direct appeal, the always-counseled appellant here had more than a fair opportunity to litigate his competency to stand trial prior to final judgment. It is incongruous that, in declaring that competency claims raised before an appellate court upon collateral appeal are an “exception” to the PCRA waiver provision, the lead opinion never cites or discusses the terms of the' statute itself. In addition to flying in the face of the actual language of the PCRA, the lead opinion’s view is contrary to this Court’s existing PCRA jurisprudence.

Most claims which could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal but were not—including claims implicating fundamental rights and claims of constitutional dimension— are waived under the PCRA. But, that is not the end of the matter. By deeming claims premised upon the ineffective assistance of counsel to be cognizable upon collateral review, the PCRA appropriately channels and allows waived claims to form the basis for constitutionally-distinct claims arising under the Sixth Amendment. The actual claim raised by appellant here—that his prior counsel were ineffective for failing to challenge his competency to stand trial—is no less amenable to rational, jurisprudentially sound decision-making than other claims of counsel ineffectiveness deriving from foregone rights of constitutional magnitude, such as the validity of a jury waiver or a guilty plea or a waiver of counsel, etc.</p>

The practical difficulty in retrospective competency determinations and the very real prospect of meritless claims are factors which should caution against judicially manufacturing an “exception” to the PCRA waiver provision to indulge this claim above all others. A competent trial lawyer presumably can be trusted to ascertain those instances where his client’s mental competency may be called into question, <em>i e., </em>those instances where his client is so beset by mental disease or defect that he could not even consult with counsel or could not even understand the proceedings as they were occurring.

In <em>Nelson, </em>the defendant was convicted of third-degree murder and he failed to appeal the verdict. He later filed a <em>pro se </em>petition under the PCHA alleging, among other things, that he was incompetent to stand trial. Counsel was appointed but inexplicably failed to amend the petition and failed to argue or develop the issues at the PCHA hearing, electing instead to present argument on two new issues at that hearing. On appeal to this Court, the defendant raised three arguments, all sounding in the ineffective assistance of counsel, including as his third claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a hearing on the defendant’s competency to stand trial. <em>Id. </em>at 999.</p>

      <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>First, I am able to join the lead opinion’s affirmation of the PCRA court’s retrospective competency assessment because Appellant has not demonstrated that the trial court improperly failed to make a determination of his competency in the course of the proceedings on his second trial. Although certainly there was information before the trial court implicating substantial mental infirmity on Appellant’s part (schizophrenia), thus bringing competency into question, Appellant had been deemed competent upon hearing during the course of his first trial; Appellant did not seek a competency hearing in his second trial; and there appears to be no indicia of record demonstrating that the judge presiding at the second trial should have discerned a change in Appellant’s mental condition. In these circumstances, I agree with the lead that the burden of proof was properly placed upon Appellant in the post-conviction proceedings concerning the retrospective competency assessment. Nevertheless, I would also note that in circumstances in which there was in fact an unjustified failure on the part of the trial court to make a contemporaneous determination of competency, a substantial argument can be made that the burden in connection with a retrospective competency assessment is more appropriately allocated to the government. <em>See James v.

In this regard, I read the United States Supreme Court’s recent <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>decision in <em>Wiggins v.

Moreover, no fact-witness affidavits were tendered with the post-conviction submission to develop the asserted neglect and abuse (principally, the fact affiants attested to unusual behaviors on the part of Appellant which reflected his mental illness, which, as the lead opinion notes, was developed as of record in the penalty phase). It is also noteworthy that the allusions that were made at the penalty phase to life-history mitigation had mixed implications, since a defense expert held the view that Appellant had, at least at one point, sought to rely on his background manipulatively. <em>See </em>N.T., Sept. 8, 1992, at 332-33.</p>
