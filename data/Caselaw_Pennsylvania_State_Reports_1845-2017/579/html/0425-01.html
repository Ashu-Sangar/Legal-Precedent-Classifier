The four men got out of the cars, approached Irick and asked him if he knew anything abut the shooting on Franklin Way. Irick responded that he had heard something about the shooting and that he was on his way to meet someone at the Starlight building who knew what had happeifed and that the four men could come with him.

Prior to closing statements, appellant’s trial counsel made a motion for a mistrial based upon the admission of evidence that the murder was drug-related. In denying the motion, the trial court noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was evidence that the victim and appellant’s co-conspirators were involved in drug-dealing, but “there was very little testimony that [appellant] was involved in drug dealing.” N.T. 3/22/00 at 730.</p>

Instead, the evidence was admitted in order to demonstrate the motive for the murder of Arthur Irick. Appellant argues that this murder was not drug-related, but rather, that he killed the victim because he believed that the victim had attempted to rob and shoot him earlier in the evening. While there was evidence of the <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>retaliation motive appellant cites, this was not the entire story. The Commonwealth’s evidence demonstrated that the victim and his associates were “stick-up kids” who systematically robbed known drug dealers; that appellant and his co-conspirators knew this fact; that appellant and his co-conspirators were drug dealers; that the victim attempted to rob appellant earlier in the evening precisely because appellant and his co-conspirators were drug dealers; and that appellant murdered the victim in retaliation. Thus, the evidence of the drug-related activity, which was limited as to appellant’s specific prior bad acts, was properly admitted to show that this killing did not occur in a vacuum, <em>i.e. </em>to demonstrate motive. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hall, </em><a href="/pa/523/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="523 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="1820353" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0075-01">523 Pa. 75</a>, <a href="/pa/523/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="523 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="1820353" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0075-01">565 A.2d 144</a>, 149 (1989) (evidence of past drug dealings admissible to demonstrate motive for murder).

Thus, the Commonwealth argues that the references to appellant were isolated and not prejudicial and, thus, counsel was not ineffective. The trial court, in its opinion, deemed the references to appellant hailing from New York as not prejudicial. Trial counsel, at the remand hearing, echoed that he did not object because evidence of drug-activity on the part of appellant and his co-conspirators had been deemed admissible and he did <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>not believe that the references to New York were prejudicial “in and of [themselves].”</p>

Whether an “onslaught” existed was not remotely at issue; nor was it relevant to attempt to tie appellant’s alleged conduct into some broader social problem involving outsiders coming into the county.

While the prosecutor here did not specifically implore the jury to “send a message” with a verdict of death, his comments regarding appellant and his co-conspirators bringing violence and drugs from New York to York County nevertheless trigger similar concerns about appealing to irrelevant factors.

Although counsel certainly could have forwarded an objection to the remarks, we do not believe that, as a matter of strategy, he was constitutionally obliged to do so. The fact of the matter is that both appellant and the victim were involved in aspects of the drug trade; the task for the jury was to determine appellant’s responsibility, if any, for the killing. Viewed in this light, it was not unreasonable for counsel to view the reference in the prosecutor’s opening as insufficiently harmful to warrant an objection and the inevitable highlighting of the remark which an objection would have created.

The fact that the jury rejected certain proffered mitigators—mitigators supported by a brief argument—does not mean that a full preparation of other relevant mitigation evidence might not have changed the result. Moreover, it is not self-evident that the proffered mitigators are objectively “stronger” than evidence of appellant’s background. Counsel’s duty encompasses pursuit of all statutory mitigators of which he is aware or reasonably should be aware, unless there is some objective, reasonable ground not to pursue the circumstance (such as when it might open the door to harmful evidence). Finally, we note that this was a close case in terms of the penalty. The Commonwealth proved a single aggravating circumstance. Counsel’s task (at that phase) was to attempt to convince at least one member of the jury that there was at least one mitigating circumstance which should be accepted and weighed against the aggravator. We cannot simply assume, as the Commonwealth would have us do, that all of the jurors would have rejected any proffered mitigator merely because they rejected other mitigators which were very briefly argued.</p>

A client is entitled to trust in the fact that his attorney will know what investigation to undertake, what leads to pursue, and what evidence to look for.

We recognize that the evidence presented by appellant at the evidentiary hearing was not so strong as the foregone “smoking gun” mitigation evidence at issue in <em>Williams </em>and, to a lesser extent, <em>Wiggins. </em>Nevertheless, appellant did prove that there were certain factors in his background which were easily discoverable and which could have been forwarded in mitigation had counsel undertaken even a minimal investigation. Additionally, counsel’s overall “preparation” for the penalty phase was clearly lacking, as it consisted of minimal meetings prior to trial with no follow up and no production of testimonial evidence at the penalty phase.

In assessing prejudice, that single aggravating circumstance must be contrasted with the two mitigating <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>circumstances actually presented as well as the mitigating circumstance that counsel should have pursued—that appellant . had been abandoned by his mother at a young age, abused by his mother’s boyfriend at the age of 10, that his mother and father had a substance abuse problem and that he was institutionalized from the age of 12 until he was 15. Although we recognize that the unpursued evidence in this case is not the strongest, we further note that trial counsel’s presentation at the penalty phase included no affirmative evidence at all, but only a brief argument and a stipulation. Such a performance, which was not motivated by any strategic decision, left the jury with a dry assessment of appellant’s individual circumstances. In short, it is not just the failure to present evidence of appellant’s background which concerns us, but the fact that the failure occurred in a case where there was little effort to personalize appellant for the jury. Indeed, personalizing appellant’s background may have made one or more of the jurors more likely to accept the other mitigating circumstances which were pursued. We are satisfied that it is probable that at least one juror would have accepted at least one mitigating circumstance and found that it outweighed the Commonwealth’s single aggravating circumstance. Thus, had the jury heard testimony and been able to consider all of the mitigation evidence and argument together, there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance and voted not to impose the death penalty. <em>See, e.g., Wiggins, </em><a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="189" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">539 U.S. at 536-37</a>, <a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="190" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">123 S.Ct. 2527</a>, 2543, <a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="191" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">156 L.Ed.2d 471</a>.
