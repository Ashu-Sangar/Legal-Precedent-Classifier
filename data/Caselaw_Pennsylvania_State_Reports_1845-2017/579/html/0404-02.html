Christy (Christy), the president of Cranberry Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Inc. (Cranberry Ambulance), a Pennsylvania non-profit corporation,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> attended the company’s annual picnic on August 28, 1994, at Knob Hill Community Park in Marshall Township, Allegheny County. Many of the Cranberry Ambulance employees attended the <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>picnic, although some of them, including Louis Liberto (Liberto), a paid staff paramedic with Cranberry Ambulance, remained on duty back at the station. During the picnic, Christy began to experience symptoms of a heart attack. Sallie Bailey (Bailey), a friend of Christy’s who was also an attendee and a volunteer paramedic with Cranberry Ambulance, assisted Christy and telephoned the station to summon an ambulance. Bailey waited with Christy and rendered assistance. Liberto and Julie Wilson (Wilson), a volunteer emergency medical technician (EMT), responded to the call and arrived at the scene to render aid. Christy was moved by stretcher to the ambulance and then transported to North Hills Passavant Hospital (Hospital). Wilson drove the ambulance, and Liberto rode in the back to care for Christy. Bailey rode along in the back of the ambulance to continue to care for Christy, despite Liberto’s protests that her presence was unnecessary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Liberto maintained Christy on basic life support during the thirty-minute ride to the Hospital and never administered the NTG.

(RR at 282a). Medical evidence suggested that NTG would have relieved his chest pain and reduced the severity of his heart attack. Christy, who was thirty-seven years old at the time of his heart attack, survived. Medical testimony established that at the time of the incident, Christy had the arteries of a seventy-year old man, that there was a history of cardiac disease in his family, including his father’s death from cardiac disease at age thirty, and that Christy had smoked two packs of cigarettes a day since he was a teenager.
