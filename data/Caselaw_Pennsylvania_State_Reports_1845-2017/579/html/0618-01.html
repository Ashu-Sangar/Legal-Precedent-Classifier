Employer’s contributions to the Plan have been governed by the terms of various agreements that have been executed by Employer and the United Steelworkers of America (the “Union”). The first such agreement relevant to the present matter was executed by the parties in 1977, and was set to expire on July 31, 1980. Under this contract, employees were scheduled to receive a cost-of-living adjustment (“COLA”) in May of 1980. In early 1980, however, before the 1977 agreement expired and before the COLA took <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>effect, Employer and the Union negotiated a second contract, dated April 15, 1980, that succeeded the 1977 contract. During the negotiations that preceded execution of the 1980 agreement, one important issue that concerned the parties pertained to the enhancement of pension funding. This issue was ultimately resolved when the Union agreed to relinquish the COLA that was scheduled to begin in May, and Employer agreed to provide a modest general pay increase and, additionally, make a lump-sum contribution to the pension fund. Thereafter, retirees and future retirees became eligible for increased pension benefits due, at least in part, to this lump-sum payment. The payment was placed directly into the general pension fund administered under the Plan; no special fund or account was created for the disbursement of these monies.</p>

Claimant initially received full unemployment benefits, reduced only by part-time wages. He also received monthly retirement pension disbursements under the Plan in the amount of $1,830.00. The local office of employment security (the “Job Center”) ultimately reduced Claimant’s weekly benefit by $212.00, a sum representing one half of the weekly prorated amount of Claimant’s pension receipts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This reduction was effected pursuant to Section 404(d)(2) of the Unemployment Compensation Law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> 43 P.S. § 804(d)(2), which provides, in relevant part:</p>

Although it was undisputed that Claimant had not directly deposited money into the fund, Claimant argued that Employer’s payment of the lump-sum monies pursuant to the 1980 agreement constituted an indirect employee contribution, inasmuch as the employees involved (including Claimant) had relinquished their scheduled COLA in return for such payment. Employer, on the other hand, asserted that, as all payments into the fund had been made solely by Employer, the employees did not make any contributions for purposes of Section 404(d)(2)(ii) of the Law, and hence, the Job Center <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>should have applied a dollar-for-dollar offset against Claimant’s unemployment benefits.</p>

The <em>Ehman </em>court held that, under these circumstances, the employees had, in effect, funded enhanced pension benefits through a reallocation of monies from their future paychecks, with the employer acting only as a conduit for this process; the court stated that such arrangement was unusual and was qualitatively different from “swapping inchoate proposals during bargaining.” <em><a href="/a2d/776/1031-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="776 A.2d 1031" data-case-ids="11083339" data-case-paths="/a2d/776/1031-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/776/1031-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="776 A.2d 1031" data-case-ids="11083339" data-case-paths="/a2d/776/1031-01">at 1036</a>.

Also, payments made by an employer to a retirement plan are not considered part of an employee’s wages for federal income tax purposes under Section 3401 et seq., of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).

Dissenting Opinion, at 641-43, 858 A.2d at 106. However, the record contains no indication of the size of Employer's lump-sum contribution as compared to the monetary value of the waived COLA wages. Indeed, during bargaining the parties could not have known the cumulative value of such wages, as that sum would depend upon unknown future events, such as plant closings and openings, and employee hirings, resignations, terminations, retirements, and deaths. Thus, if the parties had wished Employer to be a mere conduit, they would have agreed to a scheme of continuing, smaller contributions in the amount of the foregone COLA wages.

The principle of the accumulation of financial reserves, the sharing of risks, and the payment of compensation with respect to unemployment meets the need of protection against the hazards of unemployment and indigency.

To accomplish this goal, Union voluntarily relinquished its members’, including Appellant’s, contractually vested right to a wage increase, in exchange for Employer’s contribution to the Fund.

If the law had permitted, Appellant could simply have accepted his COLA and contributed it directly to the Fund.

Appellant relinquished not a mere bargaining position, but an actual amount of money with present value that Employer was obligated to pay him.
