Briefly, on the evening of March 19, 1981, the victim, Anthony Patrone, approached Joseph D’Amato (“Appellant”) in a restaurant in Philadelphia, and the two began to discuss a plan to defraud an insurance company by reporting as stolen an automobile belonging to Appellant’s girlfriend, Bernadette McFarland. <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>The scheme involved “cutting up” the car and selling its parts, and also collecting the insurance money. Appellant, Patrone, and Ms. McFarland left the restaurant and drove to a nearby parking lot to discuss the idea further. At some point, however, Appellant became suspicious that Patrone intended to betray Appellant and have him arrested. Thus, Appellant ordered Patrone out of the car, pulled out a gun, and shot him twice at close range in the face and chest, killing him. Witnesses observed a car matching the description of Ms. McFarland’s vehicle exit the parking lot and drive away with two individuals inside and its lights off (although it was after 10:00 p.m.). Appellant disposed of the murder weapon by throwing it into a river; it was never found.</p>

Appellant ultimately became a suspect in the Patrone homicide, as well as in the shooting deaths of two other individuals, John Amato and Anthony Bonaventura. Philadelphia police obtained an arrest warrant for Appellant and, later, a federal fugitive flight warrant. Appellant and Ms. McFarland remained at large for approximately nine months. In December of 1981, FBI agents apprehended them near Youngstown, Ohio. Appellant waived extradition and was returned to Philadelphia. After being advised of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v.

Thereafter, the Commonwealth provided discovery materials, and, in July of 1998, Appellant filed papers styled as á motion seeking a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, a petition for habeas corpus relief, and a petition for relief under the PCRA supplemental to the third amended petition. The Commonwealth moved for dismissal of the petition; in response, Appellant submitted twenty exhibits, which included an affidavit of Robert L.

Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, which was denied.

In support of its decision to grant a new trial, the <em>Spruill </em>court noted that evidence of prior criminal activity is highly prejudicial, and that the introduction of a statement indicating first-hand knowledge of an unrelated homicide may. have impermissibly undermined the defendant’s presumption of innocence. <em>See <a href="/pa/480/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="480 Pa. 601" data-case-ids="1745067" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0601-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/480/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="480 Pa. 601" data-case-ids="1745067" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0601-01">at 606-07</a>, <a href="/pa/480/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="480 Pa. 601" data-case-ids="1745067" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0601-01">391 A.2d at 1050-51</a>.

First, the other-crimes evidence in <em>Spruill </em>was elicited during direct examination of a Commonwealth witness; whereas, in the present matter, Detective Chitwood was testifying during cross-examination in which defense counsel, attempting to demonstrate that the confession was coerced, inquired at length concerning the physical restraints placed upon Appellant. This line of questioning opened the door for the witness to proffer some explanation as to why use of handcuffs was warranted. Additionally, the challenged testimony in <em>Spruill </em>unequivocally reflected first-hand knowledge that the defendant had committed multiple homicides. Here, by contrast, the detective initially stated that “he was a murderer. I mean we had arrested him for murder,” thus clarifying that he only <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>intended to convey that the defendant had been arrested on a homicide charge, a fact of which the jury was already aware. After counsel’s follow-up question, the detective seemed confused in that he appeared to state (somewhat implausibly) that Appellant was convicted of murder before he was arrested, and then, on disclaiming that position, asked, “Do you want me to answer the question?”</p>
    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[280,670,1155,1325]]]'>We find more troubling the district attorney’s actions in imploring the judge to allow the witness to state whether Appellant had been convicted of a separate murder. This arguably raised an inference that she expected information favorable to the prosecution to be forthcoming. Still, counsel immediately withdrew the question, and it was never answered. Moreover, in the overall circumstances of this case, this incident does not stand out as being unduly inflammatory. Indeed, on direct appeal this Court rejected several claims of prosecutorial misconduct by making specific reference to the impassioned advocacy involved at trial, in which both sides “occasionally exceeded the boundaries of overzealousness.” The Court observed that the trial judge repeatedly warned the jurors that such “heat-of-battle” remarks should not influence their deliberations. <em>See D’Amato, </em><a href="/pa/514/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="514 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="1804489,1804579" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0471-01,/pa/514/0471-02">514 Pa. at 491</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="514 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="1804489,1804579" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0471-01,/pa/514/0471-02">526 A.2d at 310</a>.

In light of these factors, we cannot conclude that Appellant has carried his burden of demonstrating that he would have been entitled to a mistrial based upon the challenged remarks, or that the lack of a curative instruction at that point in the proceedings resulted in a process in which no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.</p>

While forbidding trial courts to deviate from this statutory prescription, the <em>Billa </em>decision specifically recognized the need for trial courts to define the significant terms contained in Section 9711, <em>see Billa, </em><a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">521 Pa. at 188</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">555 A.2d at 845</a>, one of which is the phrase, “preponderance of the evidence.” <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iii).

While we do not approve of an attorney sending stand-in counsel, whose appearance has not been entered, to represent his or her client during criminal proceedings, nevertheless, our disapproval of this practice does not alter the conclusion that Mr. Durst acted as Appellant’s counsel during the relevant interval. <em>But cf.

Mason witnessed certain events connected with the killing of Bonaventura and disposal of his body. He gave police a detailed statement concerning his knowledge of that matter on April 1, 1981, in which he implicated Appellant in that offense. On April 7, 1981, Mason gave the police another statement, clarifying several minor aspects of his April 1 statement. Appellant argues that the Commonwealth concealed Mason’s April 7 statement in violation of <em>Brady v.

In this affidavit, Mason affirms that: he gave state<a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>ments to police on April 1, 1981 and April 7, 1981, in relation to the death of Anthony Bonaventura; prior to Appellant’s first trial for the Bonaventura homicide, he (Mason) and the prosecutor had a disagreement concerning the content of the testimony Mason would provide at that trial; and this disagreement centered on who owned and/or possessed “the gun”—an apparent reference to the weapon used to kill Bonaventura. The only basis on which Appellant argues that this affidavit is material to the Patrone matter consists of a quotation from Mozenter’s affidavit in which Mozenter indicates that he “now understand[s]” that portions of Mason’s April 1, 1981, statement are “not true as per [Mason’s] affidavit.” Brief of Appellant at 65. Mozenter continues that, had he previously been aware of these alleged untruths, he would have been able more effectively to impeach the credibility of Commonwealth witness William Boyle.</p>

First, Mason’s 1997 affidavit contains no representations to the effect that his April 1 and 7, 1981 statements to the police contained falsehoods. Additionally, there is no apparent nexus between the conduct described in those statements (which, as noted, pertains to the death of Bonaventura) and the events recounted by Boyle at Appellant’s trial for the murder of Patrone. Indeed, the events described in Boyle’s testimony are not even discussed in Mason’s April 1 and April 7 statements, and hence, any alleged falsehoods contained in them would be immaterial to the Patrone murder. Consequently, Appellant has failed to demonstrate how any information contained in Mason’s 1997 affidavit could have been helpful in impeaching Boyle’s credibility at the trial in the Patrone matter.</p>

By way of background, Boyle testified at trial that, between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on the day that Patrone was murdered, Appellant came to his (Boyle’s) home and met with himself, Mason, and one other individual. During this meeting, Appellant asked to borrow <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>Boyle’s .38-caliber two-barrel derringer handgun and indicated that he would return it that night. Complying with Appellant’s request, Boyle lent him the gun, and then falsely reported it stolen to the police. Boyle never saw the weapon again. <em>See </em>N.T. 2/1/83 at 138-53.

This Court has also emphasized, however, that, even as to recantations that might otherwise appear dubious, the PCRA court must, in the first instance, assess the credibility and significance of the recantation in light of the evidence as a whole. The <em>Williams </em>decision, in particular, criticized the PCRA court for failing to make any independent determination as to the subject recantation’s believability, opting instead to adopt the Commonwealth’s arguments on the matter wholesale. This Court explained that</p>

Nor is there anything in the Common-. wealth’s brief which would demonstrate that the PCRA court actually considered Ms. Boone’s recantation in light of the trial record of her testimony and her post-trial declaration. The PCRA court’s decision, therefore, is tantamount to the <em>per se </em>preclusion of post-conviction relief based upon recantation evidence. Since this would be inconsistent with our precedent, we find that the PCRA court abused its discretion not only in failing to make an independent credibility determination, but also in adopting reasons in support of its decision that were insufficient on their face.</blockquote>

There is nothing in the recantation tending to exonerate appellant in Boyle’s belated claim, contrary to his trial testimony, that he did not provide appellant with a gun similar to the never-found murder weapon on the day of the murder. Moreover, as the Majority makes clear in rejecting other of appellant’s claims, the direct evidence of appellant’s guilt in this case was “abundant,” including appellant’s detailed confession, which this Court recognized on direct appeal was the “ ‘critical and most damaging evidence introduced at trial’.” Majority op. at 508, 856 A.2d at 817 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. D Amato, </em><a href="/pa/514/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="194" data-cite="514 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="1804489,1804579" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0471-01,/pa/514/0471-02">514 Pa. 471</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="195" data-cite="514 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="1804489,1804579" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0471-01,/pa/514/0471-02">526 A.2d 300</a>, 304 (1987)). That devastating confession was corroborated by eyewitness testimony and by appellant’s post-murder flight evidencing a consciousness of guilt. While Boyle’s testimony that he provided appellant with a gun similar to the murder weapon was circumstantial evidence that was helpful in securing the conviction, offering Boyle’s new statement to contradict that testimony would not likely lead to a different verdict. The recanting statement—“I did not give appellant a gun”—is not relevant except to impeach Boyle’s former relevant testimony that he did, in fact, give appellant a gun. Furthermore, Boyle’s recantation, even if admitted, would not erase the former testimony if the matter were retried. Rather, a new jury would be faced with the same damning confession, the same corroborating eyewitness testimony, and the same guilty post-murder conduct, accompanied still by Boyle’s former testimony, admissible as substantive evidence but now im<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>peached by his new story. This impeaching evidence, in my view, could not possibly change the outcome of the earlier verdict.</p>
    <p id="b657-5" data-blocks='[["BL_657.5",657,[146,448,1158,1496]]]'>I recognize, as the Majority does, that the PCRA court, in an apparent oversight, did not address this claim. I also recognize our precedent suggesting that remand is appropriate where the PCRA court’s failure to address a claim impedes effective appellate review; or where a failure to address the claim below (particularly in the pre-dismissal notice) has impaired the petitioner’s ability to amend his PCRA petition and better develop the claim; or where the PCRA court adopts the Commonwealth’s response rather than conducting an independent review. <em>See generally Commonwealth v. (Craig) Williams, </em>566 Pa.553, <a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="196" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">782 A.2d 517</a> (2001); <em>Commonwealth v.(Roy) Williams, </em>557 Pa.207, <a href="/a2d/732/1167-01" class="citation" data-index="197" data-cite="732 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="11553069,56907" data-case-paths="/a2d/732/1167-01,/pa/557/0207-01">732 A.2d 1167</a> (1999). In my view, however, this is not an instance in which the PCRA court’s lapse impedes either appellant’s ability to prosecute his claim or impedes this Court’s present ability to resolve the claim. For the reasons stated above, the claim clearly fails as a matter of law. <em>See Bond, </em><a href="/pa/572/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="198" data-cite="819 A.2d 33" data-case-ids="716470,9344704" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0588-01,/a2d/819/0033-01">819 A.2d at 50</a>; <em>Clayton, </em><a href="/pa/572/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="199" data-cite="816 A.2d 217" data-case-ids="716496,9365567" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0395-01,/a2d/816/0217-01">816 A.2d at 222</a>.
