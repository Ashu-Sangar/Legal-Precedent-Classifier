    <p id="b409-4" data-blocks='[["BL_409.6",409,[152,408,1153,1177]]]'>At the center of this litigation is a business arrangement that was markedly different from Pioneer’s usual course dealings, involving a California loan originator known as RNG Mortgage Services, Inc. (“RNG”) and American Financial Mortgage Corporation (“AFMC”), a Pennsylvania company in the same business. As background, in the spring of 1997, Pioneer committed to serving as RNG’s warehouse lender, and the companies executed loan and security and three-party agreements establishing the usual governing terms and conditions. This relationship, however, was compromised after August of 1997, when RNG sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. RNG’s financial condition impaired its ability to attract investors from the secondary market, given its inability to assure them recourse, thus threatening its ability to survive as a going concern. About the same time as RNG was seeking avenues to allow it to continue its operations, AFMC was exploring expansion opportunities. Learning of RNG’s circumstances, AFMC began investigating a possible acquisition of the California company’s assets, the most valuable of which was its portfolio of unfunded mortgage commitments, referred to in the industry as a loan “pipeline.”</p>
    <p id="b409-5" data-blocks='[["BL_409.7",409,[153,1625,1152,581]]]'>Both AFMC and RNG thus had an interest in maintaining RNG as a going concern while AFMC considered the acquisition. To accomplish this, they devised an arrangement whereby AFMC would receive an effective assignment of the loans, assume recourse responsibility relative to them, and sell them in the secondary market. Pioneer was also made a party to the discussions, as AFMC and RNG desired to obtain continued funding from Pioneer for loans in the pipeline. Pioneer elected to participate for its own reasons, apparently related to its desire to obtain the existing business and the prospect of a future warehouse lending relationship with AFMC.</p>

Mechanically, Pioneer and AFMC executed a loan and security agreement and a three-party agreement (with Bank One), thus facially establishing the framework of a debtor/creditor relationship. Pioneer agreed to arrange for the notes to be endorsed and shipped to AFMC, along with a bailee letter indicating that Pioneer held a security interest in the notes and their proceeds, and also, retained title pending full payment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> AFMC, in turn, was to consummate the sale to an institutional investor, and Pioneer was to be paid from the proceeds.

AFMC proceeded to obtain a purchase commitment from Norwest Funding,’ Inc. (“Norwest”), an institutional investor that had categorically refused to purchase loans directly from RNG. In connection with the purchase, Norwest required a series of seller representations and warranties, including AFMC’s attestation to its absolute and unencumbered ownership of the notes, which facially contradicted the bailee letter transmitted from Pioneer to AFMC. The notes were released to AFMC, endorsed by it, and shipped by AFMC to Norwest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> After reviewing the notes, Norwest subsequently transferred payment for those that it accepted via the Federal Reserve Wire Transfer Network (“FedWire”) to an AFMC account maintained with Appellant, CoreStates Bank, N.A.

The bank had discovered a substantial overdraft in an AFMC account, in the amount of approximately $4.5 million, and, as a result of its investigation, concluded the overdraft was a consequence of a sustained practice of check kiting, <em>i.e., </em>improper manipulation of accounts to allow the account holder to draw on funds that it did not in fact possess.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> In response, on November 7, 1997, CoreStates imposed debit restraints on Flatley company accounts, including the AFMC settlement account.</p>

The second transaction initially proceeded much as the first one had. Contrary to Pioneer’s expressed wishes, and despite the request that AFMC had previously conveyed on Pioneer’s behalf, AFMC again furnished instructions to Norwest to -wire the proceeds of the sale to AFMC’s self-described settlement account at CoreStates. Norwest complied with those instructions and transmitted the approxi<a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>mately $1.78 million to this account via FedWire in three installments.

It’s absolute tort. Therefore, the UCC ... do[es] not apply to this case. That applies only to contract actions.”). Accordingly, as the case proceeded through trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> the trial court refused CoreStates’ request for a directed verdict grounded in these principles and its proposed jury instructions embodying them. Instead, the trial court issued a relatively short set of instructions that did not differentiate between (and indeed conflated) possession by a fiduciary or agent subject to another’s absolute reservation <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>of title (a true trust or bailment arrangement and the <em>Sherts </em>paradigm) and a perfected security interest in account proceeds (the <em>Pennsylvania National Bank &amp; Trust </em>scenario). The court then described Pioneer’s essential claim as an assertion of a security interest in the AFMC account proceeds, and relegated CoreStates’ defenses to the claim that Pioneer simply had no security interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> Having reduced the issue to be decided by the jury to the single question of whether or not Pioneer possessed a security interest, the trial court advised-the jurors that, if they answered this question in the affirmative, CoreStates had no right to set off and could be found liable for conversion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> Additionally, the court issued a generalized punitive damages charge.</p>

This asserted fact, however, is neither apparent on the face of the <em>Pennsylvania National Bank &amp; Trust </em>opinion nor is it any part of the Superior Court’s express reasoning; therefore, we do not deem it a proper basis to displace the court’s holding.

In this regard, although CoreStates’ act of setting off the AFMC account was aggressive, particularly in light of the character of the underlying debt owed to it by its depositor, it simply did not exceed the limits of existing law.

We conclude, however, that it is not. In terms of the lawful justification for its conduct, CoreStates was not bound by any particular party’s characterization of the transfer as mistaken. At most, the bank was on inquiry notice of a potential third-party interest <em>(inter alia </em>by virtue of AFMC’s denomination of the relevant account as a “settlement account,” <em>see supra </em>note 15), and was therefore bound to' conduct a reasonable investigation.

Most significantly, the framing of the case in terms of Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code and the incorporating provisions of Federal Reserve Board Regulation J, 12 C.F.R. 210.25(a), (b), governing fund transfers, has attracted the attention of multiple <em>amici, </em>including the Federal Reserve Banks. In this regard, CoreStates has maintained throughout the litigation that Article 4A’s express authorization of bank setoff, <em>see </em>13 Pa.C.S. § 4A502(c) (providing, <em>inter alia, </em>that “the amount credited [via wire transfer] may be set off against an obligation owed by the beneficiary to the bank”), as incorporated into Regulation J, preempts common law distinctions based on ownership or secured status external to Article 4A as they might otherwise pertain to the lawfulness of bank setoff. In this regard, CoreStates’ position appears to encompass the assertion that the <em>Sherts </em>holding has been preempted (or at least substantially displaced) by statute. This, in turn, has given rise to concerns on the part of another <em>amicus, </em>whose interests are representative of a substantial body of persons and organizations that are beneficiaries of statutory trusts arising by operation of federal law, for example, in proceeds from the sale of perishable agricultural commodities. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. § 499e(c). This <em>amicus </em>presents the counter argument'that Article 4A’s setoff provision was intended to incorporate existing setoff and priority rules into the funds transfer arena, not to supplant them. Given our determination, above, however, there is simply is no conflict between Article 4A (or Regulation J) and Pennsylvania common law concerning any material point of the present dispute.

An obstacle to the assertion of a claim of conversion against a bank exercising a right of setoff of the proceeds of a general deposit account arises out of the debtor/creditor relationship between the bank and the account holder. Among the essential elements of conversion is an absence of owner consent. <em>See Stevenson v. Economy Bank of Ambridge, </em><a href="/pa/413/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="413 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="1888633" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0442-01">413 Pa. 442</a>, 451, <a href="/citations/?q=197%20A.2d%20721" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="197 A.2d 721">197 A.2d 721</a>, 726 (1964) (setting forth the <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>elements of a conversion claim). As a general rule, however, general deposit account proceeds are treated as property of the bank, with account balances representing the bank's indebtedness to the depositor. <em>See Thomas v. First Nat’l Bank of Scranton, </em><a href="/pa/376/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="376 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1246168" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0181-01">376 Pa. 181</a>, 184, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20910" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="101 A.2d 910">101 A.2d 910</a>, 911 (1954). Thus, at least in the usual case, owner consent will be inherent in the act of bank setoff. <em>See generally </em>14 Causes of Action 105 § 3 (2004); 1 Thomas D. Crandall, Richard B. Hagendorn, and Frank W. Smith, The Law of Debtors and Creditors § 5.12 (2004) ("The action against a bank for improper setoff should lie in breach of contract, as opposed to the tort of conversion."). Conversion theory, however, has been invoked in other jurisdictions as a means of vindicating third-party ownership interests in certain identifiable account proceeds. <em>See, e.g., Citizens Nat’l Bank v. Mid-States Dev. Co., </em><a href="/ind-app/177/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="177 Ind.

Moreover, the parties devote substantial argumentation to the question of the timing of CoreStates’ setoff, given that CoreStates' knowledge concerning the source of the AFMC funds increased over time in the period between its initial receipt of the sale proceeds from Norwest and the sweeping of the accounts (this discussion is centered on the application of the doctrine of automatic setoff, <em>see generally Selig, </em><a href="/pa-super/434/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="434 Pa.

It is clear, however, that from the outset, CoreStates was aware that AFMC had denominated the relevant account a “settlement account"; this in and of itself is sufficient to trigger at least further inquiry under the <em>Sherts </em>line. <em>See Ryan Bros., </em><a href="/pa/382/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="382 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1259939" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0248-01">382 Pa. at 254-55</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20A.2d%20178" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="114 A.2d 178">114 A.2d at 181</a> (characterizing a plaintiff’s case for resisting bank setoff under <em>Sherts </em>as particularly strong, where actual ownership was invested in the third-party plaintiff, and the account had been labeled a "distribution account”).

The trial court also was not wholly incorrect in its understanding that a security interest, in the broadest sense, carries with it ownership attributes. <em>See, e.g., </em>Thomas W.

The trial court’s mistake was in not apprehending that it is not the type of interest that had been deemed, under Pennsylvania law, to be sufficient to defeat a bank's right of setoff. On this point, the trial court was not free to attempt to write on a clean slate. <em>See, e.g., In re Townsend's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/349/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="349 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="458782" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0162-01">349 Pa. 162</a>, 168, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20A.2d%20438" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="36 A.2d 438">36 A.2d 438</a>, 441 (1944) (stating the precept that common pleas courts are bound by decisions of the intermediate appellate courts, in absence of a pronouncement by this Court on the subject matter of the decision).</p>

Although certainly there is language in <em>Middle Atlantic </em>supporting Pioneer’s position, the case concerned a factoring relationship in which the funds in issue had been assigned to the plaintiff, and the holding was expressly grounded in the <em>Sherts </em>decision pertaining to funds held in trust. <em>See Middle Atlantic, </em><a href="/pa-super/199/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="199 Pa.

Prior to 1998 amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code, there was in fact a fairly strong current in a number of other jurisdictions favoring the interests of secured creditors over depository institutions, based on the general priority provision of Article 9. <em>See </em>Pa.C.S. § 9201(a) ("Except as otherwise provided by this Act, a security interest is effective according to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of the collateral and against creditors.”). <em>See generally </em>Annotation, <em>Effect of UCC Article 9 Upon Conflict, </em>As <em>to Funds in Debtor’s Bank Account, Between Secured Creditor and Bank Claiming Right of Setoff, </em><a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.L.R.%204th%20998" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="3 A.L.R. 4th 998">3 A.L.R.4th 998</a> (2004) (collecting cases); Janet A.

L.J. 59, 59 (1997) (observing that "the priority battle between banks claiming an interest not created under Article Nine and secured parties has split the courts”). The contrary line of cases generally relied on the exclusion of prior UCC Section 9—104(i) (excluding from the coverage of Article 9 a transfer of any "deposit, savings, passbook, or like account with a bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or like organization”), to exempt setoff from consideration under Article 9 entirely and to interpose a common law priority rule. <em>See id.; see also </em>Annotation, <em>Effect of UCC Article 9 Upon Conflict, </em>As <em>To Funds In Debtor's Bank Account, Between Secured Creditor And Bank Claiming Right Of Setoff, </em><a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.L.R.%204th%20998" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="3 A.L.R. 4th 998">3 </a><a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a><a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.L.R.%204th%20998" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="3 A.L.R. 4th 998">A.L.R.4th 998</a> § 1 (1981); Flaccus, <em>Banks Against Secured Parties, </em>6 U.

In rejecting the possibility of a sale scenario, the trial court placed substantial emphasis on the fact that Pioneer did not receive contemporaneous payment from AFMC. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., June 7, 2000 (p.m.), at 42 (“An ownership interest vests only upon payment.”). The trial court's view, however, overlooks the myriad possibilities for styling a sale-on- ' credit transaction. It is also worth referencing the value accruing to AFMC for entering into such a relationship, in terms of maintaining <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>RNG's status as a going concern and, concomitantly, AFMC's ability to benefit from RNG's assets via an acquisition.</p>
