At approximately 6:30 p.m., John Mendez and Ricardo Lopez arrived at the house to recover two guns that Mendez claimed belonged to him. Appellant retrieved the guns from an upstairs bedroom and gave them to Mendez. Mendez and Lopez then left.</p>

Mendez, however, came inside, where Heleva immediately accused him of stealing his guns and the two men began fighting in the kitchen. When this fight was resolved, Appellant and Lopez joined Heleva and Mendez in the kitchen, where the four men then sat around the table talking. Boyko left the house. While the men were in the kitchen, another argument erupted. This time, Appellant grabbed a .12 gauge shotgun and shot Mendez in the stomach. He then turned the gun towards Lopez and shot him in the side. After Lopez collapsed on the floor, Appellant placed the barrel of the shotgun on Lopez’s back and again <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>fired the weapon, killing him. Appellant then chased Mendez up the stairs to the second floor of the house, where he shot Mendez a second time. Although wounded, Mendez escaped from Appellant and Heleva and fled to a neighbor’s house with Appellant and Heleva in pursuit. Mendez knocked on the neighbor’s front door, but before anyone answered, Appellant and Heleva grabbed Mendez and dragged him across the lawn back to their house. Frey, who had been watching the incident, retrieved the shotgun that Appellant had dropped on the lawn, and hid it inside a sofa in the house. Once the men had dragged Mendez back inside, Appellant inflicted several blows with a hatchet type of weapon, killing him.</p>

In response, Pennsylvania State Troopers Matthew Tretter and Joel Rutter arrived at the scene and spoke to the neighbor, who told them that she had heard a loud noise and a high-pitched voice screaming “help me” outside of her door and that when she looked outside, she had seen someone being dragged across her front lawn into Heleva’s residence. The troopers noticed that there was a smear of blood on the neighbor’s front door and that a wooden porch railing had been broken. The troopers then proceeded to Heleva’s residence. Along the way, the troopers noticed a bloody jacket on the neighbor’s lawn, and they observed blood on Heleva’s door when they arrived.

After about one hour, at approximately 5:04 a.m., Appellant began to make a tape-recorded statement. In this statement, Appellant admitted that he shot both Mendez and Lopez twice, but claimed that he only started shooting after he believed Lopez was about to go out to his car to retrieve a gun. <em>See </em>N.T., 11/18/2002, at 270-71.

Appellant then gave a statement which again implicated himself in the murders, but in this statement, Appellant claimed that he had actually only shot Lopez once, in the kitchen. <em>See </em>N.T., 11/19/2002, at 290.

Based on the call from Appellant’s neighbor, Trooper Tretter and Trooper Rutter believed that they were responding to a violent domestic dispute. When they arrived at the scene, the troopers not only observed damaged property, but also saw blood on the neighbor’s front door, on a jacket left in the yard, and on the door of Appellant’s residence. The troopers then received a confusing account of events from Appellant. Given these circumstances, the troopers' could not be certain of the extent of danger before them nor could they be sure of the safety of the alleged woman involved in the reported domestic violence incident. In addition, once Appellant was placed in the patrol car, Trooper Tretter asked Appellant a very focused question, aimed at discovering the whereabouts of the alleged woman.

There, an officer stopped the defendant after the defendant repeatedly walked away from the officer in an area where a burglary had been reported. The officer asked the defendant for identification, but because the officer feared the defendant might flee after he kept moving his head, the officer placed the defendant in his patrol car. After a backup officer arrived, the officers thought they saw the defendant trying to escape, and as a result, they placed him in handcuffs. On appeal, the OAJC rejected the defendant’s claim that these actions by the police constituted an illegal arrest, instead concluding that the actions were all part of a legitimate investigative detention. In reaching this conclusion, the OAJC found that the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant initially and then stated:</p>

In any event, even if <em>Gwynn </em>were to control our inquiry here, in that it could somehow be read as establishing the broad proposition that an individual who is handcuffed and placed in a patrol car is not in “custody" for any purpose, this Court has clearly taken a contrary position in this opinion today.</p>
