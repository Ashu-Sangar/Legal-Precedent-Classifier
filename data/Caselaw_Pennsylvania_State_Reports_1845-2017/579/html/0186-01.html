Consistent with <em>Pierce, </em>a petitioner must prove the three prongs of appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness, namely, that the claim has arguable merit, that appellate counsel lacked a reasonable basis for his or her chosen course, and that the petitioner was prejudiced thereby, i.e., that there,is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings in which appellate counsel was the attorney of record would have been different. <em><a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">at 1022-23</a>.

Because there are a good many nuances and open issues in this arena, I believe that the Court’s holding is best read in light of the Commonwealth’s expert’s unusual statement to Appellant, during the course of what appears to have been a compelled psychiatric examination,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> to the effect that Appellant retained an ability to withhold his cooperation on a question-by-question basis without penalty. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 198-200, 855 A.2d at 772.

For example, it would not seem fair to state as a general proposition that a post-conviction petitioner who cannot present testimony from counsel who is (or are) unavailable at the post-conviction stage simply cannot prevail, although the petitioner is nevertheless able to establish the arguable merit and prejudice components of his claim, as well as the absence of any reasonable strategy appearing on the face of the record. To the contrary, at least in some cases; the inference of ineffectiveness arising from such circumstances should prevail over the countervailing presumption that counsel’s stewardship was constitutionally adequate, despite the absence of counsel’s testimony, but depending on the strength of the inference. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Grant, </em><a href="/pa/572/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="572 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="716471" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0048-01">572 Pa. 48</a>, 62-63 &amp; nn. 12-13, <a href="/pa/572/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="813 A.2d 726" data-case-ids="716471,9381173" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0048-01,/a2d/813/0726-01">813 A.2d 726</a>, 734-35 &amp; nn. 12-13 (2002). The reality is simply that it is not possible to devise a single approach to these sorts of matters that will fairly accommodate all circumstances—there will remain cases that can and must be decided without the benefit of the testimony <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>of counsel; cases <em>in </em>which the inference of ineffectiveness arising from the record is so weak that it will be incumbent upon the petitioner to present credible testimony of counsel that his actions were bereft of strategy if he is to prevail; and cases in which the inferences are so strong as to overcome the presumption of effectiveness, such that it should be incumbent upon the Commonwealth to present counsel’s testimony as to strategy if it is to prevail.</p>

      <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield </em>involved federal habeas review of a Florida state prisoner’s conviction for sexual battery.

In an attempt to satisfy that burden, the prosecution introduced testimony from two police officers who described post-arrest instances in which the defendant had exercised his right to remain silent and expressed a desire to consult with counsel before answering any questions. Subsequently, in his closing argument, the prosecutor reviewed the officers’ testimony and suggested that the defendant’s refusals to answer questions without consulting counsel showed a degree of comprehension that was inconsistent with his claim of insanity.

The fact that one of the twelve Circuits believes that the rule in <em>Wainwright v.

Indeed, the Majority cites no federal cases in this regard. It may be that the Majority’s omission derives from the very fact that this Court has explicitly recognized that the Pennsylvania constitutional test for counsel ineffectiveness is the same as the federal <em>Strickland </em>test-albeit we further refíne the <em>Strickland </em>performance and prejudice approach into a three-part inquiry into arguable merit and absence of objective reasonable basis (performance component) and prejudice. <em>E.g.

In one instance, a Third Circuit panel inexplicably seized upon the failure of a Superior Court panel to include a citation to any federal case when applying the <em>Strickland/Pierce </em>test as a reason to ignore the Superior Court’s analysis of the ineffectiveness claim and the deferential standard of review required by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. <em>Everett v.

As a matter of clarity and comity, and to facilitate appropriate federal habeas review should it occur, I would make it abundantly plain to our esteemed federal brethren, where the Majority does not, that this Court recognizes that appellant presents his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under federal law and that the test for ineffective assistance of counsel stated and applied today is the same under the Pennsylvania Constitution as it is under the United States Constitution.</p>

        <em>. </em>In this regard, I note that the references to silence here were not used to suggest appellant’s guilt, but rather, only to rebut appellant's evidence of a mental health mitigating circumstance. None of the questions that appellant refused to answer went to the facts of the crime; rather they went only to appellant's mental capacity. It is also notable that here, unlike in a case such as the <em>Thomas </em>case invoked by the Majority, the references were not to “pure silence,” but rather to the fact that, for purposes of the penalty phase mental health defense, appellant was capable of rational reasoning by selectively choosing which questions to respond to and which ones not to respond to.</p>
