In their petitions, Appellees argued that, as horse riders, they were not subject to Pennsylvania’s DUI statute because that statute applies only to persons operating a “vehicle.” <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a). In addition, Appellee Noel contended that Section 3103(a), which, as stated above, purports to subject a person riding an animal upon a roadway to many of the same duties of the Code applicable to a driver of a vehicle, was unconstitutionally vague. <em>See id. </em>at 3103(a). Following a hearing, the trial court granted Appellees’ petitions and dismissed the charges against them. The basis for the court’s decision was two-fold. First, the trial court agreed with Appellees that the term “vehicle,” as used in Section 3731(a)(1), does not encompass in its meaning an animal such as a horse. <em>See id. </em>at 3731(a)(1). Therefore, the court concluded that on its face, Section 3731(a)(1) could not apply to Appellees as they were riding horses and not operating vehicles when they were arrested.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

While the Commonwealth argues that “nothing beyond logic and common sense is required to make the determination” as to whether or not a particular provision in Part III is applicable “by its very nature” to horse-riders, and that, indeed, there is no “statute in Part III which, after its reading, leaves any <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>question in the mind of its reader whether or not the statute applies,” we simply cannot agree.

Although the court noted that the Commonwealth had waived the issue of whether a horse is a vehicle for purposes of the Code for failure to raise the issue in its 1925(b) statement, the court nonetheless proceeded to address the issue.

As the Code does not define “device," the court looked to the word's common definition, which is “a[n] invention or contrivance; any result of design,” <em>see </em>Black's Law Dictionary 462 (7th ed. 1999), and concluded that a horse clearly could not be considered a “device” and therefore is not a “vehicle” for purposes of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(1). Notably, in its brief to this Court, the Commonwealth does not challenge the trial court's conclusion that it had waived the “vehicle" issue below, nor does the Commonwealth clearly challenge the trial court's determination that a horse is, in fact, not a vehicle for purposes of Section 3731(a)(1). <em>See </em>Cmwlth.'s Bf. at 9 (stating that whether or not a horse is a vehicle is <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>“irrelevant” in light of its primary argument regarding constitutionality and applicability of Section 3103(a)).

The Commonwealth attempts to argue that Justice Howe's rationale in his concurring opinion is totally inapplicable to Section 3103(a). In ' support of its argument, the Commonwealth points to two examples cited in Justice Howe’s opinion, the ones relating to noise and lights, and notes that the comparable requirements in Pennsylvania are not, in fact, contained in Part III of the Code and thus, would not be applicable to Pennsylvania horse-riders via Section 3103(a). However, as Appellee Noel counters, this argument “completely ignores the other twelve examples given by Justice Howe which <em>would </em>be covered by Part III,” Appellee Noel’s Bf. at 5 (emphasis added), and therefore does not in any way dilute the underlying reasoning of Justice Howe's opinion.</p>

Appellees' vagueness challenge must fail because it is obvious that the drunk driving provision is not one that “by [its] very nature” cannot apply to horse-riders, we disagree. As an initial matter, we simply do not agree that Section 3103(a) put Appellees on reasonable notice that riding a horse on a roadway while intoxicated would violate the Vehicle Code when, to reach such a conclusion, Appellees would be required to assign a workable meaning to the language of Section 3103(a), and that language is, as made clear above, simply too imprecise to enable them to do so. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3103(a). Indeed, contrary to Justice Saylor's contention, any attempt to apply that language to the DUI provision- only serves as yet another example of how "it is impossible for anyone to determine, even upon thoughtful reflection, which portions of the vehicle code the legislature thought should apply to animals and animal-drawn vehicles and which should not.” <em>See Blowers, 111 </em>P.2d at 1323. Specifically, we reiterate that the DUI provision prohibits driving "while under the influence of alcohol <em>to a degree which rentiers the person incapable of safe driving," </em>and note that it is not at all clear, among other things, that a horse, which unlike a car is not fully controlled by the rider, would allow itself to be "driven” in an unsafe manner. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(l)(emphasis added). Thus, whether or not the DUI provision "by [its] very nature” can be summarily applied to horse-riders is simply not as clear as Justice Saylor suggests.</p>

The answer to the first two is “of course.” At a fire, the offense is not merely driving over hoses—it is driving over hoses without consent of the person regulating traffic. The statute involves regulating traffic away from the firefighting equipment, which makes eminent sense, and the offense is not “by its nature” inapplicable to drivers of animals. Likewise, one is no more allowed to endanger pedestrians by riding a horse on the sidewalk than one is allowed to drive one’s car there, momentarily or otherwise. As for the third hypothetical, the situation remains one of common sense; any ambiguity in this section involves the word “accident,” not its application to equestrians. Whether falling from a horse or a car, if it is on the highway and comprises an accident which results in injury, one must report; if there is no accident or injury, there is no need to report. The rationale for police involvement is no different just because the highway accident involved a horse.</p>

Section 3113 deals with pedestrians, not drivers. Section 3343 describes how specific heavy equipment shall be moved over railroad crossings; a horse is not one of the listed pieces of equipment. Section 3366 deals with contents of speeding citations and § 3368 involves devices with which speed may be timed. The whole of Chapter 35 deals specifically with pedal-cycles, motorcycles,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> and pedestrians; animals “by their very nature” are not pedalcycles, motorcycles, or pedestrians, and not subject to these specially tailored sections.</p>

It is the “rules of the road” that apply to the driver of the mustang and Mustang alike. Here, an ordinary person of common intelligence would know that riding a horse while intoxicated would be a violation of § 3731, just as the same person would recognize that the rider of a horse must stop at a stop sign, ride on the right side of the road, and signal before turning. <em>See Mayfield, </em>at 423 (statute sufficiently definite that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and is not so vague men of common intelligence must guess at its meaning and differ as to its application).</p>

There is an equivalent section to § 3103 for pedalcycles (§ 3501) and motorcycles (§ 3521), each excluding offenses "by their nature” inapplicable to that particular user of the highways.
