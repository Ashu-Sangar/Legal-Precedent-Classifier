Thus, in determining whether an entity is a Commonwealth agency for sovereign immunity purposes, the important factors to be considered are whether the entity was created by the state to perform a state function so that a judgment against it would, in essence, injure the state.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> In contrast, however, as made clear by our decision in <em>T &amp; R Painting Co., </em>these same factors are not essential in determining whether an entity is a Commonwealth agency for jurisdictional purposes. As the Commonwealth Court pointed out many years ago, “[t]he concept of jurisdiction is designed to insure the availability of the most practical and competent forum for the airing of a particular grievance.” <em>Scott v. Shapiro, </em>19 Pa.Cmwlth. 479, <a href="/citations/?q=339%20A.2d%20597" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="339 A.2d 597">339 A.2d 597</a>, 599 (1975). In that regard, as noted above, the Commonwealth Court was created to serve as an original forum for deciding issues of statewide concern that needed to be uniformly decided. <em>See Action Coalition of Elders, </em><a href="/pa/493/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="493 Pa. 302" data-case-ids="8732594" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0302-01">426 A.2d at 566-67</a> (“the legislature of this Commonwealth has clearly recognized the interest of the state in having an expert, specialized tribunal, Commonwealth Court, articulate uniform statewide standards in cases affecting the sovereign”). Thus, <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>when determining whether an entity is a Commonwealth agency for jurisdictional purposes so that cases against it must be originally heard in the Commonwealth Court, the pivotal factors to be looked at are whether the entity operates on a statewide basis and is predominantly controlled by the state. As we explained in <em>T &amp; R Painting Co., </em>where the entity acts throughout the state and under the state’s control, it is clearly meant to be a Commonwealth agency for jurisdictional purposes so that it may be sued in the Commonwealth Court. In contrast, where the entity operates within a single county or municipality and is governed in large part by that county or municipality, the entity must be characterized as a local agency and sued in the trial courts because the trial courts will be more familiar with the issues surrounding the entity’s operations and organizational make-up. Applying this logic to the instant case, it is clear that PHA is a local agency for jurisdictional purposes in spite of the language in Section 1550 and our decision in <em>Marshall, </em>because PHA’s scope of authority is limited to the territorial boundaries of Philadelphia, <em>see </em>35 P.S. § 1543(g), and PHA’s five members are all appointed by the Mayor of Philadelphia, <em>see <a href="/pa/493/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="493 Pa. 302" data-case-ids="8732594" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0302-01">id.</a> </em>§ 1545.</p>

The court reasoned that to be an agency of the Commonwealth, the body must have statewide impact; absent this influence, an entity, even if delineated “an agency of the Commonwealth” by the General Assembly, was merely a local agency. Because the PHA dealt largely with Philadelphia concerns, the court stated it would be “absurd and unreasonable” to require an almost exclusive Philadelphia pool of litigants to travel and litigate its cases in Harrisburg’s Commonwealth Court; “‘[t]he General Assembly, of course, could not have intended such a result.’ ” <em><a href="/pa/466/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="466 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1714986" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0493-01">Id.</a> </em>(citation omitted).</p>
