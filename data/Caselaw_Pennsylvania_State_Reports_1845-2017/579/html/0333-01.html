Greenfield (Greenfield) at 600 North Third Street, in Wormleysburg, hoping to obtain some heroin from him. Another young woman, Brook Broadwater (Broadwater), was with Smith.

Greenfield had sold heroin to Smith on other occasions and was arrested in 1995 for possession of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 124.

Greenfield left with Broadwater, returning to the house approximately 10:45 p.m. <em>Id. </em>at 131. Smith remained in the residence, and when Greenfield awoke around 6:30 a.m., he found Smith still on the floor. <em>Id. </em>at 132.

The plurality acknowledges this issue of contract interpretation but declines to reach it because appellee does not specifically forward it now, although it did argue the issue below. Plurality slip op. at 11-12 n. 6. The question of whether there was a covered "occurrence” under the policy, however, is appellants' lead argument. Appellants go to some length to argue that the decedent's death was a covered occurrence because it was an "accident.” Since the moving party has squarely joined the issue, and appellee prevailed below and therefore is not obliged to forward any claim, I believe this question of contract interpretation has been adequately presented even though appellee has confined itself to defending the more extreme, extra-contractual interpretations accepted by the Superior Court.</p>

This conclusion does not, in my view, improperly or unfairly rewrite the policy to correct the absence of an appropriate exclusion, particularly since it cannot be reasonably maintained that the parties to the insurance contract anticipated that the homeowner’s involvement in the drug overdose death of another would give rise to a covered risk. <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 178(2)(a) (providing that, in weighing the enforcement of a contractual provision in connection with public policy grounds, the parties’ justifiable expectations must be considered). Like the lead, I strongly prefer this <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>rationale to support the result in this case over the attribution of “inferred intent” to Greenfield.

I believe that these jurists were correct in apprehending that, although Appellee’s complaint alleged an intentional act by Greenfield (providing heroin to Smith), in the absence of averments alleging or reasonably implying that Greenfield expected or intended to cause her death, this result should be deemed an accidental occurrence rather than one caused with intention. In my view, this approach best comports with the line of decisions establishing that an insured’s acts are to be deemed intentional only when he aims to cause the resultant damage or harm of the same general type, <em>see United Serv.
