The Legislature, aware of this problem, considered it a matter of statewide concern, finding that it impacted upon persons residing both inside and outside of the affected cities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Thus, the General Assembly enacted the Parking Authority Law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> enabling cities, boroughs, and first class townships to create parking authorities in order to provide, administer, and collect revenue from, various types of parking facilities. <em>See generally </em>53 P.S. § 344 (relating to method of incorporation) (recodified as amended at 53 Pa.C.S. § 5504). Although the statute constituted an enabling act authorizing the specified municipalities to create such authorities by ordinance or resolution, it provided that any parking authority thus created would not be considered a municipal instrumentality, but would instead constitute a “public body corporate and politic, exercising public powers of the Commonwealth as an agency thereof.” 53 P.S. § 345 (relating to purposes and powers) (recodified as <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>amended at 53 Pa.C.S. § 5505).

Const, art. IX, §§ 10,12; 53 Pa.C.S. §§ 8001-8285, and that, like other authorities, they could engage in proprietary or business-type operations from which local governments might otherwise be precluded. <em>See generally SEPTA v.

In 1987, the City extended the life of the Parking Authority to 2037, making its life span coterminous with that of several outstanding bond issues. Initially, the Parking Authority only operated certain off-street parking garages. These operations continue to the present, and are generally carried out through leases with the City. In particular, the City leases to the Parking Authority the land and/or buildings necessary for the latter to operate parking garages and surface lots within the City and at the Philadelphia International Airport (the “Airport”) on land owned by the City. In return, the Parking Authority pays to the City rent derived from the revenues received from these parking operations. This rent has amounted to approximately $21,500,000 per year for the past several years; the vast majority of this money has come from the parking facilities located at the <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>Airport’s terminals, which were built on land owned by the City and financed primarily through bond issues. Because the federal government provided the City with grants to operate the Airport, the City may be required to segregate the monies received from the airport parking facilities into a fund designated for Airport use. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2047107" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="49 U.S.C. § 47107">49 U.S.C. § 47107</a>(b).</p>
    <p id="b726-4" data-blocks='[["BL_726.5",726,[271,613,1157,951]]]'>As amended in 1982, the Parking Authority Law authorized cities to delegate to their parking authorities responsibility for certain on-street parking functions, some of which are revenue-producing (e.g, issuing parking tickets and collecting money from parking meters). Such revenues from on-street functions were required by statute to be distributed back to the municipality as provided by ordinance or resolution. Thus, in 1983, the City passed an ordinance giving the Parking Authority responsibility for much of the City’s on-street parking services, which had previously been handled by multiple departments of the City.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In keeping with the provisions of the ordinance, these responsibilities are fulfilled under an intergovernmental cooperation agreement. From such activities, the Parking Authority collected net revenues of approximately $13,000,000 per year during the past several years. These monies formed a part of the City’s operating budget and were accordingly reported in the City’s five-year plan as revenue to balance the City’s budget.</p>

Some of these bond issues subsume parking service contracts between the City and the Parking Authority which require the City to guarantee the debt servicing of the bonds in the event that the Parking Authority defaults. At the time these contracts were <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>executed, the Parking Authority Law effectively placed the City in a position to control some of the factors which affected its risk, including the composition of the Parking Authority’s governing board.</p>

The City thereafter filed a complaint in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, naming the new appointees as defendants and challenging the validity of the amendments. The City also sought injunctive relief to prevent the new board members from being sworn in. The common pleas court, however, concluded that the Governor was an indispensable party by virtue of his new appointment powers, and that it therefore lacked jurisdiction. Accordingly, by order dated July 10, 2001, the trial court transferred the case to the Commonwealth Court pursuant to Section 5103(a) of the Judicial Code. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5103(a). After holding a hearing, the Commonwealth Court dismissed the matter for lack of jurisdiction,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> prompting the City to seek an emergency stay and the exercise of King’s Bench powers by this Court.

Although increasing the availability of parking spaces in the City helps reduce congestion— and in that sense serves a municipal need—there is a commercial aspect to operating parking facilities that generate a revenue stream, such as surface lots, parking garages, and airport parking facilities. Parking authorities, moreover, are empowered to engage in commercial leasing of the space that they own. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 345(a) (recodified at 53 Pa.C.S. § 5505). As the City’s home rule governance does not include proprietary or business-type functions, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 13133, it is difficult to argue that exercising control over an authority which performs these functions is nonetheless included within such powers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

Notably, the Constitution does not prescribe any particular means that the General Assembly must utilize in constraining home rule powers. Although Section 18 of the Home Rule Act reflects one method of imposing constraints, there is no-reason to suppose that additional limitations may not be imposed by other means, including legislation extrinsic to the Home Rule Act. <em>See generally </em>French, <em>Home Rule in Pennsylvania, </em>81 Dick.

The next sentence in that subsection indicates that fund transfers in subsequent years may only occur to the degree that the Parking Authority deems the money “available” for use by the school district. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.2d%20619" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="69 A.2d 619">id.</a> </em>In light of the preceding sentence, it is evident that the Legislature did not intend for the Parking Authority to consider any monies available for transfer which are needed to meet the authority’s outstanding obligations. <em>See O’Rourke v.

In particular. New Jersey and New York made a statutory covenant with the Port Authority’s prospective creditors that none of the funds reserved to secure repayment of the loans would be used to subsidize rail passenger service.
