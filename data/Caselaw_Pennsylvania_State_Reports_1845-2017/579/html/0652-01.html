Appellees are three homeowners, each of whom owned a separate parcel of residential real property along the banks of Springbrook Creek which was washed away or severely damaged by Gloria’s floodwaters. Appellant PG Energy owned, maintained and operated four permitted water supply dams with attendant reservoirs in the Springbrook Creek watershed, all of which were upstream from appellees’ properties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellees claimed that the negligent design, maintenance and operation of the reservoirs/dams caused their losses, and prevailed in the action in the courts below. The primary issue which this Court accepted for <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>review is what legal duty a water supply reservoir/dam owner has to undertake with respect to its dams in order to protect downstream property owners against floodwaters caused in the aftermath of a storm of the magnitude of Hurricane Gloria.

Appellees claimed that, in addition to creating reservoirs of drinking water essential to the public health and welfare, appellant’s dams were required to be designed, maintained and operated so as to cabin and safely pass on the rain and floodwaters which accompany a storm of the magnitude of Hurricane Gloria. Specifically, appellees alleged that appellant had a duty to design and maintain the dams with greater spillway capacities; that appellant was obliged to “draw down” the level of water in its reservoirs in anticipation of the storm; and that this storm posed a “dam hazard emergency,” as that term is defined by regulation, which obliged appellant to warn downstream homeowners of the danger they faced from flood-waters as the storm intensified. The defense was that the duty of dam safety owed by appellant was confined to ensur-. ing that the dams did not fail as a structural matter and, because these dams successfully passed the increased volume of water without failing structurally, no liability can arise. The courts below, while employing divergent legal theories of <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>negligence liability, each concluded that although appellant’s dams did not fail, appellant violated a duty to construct, maintain and operate them in a fashion that would have protected the downstream homeowners from these floodwaters, and that the homeowners’ losses were the proximate result of that breach of duty.</p>

In conjunction with that program, consulting engineers prepared inspection reports for each of appellant’s four dams between July of 1978 <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>and April of 1980. There is no suggestion in the reports, or elsewhere in the record, that the inspections sought to uncover violations of existing federal or Pennsylvania law and/or standards concerning the construction and maintenance of water supply reservoirs/dams. Rather, the stated purpose of the inspections and reports was to determine if the dams “constitute[d] a hazard to human life or property.” The reports concluded that the Springbrook and Nesbitt dams were in “good” condition, while the Watres dam was in “fair” condition and the Maple Lake dam was in “poor” condition. Maple Lake Dam was rated “unsafe” because its spillway capacity was “seriously inadequate” as it could pass only 42 percent of the Probable Maximum Flood (“PMF”) without overtopping the dam.

Appellant produced evidence that, in response to the reports, it performed maintenance and repair work on the dams which effectively increased spillway capacity, albeit it did not reengineer the dams or spillways or undertake a major reconstruction effort. In addition, at the time when Hurricane Gloria struck, the reservoirs/dams were subject to inspection and regulation by the then-Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (“DER”); the dams were permitted by DER. The trial court found as fact that, between the time of the reports to the Army Corps of Engineers and the arrival of Hurricane Gloria on September 27, 1985, appellant did not substantially improve, increase, modify or change the spillway capacity of any of the facilities.</p>

Appellees introduced expert testimony that the rainfall from the hurricane was so heavy as to exceed fifty (50%) percent of the PMF, which in turn should have exceeded the spillway capacities on the dams. This point was sharply disputed at trial. Appellees’ expert engineer, James Green, used the terms PMF and “100-year storm” interchangeably in discussing the rainfall, then calculated the 100-year storm/flood rainfall figure for Luzerne County as a mere 5.98 inches. Since the rainfall in the Springbrook Creek watershed from Hurricane Gloria exceeded 6.5 inches, Green concluded that the spillways obviously were inadequate to handle the storm. Green further opined that, pursuant to “standards in the engineering community,” dams must be designed to handle a 100-year frequency flood, irrespective of whether they are designed for water supply or flood control. Green also opined that one or more of appellant’s dams <a id="p662" href="#p662" data-label="662" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*662</a>“definitely overtopped” or “flooded” and that the inadequacy of the dam system to handle this storm was the cause of the flood which destroyed appellees’ homes. However, Green did recognize that none of the dams failed structurally and that two of the reservoirs/dams (Watres and Nesbitt) were drawn down to well below capacity when the storm began; thus, the dam system actually protected the downstream homeowners from a significant amount of floodwater which would have passed naturally downstream in the absence of the dams.</p>

The Code definition of PMF focuses upon what amounts to a theoretical but plausible worst case scenario involving the “most severe combination of critical meteorologic and hydrologic conditions that are reasonably possible in an area.” 25 Pa.Code § 105.1. But the Code defines 100-year frequency flood differently: “100-year frequency flood—The flood magnitude expected to be equaled or exceeded on the average of once in 100 years; it may also be expressed as the flood having a 1.0% chance of being equaled or exceeded in a given year.” <em><a href="/pa/545/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="681 A.2d 171" data-case-ids="465011,7859279" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0316-01,/a2d/681/0171-01">Id.</a></em>

According to Forbes, the PMF for Luzerne County is 23.87 inches;. thus, to pass half the PMF, the spillways/dams would have to be able to accommodate over 11 inches of rain in a 24-hour period. Forbes’ testimony was corroborated by appellant’s engineering expert, Gordon Warren. In addition, the engineering reports prepared for the Army Corps of Engineers recognized PMF figures in the 23 inch-plus range for these dams. Since the rainfall from Hurricane Gloria was only 6.5 inches, far less than half of the PMF, appellant’s evidence suggested that the dams were functionally adequate to pass the water discharged by Gloria. In addition, and consistently with this formula, defense witnesses testified that the dams did not overtop.</p>

The panel rejected appellant’s argument that the “safety” concerns addressed by the Act and the accompanying regulatory structure have to do with “the structural integrity of the dam.” In the panel’s view, the safety referred to in the Act. was the security of downstream residents; therefore, appellant “had a duty to warn people downstream of the dangers posed by Hurricane Gloria,” even if that danger was totally unrelated to the prospect of a structural dam failure.

Appellees take an expansive view of the duties that dam-owners owe, as a matter of law, to downstream homeowners. Appellees argue that, from a design standpoint, there is no difference between water supply reservoirs/dams and flood control dams: each must be engineered so as to protect downstream landowners. Thus, even if a dam retains its structural integrity, as these dams did, a dam owner is liable in negligence if the dam is not designed to hold, and/or if it does not in fact hold, waters which might accompany a storm of the magnitude of Hurricane Gloria. Appellees further argue that the harm that these dams could cause by failing to stem the flow of the waters from a storm such as Hurricane Gloria was foreseeable because the engineering reports provided to the Army Corps of Engineers highlighted the inadequacy of the spillway capacities, and yet appellant failed to remedy those deficiencies.</p>

DEP recognizes that a natural condition such as a hurricane could represent a dam emergency, but only if it affected the stability of the dam; a hurricane is not a <em>per se </em>dam emergency.

Although it is true that all dams control flooding if the reservoir created by the dam is not filled to capacity when a storm hits, that fact does not mean that the owner of a water reservoir facility has assumed the duty to become a <em>de facto </em>insurer of downstream property owners against the course of floodwaters generated by forces unrelated to the structural integrity of the dam. The statutory and regulatory framework at issue is directed to the safety and integrity of these man-made facilities themselves—which, in turn, ensures that they do not cause extraordinary harm to downstream homeowners through structural failure. That such is the purpose of the legislation is apparent from its plain language. Dam owners are duty-bound to monitor, operate and maintain the facility in a safe condition. 32 P.S. § 691.13(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). Their duty to notify and to “take all necessary actions to protect life and property” likewise is tied into situations where a condition arises “which threatens the safety of the facility.” <em><a href="/pa/573/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="821 A.2d 1215" data-case-ids="197180,9141041" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0090-01,/a2d/821/1215-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 693.13(a)(3) (emphasis supplied). The regulatory definition of “dam hazard emergency” is equally explicit: although the triggering condition may be external to the dam (“condition of the dam and appurtenant works or extraordinary natural conditions ... including, but not limited to, flood, earthquake, fire and ice jam”), it must be one which thereby “affect[s] the safety and stability of the dam.” 25 Pa.Code § 105.135 (emphasis supplied).</p>

Indeed, Superior Court went so extraordinarily far as to find that, “Appellant’s duty to warn downstream property owners is triggered by any event which threatens life, health, property or the environment, regardless of whether the integrity of the dam is implicated.” 765 A.2d at 304. In forwarding this <a id="p677" href="#p677" data-label="677" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*677</a>broad construction of appellant’s duty, Superior Court focused upon the Act’s general definitional section which defines “safety” as meaning “[sjecurity from the risk or threat of significant loss of injury to life, health, property and the environment.” 32 P.S. § 693.3. However, the panel overlooked the fact that that definitional section begins with the caveat that this particular “meaning” of the term applies “unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.” <em>Id. </em>The context of the governing provisions at issue here speaks not to the integrity of downstream homeowners and their property, but explicitly to “the safety of the facility/dam.” Of course, a natural byproduct of the dams remaining structurally sound is that the persons and property of downstream homeowners are protected as well. But, that is a far cry from finding a legislative intent to impose a statutory duty upon dam owners not only to protect downstream property owners against foreseeable dangers resulting from dam failure, but also to take protective actions against “any event which threatens life, health, property or the environment.” The Act may fairly be said to impose a duty upon dam owners to protect the public from foreseeable harms that would result from the failure of the facility—irrespective of what might occasion that danger of failure. To read into the narrow and specific provisions of the Act some greater duty to take affirmative action to protect against dangers arising from some other agency, however, is unwarranted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

The regulatory structure understandably distinguishes between facilities depending upon their size and volume and their prospective danger to the public, and modulates the level of obligation accordingly. For example, the riskier the dam is in the event of failure, the greater is the regulatory requirement regarding spillways. It is obvious both from the testimony below and as <a id="p678" href="#p678" data-label="678" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*678</a>a matter of common sense that the primary safety purpose of a spillway is to protect the integrity of the dam structure. If the volume and speed of water entering a reservoir were to exceed the capacity of the spillway to modulate the volume of water in the reservoir, and then to a point where the dam itself exceeded its capacity, there is a risk of overtopping and concomitant erosion, leakage, or bursting. If a dam leaks or bursts due to negligent design, maintenance or operation, the resulting direct damage to downstream homeowners is not due to an Act of God, but to the sudden release of that which man determined to artificially store and concentrate. By undertaking to change the natural pooling and dispersal along the waterway, the dam’s owner necessarily assumes a duty respecting the integrity of the dam. But, the owner does not thereby undertake to insure all downstream homeowners against the prospect of floods having nothing to do with the integrity of the dam, and the legislation does not oblige him to do so.</p>

Appellees make much of the fact that the engineering reports provided to the Army Corps of Engineers highlighted the deficiency in the capacity of the spillways of these dams to disperse floodwaters from the most severe probable storm. Appellant aptly rejoins, however, that if larger spillways of greater discharge capacity had passed on more water into the watershed than these did, the danger to appellees would have increased. In short, the primary danger which a greater spillway capacity guards against during the course of a storm is the failure of the dam—which is the single most catastrophic event at issue, and the event with which the Army Corps was concerned. But, at least in an instance where a dam does not fail, as was the case here, a greater spillway capacity and discharge would have presented a greater danger of flooding to downstream homeowners.</p>

It was undisputed that appellant’s dams did not fail: they did not burst or leak and, indeed, to the extent that two of the reservoirs were well below capacity at the time the storm was raging (in a period when the region had been in the midst of a drought), those reservoirs acted unintentionally as flood control facilities and thereby protected downstream homeowners • from a certain amount of Gloria’s waters.

Next, I agree that PG Energy (Appellant) had no duty to draw down the water in the reservoirs prior to the onslaught from Hurricane Gloria. This was not a flood-control dam, but a water supply reservoir and there is no support for an argument that every dam owner has a duty to institute flood control measures in times of heavy precipitation. Finally, I also agree that the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act, Act of November 26, 1978, P.L. 1375, <em>as amended, </em>32 P.S. §§ 693.1 to 693.27, is focused primarily on mechanisms for maintaining the integrity of the dam. Of course, by maintain<a id="p681" href="#p681" data-label="681" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*681</a>ing the integrity of the dam, the downstream watershed is protected from the flooding waters contained within the dam, but not additional waters. I write separately because, I believe that Appellant assumed a duty to warn when it drafted and adopted its “Emergency Warning System and Operation Plans, Spring Brook Intake” in 1982, and that it should have implemented this plan on September 27,1985.</p>
    <p id="b809-4" data-blocks='[["BL_809.5",809,[139,653,1155,1050]]]'>Initially, I am troubled by the fact that the potential for a dam hazard is being assessed after the conclusion of the event rather than before or during the event. The Majority Opinion, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), and Appellant all stress that the dams did not fail, did not burst or leak, and held back the floodwaters to the maximum of their capacities. This post-event perspective is not the appropriate timeframe in which to assess whether an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) should be implemented. Implementation of the EAP should have focused on the contents of the plan and whether a reasonable person would have deemed conditions existing to call for its implementation. Although a hurricane is not a <em>per se </em>hazard, it can pose a dam safety hazard if the storm has force and intensity. I believe that Hurricane Gloria, with its torrential rains and flooding, had the potential to threaten dam stability and that, regardless of an after-the-fact assessment that says nothing happened, it is the <em>potential threat </em>that triggers the implementation of the Emergency Action Plan. In the instant matter, I believe that a potential threat existed.</p>
    <p id="b809-5" data-blocks='[["BL_809.6",809,[140,1733,1154,365]]]'>Even the Majority acknowledges the importance of adequate spillway design, particularly where the spillways are marginal or meet only the minimum specifications. The Majority inexplicably recognizes the danger to a dam when flooding conditions exist, only to conclude that because nothing happened, implementation of the EAP was unnecessary. The Majority states:</p>

If a dam leaks or bursts due to negligent design, maintenance or operation, the resulting direct damage to downstream homeowners is not due to an Act of God, but to the sudden release of that which man determined to artificially store and concentrate.</blockquote>

The Majority continues that, “In short, the primary danger which a greater spillway capacity guards against during the course of a storm is the failure of the dam—which is the single most catastrophic event at issue, and the event with which the Army Corps was concerned.” (Op. at 678-79, 858 A.2d at 605.) I believe that Hurricane Gloria presented just this potential scenario in at least the early hours of the storm and that Appellant should have activated its plan and warned downstream residents that flooding was possible.</p>
    <p id="b810-6" data-blocks='[["BL_810.6",810,[261,1254,1175,1058]]]'>A review of the provisions of the EAP for Spring Brook demonstrates that the EAP should have been implemented. Specifically, the EAP ties a dam hazard emergency to the level of the water passing through the spillway. The initial action in the event of heavy precipitation is the dispatch of the caretaker to observe and report on reservoir levels. The EAP indicates that dam surveillance will be maintained on a twenty-four-hour basis until a company officer declares that the event has concluded. Appellant never monitored the spillway discharge at the specified locations and, without continuous .surveillance, Appellant was without information as to the safety and stability of the dam. The EAP states that a moderate danger of dam failure occurs when the spillway discharge is at 50% of capacity or rapidly approaching 50%. It notes that, “at 50% of spillway capacity, the reservoir level' is at 6.8 feet over the spillway crest or 3.7 feet below the top of the dam.” (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 865a.) At this point, the plan calls for assessment of the risk of dam failure by Appellant’s employees and preparations for possible evacuation of the downstream watershed.</p>

      <a id="p683" href="#p683" data-label="683" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*683</a>The next category of dam hazard is titled “Increasing Danger.” Increasing danger exists at 75% of spillway capacity, with the forecast for continued heavy rainfall. At 75% of spillway capacity, the reservoir level is at 8.3 feet above the spillway crest or 1.7 feet below the top of the dam. At this point, evacuation procedures are implemented. The actual passage reads:</p>

    <p id="b811-9" data-blocks='[["BL_811.10",811,[136,1489,1159,845]]]'>(R.R. at 869a). It is not disputed that the spillway discharge reached at least 75% of capacity, if not 100%, while there was still heavy rain. Although there is no recognized duty to warn in Pennsylvania, I have concluded that a duty to warn was voluntarily assumed in this case, even though not statutorily imposed, when PG Energy drafted its EAP. Appellant, when it specified a series of alerts based on the level of spillway discharge, was the one entity in the best position to know how much rainfall and what circumstances would result in downstream flooding. .However, because I do not believe that the failure to warn was the proximate cause of Appellees’ property loss,' I agree with the Majority that Appellant was not liable for the damage to the property of Appellees. The extent of the flooding was so great from the torrential downpours that warnings given by Appellant would not have averted the damage suffered by Appellees.</p>
    <p id="b812-4" data-blocks='[["BL_812.4",812,[289,284,1153,1203]]]'>
      <a id="p684" href="#p684" data-label="684" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*684</a>The occurrence of a major storm event will cause a dam to overtop because, due to the limitations of its spillway, the level of the water within the impound area will rise at a rate greater than the dam’s capacity to pass that water over that spillway. Further, the corresponding pressure of a colossal volume of water threatens the very stability of the dam. We forever remember that the unique risks posed by dam structures, in combination with torrential rains, produced the devastating failure of an earthen dam on South Fork Creek outside of Johnstown, Pennsylvania on May 31, 1889. The resulting torrent swept away more than two thousand lives. Although the area had often flooded, the dam had always held. While we have designed many of our modern methods to ensure that there is no repeat performance of this tragedy, this goal is entirely dependent on the quality of construction, frequency of inspections, promptness of repair, and the presence and proper implementation of emergency action plans. Failure of any one of these poses an unnecessary and unacceptable risk to a downstream watershed. Therefore, I believe that Appellant, pursuant to the specific provisions of the Emergency Action Plan that it drafted, assumed a duty to warn those downstream when water levels triggered the actions mandated by that plan.</p>
