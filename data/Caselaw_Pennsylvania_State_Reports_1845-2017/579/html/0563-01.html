As a result of complications from birth, Daniel suffers from neurological impairment affecting his mental and physical condition. In 1994, Mr. and Mrs. Hilkmann divorced and, pursuant to an agreement that was incorporated into a Dallas County, Texas, divorce decree, Mrs. Hilkmann received primary legal and physical custody of the children. Shortly thereafter, and with the consent of Mr. Hilkmann, Mrs. Hilkmann and the children moved to Israel. Once there, Mrs. Hilkmann enrolled Daniel in a school for students with learning impairments. According to the parties, Daniel is presently a citizen of both Israel and the United States.</p>

Mrs. Hilkmann filed an application for guardianship in the Court of Family <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>Affairs, Tel Aviv, averring that she was Daniel’s sole care giver, and citing as a basis, Daniel’s medical-mental condition and the school’s requirements. In addition, the application included a letter reflecting an opinion from Daniel’s physician in Israel concerning Daniel’s organic impairment and related developmental difficulties. In accordance with Israeli law, the social welfare division within the Office of Attorney General for the State of Israel reviewed the application and, under advisement of a family court judge, Mrs. Hilkmann was granted the status of temporary guardian. The court, however, directed Mrs. Hilkmann to provide additional medical evidence concerning Daniel’s ability to participate in the proceedings and express his opinion about the guardianship, and to serve a copy of the' application upon Mr. Hilkmann, as an interested person. Neither the guardianship application nor notice of the proceedings was provided, at this juncture, to Daniel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Upon receiving such materials, Mr. Hilkmann consulted with counsel in Israel, but did not otherwise respond. Mrs. Hilkmann also supplied the court with an opinion letter from Daniel’s pediatrician, stating that, based on his own assessment and the opinions of other physicians that had been brought to his attention, “[Daniel] is incapable of expressing an opinion regarding his mother’s petition, due to his limited cognitive ability which disqualifies him from weighing and judging the situation.”</p>

Daniel became upset, in particular, that the application contained an averment to the effect that he suffered from mild mental retardation. Upon returning to Israel, Daniel confronted Mrs. Hilkmann, and, as a result, she arranged for Daniel to meet with her attorney and consult with <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>a psychologist. Meanwhile, having received no response from Mr. Hilkmann and in light of the medical evidence, the Israeli Attorney General recommended that Mrs. Hilkmann be appointed guardian, again, noting the purpose of the application (to enable her to authorize educational enrollment and/or curriculum). On January 31, 2000, the Israeli family court issued an order permanently naming her guardian.</p>
    <p id="b695-5" data-blocks='[["BL_695.5",695,[141,668,1161,894]]]'>In February of 2000, Mr. Hilkmann sent a letter to the Israeli Attorney General objecting, <em>inter alia, </em>to the award of a guardianship without input from Daniel, and opposing any guardianship that would impede Daniel’s visitations with Mr. Hilkmann in the United States. In response, the Attorney General recommended that the court reopen the guardianship proceedings and conduct a hearing with Mr. Hilkmann and Daniel in attendance, and allow Mrs. Hilkmann the opportunity to present any additional psychiatric evidence. Initially, the court scheduled a hearing, but a few days later rescinded the order, noting that the hearing was mistakenly scheduled, as Mrs. Hilkmann already held the status of permanent guardian. Nevertheless, the court directed a social services officer to prepare a report to ascertain Daniel’s position concerning the guardianship and detail his relationship with his mother. At the time, however, Daniel and his sister were visiting Mr. Hilkmann in Pittsburgh.</p>

The characterization of the matter as one involving custody apparently arose, in the first in<a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>stance, from a mistake in the translation of the guardianship judgment. Although the pleadings were never amended, Mrs. Hilkmann has since acknowledged the facial inapplicability of the UCCJA to Daniel’s circumstances, since he is over eighteen years of age, and has suggested that her petition should be deemed to rest on the portions of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 101-8815 (the “Probate Code”), dealing with incompetents, <em>see </em>20 Pa.C.S. §§ 5101-5537, and foreign fiduciaries, <em>see </em>20 Pa.C.S. §§ 4101-4121, and the portions of the Judicial Code granting Pennsylvania courts jurisdiction to determine the legal status of parties to the greatest extent permitted by the United States Constitution. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5307; <em>see generally Shaffer v.

Mr. Hilkmann challenged the common pleas court’s jurisdiction, particularly on the state of the pleadings before the court, and took the position that any procedure short of adherence to the full and formal protocol for implementing a Pennsylvania guardianship under the Probate Code would result in a denial, to Daniel, of due process of law, as well as violate Pennsylvania public policy.</p>
    <p id="b696-5" data-blocks='[["BL_696.5",696,[275,1412,1153,631]]]'>At an initial hearing on Mrs. Hilkmann’s petition, she testified to the circumstances surrounding the Israeli guardianship proceedings, acknowledging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Daniel did not receive formal notice, was not invited to participate, and did not participate. In addition, the common pleas court received a memorandum from an attorney versed in Israeli law concerning the guardianship proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> After Mrs. Hilkmann’s testimony, the common pleas court adjourned the hearing (apparently due to scheduling conflicts),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and issued an order directing the parties to file briefs concerning the enforceability, in Pennsylvania, of an Israeli guardianship judgment.</p>

      <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>After briefing and argument, the common pleas court entered an order granting Mrs. Hilkmann’s petition and appointing her “guardian of the person and estate of her son Daniel Hilkmann, within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” In its subsequent opinion, the common pleas court deemed the relevant law to require that comity be afforded to the Israeli order, in the absence of some indicia of taint by fraud or prejudice, unless the court’s sense of justice would be offended, and unless giving effect to the judgment would contravene Pennsylvania law or public policy. <em>See Hilkmann v. Hilkmann, </em>No. 3852 of 2001, <em>slip op. </em>at 2-3 (C.P. Allegheny June 18, 2002).

The court then indicated that Mr. Hilkmann and Daniel were afforded notice and an opportunity to participate in the Israeli guardianship proceeding, which also comports only in part with the record presented, since nothing suggests that Daniel was in fact invited to participate. Although the court recognized differences between the guardianship procedures applied in Israel and those controlling in this Commonwealth, it found such differences of little relevance to its decision. <em>See Hilkmann, slip op. </em>at 3 (“Just because the Israeli guardianship procedure differs from that which is prescribed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, does not render its process violative of one’s due process rights.”). The court then focused on Mr. Hilkmann’s failure to contest the guardianship (other than by his February, 2000, letter, which the court characterized as a cursory effort). Again apparently based on its mistaken belief that a hearing on the permanent guardianship remained pending in Israel,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the common pleas court indicated that such proceeding <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>had been thwarted by Mr. Hilkmann’s refusal to permit Daniel to return to Israel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The court also stated that Mrs. Hilkmann pursued the Israeli guardianship in good faith and noted that she had permitted Daniel’s trip to the United States to visit Mr. Hilkmann, because she trusted that Mr. Hilkmann would permit Daniel to return to Israel. Since it held Mr. Hilkmann responsible for Daniel’s failure to return to Israel, the common pleas, court indicated that he could not now complain of the invalidity of an order obtained through a process in which he deliberately refused participation. Therefore, the court concluded that Mr. Hilkmann’s remedy remained with the Israeli court, in which exclusive jurisdiction for continuing litigation must lie. In addition, the court referenced the doctrines of <em>lis alibi pendens </em>(a suit proceeding elsewhere) and <em>auter action pendant </em>(another action pending). <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="192 A.2d 737">id.</a> </em>at 4 (citing <em>Davis Cookie Co. v.

Although agreeing, in the first instance, with the common pleas court’s determination that it had jurisdiction to consider enforcement of the Israeli order based upon principles of comity,' the Superior Court nonetheless concluded that the order, as enforced, violated Pennsylvania public policy and the court’s sense of justice. <em>See <a href="/a2d/816/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="816 A.2d 242" data-case-ids="9365809" data-case-paths="/a2d/816/0242-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/816/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="816 A.2d 242" data-case-ids="9365809" data-case-paths="/a2d/816/0242-01">at 246-47</a>. In this regard, the court reasoned that the Israeli guardianship procedure differed materially from prevailing Pennsylvania procedure, in that the Israeli court was not presented with neurological, psychological, or similar evidence regarding Daniel’s <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>mental capacity, but instead, its order hinged on a brief, written opinion of Daniel’s pediatrician; Daniel was not advised of the guardianship petition until six months after it was filed, after the entry of a temporary guardianship, and but a few weeks before the award of a permanent guardianship; and his interests went unrepresented at the proceedings. <em>See <a href="/a2d/816/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="816 A.2d 242" data-case-ids="9365809" data-case-paths="/a2d/816/0242-01">id.</a> </em>More generally, the Superior Court expressed the concern that the common pleas court’s approach of overlooking substantial differences between Pennsylvania and Israeli procedure would allow any foreign citizen to enforce a guardianship decree and commensurate finding of incompetence, regardless of the manner in which it was issued. <em>See <a href="/a2d/816/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="816 A.2d 242" data-case-ids="9365809" data-case-paths="/a2d/816/0242-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/816/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="816 A.2d 242" data-case-ids="9365809" data-case-paths="/a2d/816/0242-01">at 247</a>.</p>

Mrs. Hilkmann describes common law precepts treating guardianship law as local in character as antiquated and isolationistic, their underlying policies being undermined by modern communications, global travel, and the worldwide availability of high-quality mental health care. Further, she argues that restraints on the portability of guardianships would lead to overlapping litigation, conflicting adjudications between courts of different states and nations, wasted judicial resources, and instability in the lives of incapacitated persons. While Mrs. Hilkmann recognizes that cases decided under the UCCJA are not controlling, she asserts that the principles underlying the UCCJA are equally applicable in guardianship cases, in that both children and wards are at risk of the same sorts of aggressive forum-shopping tactics (including parental kidnapping) that were frequent aspects of interstate and international custody litigation before the UCCJA’s enactment. Mrs. Hilkmann emphasizes similarities between the Israeli and Pennsylvania guardianship procedures, her compliance with the Israeli law and procedure, and the actual notice that Daniel received (via his father, in the first instance) prior to the entry of the final, Israeli guardianship order.</p>

Furthermore, Mr. Hilkmann disagrees with Mrs. Hilkmann’s characterizations concerning Daniel’s mental and physical condition, which he describes as a modest learning disability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Mr. Hilkmann complains that there was never any clear assertion of the basis of jurisdiction of the common pleas court, noting that there simply is no Pennsylvania statute or other form of jurisdictional grant empowering a court of common pleas to enforce a guardianship decree of a foreign state or nation. Particularly because the common pleas court ultimately appointed Mrs. Hilkmann as guardian, Mr. Hilkmann asserts that the court’s jurisdiction, as well as other aspects of the regularity of the proceedings, must be tested by the requirements of the statutory framework authorizing the appointment of a guardian of an incapacitated person, 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 5511-5518. Employing those requirements, Mr. Hilkmann indicates that the common pleas court lacked jurisdiction, because: 1) Daniel was not made a party to the Pennsylvania proceedings; 2) Daniel was never given the notice required by statute, <em>see </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 5511;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

      <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>was decided in the context of a case in which the estate against which the foreign adoption decree was to be enforced was that of a person who had invoked the foreign judicial process to obtain the decree. <em>See id. </em>at 423-24, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="192 A.2d 737">192 A.2d at 739</a>.

Therefore, at least in circumstances such as are presented here, where those against whom the foreign judgment is sought to be enforced did not invoke the foreign judicial process that culminated in the judgment, Pennsylvania law remains open to application of the more prudential formulation of comity. <em>See generally </em>30 Am.Jur.2d, Executions and Enforcement of Judgments § 779 (2003) (“Comity as applied to judgments entered by courts of a foreign nation is a discretionary doctrine and may be granted or withheld depending on the facts, laws, and policies presented in a particular case.”).</p>

This is particularly the case where, as here, the transfer of the guardianship judgment is sought for the purpose of physically removing a United States citizen from his present domicile, which obviously implicates substantial public policy concerns. Indeed, in light of the interests at stake, a number of other jurisdictions have undertaken to codify specialized procedural and substantive rules for the transfer of guardianship judgments, and the National College of Probate Judges and the National Center for State Courts have proposed uniform <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>standards. <em>See </em>Commission on National Probate Court Standards and Advisory Committee on Interstate Guardianships, National Probate Standards (“NPS”). Standards 3.5.3 through 3.5.5 of the National Probate Standards contemplate a scheme requiring: affirmative approval and action on the part of the exporting court, <em>see </em>NPS 3.5.4, commentary (noting that “a probate court should recognize and accept the terms of a foreign guardianship that <em>has been transferred with the approval of the exporting court </em>” (emphasis added)); a full and fair opportunity for the ward and all other interested persons to be heard concerning objections in the transferee court, <em>see </em>NPS 3.5.4; substantial involvement on the part of the transferee court in terms of the local administration of the guardianship, <em>see <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="192 A.2d 737">id.,</a> </em>NPS 3.5.5; and an emphasis on the “best possible treatment of the ward according to his or her best interests.” <em>See </em>NPS 3.5.3, commentary.

The pleading and notice defects were exacerbated by the common pleas court’s failure to conduct a full and fair evidentiary hearing. Moreover, Mrs. Hilkmann’s evidence establishes that the guardianship at issue was requested of the Israeli courts for the express purpose of obtaining authorization for school enrollment and curriculum approval—there is no evidence on this record that the Israeli court was put on notice of her present intent to utilize the guardianship to remove Daniel from his current and perhaps chosen domicile. Since the Israeli court has apparently neither considered nor made a determination concerning Daniel’s best interests in this regard, or approved the transfer or extra-national recognition and enforcement of the guardianship judgment for the purpose for which Mrs. Hilkmann seeks to rely on it in Pennsylvania, the common pleas court erred in giving effect to the order, particularly in the ■ absence of some attendant determination on a full and fair hearing concerning Daniel’s present status and best interests.

I begin by noting my agreement with much of the Majority Opinion—indeed, the entirety of the Opinion up until the point where the Majority speaks of “the procedural requirements for obtaining recognition and enforcement of an extra-national judgment.” Op. at 578, 858 A.2d at 68. Prior to that point, the Majority thoroughly sets forth the background of this action, the sensitive issues posed, and the complexity in this area of law which is exacerbated by the fact that there is, at present, no specific Pennsylvania statutory procedure devoted to the transfer and recognition of an extra-national guardianship judgment. As the Majority notes, other jurisdictions have “undertaken to codify specialized procedural and substantive rules for the transfer of guardianship judgments, and the National College of Probate Judges and the National Center for State Courts have proposed uniform standards.” <em>Id. </em>Unfortunately, neither the Pennsylvania General Assembly, nor this Court, has undertaken to address this distinct circumstance. This type of situation presents a rather daunting challenge for a litigant seeking enforcement of a foreign guardianship judgment, <em>i.e., </em>trying to predict exactly what will be required of her by Pennsylvania courts as a substantive and a procedural matter. And, of course, it presents a challenge for this Court as well, which <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>not only must attempt to decide this case in a manner which will “ensure that justice is done,” <em>In re Christoff's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/411/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="411 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1885974" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0419-01">411 Pa. 419</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="192 A.2d 737">192 A.2d 737</a>, 739 (1963), but must also attempt to formulate some sort of clear procedure for the benefit of the bench and bar in future cases of this ilk.</p>

Thus, the Majority not only details the procedural deficiencies it perceives in the way appellant went about seeking a comity-based recognition of her Israeli judgment here, but also suggests a set of procedural requirements which it states would be “the most straightforward course for a foreign guardian seeking comity in Pennsylvania.” Op. at 580, 858 A.2d at 69. The latter “course” requires that a foreign guardian do three things in addition to securing the relevant foreign judgment. First, the guardian must seek the issuing court’s approval for the extra-territorial extension or transfer of authority as guardian. Next, the foreign guardian must implicate the Pennsylvania judicial process, under the Probate Code’s guardianship provisions, complying with all procedural processes, including due process. Finally, the guardian must then go before the Court of Common Pleas for recognition of the foreign court decree in the context of a Pennsylvania guardianship proceeding in “the first instance.” <em>See </em>Op. at 578-80, 858 A.2d at 68. This framework is significantly more burdensome and stringent than what would be commanded by general principles of comity alone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Appellant is afforded no opportunity to attempt to satisfy this set of procedural rules.</p>

Faced with the absence of any particularized framework for litigation of an action such as this, the Majority ultimately concludes that the Israeli guard<a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>ianship order must be ignored, not because it is not entitled to comity in its own right, but because appellant failed to navigate what the Majority’s own thorough analysis reveals to be rather perilous and unpredictable waters in Pennsylvania procedural law. Thus, the Majority finds that appellant “failed to invoke the appropriate statutory framework for entry of a guardianship order in the first instance” in Pennsylvania, and therefore,-“the case never progressed to a posture in which the merits could be properly considered.” Op. at 579, 858 A.2d at 68. As a result, the Majority concludes that it cannot enforce the Israeli guardianship ruling “for the purpose intended by [appellant] without the affordance of additional procedure and the making of relevant substantive determinations concerning disputed issues.” One such deficiency identified by the Majority is the fact that the court below (through no fault of appellant) failed to make a “determination on a full and fair hearing concerning Daniel’s present status and best interests.” <em>Id. </em>at 580-81, 858 A.2d at 68.

Not having had any reason to believe initially that such would be required of her, appellant will not be able to make the showing that would be required of her to secure an order of guardianship in the “first instance” under the Probate Code, for such is not what she was seeking. Instead, appellant only sought a comity-based recognition of, and deferral to, the guardianship judgment she already had in hand and had secured, so far as we can tell, in full compliance with Israeli legal requirements. The Majority’s answer to the plea actually forwarded by appellant, indirect but unmistakable, is that Pennsylvania will simply not entertain such requests.</p>
    <p id="b715-4" data-blocks='[["BL_715.5",715,[144,968,1158,1173]]]'>I think a better approach is that adopted by the Superior Court: <em>i.e., </em>to recognize jurisdiction to entertain appellant’s comity-based request on its own terms, and to evaluate the merits of the accompanying due process issue (raised by appellee) under settled substantive principles of comity law. But to dismiss appellant’s action on procedural grounds, as the Majority does, punishes her both: (1) for the fact that Pennsylvania law does not currently provide a clear method and procedure whereby a party in possession of a presumptively valid foreign guardianship order may seek in good faith to have that order enforced in Pennsylvania; and (2) for failing to predict the procedural course this Court would decide is “most straightforward” in the absence of a specifically governing course. Furthermore, proceeding to an evaluation of the merits avoids the irony of this Court essentially avoiding a sensitive substantive question which would involve our assessment of whether a foreign jurisdiction’s judicial proceedings comport with our own notions of due process, by holding that the foreign party will have no meaningful day or process in Pennsylvania because this Commonwealth’s approach is so uncertain and byzantine that the party could not possibly have guessed how to proceed.</p>

    <blockquote id="b716-4" data-blocks='[["BL_716.5",716,[329,409,1113,629]]]'>Comity is a recognition which one nation extends within its own territory to the legislative, executive, or judicial acts of another. It is not a rule of law, but one of practice, convenience, and expediency. Although more than mere courtesy and accommodation, comity does not achieve the force of an imperative or an obligation. Rather, it is a nation’s expression of understanding which demonstrates due regard both to international duty and convenience and to the rights of persons protected by its own laws. Comity should be withheld only when its acceptance would be contrary or prejudicial to the interest of the nation called upon to give it effect.</blockquote>

The framework is also more stringent than the specific statutory framework for applying foreign custody orders in Pennsylvania under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5341-5366 (the "UCCJA”), which arguably involves the same public policy concerns. The UCCJA allows enforcement and recognition of international custody orders as long as there is reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 5365.</p>

It is not clear whether the Majority is ruling against appellant entirely upon grounds of procedural deficiency or upon a combination of procedural and substantive grounds. The uncertainty arises from the fact that the Majority, apparently in order to disavow the Superior Court's review of the public policy question, opines that the foreign determination is inadequate on the current state of the record, which suggests a merits ruling. Op. at 578-81, 858 A.2d at 68. But, that observation is accompanied by the denial of an opportunity for appellant to make the required showing, as well as the purely procedural analyses which preceded this commentary. Since appellant is assessed one hundred percent of the retroactive blame for the procedural deficiencies identified by the Majority, with no opportunity to address the deficiencies, the disposition here must be deemed procedural.</p>
