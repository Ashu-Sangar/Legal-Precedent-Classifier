For the following reasons, we conclude that the court erred insofar as it found that the Township’s taxation of receipts generated from Northwood’s out-of-state work did not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, and therefore reverse that portion of the Commonwealth Court decision. In all other respects, we affirm.</p>

The amount of the BPT is 3.5 mills (.0035) on the gross receipts of the business, subject to certain specified exclusions, including an exclusion for gross receipts on which a “business privilege tax or similar tax has been imposed by another political subdivision by reason of the performance of the service or conducting the business in that <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>political subdivision.” <em>Id. </em>§ 1.02(f)(4) (the “Exclusionary Provision”).</p>

In those returns, Northwood reported as taxable gross receipts that portion of its gross receipts that were attributable to its business activity in the Township. It also paid a BPT in connection with its 1995 and 1996 returns, but it made no BPT payment in 1997 and 1998, asserting that it was due a refund for overpayments of the BPT in prior years. Specifically, Northwood claimed that in 1995 and 1996, the Township had erroneously imposed a BPT on (1) gross receipts from certain in-state activities outside of the Township that the Township could not tax, as well as (2) 100% of the gross receipts derived from out-of-state activities. The Township, however, not only denied Northwood’s refund claims, but also took the position that Northwood had <em>underpaid </em>the BPT in all four years at issue and demanded an additional BPT payment of $257,579.52 plus interest and penalties.</p>
    <p id="b595-5" data-blocks='[["BL_595.6",595,[159,1316,1157,684]]]'>To resolve this dispute, Northwood filed a civil action in the trial court, seeking to recover the BPT it claimed to have overpaid. The Township, in turn, filed a counterclaim, asking the trial court to award it the $257,579.52 that it claimed Northwood still owed for the tax years in question. North-wood and the Township subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In conjunction with those motions, the parties filed two stipulations of facts and also certified that there were no material facts in dispute and that their dispute could therefore be resolved as a matter of law. After oral argument, the trial court denied Northwood’s motion and granted the Township’s motion, awarding the Township the $257,579.52 plus penalties and interest that it had requested.</p>

As the court explained, the plain <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>language of the Ordinance provides that the Township will impose the BPT on any entity “engaging in a business ... in the Township,” Ordinance § 104, and states that the Township will calculate the BPT on the entity’s gross receipts, which it defines as “cash, credits, property of any kind or nature, received or allocable or attributable to any business” of the entity. <em><a href="/a2d/802/1269-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="802 A.2d 1269" data-case-ids="9406991" data-case-paths="/a2d/802/1269-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 102(f). While Northwood contended that these two Ordinance provisions together convey that only the gross receipts <em>generated from business in the Tmmship </em>are subject to the BPT, the court disagreed, emphasizing that the Ordinance’s definition of gross receipts subject to the BPT is not so limited, but rather provides for the taxation of income “attributable to <em>any </em>business” of the taxed entity. <em><a href="/a2d/802/1269-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="802 A.2d 1269" data-case-ids="9406991" data-case-paths="/a2d/802/1269-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis added).</p>

Moreover, it noted that the Township’s Ordinance <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>contains no <em>bona fide </em>office provision and thus, no such limitation applies in the instant case. <em>Northwood Construction Co., </em><a href="/a2d/802/1269-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="802 A.2d 1269" data-case-ids="9406991" data-case-paths="/a2d/802/1269-01">802 A.2d at 1278</a> (“[T]he Pittsburgh ordinance [at issue in Gilberti] and the Pittsburgh regulations, which contain provisions dealing with <em>bona fide </em>offices, are not relevant here.”). The court reiterated that the Ordinance provides that the Township will not tax receipts for which a BPT is paid to another political subdivision, Ordinance § 1.02(f)(4) (no taxation of receipts for which a “business privilege tax or similar tax has been imposed by another political subdivision”), and noted that, in certain instances, this could exempt receipts that were generated from a taxpayer’s <em>bona fide </em>office outside the Township. However, the court made clear that there was no basis on which Northwood could argue that the Ordinance prohibits the taxation of <em>all </em>receipts generated from <em>bona fide </em>offices outside the Township in the absence of a <em>Gilberti-style bona fide </em>office provision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Indeed, having a place of business within the City enables the taxpayer to have a base of operations from which to manage, direct, and control business activities occurring both inside and outside the City limits. Further, the in-City office provides a place from which to solicit business, accept communications, conduct meetings, store supplies, and perform office work.

Like the Firm in <em>Gilberti, </em>Northwood maintains its principal place of business within the taxing jurisdiction. While the taxation of Northwood’s gross receipts “operates in such a manner as to, in effect, tax revenues from certain transactions that occur wholly outside of the [Township],” such a tax, as we stated in <em>Gilberti, </em>“remains one that is levied only upon a privilege exercised within the City, to wit, maintenance of a business office and the fact that the amount of tax is dependent upon the taxpayer’s gross receipts, including receipts from services performed outside the [Township], does not undermine the legitimacy of the tax.” <em>Id. </em>at 1326.

By way of example, of Northwood's nearly $35 million in gross receipts reported on its 1996 federal tax return, approximately $15.5 million were attributable to Pennsylvania, $15.4 million were attributable to New Jersey, $3 million were attributable to Delaware and $1.1 million were attributable to Maryland. <em>See </em>Stipulation of Facts at ¶ 20, R.R. 6a-7a. Similarly, of Northwood's nearly $42 million in gross receipts reported on its 1998 federal tax return, approximately $27 million were attributable to Pennsylvania, $14 million were attributable to New Jersey, and $813,000 were attributable to Delaware. <em>Id.</em>

As stated above, <em>supra </em>n. 12, the Township has not utilized the Exclusionary Provision to exclude from Northwood's taxable gross receipts any receipts on which taxes were paid to other states, apparently taking the position that any tax that Northwood paid on such receipts did not constitute a "business privilege tax or similar tax ... imposed by another political subdivision by reason of the performance of the service or conducting of business in the political subdivision.” Ordinance § 1.02(f)(4).</p>

Of course, Northwood does not agree with this premise as it contends that in spite of the Exclusionary Provision, its receipts have been taxed twice because the Township has refused to provide it with the exclusions to which it is entitled. <em>See supra </em>nn. 12, 18.</p>

Although application of the Exclusionary Provision should, in theory, reduce the extent to which interstate receipts are taxed, it has obviously not done so here. Northwood asserts that this is due, at least in part, to the Township's failure to apply the provision properly. <em>See supra </em>nn. 12, 18. However, the record in this case is insufficient to determine whether Northwood is correct in this regard and in any event, whether the Township should have given Northwood certain exclusions is immaterial to our resolution of whether the tax that the Township has actually imposed violates the Commerce Clause.</p>
      <p id="b617-7" data-blocks='[["BL_617.8",617,[185,2007,1120,302]]]'>Moreover, even assuming that the Township should have given Northwood some exclusions for receipts on which taxes were paid to other states under the Exclusionary Provision, we feel compelled to note that we have no confidence that such exclusions would fully resolve any external consistency problem, because their availability is entirely dependent on the whims of other states, which may or may not impose a BPT or similar tax on receipts that are properly allocated to them.</p>
