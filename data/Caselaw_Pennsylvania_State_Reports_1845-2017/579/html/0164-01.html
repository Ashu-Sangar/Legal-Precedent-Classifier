The parties settled the survival action and agreed that appellees would file a motion for judgment on the pleadings to resolve the questions of whether a parent can recover non-pecuniary losses resulting from a child’s death within the context of a wrongful death action and whether sovereign immunity is a bar to recovery against appellees. The trial court denied the motion, finding that “since it is not absolutely clear as a matter of law that such damages are not recoverable, judgment on the pleadings is inappropriate and must be denied.” Memorandum and Order, 9/3/02, at 8. The trial court certified its interlocutory order for immediate appeal, pursuant to Rule 702(b) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b).
