One complicating factor is that here, as in the <em>Bradley </em>case, it could be said that “if appellants claim proved to have merit, it would' implicate the legality of his sentence” under the classic formulation of sentence illegality. <a href="/pa/575/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="180" data-cite="834 A.2d 1127" data-case-ids="630409,9083893" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0141-01,/a2d/834/1127-01">834 A.2d at 1131</a>. This is so because if appellants claim that the procedure by which he was subjected to the enhanced sentence authorized by Section 780—115(a) was constitutionally deficient proved to have merit, then appellants sentence would exceed the lawful statutory maximum otherwise imposable for his offense. But, before concluding that <em>Bradley </em>makes appellants waived claim reviewable, it bears emphasis that <em>Bradley </em>involved a preserved claim. The question of sentencing “legality” in <em>Bradley </em>arose only in conjunction with the jurisdictional distinction in appellate review models set forth in the Sentencing Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
      <em>Bradley </em>did not purport to address and answer what it might mean to say that a claim implicates the “legality” of a sentence for other purposes—such as attempts to defeat jurisprudential principles of issue preservation and waiver, or to establish jurisdiction where it does not otherwise exist, or to defeat restrictions upon collateral attack, or to defeat the restrictions upon retroactive application of new procedural rulings of constitutional dimension. Nevertheless, since <em>Bradley </em>employed the classic “exceeds the statutory limit” formulation in a context where the assumed success of the claim was the only basis upon which the claim could be said to implicate sentencing “legality,” it provides at least some support for the notion that <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>the claim <em>sub judice, </em>if deemed meritorious, likewise could be said to implicate the “legality” of appellants sentence.</p>
    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[154,403,1158,1426]]]'>I have serious reservations concerning the prospect of employing a form of relaxed waiver to absolve a criminal defendant of the requirement of preserving a novel sentencing challenge in the trial court based upon the assumption that, if the claim proved to have merit and the statute under which the defendant was sentenced were suspended, the sentence would exceed the residual statutory maximum. Appellants sentence unquestionably is lawful upon its face, given the existing statutory construct; his claim, in essence, seeks to alter that construct. In short, appellant would belatedly like his to be the test case which would result in striking the statute down on constitutional grounds. In this regard, the posture of this appeal is significantly different from that at issue in <em>Commonwealth v.

Pennsylvania courts have held on numerous occasions that constitutional challenges to a sentence are waived if not properly raised below. <em>See generally Commonwealth v.

Moreover, recent experience teaches that the issue should be treated in a less monolithic fashion than our brief discussions over the years may have suggested. As I have noted above, a claim that a sentence is “illegal” may be offered for a variety of reasons: to negate an abject waiver on direct appeal, as here; to secure substantive appellate review of a preserved claim in light of statutory restrictions, as in <em>Bradley; </em>as a basis for creating a <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>form of extraordinary jurisdiction <em>nunc pro tunc, see Fajohn v.

Should that construction apply only to those seeking the benefit of an existing law or interpretation which calls into question the lawfulness of their sentences (as in the case of the appellant in <em>Wynn </em>who sought application of the <em>Butler </em>decision), as opposed to one seeking to make that very law? Should the definition of what is an “illegal” sentence for purposes of avoiding a judicial issue preservation doctrine factor in the reality that the Court would essentially be permitting the defendant to mount a preemptive collateral attack, and thereby to avoid satisfying statutory limitations upon collateral attack as well as salutary limitations upon the retroactive effect of new constitutional rulings? Merely labeling a sentence as “illegal” hardly justifies defeating all other laws which exist to ensure a rational and fair system of review.</p>

For practical purposes, this means that such a constitutional claim is subject to waiver; and indeed, this Court has already treated Apprendi-based claims as waivable. <em>See Commonwealth v. Bavusa, </em><a href="/pa/574/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="199" data-cite="574 Pa. 620" data-case-ids="588008" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0620-01">574 Pa. 620</a>, <a href="/pa/574/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="200" data-cite="832 A.2d 1042" data-case-ids="588008,9088826" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0620-01,/a2d/832/1042-01">832 A.2d 1042</a>, 1051 (2003) (“If appellant had a constitutional objection to the statute premised upon the concerns that led to the view embraced by the 5-4 majority in <em>Apprendi, </em>he was obliged to specifically forward it below.”). Accordingly, even if the constitutional challenge to the statute forwarded in this case were someday deemed meritorious, the only defendants who should properly be entitled to the benefit of that ruling would be those who raised and preserved the question at all appropriate stages of the litigation. <em>E.g. Commonwealth v.

By his own admission, appellant is not one of those people. This fact should weigh heavily against holding that an innovative but waived claim such as the one appellant forwards implicates the current “legality” of his sentence for purposes of defeating requirements of issue preservation and limitations upon the retroactive effect of new procedural rulings.</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[269,1407,1160,907]],["BL_399.1",399,[156,274,1152,258]]]'>Logically, the question of when a sentencing claim should be deemed to be of such fundamental importance as to defeat existing procedural defaults should depend upon a balance of the specific nature, of the claim forwarded and the specific statute, rule or judicial default doctrine which would be negated by judicial consideration of the claim. I would flatly reject the blanket notion that if a sentencing claim is deemed to implicate “legality,” it necessarily suspends all countervailing considerations. I would reserve that sort of status to those few sentencing claims which fall within the traditional realm of what may be called the “illegal”: <em>i.e., </em>those which challenge sentences exceeding the very jurisdiction or power of the sentencing court, such as a twenty-year sentence for an offense which is punishable by a maximum of ten years, or separate sentences on offenses which merge. Appellants claim that his sentence, which falls within the durational parameters of the statute under which he was sentenced, is <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>infirm because the statute suffers- from some constitutional deficiency (such as the allocation of decision-making authority) is not nearly of the same magnitude as a claim that the courts sentence exceeded the very authority granted it by the General Assembly.</p>
    <p id="b399-4" data-blocks='[["BL_399.5",399,[152,560,1158,1442]]]'>I am strongly inclined to view the instant claim as waived and therefore available to appellant, if at all, only under the auspices of the PCRA. Nevertheless, I am satisfied to reach the question for the following reasons. First, as noted above, the procedural question of exactly what sorts of issues should be deemed to implicate the “non-waivable” “legality” of a sentence is unclear under Pennsylvania precedent and was made even more unclear by <em>Wynn; </em>indeed, the procedural question may be more difficult than the substantive issue accepted for review here. Second, although the parties have briefed the question of waiver, this Court did not focus upon that question in the allocatur grant and the generalities argued by the parties understandably do not address the complexities outlined above. A definitive holding on the question should perhaps await a case where the broader issue has been joined. Third, in the absence of comprehensive and definitive guidance, <em>Bradley </em>and <em>Wynn </em>provide some arguable, albeit weak and indirect, support for reviewing the merits of the claim. Finally, although entertaining the defaulted claim may have the corollary effect of subverting the role of the PCRA, the direct appeal “waiver” existing at this point derives from this Court’s jurisprudential doctrines, over which we have more legitimate discretionary control than a statutorily-created waiver. On balance, although I do not believe that appellant is entitled to review as a matter of right, I believe it is a proper exercise of judicial discretion to hear the claim on the merits.</p>
