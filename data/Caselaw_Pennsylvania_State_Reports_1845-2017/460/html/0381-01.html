After a pre-trial hearing, the trial court grant<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>ed judgment on the pleadings to appellees and dismissed the complaint. On this appeal,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[204,444,1149,537]]]'>In 1973, the authorities of Somerset County undertook a re-assessment of all real property in the county for the purpose of determining 1974 real estate taxes. Notices of assessment for 1974 taxes were mailed to property owners throughout the period from September 7, 1973, to November 6, 1973. The notices informed the owners that they could take an appeal from the assessment within 10 days of the date of the notice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Accompanying the notice were a letter from the chief assessor and a form for use in taking an appeal from the assessment.</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[203,1017,1146,483]]]'>Appellants’ attack in the trial court focused on the right to appeal from the assessment. They contended that the notice, letter, and appeal form misrepresented the proper procedure to be employed in appealing the assessment. They also contended that the representation that the owner had a 10-day period in which to appeal was false and misleading because, under, the applicable statute,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> ****the owner in fact had until September 1, <em>197Ip, </em>to take an appeal.</p>
    <p id="b542-3" data-blocks='[["BL_542.3",542,[278,319,1156,798]]]'>
      <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>- In this appeal, appellants have abandoned the contentions that the notice, letter, and appeal form misrepresented the appeal procedure and the time limit for taking an appeal. They now for the first time urge two quite different theories. First, they contend that the applicable statute <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> required that the owners have appealed by September <em>1,1973, </em>and therefore, because assessment notices were not mailed until after September 1, they have been denied any appeal<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>(even though thousands of appeals were in fact filed and considered on their merits by the Board of Assessment Appeals). Second, citing Moyer Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20Pa.%20D.%20%26%20C.%20261" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="57 Pa. D. &amp; C. 261">57 Pa.D. &amp; C. 261</a>, 268 (C.P.Montgomery County 1971), they contend that the authorities failed to adhere to the statutory schedule for re-assessment,® and that this failure renders the re-assessment void.</p>
