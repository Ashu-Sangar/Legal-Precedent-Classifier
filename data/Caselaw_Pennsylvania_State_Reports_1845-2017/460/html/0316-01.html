Then in answer to the question, “How many people shot him, one or two?”, the witness replied “One”.</p>

Like he had something under his shirt.” When asked if he saw any weapons, the witness said, “No, I didn’t.”</p>
    <p id="b477-4" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[222,919,1148,479]]]'>The third and final witness for the Commonwealth was a police detective who testified that he went to a hospital shortly after the shooting; that Press was in the emergency room and in response to questions said he was seated on the steps with his girl friend when “Boonie [Leroy Gause] and Melvin Fields came up and asked if I was from 29. He didn’t give me a chance to answer. He just shot about five times.” When asked who shot him, Press said “Boonie”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <em>Commonwealth v. McFadden, </em><a href="/pa/448/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="448 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="1944690" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0146-01">448 Pa. 146</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20358" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="292 A.2d 358">292 A.2d 358</a> (1972), and <em>Commonwealth v. Strantz, </em><a href="/pa/328/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="328 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1179695" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0033-01">328 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2075" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="195 A. 75">195 A. 75</a> (1937). While this may be established by circumstantial evidence, the proof must lead to more than suspicion and conjecture. See <em>Commonwealth v. McFadden, </em>supra. Furthermore, mere presence at the scene of a crime is not in itself, sufficient to establish that one is an active partner in the intent of another to commit the crime. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Leach, </em><a href="/pa/455/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="455 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="582100" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0448-01">455 Pa. 448</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20293" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="317 A.2d 293">317 A. 2d 293</a> (1974), and <em>Commonwealth v.

Likewise, flight from the scene of a crime, without more, is not enough to show one is such an active partner. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Roscioli, </em><a href="/pa/454/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="454 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="579860" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0059-01">454 Pa. 59</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20396" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="309 A.2d 396">309 A.2d 396</a> (1973); and, <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b478-4" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[279,1155,1153,695]]]'>In our view, the Commonwealth’s evidence was inadequate, as a matter of law, to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Fields was an active partner in Gause’s intent to shoot Press. Read in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the record proves that Fields arrived' at the scene of the shooting with “Boonie”, the killer; that he <em>may </em>have asked Press if he “was from 29”; <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> that after “Boonie” shot Press, Fields ran from the scene with “Boonie”. There is nothing in the testimony to indicate Fields had any prior knowledge of Gause’s lethal intent or that he in any way counseled or participated in the shooting. Under the circumstances, the proof left too much to conjecture.</p>
