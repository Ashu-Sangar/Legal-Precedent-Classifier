Appellant’s brother, Nathaniel, said that they were going to “get” the victim.

Clark, supra. </em>Emphatically condemned in <em>Lipscomb </em>is yet another comment<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> similar to that of the prosecutor when he argued here, “there’s one way that you could find this defendant not guilty, there’s only one way, and that’s if Irving Rotfarb walked through those courtroom doors, then you could find the defendant not guilty.” As we said in <em>Lipscomb, </em><a href="/pa/455/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="455 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="582030" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0525-01">455 Pa. at 528-529</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20205" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="317 A.2d 205">317 A.2d at 207</a>, this amounted to a statement by the prosecutor that he was personally convinced that the appellant was guilty, and his innocence was as unlikely as the deceased’s resurrection. We held such <em>personal assertions </em>by the prosecutor on the guilt of the <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>accused were beyond the scope of fair play and were reversible error.</p>
    <p id="b563-4" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[187,436,1148,1896]]]'>Yet an even stronger assertion was made by the prosecutor in this case when he expressed his <em>personal belief, </em>after numerous references to the appellant’s clever and cunning nature, that he thought Jimmie Lark to be clever, more evil than his brother and the actual planner of the crime committed by the two brothers. Not only did the prosecutor impermissibly express his <em>personal </em>conviction that appellant was guilty but he also characterized appellant as evil, clever and calculating. As was said in <em>Commonwealth v. Capalla, </em><a href="/pa/322/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="322 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1167831" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0200-01">322 Pa. 200</a>, 204, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20203" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="185 A. 203">185 A. 203</a> (1986), it is no part of the district attorney’s duty nor right to stigmatize the defendant. The <em>Capaila </em>Court went on to say that the characterization of the defendant there as a cold-blooded killer was supported by no facts in the record which could warrant such a belief by anyone, and even if they were, the jury must be the first permitted to express such a belief. Here appellant, a juvenile who had never been in trouble before, agreed to run to the corner to be a lookout for a twenty-year old brother who had previously procured the murder weapon without any collaboration on the part of appellant, did the actual shooting and robbing of the victim and paid appellant afterwards for assisting him. The Commonwealth’s strongest evidence of appellant’s collaboration in the plan was appellant’s own admission that the two brothers decided to rob the victim. For the district attorney to unfairly characterize appellant as he did, totally unsupported by any evidence in the record, was to express his own personal beliefs and to invite the jury to rely upon the district attorney’s knowledge, general experience and wisdom. <em>Cf., United States v. Schartner, </em><a href="/f2d/426/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="426 F.2d 470" data-case-ids="2246838" data-case-paths="/f2d/426/0470-01">426 F.2d 470</a> (3d Cir. 1970). These statements exceeded the bounds of fair play and decency and violated the appellant’s right to a fair and impartial trial.</p>

The only issue preserved for our consideration is the voluntariness of that confession.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The trial court, supported by the record, found that appellant, seventeen years old and in the eleventh grade, was articulate, knowledgeable, of at least average intelligence, and capable of comprehending <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The trial court found that defendant was given his warnings, allowed to eat and to rest, and was in custody for approximately six hours prior to giving his first inculpatory statement. The court further found that appellant was not mistreated and that appellant’s mother was aware that appellant was being taken in by the police for questioning but declined to accompany him.
