The testator’s will, executed on August 16, 1971, was duly probated. After the first and final account was rendered, petition for distribution was filed and exceptions were taken. Testimony was begun on February 1, 1974, after which time the court terminated the hearing to make a determination as to whether a latent ambiguity existed in the wording of the will. On February 19, 1974, the court entered a decree finding no ambiguity in the will which would permit extraneous testimony and dismissed all exceptions.

In addition, the testator provided that if any monthly payment previously authorized to be made should be insufficient in the opinion of the trustee to provide for the welfare, support and education of “such beneficiary and members of his or her immediate family,” the trustee is authorized in its discretion to use principal for such purpose and as it deems advisable.</p>

However, in the absence of a different intent appearing from the will a bequest of income ordinarily means the whole of it or at least the entire net income. <em>McManus Estate, </em><a href="/pa/361/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="361 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="476448" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0122-01">361 Pa. 122</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20A.2d%2075" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="63 A.2d 75">63 A.2d 75</a> (1949). <em>See also </em>96 C.J.S.

The plain and usual <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>meaning of the words used by the testator led the lower court to the conclusion that the will directs the trustee to pay the income from the trusts to the beneficiaries; and if that income is less than the minimum amounts specified, the trustee can invade the principal to insure the payment of a minimum amount per month. We agree. It is important to note that in the sentence immediately following the creation of his son’s trust, the testator had no difficulty in clearly expressing his desire to limit to a specific sum the funds to be given to his son for medical expenses in the three years following the testator’s death. Furthermore, the only reference in the will to the distribution of any excess income which might be accumulated, accrued or invested in the children’s shares is that upon the death of the children, “the remaining principal and any undistributed income” is to be equally divided and held in trust for the grandchildren.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It is clear from an analysis of the will that the intent of the testator was to provide his children with life estates. The trustee is directed to pay Thelma Perilman and Robert L. Jacobson the income from the principal shares and to invade the principal if such income was insufficient to assure them specified minimum sums. Additionally, the trustee at his discretion can invade the principal to provide for the welfare, support and education of any beneficiary and members of his or her immediate family and to pay part or all of his funeral expenses. There is, however, a question as to what is meant by the words “and any undistributed income.”</p>

The term “family” usually includes the husband or wife and children unless the language indicates a contrary intent on the testator’s part. Act of November 25, 1970, P.L. 707, No. 230, as amended, 20 Pa. S. § 2514(4) (Supp.1974). This Court had previously held the word “family” to include only members of the bloodline and therefore not to include the spouse. <em>Heck v.

There were only two persons for whom the testator provided monthly payments, and Thelma Perilman was one of those persons. The clear intent of the testator’s designation of “any beneficiary under paragraphs A or B” of Article 9 would certainly have to include the testator’s daughter if it included any one at all. While the remaindermen may question the wisdom of the trustee’s exercise of discretion, we find no abuse of that discretion here. Not only was there a reasonable basis for the invasion of the principal in accordance with the terms of the will, but the trustee testified as to the reasons for advancing the sums to Mrs. Perilman. He testified that each of the trusts under the will had been established immediately after the testator’s death by means of proceeds from policies of life insurance on the life of the decedent which were payable to the trustee under the will. This provided a relatively small amount of principal in the trusts immediately. The administrative assets of the decedent’s estate were held in the administrative account and thus the income earned by those assets had been accumulated in that account. The result was that the income earned by the trust was rather limited before the transfer of the assets of the administrative estate. Mrs. Perilman requested invasion of the principal for her maintenance during this period and the trustee granted her request with the understanding that <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>when the accumulated income was transferred by decree of the Court from the administrative estate to her trust, the advancement of principal in the trust would be charged against the accumulated income. In fact, the principal has been reimbursed for the invasion for all but $1,641.84 as of January 17, 1974. We hold under these circumstances there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trustee.</p>
