The pertinent facts are that the police responded to a burglar alarm from a clothing store and arrived shortly thereafter at the scene. Upon arrival, the officers noted a fleeing shadow departing from the rear of the building in question. Although an attempt was made to apprehend the fleeing suspect it proved unsuccessful and under the circumstances, no identification of the individual was possible. At the scene, the officers discovered a pry bar wedged between the door and the door casing at the rear of the store. Other members of the police department, after being advised of the incident, proceeded to search the area in an effort to apprehend the culprit. Approximately an hour after the initial alarm, police officers observed a 1962 Chevrolet automobile enter a driveway of a house located near the store, stop for a few moments and then depart. It was subsequently determined that the place where the vehicle had stopped, was the home of the parents of appellant. As the automobile drove away, the police proceeded to follow it for approximately one-half mile. During this period of time, no traffic laws were violated nor was there any indication of anything unusual either about the appearance of the vehicle or the behavior of its occupants. The officers then signaled the vehicle to stop. The driver complied and immediately brought his vehicle to a halt. One of the officers went to the passenger side of the automobile and at some point thereafter shined a flashlight into its rear interior. Lying on the floor behind the driver’s seat and visible from the outside, was a hammer and railroad spike. Upon request, the three oc<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>cupants of the car produced proper identification. As a result of. the police’s observation of these items in the rear of the vehicle, a search warrant was obtained for the automobile and the resulting search produced items that had been taken in a burglary earlier that night.</p>

Because a motorist’s extreme mobility may otherwise allow him to avoid police confrontation, the State has an equally strong interest in these cases in stopping a moving vehicle to freeze momentarily a situation of suspected criminality. However, these decisions have made it clear that to justify the intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which taken together with rational inferences from those facts reasonably warranted the intrusion.

The only factor relied upon to suggest suspicious behavior was the assumption the occupants of the vehicle could have seen the police car and, not wishing to be discovered, pulled into the driveway, backed, out and proceeded slowly in the opposite direction. The weak<a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>ness of this position is that there is an absence in this record of any facts that would cause this seemingly innocent conduct to be viewed as suspicious.</p>

Proceeding under that information, the officer went immediately to the vehicle and recovered the items. In each instance, there were articulable facts that could be offered as a basis for a reasonable conclusion that criminal action was afoot and justifying a limited intrusion in those instances. Here, there was nothing to suggest that these individuals were in any way related to the attempted burglary at the store that had occurred approximately an hour earlier. The only information the police possessed with reference to the burglary was that a shadow of a single individual was seen leaving. There was nothing to suggest either that this individual had access to a motor vehicle or that he was accompanied by companions. There was nothing unusual about the car’s presence in the area, shortly after midnight. The testimony established that there were many other vehicles on the road and none of these were stopped. Although the officers testified that the vehicle aroused their suspicion, they were incapable of articulating any actions on the part of the occupants of that vehicle which justifiably occasioned such a suspicion. We are satisfied that the record is devoid of any unusual conduct “which leads him [officers] reasonably to conclude in light of his [their] experience that criminal activity may be afoot.” <em>Terry, supra, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. at 30</a>, 88 S.Ct. at 1884.
