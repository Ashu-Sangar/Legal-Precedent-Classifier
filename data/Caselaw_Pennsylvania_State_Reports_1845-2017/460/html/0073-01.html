The system, connected to all three listed department telephone numbers, automatically recorded all calls, both incoming and outgoing, conducted on police department telephones. It was structured so that the desk officer could not disengage it if a party to the communication objected to the interception.</p>
    <p id="b236-6" data-blocks='[["BL_236.7",236,[289,986,1153,421]]]'>To render this recording system compatible with the telephone system, the city requested that the Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania install a device called a “recorder connector.” This device, which is interposed between the recorder and the telephone lines, protects Bell Telephone’s equipment and employees from “voltage surges” caused by the recording system. In compliance with its tariffs, Bell installed the “connector.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In response to this message, appellant telephoned the police department. While speaking to the client’s mother, who was also at the police station, an unusual noise on the <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>telephone line caused appellant to suspect the police were recording the conversation. He immediately asked to speak with the officer in charge, who confirmed his suspicions. Appellant requested that the interception stop but was informed that the officer could do nothing to terminate the interception. Later that day, the client, using a police department telephone, returned appellant’s call. This conversation was also monitored over appellant’s objections.</p>

The trial court, without hearing evidence, denied appellant’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Appellant appealed to this Court and we vacated the equity court’s decree and remanded for an evidentiary hearing. On remand, the court, after a hearing, again refused to issue a preliminary injunction.

    <p id="b239-7" data-blocks='[["BL_239.6",239,[159,1257,1151,802]]]'>The record is devoid of any evidence of wrongful intent on the part of Bell Telephone. Bell’s sole interest in supplying the city with the “recorder connector” was the protection of its equipment and employees from dangerous voltage surges. Disconnection of the device would not have guaranteed the termination of improper interceptions. Had the device been removed, the city could have violated Bell Telephone’s tariff and connected its recording system directly to the telephone lines. We therefore cannot assign to Bell any illicit or improper intent to violate appellant’s statutory rights. Without this intent, Bell Telephone was not, for purposes of this Act, an aider or abettor. We therefore affirm the court’s decision to deny appellant equitable relief and damages against Bell Telephone.</p>

The chancellor refused to award damages because he interpreted the statute as requiring a criminal conviction as a condition precedent to civil liability. Since the purpose of the damage provision is to encourage civil enforcement of the Act, all that is required to make the damage provision of the Act operative is a determination by the court, as was made here, that the Act was violated.</p>

See Pa.R.C.P. 1020, 1041, 1501. The Complaint, as filed, does not purport to assert more than a single cause of action.
