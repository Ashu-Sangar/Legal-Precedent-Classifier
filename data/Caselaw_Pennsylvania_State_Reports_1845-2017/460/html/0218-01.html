[S]uch dereliction, standing alone, was not sufficient to evidence an intention to relinquish parental rights under the former Adoption Act, and it would appear to us that if the Legislature had intended so radical a change in the law regarding the forfeiture of parental rights it would have clearly so stated in plain and simple language.”</blockquote>
