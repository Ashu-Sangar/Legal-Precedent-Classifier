In this application, Blofsen indicated he worked for the American Ice Company [American] from 1923 to 1955, and for the Terminal Ice Company [Terminal] from 1955 to the date of the application. The Pension Fund Trustees [Trustees] <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> rejected the application stating Blofsen was <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>ineligible for benefits because his employment with Terminal was not as an employee, but as an employer. Blofsen then instituted this action in equity seeking all benefits due him from the Pension Fund, and an evidentiary hearing followed. The chancellor, while holding that Blofsen failed to meet the eligibility requirements established by the Trustees, nevertheless entered a decree nisi granting the requested relief. The chancellor ruled the Trustees, having accepted contributions to the Pension Fund made on behalf of Blofsen, were estopped from invoking the eligibility requirements. Exceptions thereto were later dismissed by a court en banc, and the decree nisi was made a final decree. This appeal was then filed.</p>

However, by June 26, 1953, Blofsen had clearly lost the status of employee. On that date a certificate was filed with the Prothonotary of Philadelphia County stating that Blofsen and James McCaughan were engaged in the business of hauling and delivering ice under the name of “Terminal Ice Company”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> From that date until June 20, 1963, when a certificate of incorporation was granted to “Terminal Ice Company, Inc.”, it is clear from the testimony that Blofsen’s status was that of an employer. Blofsen testified he purchased several trucks from American for use in the business. He admitted having several employees on the payroll. Blofsen signed collective bargaining agreements with the union, representing himself as the “employer”. And Blofsen’s <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>earnings were commensurate with employer status. For example, in 1954, the year after Terminal was formed, he earned nearly twice the wages paid the highest paid laborer in the industry, covered by union contract.</p>

    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[276,502,1157,933]]]'>The essential elements of estoppel are “an inducement by the party sought to be estopped to the party who asserts the estoppel to believe certain facts to exist— and the party asserting the estoppel <em>acts in reliance on that belief.” </em>[Emphasis in original.) <em>Sabino v.

Instantly, no evidence was introduced demonstrating that Blofsen’s actions were in reliance upon the Trustees’ representations, rather than as the result of his own judgment. <em>Northwestern National Bank v. Commonwealth, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/345/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="345 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="1213333" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0192-01">345 Pa. at 197</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20A.2d%2020" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="27 A.2d 20">27 A.2d at 23</a>. There was no evidence which indicated Blofsen acted any differently than he would have acted had he known he was ineligible for pension benefits. In fact, there was nothing in the record to indicate Blofsen had not secured other retirement security. Under the circumstances, we find no basis upon which to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[276,1469,1154,909]]]'>Finally, Blofsen contests the validity of the “Break in Service” provision. While trustees of an employee pension fund do possess a large measure of discretion in prescribing conditions of eligibility for benefits, they do owe a fiduciary duty to the employees whom they represent and may neither impose unreasonable conditions of eligibility nor act arbitrarily in determining who is eligible. <em>Lee v. Nesbitt, </em><a href="/f2d/453/1309-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="453 F.2d 1309" data-case-ids="750135" data-case-paths="/f2d/453/1309-01">453 F.2d 1309</a>, 1311 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>Roark v.

Blofsen contends the “Break in Service” provision, which causes forfeiture of all credit for employment prior to the break, unjustly deprives an individual of his hard-earned pension. Citing <em>Roark v. Boyle, </em>supra, he argues that eligibility for pension benefits would be more equitable if the eligibility requirements were geared to an individual’s “entire contribution history”.</p>
