Hazel Henry. Attached to the complaint was a copy of a written agreement dated April 14, 1969, and signed by one George Henry, brother to the appellant, purporting to be her lawful agent. This written agreement contemplated the sale of approximately one hundred acres of land belonging to the appellant, with the purchase price being $24,000. The appellant’s answer to the complaint denied the agency, stating that George Henry was never “granted the authority ... to convey title to the premises . . . . ” or “had authority to enter into an agreement pertaining to the sale of the premises.” Proof of such authority was demanded.</p>

The reason for the rule requiring notice of the intention to stand on the defense of the Statute of Frauds is evident. The plaintiff is entitled to be informed, before proceeding to the expense and burden of the prosecution of a fruitless trial, whether defendant intends, upon plaintiff's proof of an oral contract, to claim the protection of the Statute of Frauds. <em>Martin v. Wilson, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/371/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="371 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1237072" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0529-01">371 Pa., at 534</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20A.2d%20193" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="92 A.2d 193">92 A.2d at 195</a>. Although the appellant, in her answer to the complaint did deny the existence of a lawful agency between herself and George Henry, we view this as inadequate notification to the appellees of appellant’s intention to rely upon the Statute of Frauds as a defense. Her failure to set out, in a responsive pleading under the heading “New Matter”, the defense of the Statute of Frauds, was properly relied upon the chancellor in denying the appellant the opportunity to raise the defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

This rule is particularly applicable to “findings of fact which are predicated upon the credibility of witnesses, whom the chancellor has had the opportunity to hear and observe, and upon the weight to be given to their testimony.” <em>Scientific Living, Inc. v. Hohensee, </em><a href="/pa/440/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="440 Pa. 280" data-case-ids="1932232" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0280-01">440 Pa. 280</a>, 286, <a href="/citations/?q=270%20A.2d%20216" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="270 A.2d 216">270 A.2d 216</a>, 220 (1970). In his evaluation of the testimony, the chancellor apparently placed great emphasis upon certain statements made by the appellant. She testified that her brother, George Henry, took care of the property. She admitted having spoken to Mr. Charles, early in 1969, concerning the possible sale of the property. While the appellant claimed to have told Mr. Charles that she had no intention of selling the property, she conceded having told him to discuss the matter further with her brother. Furthermore, the appellant indicated that the property was for sale if the “right price” were offered. Given this testimony and the control over the property which her brother exercised, we find no error in the chancellor’s conclusion that the appellant had orally authorized her brother to act as her agent for the sale of this property.</p>
