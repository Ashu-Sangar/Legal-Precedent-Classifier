      <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>supra, at 76, 801 A.2d at 815. Counsel mailed a copy of the brief to appellant. In addition, on October 3, 1974, the prothonotary of this Court sent appellant a copy of the brief and informed him in a covering letter:</p>

It fails to include a summary of argument (Supreme Court Rules 47(4) and 54), a statement of jurisdiction (Rules 47(1) and 51), and an index and table of citations (Rule 37), and fails to properly set forth a statement of the questions involved (Rule 52). This noncompliance with our Rules is strongly condemned. Were it not for the delay that has already occurred, we would order the brief stricken and direct counsel to file a conforming brief.</p>
