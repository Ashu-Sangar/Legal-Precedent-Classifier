Almost concurrent with the filing of the complaint in assumpsit the contractors filed a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association pursuant to the provisions of their contracts.

The Court also issued an Order in the assumpsit action dismissing defendant’s Petition for Stay of Proceedings Pending Arbitration.

The scheduled completion date was September 25, 1969. However, as a result of unanticipated delays in construction the project continued into the year of 1971.

      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> if the work involved was not within the terms of the original contract, Aberthaw would not be able to collect its expenses.
