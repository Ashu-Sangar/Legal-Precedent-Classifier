At trial a Philadelphia police officer, Leonard Indelicate, identified appellant as being the same person whom he had arrested nearby shortly after the time Brooks was attacked, carrying a “two-by-four” and apparently intoxicated. Two additional witnesses testified that they had seen appellant in the vicinity of 3rd and Callowhill Streets about the time of the Brooks attack, and that he was swinging a “two-by-four” at various people. Medical testimony established that Brooks died as a result of head injuries. Appellant’s defense was alibi: he testified that he was living in Harrisburg on September 26, 1970, and introduced evidence that he had been in the Harrisburg Department of Public Assistance on September 25 and September 28.</p>

Although none of the jurors in the instant case had in fact served on the jury in the previous case, it is argued that they may well have become aware, through contact with their fellow panel members, that appellant had been accused of another crime.</p>

It was ascertained that none of those who were thus disqualified had discussed the previous trial with any other members of the panel, and the judge cautioned against doing so.
