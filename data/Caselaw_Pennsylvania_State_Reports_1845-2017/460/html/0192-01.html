Appellant requested a <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>writ of mandamus seeking reinstatement and back pay. The lower court, sitting without a jury, tried the case and rendered a verdict upon which judgment was entered, in favor of Baldwin-Whitehall and against Frantz. Exceptions to the verdict were filed by Frantz and after argument the court en banc dismissed the exceptions. An appeal to the Commonwealth Court resulted in an affirmance of the action of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County with one judge dissenting. We granted allocatur and now affirm.</p>
    <p id="b353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[152,895,1153,1234]]]'>Appellant, at the time of his dismissal, had been a school teacher in the appellee’s school district from September 1, 1955 until June 25, 1971. At all times material to this lawsuit, appellant was not a member of the old age and survivors insurance system established for public employees (including school teachers) pursuant to the provisions of the Act approved the first day of June, 1956, P.L.1973, 65 P.S. § 201 et seq. On at least three different occasions appellant specifically elected not to become a member of such system established pursuant to the aforesaid Act. Frantz is a member of the old age and survivors insurance system established pursuant to the Act of Congress approved August 14, 1935 as amended, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 301">42 U.S.C.A. § 301</a> et seq. and his contributions to the system were made through part-time employment in the private sector. No portion of the wages earned by appellant as a public school employee have been credited to his Social Security account. On June 25, 1971, at a special meeting of the Board of Directors of the appellee school district upon the recommendation of the Superintendent of the district, action was taken to terminate Frantz’s employment. Frantz was sixty-two years of age on June 25, 1971.</p>

He asserts that he was denied his constitutional right of equal protection by being forced into retirement as a member of the class covered by Social Security but not <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>under the Act of June 1, 1956. Secondly, he argues that the School Board acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and in violation of his right of equal protection in terminating his employment while not terminating the employment of three other teachers who were also sixty-two years of age and not members of the old age and survivors insurance system pursuant to the 1956 Act. Lastly, he asserts that since he is a member of the old age and survivors insurance system, although not under the Act of 1956, the age sixty-five termination date should apply to him because he also will not receive full benefits until age sixty-five.</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[287,985,1151,150]]]'>Section 1122 of the Public School Code of 1949, Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, as amended, 24 P.S. § 11-1122, provides in pertinent part:</p>

He argues further that the forced retirement of appellant because he was already covered by Social Security resulting from some other employment, discriminates against him as a member of a class of school teachers covered by Social Security. This argument, however, fails to perceive the very real distinction between persons in appellant’s situation and those school teachers who are covered under the 1956 Act. As a result of appellant’s election not to become a member of Social Security as a public employee, he has received no credit for, or benefit from, his earnings as a school teacher for Social Security purposes. Whether the appellant retired from teaching at age forty-five, fifty, sixty or seventy, would not affect the computation of his Social Security benefits in any manner. The only factors which could affect appellant’s eligibility for Social Security benefits are with regard to his employment in the private sector. On the other hand, a school teacher who retires prior to reaching age sixty-five and is covered by the Act of 1956 would face two disadvantages. First, his Social Security account would not be credited with earnings subsequent to retirement which could otherwise have accrued and secondly, his monthly Social Security benefits would be reduced if he elected to receive same prior to reaching age sixty-five. Thus, it is only a public school teacher who is a member of the Social Security system pursuant to the Act of 1956 who would be harmed by retirement prior to reaching age sixty-five. It is also clear that the statute, rather than establishing an unreasonable classification, creates an exemption from the age sixty-two termination date in order to enable those teachers who joined pursuant to the 1956 Act to become eligible for the benefits since they could have attained benefits only through continued contributions from wages earned as teachers. See <em>Hopfer v. Oklamchak, </em><a href="/pa/407/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="407 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="1307425" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0193-01">407 Pa. 193</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%2069" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="180 A.2d 69">180 A.2d 69</a> (1962).</p>

      <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a> In our view the classification at issue here reasonably relates to a valid state interest and is sustainable against a challenge based upon the equal protection clause. The state interest to be protected is the availability of benefits to those teachers who joined the system pursuant to the Act of 1956 and this interest is reasonably insured by the exemption for those teachers. In contrast, appellant’s access to benefits, by his own election, has no relationship to his employment as a teacher. In <em>Adler v. Montefiore Hospital A. of W.

A review of the record satisfies us that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s finding that the School Board had not acted arbitrarily and capriciously. The circumstances of the other three teachers are clearly distinguishable from those of appellant. In one case, the teacher did not attain age sixty-two until after the school year commenced, and at that point he voluntarily tendered his resignation effective the following year. The evidence as to the other two teachers amply demonstrated that they were performing specialized duties in a highly proficient manner and as a result they would have been very difficult to replace. Appellant, however, had received a rating of “barely satisfactory”. Under these facts, we cannot say that the Board abused its discretion or that they acted with purposeful and intentional discrimination against appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The language used by the legislature in the proviso in § 1122 is clear, unambiguous and free from doubt. The legislature could not have been more explicit in referring to the Act of 1956 and thus by implication excluding those who were not covered by that specific provision. “When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b), added by act of December 6, 1972, (P.L. 1339, No. 290), § 3. Not only is appellant’s suggested construction in violation of the clear meaning of the language it is also inconsistent with the obvious purpose of the section. It is clear that the legislature only intended to limit the board’s discretion in terminating employment at age sixty-two for those employees who were under the provisions of the Act of 1956 and required the additional employment, until age sixty-five, to become eligible for benefits under Social Security.</p>
