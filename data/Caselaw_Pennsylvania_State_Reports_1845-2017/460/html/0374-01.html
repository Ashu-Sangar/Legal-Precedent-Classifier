Before his arrival, his mother and stepfather had been arguing over who was the benefactor responsible for a new stove which had been delivered to the house that day. His mother, Mrs. Donald, had claimed that the stove was a gift from her mother, but her husband, Mr. Donald, accused his wife of having received it from an alleged paramour. When the appellant joined the others he asked <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>his stepfather what he thought of the new stove. This precipitated a tirade by Mr. Donald who inveighed against the appellant and the entire family. In the course of this verbal barrage appellant left the living room where the argument was taking place, entered the kitchen, removed a butcher knife from a cupboard, placed the knife in his trousers and returned to the living room. The quarrel was resumed, and in the course of it appellant stood over Donald, who was seated on the couch, and stabbed him 15 times in the area of the chest and head. From these blows the victim died.</p>

This argument is without merit. The evidence as recounted above established that appellant left the affray with his stepfather, deliberately went into the kitchen, obtained a butcher knife, returned with it concealed in his trousers and then, after the resumption of the argument, killed his stepfather with the knife. Lee testified in his own defense that he didn’t remember obtaining the knife, that the only knife he saw was one brandished by Donald, who had lunged towards him with a knife. This evidence was directly contradicted by the appellant’s sister-in-law, who testified she saw appellant obtain the knife from the kitchen, and by his mother, who testified that she neither saw the victim with a knife nor saw him striking Lee in any manner. It was for the jury to decide which version of the events to believe and whether the appellant had “formed in his mind the conscious purpose of taking life.” <em>Commonwealth v.

On the evening of the slaying, January 22, 1972, Lee surrendered to the police. He was indicted on March 9, 1972 on charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter. On September 12, 1972, upon petition of his counsel, appellant was ordered released from custody pending trial, pursuant to the Act of March 31, 1860, P. <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>L. 427, § 54, as amended, 19 P.S. § 781. (Appellant remained at liberty until March 13, 1973 when he was arrested on several unrelated charges). Trial was then scheduled for October 2, 1972. Several days before the trial date, defense counsel requested a continuance for the purpose of securing a psychiatric evaluation of Lee. This was allowed, and trial was rescheduled for January 22, 1973, but was not reached that day due to the heavy docket of the court. Without objection by appellant, trial was again continued, this time to April 2, 1973. On that day, at the request of new counsel for appellant, another postponement was granted. Trial was finally had on July 25,1973, as indicated above.</p>

He alleges he was subjected to oppressive incarceration throughout much of the time he was awaiting trial; that he suffered considerable anxiety and concern; and that his defense was impaired as a result of the delay. These are all interests identified by the Court in <em>Barker </em>as being indicative of prejudice, with the last the most serious. <em>Barker, supra, </em><a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">407 U.S. at 532</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">92 S.Ct. at 2193</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">33 L.Ed.2d at 118</a>.</p>
