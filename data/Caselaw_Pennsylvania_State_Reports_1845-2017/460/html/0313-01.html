    <p id="b472-13" data-blocks='[["BL_472.13",472,[278,1837,1152,205]]]'>Appellant, Simon Evans, was tried by a judge and jury and found guilty of murder in the first degree. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b472-14" data-blocks='[["BL_472.14",472,[278,2063,1152,151]]]'>Appellant’s conviction arose out of the murder of Mack Baker on January 7, 1972, in the City of Philadelphia.</p>

We do not agree. Appellant was arrested on January 8, 1972, at about 7:00 a. m., by officers of the Philadelphia police. When police initially arrested appellant, they started to give him his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, but they were interrupted by the appellant, who stated: “I know all that.” After this interruption, appellant was transported to police headquarters. At this point, the failure of appellant to receive his full <em>Miranda </em>warnings did not prejudice him because he was not questioned by the police officers. After appellant arrived at police headquarters, he was given his full <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and questioned. He initially denied complicity in the homicide. He was thereafter reinterviewed and he gave an oral confession. Under these facts, the record supports the Commonwealth’s contention that the oral confession was preceded by full <em>Miranda </em>warnings and voluntarily given. See <em>Commonwealth v. Parks, </em><a href="/pa/453/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="453 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="577626" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0296-01">453 Pa. 296</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20725" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="309 A.2d 725">309 A.2d 725</a> (1973).</p>
    <p id="b473-4" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[192,1337,1148,585]]]'>Appellant next argues that the court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to prove that appellant purchased heroin with the money he obtained in the robbery-murder of the victim, Mack Baker. The argument is based on the theory that this testimony related to other crimes for which appellant was not on trial and thereby prejudiced his case. This evidence offered by the Commonwealth was relevant and admissible to show appellant’s motive and intent in the robbery and murder of the victim. See <em>Commonwealth v. Faison, </em><a href="/pa/437/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="437 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1927806" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0432-01">437 Pa. 432</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20394" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="264 A.2d 394">264 A.2d 394</a> (1970).</p>
