A direct ap<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>peal was taken to this Court alleging that appellant was not effectively represented by trial counsel. The order of the court below was affirmed at <a href="/pa/440/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="440 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="1932348" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0579-01">440 Pa. 579</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=270%20A.2d%20695" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="270 A.2d 695">270 A.2d 695</a> (1970).

Appellant’s petition was dismissed without a hearing.</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[182,1021,1147,850]]]'>Appellant now asserts in this Court that it was error for the court below to dismiss his post conviction petition without a hearing on the issues presented in that petition. The Post Conviction Hearing Act clearly states that the court may deny a hearing if petitioner’s claim is patently frivolous and is without a trace of support either in the record or from the evidence submitted by the petitioner. Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, § 9, 19 P.S. § 1180-9 (Supp.1974-75). Further, “[t]he appointment of counsel shall not be required if the petitioner’s claim is patently frivolous and without trace of support in the record as provided by section 9 of the act.” Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, § 12, 19 P.S. § 1180-12 (Supp.1974-75). Thus, if the petition of appellant was patently frivolous, it was not erroneously dismissed.</p>
