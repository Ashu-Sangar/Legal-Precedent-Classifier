At that time, she informed the district attorney that she would not appear.</p>

    <p id="b193-7" data-blocks='[["BL_193.7",193,[137,1455,1150,794]]]'>Later that day, the court instructed the detective to maintain an all-night vigil at the witness’s home. That night the detective talked to at least two persons who claimed to have recently seen the witness but who were unable to tell the detective of her present whereabouts. The detective also spoke with the witness’s mother, who stated that her daughter had left the mother’s home two weeks earlier. The mother said she had no knowledge where her daughter could be found. The officer searched the mother’s home and did not find the witness, although he did find evidence that the witness had lived there. He then called at the home of the witness’s stepbrother, but no one was home. Finally, he returned to the mother’s home, searched it again and again failed to find the witness.</p>

Nor can we conclude that the fact the witness had been recently seen in the neighborhood where she lived bars application of the statute. The Act does not require that the Commonwealth establish that the witness has disappeared from the face <em>of </em>the earth; it demands that the Commonwealth make a good-faith effort to locate the witness and fail. In the circumstances of this case, the Commonwealth established that a good-faith attempt was made to find the witness and that “the witness [could] not be found.” We therefore hold that the court, in compliance with section 3 of the Act of May 23, 1887, properly permitted the witness’s prior testimony to be read to the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellant first contends that the court improperly permitted testimony to be given on irrelevant issues. Next he asserts that the court’s statement to the jury after the Commonwealth rested its case “that the next order of business will be for the defendant to present his defense,” shifted the burden of proof from the Commonwealth. Finally, he contends that the testimony of the missing witness read to the jury was inadmissible because it was the fruit of a custodial interrogation of the witness by the police at which the police failed to give the witness <em>Miranda </em>warnings. At the time of these alleged errors, appellant failed to object.
