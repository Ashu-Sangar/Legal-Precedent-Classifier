The indication of group-mindedness is sufficient if the group is capable of either future increase or decrease. Id., Comment e, at 1455. In her will, Mrs. Clarke clearly contemplated and provided for a future decrease in the number of takers. Distribution of principal was postponed until none of the named grandchildren was under the age of 25. At that time, “the principal and any accumulated income shall be divided into as many equal shares as there are of said grandchildren then living and said grandchildren then deceased with issue then living.” Thus, any grandchild who was a potential member of the class at the execution of the will who failed to survive until the time for distribution and failed to leave issue who survived until the time for distribution would be removed from the group of takers; his expectant share would be divided among the grand<a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>children then living and then-living issue of deceased grandchildren.

The direction for division of the principal uses only the general word of description: “said grandchildren then living and said grandchildren then deceased with issue then living.” The sentence mandating distribution (“Each share set apart for a living grandchild shall be transferred and delivered to him or her free of trust . . . ”) does not even use the word “said,” which appellants contend acts to incorporate the names by reference.</p>
