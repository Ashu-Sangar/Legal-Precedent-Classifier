He amended the distributive article of the trust agreement on August 19, 1963 and again named his children as the principal beneficiaries. Oliver also executed a second amendment on September 18, 1963, to fulfill an obligation which he had undertaken in a divorce settlement agreement with his first wife, Joan Kaufmann. This second amendment required that periodic payments agreed to in the divorce settlement would, to the extent necessary, be satisfied from trust income and assets in the event of Oliver’s death. The second amendment further provided that no future amendment or rescission of the paragraph which gave Joan Kaufmann the first claim to the trust income and corpus, would be effective without her prior written approval.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The remainder of the 1961 trust as amended on August 19, 1963, was reaffirmed.

Except perhaps for sums necessary to fulfill the settlement agreement entered into with his first wife, the settlor, therefore, could have revoked the entire trust. If a trust can thus be revoked, it follows that the settlor can revoke his own declaration as to the manner in which the trust instrument may be altered or amended. The August 17, 1969 instrument, therefore, validly amended the trust agreement to the extent that the rights of the settlor’s first wife were not disturbed.</p>

If we may not look to extrinsic evidence which would have established that, by signing the August 17, 1969, instrument, the settlor meant to do exactly what he did, how does the majority consider extrinsic evidence to establish that he did not mean for the signed instrument of August 17, 1969, to be effective. The majority uses extrinsic facts to show the possibility that the settlor wasn’t serious when he signed the August 17, 1969 instrument, but paradoxically states that the appellant was properly precluded from introducing extrinsic evidence to establish that the settlor was serious. The law cannot go in two different directions on the same issue at the same time.</p>
