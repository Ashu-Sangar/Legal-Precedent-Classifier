After the hearing below, the petition for adoption of appellee, Larue McKenzie, was denied and an order was entered directing that Mr. McKenzie and his wife, Nichelle’s mother, remain in custody of the child. Shortly thereafter, following argument before the court en banc, the original decree was unanimously reversed and a decree of adoption was entered.

On February 7, 1968, appellant’s wife gave birth to Nichelle and for approximately three months following the birth the McCray family remained together in their Pittsburgh home. After May of 1968, Nichelle’s parents separated and the child stayed with her mother.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> ***During 1968, appellant was employed briefly between periods when the family went on relief. In January of 1969, Mr. <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>McCray was sentenced to six-months’ imprisonment for violating the Uniform Firearms Act and in December of the same year he was sentenced to three months for rape or fornication.

Nichelle rejoined her mother in November of 1971 and has resided with the McKenzie family ever since. On March 17, 1973, Mrs. McKenzie gave birth to a second child.

Since his first conviction, McCray’s only “contact” with Nichelle consisted of a birthday card, sent on Nichelle’s first birthday, and a $10.00 or $20.00 gift handed to the child’s mother in August of 1969. Although appellant admitted lack of contact with Nichelle, he testified that he loved his child, thought of her constantly and did in fact make inquiries regarding her health and well-being. In defense of his alleged disinterest in Nichelle, he stated that he had not always known of Nichelle’s whereabouts and that attempts to communicate with his daughter were thwarted by prison officials. McCray’s testimony was the subject of much dispute and, at best, indicated that since his 1970 conviction he made only two. attempts to contact Nichelle, the first occurring some time in May of 1972.</p>

As background to our inquiry, we note that the Adoption Act of 1970 has broadened the grounds for abandonment that existed under prior law. Under the Act of April 4, 1925, P.L. 127, § 1, as amended, it was necessary to show <em>both </em>a settled purpose to relinquish parental claims <em>and </em>a refusal or failure to perform parental duties for a period continuing six months and hence abandon<a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>ment was construed to be “largely a matter of intent.” See, e. g., <em>Harvey Adoption Case, </em><a href="/pa/375/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="375 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1244425" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0001-01">375 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=99%20A.2d%20276" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="99 A.2d 276">99 A.2d 276</a> (1953). Under the present law, abandonment is established if <em>either </em>of the aforesaid grounds are proven and, thus, there will be cases where a parent will forfeit his rights despite a <em>desire </em>to remain the parent or where there is no settled purpose to relinquish parental claims. <em>See Appeal of Diane B., </em><a href="/pa/456/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="456 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="584423" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0429-01">456 Pa. 429</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=321%20A.2d%20618" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="321 A.2d 618">321 A.2d 618</a> (1974); and <em>In Re: Lumiere </em>Castel <em>Cassen, </em>Pa., <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20377" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="326 A.2d 377">326 A.2d 377</a> (1974).</p>
