    <p id="b702-6" data-blocks='[["BL_702.5",702,[307,1391,1155,859]]]'>It is easy to find such a basis for the difference in treatment of write-in votes on paper ballots and machines. Allowing write-in votes for those appearing on the machine would increase the time and effort required to count the votes. By ignoring the speedy and efficient means of voting for such candidates provided by the regular operation of the machine, the voter casting an irregular vote would, to that extent, defeat the very purpose of using voting machines. When dealing with a comprehensive and carefully drawn legislative scheme for the conduct of elections, we must take care not to consider the particular elements of the scheme without regard to their place in the entire structure. Otherwise, the legislative plan may be frustrated by deviations, each seemingly reasonable in itself but destructive of the carefully designed structure.</p>

By forbidding write-in votes for candidates appearing on the machine, the Legislature has erected a considerable safeguard against the failure of the locking mechanism. Double voting for the same candidate is thereby entirely precluded. Even when double voting does occur, it will not affect the outcome unless there is a strong write-in candidate, actually competitive with those appearing on the ballot. While such situations are not unknown, see <em>Weber Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/399/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="399 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="1290582" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0037-01">399 Pa. 37</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20901" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="159 A.2d 901">159 A.2d 901</a> (1960), the more usual contest is between candidates who appear on the ballot (and therefore cannot benefit by double voting even if the locking mechanism fails).
