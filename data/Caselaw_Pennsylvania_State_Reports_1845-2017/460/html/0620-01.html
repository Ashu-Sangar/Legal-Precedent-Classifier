This waiver is clearly intentional, as appellant responded to a motion to quash the appeal for failure to comply with our Rule 44 by averring that the evidence had no connection to the questions involved, inasmuch as the instant appeal involves only the chancellor’s alleged error in making certain conclusions of law.</p>

This uncontested purpose in making the transfer distinguishes this case from those relied upon by appellant (with one exception to be noted below). In all of those cases, the purpose of placing title in the wife’s name rebutted the normal presumption of donative intent. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em><a href="/pa/406/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="406 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1304862" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0050-01">406 Pa. 50</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.2d%20673" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="176 A.2d 673">176 A.2d 673</a> (1962) (avoidance of claims of creditors); <em>Lapayowker </em>v. <em>Lincoln College Prep.

This surely is not inconsistent with a donative intent, but rather positively suggests such an intent.</p>
