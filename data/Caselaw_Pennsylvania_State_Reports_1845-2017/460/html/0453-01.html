That premise is not here present, for although James Masgai made the down payment on the new home, the mortgage debt which comprised the balance of the purchase price was assumed by both James and Gloria. The record is devoid of any showing that there was an understanding between James and Gloria that James was to satisfy this joint and several undertaking.
