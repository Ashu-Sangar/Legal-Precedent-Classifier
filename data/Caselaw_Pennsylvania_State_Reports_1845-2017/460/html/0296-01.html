Thompson dead from causes obviously other than natural. His head and body bore evidence of bruises and injuries apparently caused by blows inflicted by someone else. A canvass of individuals living in the neighborhood provided leads which led the police to the appellant Irwin who, when questioned, confessed participation in an assault on Thompson. In part, Irwin stated that on the afternoon of the day involved, he became intoxicated after sharing a bottle of wine with a friend, named “Jim”, who told him he knew a guy who had two hundred dollars in his pocket and was drunk. Under the guidance of “Jim”, the two then proceeded to an apartment on Spring Garden Street where they found a man [Thompson] in an inebriated condition. Irwin and his companion demanded the man’s money and when he failed to comply, Irwin “smacked him across the face with an open hand”. Irwin then kicked him in the ribs and “Jim” kicked him in the head. After searching the <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>victim’s pockets for money, Irwin and “Jim” dropped a sack of plaster on his unconscious body and left the scene. About an hour later Irwin returned to the apartment without “Jim” and found the man dead.</p>

    <p id="b458-5" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[274,649,1153,805]]]'>In order to establish the cause of death, the Commonwealth offered the testimony of a pathologist, Dr. Joshua Perper, who performed the autopsy. The witness stated that his examination disclosed Thompson suffered bruises and scrapings of the skin over the right side of the forehead; a one and one-quarter inch cut over the left eyebrow; multiple bruises in the area of the eyes, nose and cheek; a tear in the rear of the left ear; severe injuries to the neck; multiple bruises inside the mouth and a complete fracture of the jaw on both the right and left sides. He opined that death “occurred finally as the result of asphyxiation due to the tremendous amount of, large amount of blood pouring inside the upper respiratory passage. The source of this massive bleeding inside the upper air passages obviously came from the injuries</p>
    <p id="b458-6" data-blocks='[["BL_458.6",458,[276,1540,1152,203]]]'>The pathologist also testified that an examination of Thompson’s blood evidenced .43 alcoholic content. He discounted this as a contributing factor to the death when pressed as to this possibility on cross-examination.</p>
    <p id="b458-7" data-blocks='[["BL_458.7",458,[276,1775,1153,421]]]'>The photographs in controversy were taken at the direction of Dr. Perper immediately before the autopsy proceeded.
