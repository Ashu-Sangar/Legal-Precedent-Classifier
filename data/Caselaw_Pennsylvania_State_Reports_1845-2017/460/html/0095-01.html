He therefore claims denial of effective assistance of counsel. See Post Conviction Hearing Act § 3(c)(6), 19 P.S. § 1180-3(c) (6) (Supp.1974). Appellant asserts the most important of these alleged prejudicial trial deficiencies occurred because counsel relied on a self-defense theory despite Dancer’s refusal to admit that he had struck the fatal blow. Counsel’s utilization of this defense resulted in failure to exploit alternatives that, appellant claims, might have suggested to the jury that the deceased had not been mortally wounded by appellant. This defense also led counsel to refrain from objecting to portions of the court’s charge that were premised on the assumption that the victim’s death was attributable to Dancer.</p>

Counsel’s decision not to offer testimony suggesting a totally speculative intervening cause of death which could only tend to diminish the credibility of the defense without advancing it “had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interests.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

Despite appellant’s contention that the witnesses might have suggested that Tatum’s death did not result from his confrontation with appellant, his counsel could reasonably have feared that their testimony instead would bolster the Commonwealth’s case by filling the gaps in its evidence.
