    <p id="b776-4" data-blocks='[["BL_776.5",776,[281,516,1156,1017]]]'>Appellant, James Taylor, a/k/a Alonzo Robinson was adjudged guilty by a jury of aggravated robbery, assault with intent to kill, wantonly pointing a firearm, carrying concealed deadly weapons, and a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act. Post-trial motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial were filed and on the basis of two references during trial to “photographs” of appellant, the trial court granted appellant’s motion for a new trial. The Superior Court reversed the grant of a new trial, holding that the error (testimony referring to photographs of appellant) was harmless. <em>Commonwealth v.

This Court denied allocatur on June 5, 1972. Appellant, on remand, was then sentenced on July 7, 1972, to a four to ten year term of imprisonment. The Superior Court affirmed (obviously on the basis of its prior decision) in an opinionless per curiam order. <em>Commonwealth v.
