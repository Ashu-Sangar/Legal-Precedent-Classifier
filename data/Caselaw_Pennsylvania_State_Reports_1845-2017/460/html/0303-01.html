    <p id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[188,466,1145,533]]]'>On January 27, 1961, Frank Johnson, the appellant, appeared at a Philadelphia police station and voluntarily surrendered himself in connection with the fatal stabbing of his mother-in-law, Mattie Aquilar. Johnson gave a written confession to the police,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the essence of which was that Johnson had stabbed his mother-in-law the previous evening during the course of a heated argument, and while he was intoxicated. Johnson was thereupon formally arrested and charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter.</p>
    <p id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[187,1028,1145,530]]]'>On October 30, 1961, when his case was called for trial, appellant, represented by counsel, pleaded guilty to murder generally, the District Attorney certifying to the court that the crime rose no higher than murder in the second degree. After receiving evidence presented by the Commonwealth and appellant, the court accepted the plea and found appellant guilty of murder in the second degree. Sentence of imprisonment of ten to twenty years was imposed. No appeal was then taken from the judgment of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b463-6" data-blocks='[["BL_463.6",463,[185,1592,1146,257]]]'>During the next several years, Johnson unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the transcript of his degree of guilt hearing in order that he might challenge his conviction. Finally, in 1968, he filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for collateral relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Inexplicably, counsel was not appointed for this purpose until April 25, 1969, and even then, through no fault of appellant, no appeal was filed.</p>
    <p id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.4",464,[299,513,1159,312]]]'>In 1971, having served his minimum sentence, Johnson was released from custody and placed on parole. With the assistance of the Public Defender he then filed a second petition for post-conviction relief alleging, again, a denial of his right of appeal and, further, that his plea of guilty had not been entered voluntarily.</p>
    <p id="b464-5" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[290,850,1162,1294]]]'>An evidentiary hearing was held on this petition on January 31, 1973. By this time, both the judge who had accepted appellant’s guilty plea and appellant’s trial counsel were deceased, and the assistant district attorney who had prosecuted the case no longer possessed an independent recollection of the 1961 guilty plea proceedings. The sole witness available to testify at the hearing was, therefore, the appellant himself. He testified as to both issues raised in his petition, i. e. the failure of court-appointed counsel to assist him in filing the appeal nunc pro tunc as ordered by the court in 1968, and the circumstances surrounding his decision to enter a plea of guilty. The substance of appellant’s testimony with regard to the latter issue was that, although he had pleaded guilty upon the advice of counsel in order to avoid the imposition of the death penalty, his decision was, nevertheless, wholly uninformed. Specifically, Johnson stated that he had not been told, either by counsel or the trial court, of his right to trial by jury and to an appeal therefrom; of the presumption of innocence to which he would be entitled should he proceed to trial; of the nature of the' charges against him and the acts which comprised those crimes; nor, finally, of the possible defenses which might be available to him.</p>

The <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>hearing court declined, however, to pass on the merits of the claim that the guilty plea had been made involuntarily because, in his view, that issue would be cognizable on direct review. The court therefore denied post-conviction relief except for the right to appeal from the judgment of sentence.
