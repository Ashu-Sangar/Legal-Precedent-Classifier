Post-verdict motions were denied, and Wright was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction, and a concurrent term of imprisonment of ten to twenty years on the robbery conviction. This appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b407-7" data-blocks='[["BL_407.8",407,[178,1177,1147,422]]]'>The victim, one Karl Klaiss, was fatally shot on a Philadelphia street corner during a robbery on the evening of July 11, 1972. Police heard the shots and arrived on the scene in time to observe two men fleeing down an alley. A description of the two men was immediately sent out over police radio. Wright, who matched the broadcast description, was arrested one block from the scene of the crime approximately one hour after the shooting.</p>
    <p id="b407-8" data-blocks='[["BL_407.9",407,[178,1623,1147,311]]]'>Wright arrived at the Police Administration Building at approximately 12:30 A.M. the following morning. He was left alone in an interrogation room until 3:30 A.M., when he was given his <em>Miranda, </em>warnings and interviewed by police detectives. During this interview, Wright denied any participation in the crime.</p>

At 5:05 o’clock on the same <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>morning Wright was confronted with Jackson, who again admitted taking part in the robbery, and urged Wright to confess. Wright then did make an inculpatory statement. At trial this statement was admitted in evidence as part of the Commonwealth’s case, a motion to suppress it having been previously denied. The two contentions raised on this appeal are that, for different reasons, the admission of Wright’s confession was error requiring reversal. We do not agree.</p>

The court which heard Wright’s motion to suppress his statement ruled that the arrest was legal, but on post-verdict motions the trial court disagreed. Noting that about a dozen suspects matching the description broadcast by the police were arrested on the night of the shooting, the court ruled that Wright’s detention was part of an illegal “dragnet” arrest of the sort condemned by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b409-4" data-blocks='[["BL_409.4",409,[182,443,1146,367]]]'>We agree with the court below that the Commonwealth has met its burden on this issue.

It was this confrontation, rather than any exploitation of the circumstances of the arrest, which prompted his confession. <em>Commonwealth v.

We will not pass on this contention, for the issue has not been properly preserved for appellate review. Appellant’s suppression hearing took place one year after our decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

The court below was thus denied the opportunity to protect the trial proceedings from the alleged error.
