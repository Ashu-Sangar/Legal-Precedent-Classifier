Appellant contends that this statement should have been excluded because the prosecution failed to demonstrate that appellant’s police interrogators had afforded him an opportunity to exercise his <em>Miranda </em>rights <em>at the :point in time </em>when he made the inculpatory statement. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. 1602</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">16 L.

He contends that the twelve hour time lapse, the change of physical location between the place where <a id="p703" href="#p703" data-label="703" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*703</a>warnings were given and the place where the inculpatory statement was made, the break in the continuity of interrogation, the change of interrogators, and the material difference between the statements given following the initial <em>Miranda </em>warnings and those given twelve hours later, combine to compel the conclusion that the waiver given after the initial warnings was ineffective as to the statement given twelve hours later. We agree, and reverse appellant’s conviction and grant a new trial.</p>

Because an automobile registration card bearing appellant’s name was found on the victim’s body, the police went to appellant’s home several hours later and told him that he could help them by coming to the Police Administration Building to answer some general questions regarding the decedent. At 5:15 a. m., appellant and his wife appeared at the Police Administration Building. Appellant was not taken into an interrogation room, but was questioned in a large office which houses the Homicide Division.</p>

No further questions were asked, and appellant remained with his wife in the Homicide Division Office until 6:45 a. m. At that time Detective Basmajian re-warned the appellant, and questioned him for about one-half hour. Appellant was not isolated at this time or taken to any interrogation room.

No <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given. Appellant was interrogated by this detective from 5:30 to 6:00 p. m. He was alone from 6:00 to 6:20 p. m., and interrogated again from 6:20 to 6:45 p. m. At 6:45 p. m., Detective Smith entered the room. Shortly thereafter appellant gave a statement admitting the shooting.

In <em>Riggins </em>the delay between the <em>Miranda </em>warning and the confession was 17 hours; here it was 12 hours. In <em>Riggins </em>the warnings were given while the defendant was in a police patrol car but the confession was not made until after the defendant had been moved to the police station. Here both the warnings and the confession occurred within the Police Administration Building, but the confession came only after appellant had been moved out of the large Homicide Division Office where the warnings were given, into an interrogation room, and finally into a second interrogation room in which the confession was made. In <em>Riggins </em>the officer securing the confession was not the officer who gave the <em>Miranda </em>warnings; here the warnings were given by Detectives Bacher and Basmajian, neither of whom were present when the statement was made to Detectives Smith and Kuestner. In <em>Riggins </em>there was a “material difference” between the statements given to police immediately following a reading of the warnings and those given 17 hours later; here there was also a material difference between the statements given following the morning <em>Miranda </em>warnings and those given in the evening 12 hours later.</p>
