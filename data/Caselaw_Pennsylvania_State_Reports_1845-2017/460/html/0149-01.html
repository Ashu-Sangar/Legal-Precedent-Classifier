It established that on the night of December 19, 1971, the appellant shot and killed one Leonard Wilcox as Wilcox was riding as a guest passenger in an automobile driven by one Robert Fuller on Lancaster Avenue in the City of Philadelphia. Also in the car was Segers’ common-law wife, Margaret Lane. Miss Lane and Fuller both testified that immediately prior to the shootirg they had observed Segers following them in his own car as they drove through Philadelphia. Segers eventually pulled alongside the Fuller car, yelled “You all can’t come back to Jersey no more,” aimed a shotgun out of the window of his car, and fired. Wilcox was fatally wounded, and Margaret Lane slightly so. Both automobiles stopped after the shooting. Segers alighted from his car and exclaimed, <em>“I </em>told you I was going to get you.” The shooting apparently was the result of Segers’ belief that his common-law wife and Wilcox were lovers. Some three weeks previously Miss Lane had left Segers following an argument.</p>

When his second petition was filed, just prior to the cáse going to trial, Segers was sworn and took the stand to reiterate that his reason for requesting a change of counsel was due to a “conflict of interest,” adding that counsel had not obtained two witnesses for his defense.

Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, § 701, as amended, 18 P. S. | 4701 (repealed June 6, 1973). Those requirements have been met here. The evidence introduced at trial established that some days prior to the shooting, Segers observed Margaret Lane, his common-law wife, entering the automobile of Leonard Wilcox, the victim. An argu<a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>ment ensued and Segers stated that he did not want to see his wife in Wilcox’s automobile again. And on the night of the shooting, as recounted above, Segers followed the automobile in which Wilcox and Lane were passengers for a number of blocks in Philadelphia. When finally he was able to pull alongside that car, Segers aimed a shotgun out of his car window at the car in which the others were riding, yelled “You all can’t come back to Jersey no more” and fired, killing Wilcox. Alighting from his automobile, appellant boasted “I told you I was going to get you.” The evidence offered by the Commonwealth, which included Segers’ own voluntary confession, was more than sufficient for the jury to conclude that the shooting was not accidental, but premeditated and done with a specific intent to kill. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant has also alleged that the lower court erred in failing to suppress his confession because it was purportedly obtained in violation of Rule 118, Pa.R.Cr.P.

We need not, however, reach the merits of appellant’s claim that the confession was the product of an unnecessary delay between his arrest and preliminary arraignment. At the suppression hearing, defendant’s theory for moving to suppress the confession was that it was involuntarily obtained. No mention of any alleged unnecessary delay was made either then or at trial. It was not until his post-trial motions that the defendant raised this issue. Since the suppression hearing was held approximately seven months after our decision in Futch, we must hold that this alleged error has been waived. Commonwealth v.
