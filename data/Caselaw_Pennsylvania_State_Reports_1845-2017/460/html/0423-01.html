It is abundantly clear that the record is barren of any evidence to establish a settled purpose of relinquishment of parental rights. We have stated, even inaction or lack of interest in a child for a period in excess of six months will not conclusively establish the required settled purpose of relinquishment. This section has been interpreted as requiring a deliberate decision on the part of the parent to terminate the parental relationship and that parent must persist in <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>that determination throughout the six-month period.

We have stated that this portion of § 311(1) requires that a parent exert himself to take and maintain a place of importance in the child’s life. As a corollary, we required that a parent affirmatively demonstrate his love, protection and support of his child and to make every reasonable effort to maintain communication and association with that child. See <em>Adoption of McCray, supra; Appeal of Diane B., </em><a href="/pa/456/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="456 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="584423" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0429-01">456 Pa. 429</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=321%20A.2d%20618" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="321 A.2d 618">321 A.2d 618</a> (1974); <em>Jacono Adoption Case, supra. </em>These principles, however, are necessarily subject to the qualifications that the measures taken by the parent to demonstrate his interest and affection must be viewed in light of the existing circumstances. Here, it was amply clear the relationship between the appellee and his in-laws had deteriorated to such a state that further personal contact with them would only exacerbate an already potentially inflammatory situation. Recognizing the wisdom of the priest, he refrained from acceding to the normal impulse to see his child and sought legal assistance in achieving a way to re-establish the communication. Additionally, he made major alterations in his life style motivated primarily by his obvious intense desire to regain the custody of his daughter. Under the existing circumstances, the record establishes his love and affection and his actions fully comported with the requirement that he affirmatively demonstrate that affection.</p>

Appellants have laid great stress on the traumatic effect they allege would be associated with the child’s removal from the surroundings with which she has been familiar from birth (Debora was age eight at the time of the filing of the petition) and transplanted to what they suggest would be a foreign and unaccustomed environment. We are not unmindful of the adjustment that is required for a transition from one household to another. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Children’s Aid Society v.

To the contrary, the evidence strongly suggests that the father was unable to continue to maintain his relationship with his child primarily because of the attitude of the grandparents. Here, the father has done all that could be expected, with the resources available to him, to provide a fit and decent home for his child.
