He nevertheless refused to take the test. The Secretary of Transportation (Secretary), upon report of such refusal, suspended appellant’s motor vehicle operating privileges.

Appellant, however, contends that the term “arrest” as used in the instant section encompasses more than a factual determination that there has been a deprivation of a person’s liberty, but also requires a legal determination that the restraint of personal freedom was exercised in accordance with law. Specifically here, he is charging that since the arrest did not comport with the requirement of the Act of April 29, 1959, <em>supra, </em>the Secretary had no power to suspend operating privileges under § 624.1(a).</p>

The argument presently advanced is that the legislature in its use of the word “arrest” intended that power to be limited to those arrests that comported with the statutes and case law of this Commonwealth. Where the legislature intended to require a determination of the lawfulness of the arrest procedure, “they have on occasions expressed that intention by using the term 'lawful arrest’ ” e. g., 18 Pa.C.S. § 5104 (1973). Thus, if the legislature had wished to suggest a meaning other than the fact of arrest, as here sug<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>gested, it is reasonable to assume that they would have used more explicit language to convey that intention.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[269,421,1154,1181]]]'>Appellant is obviously correct in his assertion that courts in their effort to deter illegal arrests have extended the doctrine of exclusion to non-criminal proceedings where the fruits of that tainted arrest are sought to be introduced. <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan, </em><a href="/us/380/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="380 U.S. 693" data-case-ids="1524671" data-case-paths="/us/380/0693-01">380 U.S. 693</a>, <a href="/us/380/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="380 U.S. 693" data-case-ids="1524671" data-case-paths="/us/380/0693-01">85 S.Ct. 1246</a>, <a href="/us/380/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="380 U.S. 693" data-case-ids="1524671" data-case-paths="/us/380/0693-01">14 L.Ed.2d 170</a> (1965); <em>Leonardziak Liquor License Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/210/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="210 Pa.

It is equally beyond question, that the legislature in its wisdom may determine that certain types of evidence should be excluded, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5701-04, added by act of December 6, 1972 (P.L. 1482, No. 334) §§ 1-4 (1973). These principles, unfortunately, are of little assistance to appellant’s position. Here the obvious concern of the legislature was to define those factors upon which the Secretary’s power of revocation for refusal to submit to a breathalyzer depended. Section 624.1(a) confers the power of suspension where the enumerated <em>facts </em>have been determined to have occurred. There is, in our judgment, no indication from the language of this subsection that the legislature also intended by the use of the word “arrest” to limit the Secretary’s power of suspension depending upon the legality of the seizure of the person.</p>
    <p id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[266,1641,1153,698]],["BL_527.1",527,[195,313,1145,252]]]'>This conclusion is further strengthened by the proviso clause appearing in that section. The section itself limits the power to suspend for refusal to submit to the examination unless the test is administered by qualified personnel, with approved equipment and “at the direction of a police officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person to have been driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.” Acceptance of appellant’s theory would render the latter clause of the proviso redundant and violate the rule of statutory construction that requires that we read statutes so as to give effect to all of its provisions. Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a) (Special Pamphlet 1973). <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>Had the legislature intended to require a “lawful arrest” there would not have been a necessity to expressly require the police officer to act upon “reasonable grounds”. The probable cause requirement for a “lawful arrest” would have satisfied this end.</p>
    <p id="b527-5" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[198,595,1147,1185]]]'>Lastly, we do not believe this position is in any way inconsistent with the judicially determined policy to exclude the admission into evidence of the fruits of an illegal arrest. In this appeal, we are not called upon to pass upon the admissibility in a subsequent legal proceeding of the results of the examination if taken, where there has been an arrest which fails to meet the requirements of the laws of this Commonwealth. Nor are we persuaded that the objectives sought to be achieved by the doctrine of exclusion of the fruits of an illegal arrest would be necessarily furthered by superimposing this requirement upon the Secretary’s power to suspend operating privileges for the refusal to submit to a breathalyzer examination. Balancing the dangers presented to the public by intoxicated motorists and the pressing need to remove them from our roads against the contribution to the effectiveness, this requested interpretation, will provide in deterring illegal arrests (particularly, where the irregularity did not violate constitutional mandates), it is clear that there is little justification for straining the clear language of this section in an attempt to ascertain a legislative intent to incorporate such a limitation.</p>
    <p id="b527-6" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[193,1824,1152,529]],["BL_528.1",528,[296,323,1150,311]]]'>Therefore, we conclude that where it has been ascertained that the operator has been placed under arrest, charged with the crime of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and has refused the request to submit to a breathalyzer examination, the Secretary is vested with the discretion to suspend the driving privileges of the motorist. In testing the exercise of that discretion, section 624.1 has provided that the germane considerations should be whether the test was administered by a qualified person, using ap<a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>proved equipment and that the arrest was made by a police officer having reasonable grounds to believe that the motorist was operating while under the influence of alcohol. There being no question raised as to any of these factors in the instant appeal, the exercise of discretion by the Secretary cannot be successfully challenged.</p>
    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[295,687,1154,637]]]'>In a related argument, appellant asserts that the suspension of his operating privileges was accomplished without providing him with a “full and fair and meaningful hearing.” Appellant asserts that at the departmental hearing he was not permitted to develop in detail the circumstances of the accident which had precipitated this arrest. However, his attack was not addressed to the competency of the examiner, the accuracy of the equipment used or the information supplying the basis upon which the officer formed the belief that he was operating while under the influence of liquor. For these reasons this objection is also without merit.</p>

In addition to providing the Secretary with the suspension power for failure to submit to the breathalyzer test, the Legislature also provided that such refusal could be admitted into evidence at the subsequent criminal proceeding against the accused. Act of April 29, 1959, P.L. 58, § 624.1(h), as amended, 75 P.S. § 624.1(h) (Supp.1974). As such evidence could be properly introduced only as the product of a lawful arrest, any reading which would allow less than a lawful arrest would clearly be unconstitutional and be violative of the aforementioned rule of statutory construction. Moreover, it would be inconsistent to allow the Secretary’s suspension power to be triggered by an unlawful arrest, while requiring the presence of a lawful arrest before evidence of such refusal to submit to the test may be admitted at the criminal proceeding. As the Legislature cannot be considered to have intended an unreasonable or absurd result, 1 Pa. S. § 1922(1) (Supp. 1974); <em>Kurtz v.
