He planned to accomplish this liquidation by public auction. Before he had entered into a formal agreement with the auctioneer, a realtor approached the appellant and intimated that he had a purchaser available. Appellant informed the realtor that he fully intended to conclude an agreement for sale by auction unless, prior to that agreement, the realtor could <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>produce a purchaser willing to buy the entire tract at a specified price per acre. After this meeting, the realtor forwarded a registered letter to the appellant informing him that he, the realtor, had shown the property to the prospective purchaser, who remained interested.*</p>

Appellant relies on three grounds for reversal of the lower court. First, he alleges that the objectors presented no evidence. Second, he asserts that no reasonably prudent executor could have foreseen that the facts here could have been deemed to have created a contractual relationship. Finally, he maintains that even if a contractual relationship could <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>reasonably be assumed to have existed, the appellant’s failure to perceive that relationship was not “supine negligence” sufficient to impose surcharge.

Here, the fact of dual payment for realty commissions was admitted by all parties. As the lower court noted in its opinion: “Such a [double] payment is not a common or usual transaction in the normal course of business. The details as to how it came about ought to be put forth and scrutinized.” It is the duplication of commissions as opposed to the splitting of a commission which is suspect. <em>Cf. </em>Section 3360 of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code of 1972, 20 Pa. S. § 3360. Once the payment of <em>two full commissions </em>was conceded by the executor he had the burden of going forward with evidence establishing prudence, skill and due care. Thus, appellant’s first basis for reversal is without merit.</p>

      <em>our </em>consideration. The withdrawal of the appeal of the award to the realtor finally determined the existence of a contract between the parties to that action. The appellant cannot now plead the absence of a contract. Under criteria announced in this opinion, he is bound by the principles of collateral estoppel.</p>
    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[272,687,1153,803]]]'>Traditionally, collateral estoppel can only be invoked where there is a mutuality of estoppel, that is, both parties must be bound by the previous adjudication before either party can claim the benefits of that adjudication. Restatement of Judgments, § 93(b) (1942). That mutuality is absent here and, under a strict adherence to Restatement principles, the appellant could re-litigate the existence of a contractual relationship between himself and the real estate agent. However, Pennsylvania has never strictly adhered to the requirements of mutuality. <em>See Posternack v. American Casualty Co., </em><a href="/pa/421/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="421 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1900422" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0021-01">421 Pa. 21</a>, 25, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20350" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="218 A.2d 350">218 A.2d 350</a>, 352 (1966), and cases cited thereat.

    <p id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.6",444,[271,1523,1153,640]]]'>It seems unwise, though, to retain a rule whose potential for unfairness necessitates an <em>ad hoc </em>development of numerous exceptions. The rule sacrifices all consideration of judicial economy to satisfy a judicial desire for symmetry: unless both parties are bound by the former action, neither can plead it in the latter one. But Judge Hastie in <em>Bruszewski v. United States, </em><a href="/f2d/181/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="181 F.2d 419" data-case-ids="1246864" data-case-paths="/f2d/181/0419-01">181 F.2d 419</a>, 421 (3d Cir. 1950), recognized that “no unfairness results . from estoppel which is not mutual.

      <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>The assault upon the requirement of mutuality began with Justice (later Chief Justice) Traynor’s opinion in <em>Bernhard v.

If the appellant were allowed to demonstrate the absence of a contract in the surcharge action, a contradictory result would occur. The estate would have suffered an obviously unnecessary expense of a type normally recoverable from the executor. Yet the beneficiaries could not successfully surcharge the executor for the loss. Thus, the estate would lose because there was a contract and the beneficiaries because there was not. Clearly, collateral estoppel must be a permissible plea to avoid such a contradiction.</p>

No executor has the discretion to inadvertently enter into a second realty contract and unintentionally incur the expense of a double commission. Hence, the executor must be held to the usual standard of prudent due care. When this standard is applied to the facts presented, we must conclude that the executor acted imprudently. The executor did not cautiously engage the realtor, but conducted himself in such a manner that a jury concluded a contract existed. No man of <em>ordinary </em>prudence carelessly enters into two contracts for the sale of valuable property. The conclusion of the second contract, when unwittingly created, subjected the estate to an unnecessary expense for which the executor was properly surcharged.</p>

Although the question is not before us today, an exception to this general rule might be necessary to accomplish substantial justice where successive litigation of identical issues by several plaintiffs is likely. In such cases, if mutuality were completely abandoned a common defendant might successfully defend several actions, lose one and be subjected to a plea of collateral estoppel for the remaining cases. <em>See </em>B. Currie, Mutuality of Collateral Estoppel: Limits of the Bernhard Doctrine, 9 Stanford L.Rev. 281, 308 et seq. (1957) and cases and examples there cited.</p>

What constitutes a full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue can itself be a very complicated determination. <em>See </em>Currie, <em>supra </em>note 7, and H. Semmel, Collateral Estoppel, Mutuality and Joinder of Parties, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%201457" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="68 Colum. L.

Here, the appellant’s liability to the beneficiaries as a group is fixed by the determination of his contractual indebtedness to the realtor. It differs from the multiple suits excluded from the general rule where monetary liability is limited only by the damage incurred by all possible plaintiffs. Here, liability is fixed whether there be one beneficiary or one thousand.</p>
