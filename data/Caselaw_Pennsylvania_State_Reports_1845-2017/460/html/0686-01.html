He was then questioned briefly beginning at 5:10 a. m. Initially, he denied involvement in the Bodenstein robbery and killing. He was then asked if he were willing to take a polygraph examination. He agreed and was accompanied to a polygraph room at 5:55 a. m. The polygraph examination was completed at 7:30 a. m. Hamilton was then questioned for one-half hour. At 9:00 he was fed a sandwich and coffee. Immediately thereafter, at 9:25 a. m., Hamilton admitted his implication in the Bodenstein crimes. From 9:25 until 11:45 a. m., he related the details of his participation. Following a short luncheon break, a formal statement was recorded on a typewriter between 12:08 p. m. and 2:17 p. m. When finished the statement was read to Hamilton and he signed it at 2:50 p. m.</p>

This Court has held similar delays to be primarily administrative and, hence, necessary. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

Aside from the questions submitted as part of the polygraph examination, the questioning during this period consumed only a little over one-half hour. The subsequent formal statement was merely a reiteration of what Hamilton had already admitted. Under these circumstances, these incriminating statements were <a id="p694" href="#p694" data-label="694" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*694</a>not reasonably related to the delay in arraignment.

Both Hamilton and Denise Ingram testified at trial, substantially in accord with the contents of these two statements. Moreover, since Hamilton’s initial incriminating statement and his recorded statement were properly admitted into evidence at trial, there was overwhelming evidence of Hamilton’s guilt apart from any incriminations included in these subsequent statements.

The jury retired to begin its deliberation at 1:12 p. m. on March 16th. During the next three days, the jury spent more than twenty-eight hours in actual deliberation. On the morning of March 19th, the fourth day of deliberation, the trial judge instructed the jury to continue to deliberate, and to use all reasonable efforts to arrive at a unanimous decision. The trial judge indicated that, in view of the impending weekend, if a unanimous verdict was not reached by mid-afternoon, the jury would be discharged. The jury continued to deliberate, with only a break for lunch, until 5:15 p. m. The trial judge, despite his earlier intention to discharge the jury, informed the members of the jury, that at the request of both the assistant district attorney and defense counsel, he was directing them to continue to deliberate over the weekend. A colloquy between the trial judge and several jurors ensued, during which several jurors indicated that further deliberation would be useless, since the jury was deadlocked. Despite this, the trial judge ordered the jury to <a id="p695" href="#p695" data-label="695" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*695</a>deliberate over the weekend. As the jurors filed out of the court room, several were hysterical, while others wept and became emotionally upset. The jurors declined to eat their dinners. One juror became nauseated. Another with a heart condition began experiencing chest pains. A juror refused to return to the jury room and resume deliberation. After the trial judge and both counsel had been informed of the state the jury was in, defense counsel stated there was now no question but that the jury should be discharged. Upon inquiry by the trial court, the jury foreman responded that further deliberation would be futile because the jury was hopelessly deadlocked. Asked if they disagreed with the foreman’s assessment, the other jurors remained silent. The trial judge then declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.</p>

The record clearly discloses that Hamilton’s counsel consented to the discharge of the jury and the grant of a mistrial. Moreover, there was “manifest necessity” for the declaration of a mistrial. The jury, after thirty hours of deliberation over a four-day period, had twice declared themselves hopelessly deadlocked. Several jurors were hysterical over the prospect of further confinement, and at least two jurors became ill. In <em>Commonwealth v. Kent, </em>supra, the jury after forty hours of deliberation over a three-day period, declared themselves hopelessly deadlocked. One of the jurors became ill and required medical attention. Under those circumstances, this Court held the trial court’s declaration of a mistrial to be based on “manifest necessity”, thus permitting retrial. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa/451/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="451 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="1948623" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0395-01">451 Pa. 395</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20876" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="301 A.2d 876">301 A.2d 876</a> (1973). In light of these precedents, the trial court was warranted in dismissing the jury and <a id="p697" href="#p697" data-label="697" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*697</a>granting a mistrial. Hence, subsequent retrial on the same charges did not constitute double jeopardy.</p>
    <p id="b855-4" data-blocks='[["BL_855.4",855,[157,436,1149,260]]]'>Finally, Hamilton contends he was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial because of prejudicial and inflammatory remarks in the prosecution’s final argument to the jury. During summation, the assistant district attorney used the following language to the jury:</p>
    <blockquote id="b855-5" data-blocks='[["BL_855.5",855,[202,719,1103,370]]]'>“Now, it’s difficult at best to live in a community of Philadelphia where crime has been so rampant that people are afraid to walk the streets.
