    <p id="b668-5" data-blocks='[["BL_668.5",668,[279,548,1154,577]]]'>The appellant was found guilty of sodomy by a jury. The victim was a twenty-two year old retarded man who had the mental ability of a first or second grade child and the emotional stability of an even younger child. The sole issue in this case is whether the Commonwealth proved the date of the crime with sufficient particularity to uphold the conviction. The only proof at trial was that the crime occurred some time within a fourteen-month period from February 1971 to April 1972. On this issue of first impression in this Court, we granted allocatur and now reverse.</p>
    <p id="b668-6" data-blocks='[["BL_668.6",668,[276,1171,1151,493]]]'>The victim had been in a State school for the mentally retarded since 1964. At this school, he had been given vocational training which led to his ability to perform certain basic and repetitious types of work. Subsequently, he became employed in the City of Altoona by a clothing manufacturer although he remained under the general supervision of the State school. He received his earnings directly and he lived in the community with other retarded persons.</p>
    <p id="b668-7" data-blocks='[["BL_668.7",668,[275,1702,1151,637]]]'>Shortly after his employment began, the victim began to exhibit difficulty in managing his own financial affairs. Therefore, a social worker at the State school contacted the appellant, age fifty-two and an employee of another social agency, and made arrangements with the appellant to receive the earnings of the victim from his employer and to supervise these funds so that the victim would receive a proper diet and have his obligations paid. The appellant assumed these duties in February of 1971 and thereafter the victim went twice daily to the home of the appellant to procure money for lunch and dinner.</p>

He told the two officers that acts of sodomy had been perpetrated upon him by the appellant and he gave the officers Devlin’s name, address and license number. The officers took the victim home and reported the incident to their commanding officer.</p>

Other witnesses for the Commonwealth gave testimony which would prove the continuing financial arrangement between the victim and the appellant from February 1971 to the date the crime was reported on April 14,1972.</p>
    <p id="b669-6" data-blocks='[["BL_669.6",669,[193,1762,1147,475]]]'>The defense attempted, during its cross-examination of the victim, to discredit the testimony of the victim by showing that two of the victim’s friends had encouraged him to falsely accuse the defendant of this licentious behavior so that the victim would receive more of his own money from the appellant.

As a general proposition of law, the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if it tends to prove that the offense was committed prior to the commencement of the prosecution and that it was not committed at a time so remote that its prosecution is barred by the prescribed statutory period of limitations. <em>Commonwealth v. Weiss, </em><a href="/pa/284/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="284 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1092080" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0105-01">284 Pa. 105</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.%20403" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="130 A. 403">130 A. 403</a> (1925); <em>Commonwealth v.

However, the rule announced in <em>Levy </em>contains another requirement: the date of the commission of the offense must be <em>“fixed with reasonable certainty.” </em>We do not feel that the Commonwealth’s proof to the effect that the crime was committed on any single day within a fourteen-month period meets the “sufficient particularity” standard of <em>Levy. </em>To hold otherwise would violate the notions of fundamental fairness embedded in our legal process.</p>

Two reasons support our rejection of that proposition: First, although an alibi defense is the most obvious reason for the rule, the lack of a sufficiently particular date in the prosecution’s proof can hamstring the defense in other ways. In this trial, for instance, the credibility of the victim was a serious issue. The appellant, because he did not have a sufficiently particular period of time to defend was precluded from further attacking the credibility of the victim by showing (1) behavior of the victim after the incident which was inconsistent with the extremely severe conduct to which the victim was allegedly subjected, and (2) the physical and emotion trauma which would have necessarily resulted therefrom.

Although the issue raised by appellant here is not strictly one of variance, it is apparent that the same considerations which measure the fairness of a variance between indictment and proof <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>must be utilized to test the reasonableness of the interval of time in which it is proved that the crime has been committed.</p>
