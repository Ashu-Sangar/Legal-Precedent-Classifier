Prior to trial, the appellant made a timely application to suppress evidence seized during a search of his apartment. Relief was denied, and the evidence seized formed the basis for appellant’s conviction. Post-verdict motions were denied. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the conviction. <em>Commonwealth v.

The listing of the address in the affidavit informs the neutral judicial officer of the premises which the police want to search, but the mere request to search a particular premises, in and of itself, does not justify the issuance of a search warrant. <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>and <em>Spinelli, <a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">supra,</a> </em>require the affiant to aver underlying facts and circumstances sufficient to establish probable cause and thus justify the issuance of the warrant.

A reading of the affidavit here reveals that the police informant said that “the <em>above named defendant </em>[William Barton] did have <em>in his apartment </em>approximately thirty pounds of marijuana.” This informant also said that “he had occasion to be inside the above location and did observe numerous persons entering the above location and hand to the above [William Barton] $200 in U.S. currency at which time the subject [William Barton] would <em>go into his bedroom and upon returning </em>hand to the persons a brick of ground green weed weighing approximately one pound.” (Emphasis added.) We have inserted the name of William Barton in brackets <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>where there is reference to an individual because such references could not apply to any other person; William Barton was the only person mentioned in the affidavit.</p>
    <p id="b753-4" data-blocks='[["BL_753.4",753,[141,508,1155,1839]],["BL_754.1",754,[302,307,1151,95]]]'>There is no reference in the application to the appellant, William Muscheck. Thus, the references in the affidavit to “his apartment,” and to “his bedroom” appear to be references to William Barton’s apartment and bedroom. Since the affidavit says that William Barton’s residence is “1008 S. 49th Street,” the common sense conclusion would be that “his apartment” and “his bedroom” would be located at 1008 S. 49th Street. There are no factual averments in the affidavit indicating what connection, if any,' the informant had, with the premises to be searched located at 1633 Locust Street. The prosecution argues that William Barton is averred to be the “owner, occupant of the premises” located at 1633 Locust even though he resided at 1008 S. 49th Street. According to the prosecution, the informant could have been speaking of the premises at 1633 Locust Street when the informant spoke of being in Barton’s apartment and seeing Barton go into his bedroom. No doubt the underlying circumstances provided by the informant <em>could </em>have meant that he had visited the premises located at 1633 Locust Street on numerous occasions, but from the factual averments in the affidavit, the informant <em>could </em>also have meant that on numerous occasions he had visited the premises located at 1008 S. 49th. It is certainly not clear from the affidavit that the informant was referring to 1633 Locust Street. When one speaks of a person’s apartment or bedroom, one is normally speaking of a person’s residence, unless additional information is provided indicating that a place other than the person’s residence is being referred to. The uncontradicted record here, however, shows that appellant was the lessee of the apartment searched, and that nothing was found during the search which in any way connected William Barton with that apartment. The affidavit before us is at <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>best ambiguous, and such ambiguity prevents the warrant from meeting the <em>A guilar-Spinelli </em>test.</p>
    <p id="b754-4" data-blocks='[["BL_754.4",754,[295,458,1157,1017]]]'>Even, however, if we were to consider the underlying facts and circumstances alleged in the affidavit as adequate to establish that the informant was present and witnessed sales at 1633 Locust Street, the search cannot be upheld. The facts and circumstances recited in the affidavit describing the apartment to be searched do not fit the actual physical layout of the apartment searched. The informant told the police that he saw Barton “go into his bedroom and upon returning” hand over a brick of ground green weed. A common sense reading of that description of the apartment where the “informant witnessed the sales indicates that it had a separate bedroom. The uncontradicted testimony at the suppression hearing, including the testimony of the two police officers who conducted the search, indicates that the apartment searched does not have a separate bedroom. One officer said, “it’s almost all one big room, just has certain portions of it cut down for various areas.” He further described it during cross-examination:</p>
