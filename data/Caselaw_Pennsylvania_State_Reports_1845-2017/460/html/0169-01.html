Appellant contends the trial court erred in ac-cepting his guilty plea because certain evidence, present-ed by stipulation, indicated a possibility of accidental homicide or the defense of self-defense. Specifically, ap-pellant claims Ms statement to the police introduced into evidence through the stipulation, emphasizes that he unintentionally fired the weapon.

After inquiring what there was to eat, the appellant went over to the oven and placed Ms hand into the pot, hoping to retrieve some ham. Before he could remove his hand from the pot, Elizabeth put the lid down upon it. The appellant pushed Ms wife away and went upstairs to the bedroom where he took his loaded gun from the dresser. He proceeded back downstairs and confronted his wife. While pointing the gun at her, the appellant said, “I know you been running around with John.” After denying the accusation, Elizabeth swung a butcher knife at the appellant. Although the appellant told his wife to back off and fired a shot at the floor, she again swung her arm at the appellant and this time she knocked his hat off. As he reached down to pick up his hat, the gun discharged, killing Ms wife. An autopsy report revealed that death resulted from a gunshot wound of the tjr~uek of the body.</p>

He claims he carried the gun downstairs only to scare his wife and that he accidentally fired the fatal shot while bending down to retrieve his fallen hat. A similar contention was advanced and rejected by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Chruscial, </em><a href="/pa/447/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="447 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1942971" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0017-01">447 Pa. 17</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20521" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="288 A.2d 521">288 A. 2d 521</a> (1972). Therein, the defendant testified at the time of the acceptance of his guilty plea, that he had visited the decedent carrying a loaded shotgun, seeking a reconciliation of past differences. He stated he took the shotgun along only to frighten her. A struggle ensued during which the shotgun went off, killing the decedent. In concluding the testimony failed to establish a defense, we said, “Accepting the testimony of Chruscial as true, it is clear it did not establish an excusable homicide or homicide by misadventure. To be such, the act resulting in death must, inter alia, be lawful. Pointing a 'firearm at another human being, even to scare, is not a lawful act in Pennsylvania.” <em>Commonwealth v. Chruscial, </em>supra, at 20, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20521" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="288 A.2d 521">288 A.2d at 523</a>.

As we recognized in <em>Commonwealth v. Blackman, </em>supra, a valid claim of self-defense cannot be made out by the killer when the killer introduces a weapon into the encounter without provocation. Such introduction operates to deny the killer’s assertion that he was free from fault in provoking the difficulty. Since the stipulated facts indicate that appellant brought the gun downstairs and pointed it at his wife prior to her lunging at him with the aforementioned knife, we must conclude the defense of self-defense was not established.</p>

He cites two decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which purport to interpret this Commonwealth’s law, in support of the proposition that, before a guilty plea is accepted, the trial court must inform the defendant of all possible defenses available to him.

Recognizing the difficulty in formulating a comprehensive list of questions a judge must ask of a defendant in determining whether the defendant understands the impact and consequences of his plea, the Comment to Rule 319 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, 19 P.

The appellant, by his responses, clearly demonstrated an understanding of his rights and an awareness of the nature and consequences of his guilty plea.
