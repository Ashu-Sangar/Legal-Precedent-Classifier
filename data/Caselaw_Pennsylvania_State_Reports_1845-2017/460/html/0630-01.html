As they left the motel they encountered police officers Carey and Yarrington, who sought to apprehend them. The police officers engaged in a struggle with Hogg and, while they were struggling, Dobrolenski pointed a gun at the officers and fired several shots, which fatally wounded the officers. This evidence is sufficient to support a finding of murder in the first degree either as a felony murder or a willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing.

The crimes were committed on January 5, 1972, and Dobrolenski was arrested and arraigned on January 6. On February 10, a motion for change of venue was filed, alleging that “the incident, the alleged perpetrators, the victims and their families have been the subject of intensive and extensive publicity by all the mass media” to a degree unprecedented in the history of Delaware County. It was contended that, because of this publicity, it would be impossible to impanel an impartial jury. On February 25, a hearing was held and the motion was denied.</p>

Under such circumstances, the election is clearly binding upon the appellant.”</blockquote>

There are two principal difficulties with this approach. First, many existing standards of acceptability tolerate considerable knowledge of the case and even an opinion on the merits on the part of the prospective juror. And even under a more restrictive standard, there will remain the problem of obtaining accurate answers on <em>voir dire </em>— is the juror consciously or subconsciously harboring prejudice against the accused resulting from widespread news coverage in the community? Thus if the change of venue . [is] to be of value, [it] should not turn on the results of <em>voir dire; rather </em>[ii] <em>should constitute [an] independent </em>[remedy] <em>designed to assure fair trial when news coverage has raised substantial doubts about the effectiveness of the voir dire standing alone.</em>

Knowing conditions in the community, he may be more inclined to accept a particular juror, even one who has expressed an opinion, than to take his chances with other less desirable jurors who may be waiting in the wings. And yet to make a record for appellate review, he must object as much as possible and use up his peremptory challenges as well. This dilemma seems both unnecessary and undesirable.</blockquote>

Moreover, when the motion was heard, the most recent of the allegedly prejudicial articles was six weeks old. The court might properly have concluded that, absent further prejudicial publicity, the effect of the news coverage complained of could sufficiently dissipate by the probable time of trial (especially in view of the possibility of continuances for the purpose of dissipating that effect).

The trial was about to begin more than five months after the last of the articles in question was published when it was aborted by Dobrolenski’s plea of guilty.

In these circumstances, we cannot say that it was error to deny the motion for change of venue made in February.

The Commonwealth recognizes this but offers an evidentiary record, not present in those cases, purporting to show that there has been no discrimination in the imposition of the death penalty on the basis of race, wealth, or nature of the proceeding leading to conviction (jury trials vs. pleas of guilty). However, as we recognized in the above cases, <em>Furman </em>holds that “the imposition of the death penalty <em>under statutes, such as here involved, </em>is violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.” <em>Commonwealth v. Scoggins, </em>supra, 451 Pa. at 481, <a href="/citations/?q=304%20A.2d%20102" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="304 A.2d 102">304 A.2d at 108</a> (emphasis added). Had we viewed evidence of the actual application of the statute as necessary for determination of its constitutionality, we would have directed evidentiary hearings in those cases. As we understand <em>Furman, </em>the constitutional prohibition extends at least to all death sentences imposed pursuant to statutes which give the sentencing authority unfettered discretion in imposition of the death penalty. Because this <em>statute </em>gives such discretion, the constitution forbids the execution of any death sentences imposed under its authority.</p>

The Commonwealth also contends that the <em>pre-Furman </em>statute is saved from the strictures of <em>Furman </em>by the existence of “standards applicable ... to determine whether the penalty in a first degree murder should be life [imprisonment] or death.” This contention refers not to the sort of legislatively mandated standards now prescribed by 18 Pa.C.S. § 1311(d) but simply to an indefinite, non-exclusive, and non-binding list of factors such as “the nature of the crime,” “the defendant’s physical condition, mental capacity, his past history, his age, discretion, and <em>anything else [the jury considers] important as having a bearing on the punishment to be inflicted.” </em>(emphasis added). This argument need not long detain us, for such “standards” were applicable in the same informal fashion under all the statutes before the United States Supreme Court in <em>Furman </em>and were necessarily rejected as a ground for sustaining those statutes. Thus <em>Furman </em>forecloses this argument.</p>
