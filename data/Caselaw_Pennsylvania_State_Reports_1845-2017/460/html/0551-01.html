Act of 1925, <em>supra, </em>§ 1. We therefore conclude that the order of the court, granting the request for a preliminary injunction was, in fact, a denial of appellants’ motions attacking jurisdiction. The assumption of jurisdiction is at least an implicit ruling that the court has the jurisdiction to act in the matter. This order was entered and docketed on September 26,1973.</p>

This argument is predicated upon the assumption that the crucial time is the date that the restraining or<a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>der became effective and not the date of its entry. Under the terms of the court’s order and pursuant to Pa.R. Civ.Proc. 1531(b), the restraining order was not to become effective until the bond required was approved by the court. The filing of an approved bond occurred on October 1, 1973. We must disagree with appellants’ premise. If this were an appeal from the restraining order itself, the argument <em>might he </em>more persuasive. Here, however, our concern is the denial of the preliminary objections. Under the Act of 1925, our inquiry is limited to the question of jurisdiction and the ineffectiveness of the court action for any other reason is immaterial. <em>Emerson v. Billingsley, supra; Studio Theaters, Inc. v. Washington, </em><a href="/pa/418/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="418 Pa. 73" data-case-ids="1896121" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0073-01">418 Pa. 73</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20802" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="309 A.2d 802">309 A.2d 802</a> (1965). The operative event was the determination that the court had jurisdiction. Whether or not that order might have been ineffective for another reason would not prevent an appeal as to the propriety of the court’s decision that it had the power to act.</p>

In that decision, we entertain an appeal from the issuance of a preliminary injunction even though the bond had not been entered at the time of the filing of the appeal. There this Court was called upon to determine <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>whether the preliminary injunction should have been issued. In that case the appeal was pursuant to the Act of 1866, February 14, P.L. 28, § 1, 12 P.S. § 1101.
