A hearing was held shortly thereafter and the matter was continued in order to afford the appellant, á Kansas resident, an opportunity to obtain certified copies of records filed in the District Court of Pratt County, Kansas. After an additional hearing was held, in an opinion and decree dated August 2, 1973, the Blair County Court held that Mr. McAhren had abandoned his children for periods exceeding six months in accordance with Section 311 of the 197,0 Adoption Act, thereby forfeiting his parental rights, and granted appellees’ petition for adoption.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Following appellant’s filing of exceptions to the August <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>ruling, the trial court reaffirmed its previous findings and confirmed its prior decree.

We hold that the evidence does not justify the termination of appellant’s parental rights under Section 311(1) and hence vacate the lower court decree.</p>
    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.6",225,[145,964,1147,644]]]'>The facts underlying this appeal are as follows: On August 17, 1959, Clarence McAhren and Edith Malach were married. Following their marriage, Mrs. Malach gave birth to three sons: Mark Clarence McAhren on March 3, 1961, in Stafford, Kansas; Scott Eric McAhren on August 30, 1963, in Pratt, Kansas; and Kent Allen McAhren on December 29, 1967, in Altoona, Pennsylvania. On January 8, 1968, the McAhrens were divorced by a decree entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County and thereafter on October 26, 1968, Mr. and Mrs. Malach were married. Appellant’s three sons have since resided with the Malachs in Altoona, Pennsylvania.</p>

No. 291, § 42, 62 P.S. § 2043-1 et seq., the appellant was directed to pay $100.00 monthly, beginning in February 1969, for the support and maintenance of his three children. Subsequently, the monthly support was increased by order of the same court dated October 18,1971, to the sum of $150.00.</p>

      <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>At the adoption hearings below it was established that payments had been made beginning in February 1969 and continuing through October of 1971. However, whether payments were made after October 1971 was hotly contested. Although appellant’s attorney presented certified records from the Pratt County Court indicating that payments in November and December of 1971 had been forwarded to Mrs. Malach, it was not resolved whether such payments were actually received. Appellees strenuously denied ever receiving any support checks after October of 1971, and it was established that payments had not been forwarded to the Malachs in or after January of 1972. In defense of his apparent non-compliance with the October 1971 support order, Mr. McAhren alleged that payments covering the first six months of 1972 had been impounded by the Pratt County Court. In further support of his contention, appellant’s counsel produced Pratt County records indicating that a $900.00 payment had, in fact, been placed in escrow on June 14, 1972, a month prior to the first adoption hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Prior difficulties in this regard had temporarily been resolved subsequent to appellant’s filing of a habeas corpus petition in March of 1971. Pursuant to this petition, on June 10, 1971, the Blair County Court ruled that appellant be" given the right to temporary custody of his children from June 13 <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>to July IB each year commencing in June of 1971.

The testimony at the hearings established that following at least one letter in the Fall of 1971, McAhren sent his boys two Christmas cards as well as a Christmas letter asking what gifts the boys might desire. Nevertheless, these and subsequent communications went unanswered. Further, the appellees admitted that some time after the children’s summer visit to their father’s farm, a package, sent from Kansas and addressed to the McAhren boys, was refused by Mrs. Malach, that appellant’s eldest son received a birthday card from Mr. McAhren in March of 1972 and that in either October or November of 1971, an “unidentified long distance caller” tried to reach the McAhren boys. Appellant claimed that the preceding uncontested communications were not the extent of his efforts, but that other attempts to telephone, write and send gifts were thwarted by the Malachs. In further and final support of his contentions, appellant was able to establish that in early June of 1972, his local counsel wrote the Malachs of his desire to again obtain temporary custody of the boys. In response to this letter, appellant was advised that visitation privileges would be refused and that an adoption petition had been filed.</p>

As a result of appellant’s efforts, in September of 1970 and March of 1971, the Pratt County Court ordered that support payments be impounded by the court clerk until such time as reasonable visitation rights were granted. Consequently, appellant had a history of escrow payments. Moreover, although visitation privileges were finally adjudicated in the Blair County Court in June of 1971, appellant contends that his most recent withholding of payments was in compliance with the 1971 Kansas court order.</p>

Further, there was testimony by the eldest son that he was angry with his natural father and wished to be adopted. Although such feelings are unfortunate, we are cognizant that an adolescent’s emotions toward a parent often change by adulthood. Nevertheless, should this son still wish to be adopted when he reaches eighteen, the law permits him to do so. <em>Sarvar Adoption Case, </em><a href="/pa/444/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="444 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="1938646" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0507-01">444 Pa. 507</a>, 511, <a href="/citations/?q=281%20A.2d%20890" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="281 A.2d 890">281 A.2d 890</a>, 892 (1971).</p>

It is unclear why this appellant did not pursue the legal avenues already available to him, namely, court enforcement of the June 1971 Blair County Court visitation order. However, by the same token, there was no explanation why appellees did not pursue their legal alternative of enforcing the October 1971 Blair County Court support order before resorting to adoption proceedings.</p>
