        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from a final order of the Commonwealth Court, which reversed a Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (board) award to appellant, John Z. Fry. We granted allocatur and now reverse the Commonwealth Court.\nThe facts surrounding this appeal are as follows: On August 9, 1969, appellant suffered a compensable back injury while employed as a truck driver for appellee Calcite Quarry Corporation. Orthopedic surgery was performed by Dr. Thomas Forker, resulting in the removal of four herniated discs. Appellant then returned to work as a truck driver on March 16, 1970, under instructions from Dr. Forker not to lift anything weighing more than twenty-five to thirty-five pounds, and he was also required to wear a back brace. Appellee-employer was aware of these restrictions, which were still in effect at the time of the injury involved in this appeal.\nOn January 15, 1971, appellant sustained further back injuries while unloading one-hundred-pound bags of salt from the tailgate of one of appellee\u2019s trucks. As a result of these injuries, on April 23, 1971, a lumbosacral spine fusion was performed by Dr. Forker on the same area of the back previously injured. Appellant was discharged from the hospital on May 21, 1971. On July 14, 1971, appellant suffered a heart attack which Dr. Forker related to appellant\u2019s back injury.\nOn March 29, 1971, appellant filed a claim with the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. A hearing before a referee was scheduled for July 21, 1971, but had to be postponed because of appellant\u2019s heart attack. A hearing was held on March 29, 1972, before Referee Perna, and on November 16, 1972, an award in favor of appellant was handed down. On December 26, 1972, appellee filed an appeal to the board, and on September 28, 1973, the board affirmed the award and dismissed appellee\u2019s appeal. On October 17, 1973, appellee filed an appeal to the Commonwealth Court from the order of the board. On July 18, 1974, the Commonwealth Court, in a four-three decision, reversed the award of the referee and board. We granted allocatur to clarify \u201cthe unusual strain doctrine\u201d in workmen\u2019s compensation cases and the sufficiency of the evidence in the instant case concerning the cause of appellant\u2019s heart attack.\nAppellant first argues that the Commonwealth Court erred in not sustaining the findings of the referee and the board that on January 15, 1971, an \u201caccident\u201d occurred within the ambit of the \u201cunusual strain doctrine\u201d which would allow recovery under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nBoth parties agree that on January 15, 1971, appellant incurred a back injury while unloading one-hundred-pound bags of salt from the tailgate of one of appellee\u2019s trucks. The controversy is centered around whether this injury constitutes an \u201caccident\u201d within the \u201cunusual strain doctrine\u201d and, therefore, is a compensable injury under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. An \u201caccident\u201d within the \u201cunusual strain doctrine\u201d occurs when a claimant suffers an injury resulting from overexertion or an unusual strain from an activity which is not within his normal work duties. See Hamilton v. Procon, Inc., 434 Pa. 90, 252 A.2d 601 (1969). The referee made two specific findings of fact dealing with the injury incurred on January 15, 1971, which support a finding of an \u201caccident\u201d:\n\u201c2. On January 15, 1971, the [appellant] Claimant was helping to unload a truckload of salt. The salt was packed in bags weighing 100 pounds. In the process of doing so the Claimant injured his back.\n\u201c3. As a result of said accident and injury, the Claimant was disabled and not able to work for the period beginning January 15,1971 to the present.\u201d\nTo support a finding that the injury was within the meaning of the \u201cunusual strain doctrine,\u201d appellant testified that since he began his employment with appellee in 1969, he had never loaded or unloaded trucks; rather, he was only a truck driver. Further, George Patton, president of appellee corporation, testified only as to the general duties of truck drivers, not the work performed by appellant. Under these facts we agree with the referee that the injury was within the \u201cunusual strain doctrine.\u201d\nAppellant finally argues that the Commonwealth Court erred in finding insufficient evidence to sustain the findings of the referee that there was a relationship between the injury of January 15, 1971, and appellant\u2019s heart attack of July 14, 1971. We agree. Appellant presented Dr. Forker, the orthopedic surgeon who performed the two lower back operations. He stated that in his opinion the two back operations were contributing causes to the emotional stress and anxiety which caused the heart attack. While Dr. Forker was not the attending physician for appellant at the time of his treatment in the intensive care unit, he was familiar with appellant\u2019s medical background, and in Dr. Forker\u2019s medical opinion there was a causal connection between appellant\u2019s back injury and heart attack. That finding was accepted by the referee and affirmed by the board and we find no reason to disturb that finding. See Utter v. Asten-Hill Mfg. Co., 453 Pa. 401, 309 A.2d 583 (1973). See also Aluminum Co. of America v. Theis, 11 Pa. Cmwlth. 587, 314 A.2d 893 (1974).\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court reversed. Order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board is reinstated.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nNIX, J., concurs in the result.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a dissenting opinion.",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice\n(concurring).\nIn his findings of fact in support of his award to appellant, the referee found:\n\u201c6. The Claimant and Defendant stipulated the Claimant did sustain an injury to his back as a result of the accident on January 15, 1971, and that Claimant is entitled to the benefits of the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act because of his back injury.\u201d\nBecause appellees failed to except to finding no. 6 in their appeal to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, they are precluded from arguing on appeal that appellant did not sustain a compensable injury to his back. See Walker v. Nu-Car Carriers, Inc., 164 Pa.Super. 246, 253, 63 A.2d 484, 487 (1949); Vadnal v. Krsul-Kutchel Coal Co., 149 Pa.Super. 269, 273-74, 27 A.2d 709, 710-11 (1942); Nesbit v. Vandervort & Curry, 128 Pa.Super. 58, 63-65, 193 A. 393, 396-97 (1937). Therefore, the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that the record failed to support a finding of compensable injury.\nBecause I agree that there is competent evidence to support the referee\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s coronary ailment resulted from the injury to his back, I concur in the result.\n\u201cThere is absolutely no basis in the record for finding of fact No. 6. . . .\n\u201cFor this reason alone, the referee\u2019s award must be reversed, for absent finding of fact No. 6, there is no finding of an accident, compensable or otherwise.\u201d\nCalcite Quarry Corp. v.
