        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM.\nAppellant was indicted for murder and firearms violation, tried without a jury, and found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Post-trial motions were filed and denied, and sentence was imposed. This appeal followed in which appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict rendered. We affirm.\nThe appellant and three other youths accosted the victim and a friend as they were about to enter a home in Philadelphia. After words were exchanged, the appellant and the others left, only to return to the home five minutes later. Appellant confronted the victim at the doorway. A scuffle ensued which eventually found the victim still inside the house with the appellant and two companions walking toward him. The victim charged the group and attempted to pull a knife, but was shot by one of appellant\u2019s companions. From that injury the victim died.\nSince the appellant stands convicted, \u201cwe must review the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, - Pa. -, 326 A.2d 300 (1974), and cases therein cited. Viewing the evidence of this case in this manner, we conclude that the trial judge could properly find the group returned to the house to assault the victim. Furthermore, the collusion evinced by the return to the house and the threatening approach by the group as a unit toward the victim made the illegal \u201cact of one the act of all.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rife, 454 Pa. 506, 511, 312 A.2d 406, 409 (1973) quoting Commonwealth v. Strantz, 328 Pa. 33, 40, 195 A. 75, 79 (1937). Finally, since the appellant and his companions were clearly the aggressors, no valid claim of self-defense can be asserted. Commonwealth v. Tiernan, 455 Pa. 88, 314 A.2d 310 (1974). Beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction of at least voluntary manslaughter. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Owens, 447 Pa. 294, 289 A.2d 721 (1972).\nJudgment affirmed.",
