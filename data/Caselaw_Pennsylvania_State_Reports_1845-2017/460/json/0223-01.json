        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Norris Jones, was tried by a judge and jury and found guilty of murder in the second degree. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to a term of 5 to 12 years in a state correctional institution. This appeal followed.\nAppellant\u2019s conviction arose out of the fatal stabbing of Dennis Stancko on October 8, 1971, in Erie, Pennsylvania.\nAppellant first argues that his oral statement given to police officers, while he was being transported to police headquarters, was inadmissible because he was not given his Miranda warnings. We do not agree. The record reveals that when appellant was initially picked up by the police officers he was placed in the police vehicle and given his Miranda warnings. He was then asked if he had any weapons on his person, and he produced a knife, which he gave to the police officers, and stated that \u201cit was the knife he used\u201d. Under these facts, we find appellant\u2019s statement to be admissible. See Commonwealth v. Powell, Pa., 328 A.2d 507 (1974).\nAppellant next argues, citing Commonwealth v. Collins, 436 Pa. 114, 259 A.2d 160 (1969), that his formal statement is inadmissible because he was not informed prior to his questioning that the victim of the stabbing had died. We do not agree. When appellant was initially given his Miranda warnings at the police station, he was not informed that the victim had died because the police were unaware of the fact. After several preliminary questions, the interview was stopped because the police were informed of the death of the victim. Appellant was then readvised of his rights and told that the victim had died. He again waived his rights and gave the police a statement. This second warning given to appellant advised him of the death of the victim and gave him the requisite information to make an intelligent decision of whether to waive his rights. We therefore find no error in the police procedure.\nAppellant next argues that he was denied due process of law because of the absence of black jurors on his jury. Appellant did not file a challenge to the general array of the jury panel prior to trial, but only raised the issue in post-trial motions. The trial judge took this issue under advisement, and defense counsel agreed that he would accept the findings as stated in Commonwealth v. Carroll, 443 Pa. 518, 278 A.2d 898 (1971), pertaining to the total population of Erie County and the percentage of blacks in the county. The trial judge found that since the jury selection process was the same in Erie County as it was in Carroll, supra, and since that system was sustained when it came under constitutional challenge in Carroll, it was still valid. We must agree with that determination. Appellant failed to prove any systematic exclusion of blacks on Erie County juries, and only suggested by speculation that evidence and testimony taken on the issue in another Erie County case would prove his contention. Appellant had the opportunity prior to trial to establish his contention and create a record to support his claim. Since he failed to do so, we must dismiss his contention.\nAppellant next argues that the trial judge erred in his charge relating to self-defense, and in his explanation of the differences between voluntary manslaughter and murder in the second degree. An examination of the trial judge\u2019s charge clearly establishes that both points were fully and properly covered by the trial judge.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which MANDERINO, J., joins.",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice\n(concurring).\nI concur in the result reached by the majority and desire to set forth by reasons for affirming the judgment of sentence.\nAppellant Norris Jones was convicted by a jury of second degree murder and sentenced to 5 to 12 years imprisonment. Post-trial motions were denied and this appeal ensued.\nOn October 8, 1971, appellant, age 19, and a companion were involved in a fist fight with Craig Stancko, age 16. The fight ended when Craig Stancko retreated to his home. There, he told his older brother Dennis, age 22, what had transpired. Dennis, accompanied by Craig and a friend, immediately set out for Jones\u2019s home, apparently with the intention of avenging the beating Craig sustained.\nIn an effort to entice Jones out of his house, Dennis pounded on Jones\u2019s door. When Jones opened the door, a fight began and Jones was knocked to the ground. Jones regained his feet, drew a knife and stabbed Dennis Stancko.\nStancko ran seven blocks to his home. He was rushed to a hospital where he died.\nWithin a half hour after the melee, the police arrived at Jones\u2019s home. After asking appellant whether he was \u201cinvolved in this incident\u201d and receiving an affirmative reply, the police arrested Jones and a friend, ushered them into a police car and informed the suspects of their constitutional rights. While en route to the police station, it occurred to the police officers that they had forgotten to search appellant. One of the officers therefore asked appellant if he had anything in his pockets. Appellant produced a pocket knife and told the police \u201cthis is the knife that was used.\u201d\nJones was taken to police headquarters, reinformed of his constitutional rights, and told that he would be questioned about the stabbing. When the interrogators learned of Dennis\u2019s death, they relayed this information to Jones, and again repeated the Miranda warnings. Sometime after he was told of Stancko\u2019s death, Jones dictated to the police a statement in which he admitted his involvement in the killing.\nAt a pre-trial hearing, appellant moved for the suppression of the statements made in the police car and in the police station. This motion was denied and the statements were admitted at trial.\nIn this appeal, Jones argues that it was error to admit the statements. He asserts that because he was not told either of Stancko\u2019s death or of the charges lodged against him, his waiver of his constitutional rights was not \u201cknowing and intelligent,\u201d and was invalid. He therefore claims the statements were admitted in violation of article I, section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution. I cannot agree.\nThe theory that a suspect\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights is \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d only if he knows the nature of the incident under investigation was first suggested in the plurality opinion in Commonwealth v. Collins, 436 Pa. 114, 259 A.2d 160 (1969). Although a number of subsequent cases discussed this requirement, not until Commonwealth v. Richman, 458 Pa. 167, 320 A.2d 351 (1974), did a majority of this Court articulate clearly the elements of this doctrine. There we held that while \u201cthere is no need for the police to explain in detail all of the technicalities of the charges, the accused should at least know the general nature of the transaction giving rise to the charges.\u201d Id. at 175, 320 A.2d at 355.\nUnder our holding in Richman, appellant\u2019s waiver at the police station was clearly \u201cknowing and intelligent.\u201d The suppression court found that before Jones waived his Miranda rights, he had been informed that he was being questioned about the Stancko stabbing. In these circumstances, the accused did \u201cknow the general nature of the transaction giving rise to the charges.\u201d\nLikewise, Jones\u2019s statement in the police car that his \u201cwas the knife that was used,\u201d was made with sufficient knowledge of \u201cthe general nature of the transaction\u201d to constitute a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver. Admittedly, the police never explicitly told appellant that they were arresting him for the stabbing. Nevertheless, when the police arrived at Jones\u2019s home, they asked him, \u201cwere you involved in this incident?\u201d Jones answered that he was. Because the arrest followed so closely the stabbing, an eyent in which appellant never denied participating, there could be no ambiguity as to what incident the police meant. Moreover, during the trip to the police station, appellant told his friend, \u201cWe won\u2019t be there long. All they have to do is find out whose property it was on when it happened.\u201d While this statement is not unambiguous, it does suggest that appellant understood he was to be questioned about the event that had just occurred at his home.\nOn this record, the Commonwealth adequately established that appellant had a sufficient knowledge of \u201cthe general nature of the transaction giving rise to the charges\u201d to fathom what was at stake when he waived his rights. Therefore, I agree with the majority that Jones\u2019s waiver was \u201cknowing and intelligent.\u201d\nAppellant asserts that the court incorrectly charged the jury on self-defense, and that two of his points for charge were improperly rejected. He also claims that when the jury requested additional instructions, the court erred in failing to give another requested point for charge. However, appellant made no specific objections to the points now assigned as error. Pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1119(b), failure to make specific objections to the courts charge bars appellant from asserting the alleged errors on appeal.\nFinally appellant alleges that the absence of blacks on the general jury panel from which appellant\u2019s petit jury was chosen rendered his conviction invalid. Appellant admits that he failed to make a timely objection to the array. Nevertheless he claims that this failure should be excused because (1) he had no opportunity to observe the racial composition of the general panel and (2) because \u201ca constitutional error of this magnitude is not waived by the failure to make a timely objection.\u201d Appellant\u2019s claim that he was unable to determine the racial composition of the general jury panel is clearly frivolous. His assertion that we should take cognizance of \u201ca constitutional error of this magnitude\u201d is nothing more than a claim of \u201cbasic and fundamental error.\u201d In Commonwealth v. Clair, - Pa. \u2014 , 326 A.2d 272 (1974), we held \u201cno longer will allegations of basic and fundamental error serve to enable parties in criminal matters to seek reversal on alleged errors not properly raised below.\u201d Id. at -, 326 A.2d at 274. Therefore, that claim was waived.\nIn my view, appellant advanced no ground for overruling his conviction.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this concurring opinion.\n. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\nAppellant contests the suppression court\u2019s conclusion that he was informed of his constitutional rights while in the police car. However, the court\u2019s findings are supported by the record and may not be disturbed.\n. \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused . . . cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself.\u201d\n. \u201cNo person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d\n. \u201cIf the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination . . Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1628, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\n. See Commonwealth v. McKinney, 453 Pa. 10, 14, 306 A.2d 305, 307 (1973); Commonwealth v. McIntyre, 451 Pa. 42, 48, 301 A.2d 832, 835 (1973); Commonwealth v. Swint, 450 Pa. 54, 59, 296 A.2d 777, 780 (1972); Commonwealth v. Boykin, 450 Pa. 25, 28, 298 A. 2d 258, 260 (1972) (Opinion announcing the decision of the Court); Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 445 Pa. 364, 366-367, 284 A.2d 108, 109 (1971); Commonwealth v. Cooper, 444 Pa. 122, 124, 297 A.2d 108, 109 (1971).\n. While it is true Richman dealt with waiver of the right to counsel at line-ups, the opinion clearly states that the same standard is to be applied to Miranda waivers as is used in waivers of the right of counsel at line-ups.\n. I cannot subscribe to the majority\u2019s view that this statement of Jones was volunteered. Compare Commonwealth v. Powell, 459 Pa. 253, 328 A.2d 507 (1974). In my judgment the officer\u2019s question was \u201ccalculated to, expected to, or likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d Commonwealth v. Yount, 455 Pa. 303, 309, 314 A.2d 242, 246 (1974); see Commonwealth v. Davis, 460 Pa. -, 331 A.2d 406 (1975). Therefore, Jones\u2019s response cannot be considered truly volunteered.\n. When the officer asked this question Jones was not in custody. Therefore, the officer need not have informed Jones of his constitutional rights before posing this question.\n. \u201cNo portions of the charge nor omissions therefrom may be assigned as error unless specific objections are made thereto before the jury retires to deliberate.\u201d\nSee Commonwealth v. Johnson, 457 Pa. 554, 562 n. 8, 327 A.2d 632, 637 n. 8 (1974); Commonwealth v. Martinolich, 456 Pa. 136, 160 n. 15, 318 A.2d 680, 693 n. 15 cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1065, 95 S.Ct. 651 (1974); Commonwealth v. Watlington, 452 Pa. 524, 306 A.2d 892 (1973).\n. Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 36 n. 3, 331 A.2d 213, 215 n. 3 (1975). Commonwealth v. Agie, 449 Pa. 187, 296 A.2d 741 (1972).",
