        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant, Gary Blair, was arrested on July 26, 1972, and charged with the murder of one Willie Lee Edwards. Blair\u2019s first trial commenced on April 28, 1973, and ended in a mistrial when the jury informed the trial court that it was unable to reach a verdict.\nAppellant was retried before a jury in August, 1973. The jury convicted him of first degree murder and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. Post-trial motions were filed and denied. This appeal ensued. We affirm.\nAt appellant\u2019s second trial, one of the prosecution\u2019s key witnesses, appellant\u2019s girl friend, failed to appear. Consequently, the court permitted the witness\u2019s testimony at appellant\u2019s first trial to be read to the jury. Appellant asserts this was error.\nUnder the Act of May 28, 1887, P.L. 158, \u00a7 8,19 P.S. \u00a7 582 (1964),\n\u201c[wjhenever any person has been examined as a witness, either for the commonwealth or for the defense, in any criminal proceeding conducted in or before a court of record, and the defendant has been present and has had an opportunity to examine or cross-examine, if such witness . . . cannot be found ... . notes of his examination shall be competent evidence upon a subsequent trial of the same criminal issue . . .\nAppellant alleges that the Commonwealth\u2019s efforts to obtain the witness\u2019s presence was inadequate and that the prosecution failed to establish that the witness \u201ccannot be found.\u201d Therefore he asserts that it was error to read the record to the jury.\nA witness \u201ccannot be found,\u201d within the meaning of section 3 of the Act of May 23, 1887, only if a good-faith effort to locate the witness and compel his attendance at trial has failed. See Commonwealth v. Faison, 452 Pa. 137, 141, 305 A.2d 44, 46 (1973); Commonwealth v. Beach, 445 Pa. 257, 284 A.2d 792 (1971). Cf. Mancusi v. Stubbs, 408 U.S. 204, 92 S.Ct. 2308, 33 L.Ed. 2d 293 (1972); Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968).\nThe record reveals that the following efforts were 'made to obtain the testimony of the witness. On August 7, 1973, during the selection of the jury for appellant\u2019s trial, the district attorney saw the witness in the courtroom and told her that she would receive a subpoena to appear at appellant\u2019s trial. At that time, she informed the district attorney that she would not appear.\nOn the same day, a detective attempted to serve the subpoena at the address the witness had given the officer investigating the murder. However, he discovered that the building at that address was abandoned. Later that day, the detective attempted to telephone the witness\u2019s mother but the call went unanswered.\nThe following day, the detective called at the home of the witness\u2019s mother. No one was home. The detective testified that he thought he slipped the subpoena under the door at that time.\nThe detective then checked with postal authorities to ascertain whether the witness had a forwarding address. He was informed that the postal service had received no information about a change of address.\nLater that day, the detective contacted the witness\u2019s mother by telephone. He told her about the trial and instructed her to have her daughter call him. The next morning, the detective again telephoned the witness\u2019s mother but was informed that the mother had not seen her daughter.\nOn August 13, during appellant\u2019s trial, a bench warrant was issued for the witness and the detective, upon the court\u2019s instruction, attempted to serve it at the address the witness had given in her previous testimony. Once again, the witness could not be found and service could not be made.\nLater that day, the court instructed the detective to maintain an all-night vigil at the witness\u2019s home. That night the detective talked to at least two persons who claimed to have recently seen the witness but who were unable to tell the detective of her present whereabouts. The detective also spoke with the witness\u2019s mother, who stated that her daughter had left the mother\u2019s home two weeks earlier. The mother said she had no knowledge where her daughter could be found. The officer searched the mother\u2019s home and did not find the witness, although he did find evidence that the witness had lived there. He then called at the home of the witness\u2019s stepbrother, but no one was home. Finally, he returned to the mother\u2019s home, searched it again and again failed to find the witness.\nAfter hearing the testimony of the officer\u2019s efforts to locate the witness, the court concluded that the witness was \u201cnot available to testify personally and the Commonwealth [had] exerted every possible effort to try and serve her.\u201d This conclusion is amply supported by the record.\nAlthough the district attorney would have been better advised not to wait until appellant\u2019s trial began to attempt to secure the attendance of the witness, we cannot conclude that his delay vitiated the extensive efforts to find the witness. Nor can we conclude that the fact the witness had been recently seen in the neighborhood where she lived bars application of the statute. The Act does not require that the Commonwealth establish that the witness has disappeared from the face of the earth; it demands that the Commonwealth make a good-faith effort to locate the witness and fail. In the circumstances of this case, the Commonwealth established that a good-faith attempt was made to find the witness and that \u201cthe witness [could] not be found.\u201d We therefore hold that the court, in compliance with section 3 of the Act of May 23, 1887, properly permitted the witness\u2019s prior testimony to be read to the jury.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nJONES, C. J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Appellant\u2019s written post-trial motions were boiler plate challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. Although counsel apparently made more specific oral motions that were considered by the court, the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, rule 1123(a), 19 P.S. Appendix, requires written post-trial motions.\nThe practice in some judicial districts of ignoring the requirements of Rule 1123(a) is condemned. Henceforth, issues not presented in compliance with the rule will not be considered by our trial and appellate courts.\n. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. i 211.202(1) (Supp.1974).\n. Appellant makes three other claims of error. None of these were properly preserved for appeal. Appellant first contends that the court improperly permitted testimony to be given on irrelevant issues. Next he asserts that the court\u2019s statement to the jury after the Commonwealth rested its case \u201cthat the next order of business will be for the defendant to present his defense,\u201d shifted the burden of proof from the Commonwealth. Finally, he contends that the testimony of the missing witness read to the jury was inadmissible because it was the fruit of a custodial interrogation of the witness by the police at which the police failed to give the witness Miranda warnings. At the time of these alleged errors, appellant failed to object. Therefore he may not raise these issues upon appeal. Commonwealth v.
