        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Joseph Blair, was tried by a judge and jury and found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to a term of two to eight years in a state correctional institution. This appeal followed.\nAppellant\u2019s conviction arose out of the fatal shooting of his brother-in-law, Robert Clift, on November 17, 1972, in Philadelphia.\nAppellant first argues that the following comment made by the District Attorney to the jury relating to his character prejudiced his case:\n\u201cThis brings me to the question of character. The defendant\u2019s character not in general, not the defendant\u2019s character for everything. We didn\u2019t hear testimony about that. We heard the limited character of peacefulness.\u201d We do not agree. The evidence presented by appellant covered the single character trait of his peacefulness and did not relate to his general character. The district attorney pointed this out to the jury and further stated that this testimony did not prove that appellant could not have committed the homicide. While not condoning this type of statement in a summation, we find no prejudicial error in the district attorney\u2019s summation. Cf. Commonwealth v. Zeger, 193 Pa.Super. 498, 165 A.2d 683 (1960). Moreover, the judge\u2019s charge more than amply explained to the jury the purpose and weight to be given to the reputation evidence presented by appellant.\nAppellant next argues that the court erred in not allowing an individual voir dire of prospective jurors as provided by Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1106, 19 P.S. Appendix. Rule 1106 provides for a jury selection process in capital cases, while Rule 1107 defines the procedure for jury selection in non-capital cases. The trial judge was of the opinion, and we agree, that subsequent to our decision in Commonwealth v. Truesdale, 449 Pa. 325, 296 A.2d 829 (1972), there are no capital offenses in Pennsylvania, therefore negating the necessity to conduct a voir dire in accordance with Rule 1106.\nAppellant raises other allegations of error which we need not discuss, since he failed to note a proper exception at trial. See Commonwealth v. Clair, - Pa. - 326 A.2d 272 (1974).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nEAGEN, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nNIX and MANDERINO, JJ., concur in the result.",
