        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice\n(dissenting).\nIn my view, the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard in drawing conclusions from the record evidence. Therefore, I dissent.\nAppellants are husband and wife who are seeking to adopt the wife\u2019s two children by a former marriage. Her former husband is appellee. Appellants petitioned for the involuntary termination of appellee\u2019s parental rights under section 311 of the Adoption Act.\nThe trial court found as a fact that appellee had failed to make any support payments since December, 1969, approximately 32 months prior to the filing of appellants\u2019 petition for adoption. That court concluded, however, that this failure to support was an insufficient ground to terminate appellee\u2019s parental fights. It stated:\n\u201cThe duty of support is a primary and necessary duty for a father; however, we do not believe that the mere failure to support, in itself, is now a new and sufficient ground for the termination of parental rights under Section 311 of the new Adoption Act .... [S]uch dereliction, standing alone, was not sufficient to evidence an intention to relinquish parental rights under the former Adoption Act, and it would appear to us that if the Legislature had intended so radical a change in the law regarding the forfeiture of parental rights it would have clearly so stated in plain and simple language.\u201d\nThe Legislature has plainly and simply said so. The statute is absolutely clear that parental rights may be terminated upon proof that \u201c[t]he parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least six months . has . . . failed to perform parental duties . .\u201d Because parents indisputably have a duty to support their children, Appeal of Diane B., 456 Pa. 429, 433, 321 A.2d 618, 620 (1974), it is difficult to conceive of how the Legislature could have more clearly stated that failure to support is a sufficient ground for involuntary termination.\nThe trial court apparently concluded that appellee\u2019s failure to support was excusable in view of his employment record. Appellee is a draftsman; difficulties in the aerospace industry resulted in his layoff by several successive employers. During part of the relevant period, he collected unemployment compensation.\nI cannot agree that mere financial difficulty excuses failure to support. I would have thought that this was incontrovertible in light of what we said in Smith Adoption Case, 412 Pa. 501, 505, 194 A.2d 919, 922 (1963):\n\u201cParental rights may not be preserved ... by merely waiting for some more suitable financial circumstance or convenient time for the performance of parental duties and responsibilities . . . . The parental obligation is a positive duty and requires affirmative performance which may not be delayed beyond the statutory period by the parent if the parental right is not to be forfeited.\u201d\nI assume that financial difficulty will diminish the amount required for fulfillment of the duty to support. However, complete failure to provide even a token amount is neither a \u201cutiliz [ation of] those resources at his or her command\u201d nor an \u201cexercise [of] reasonable firmness \u2018in declining to yield to obstacles\u2019 . . . .\u201d McCray Adoption, 460 Pa. 210, 217, 331 A.2d 652, 655 (1975).\nIn any event, there were substantial periods of time when appellee was able to perform his duty of support. He conceded as much at trial and acknowledged his lack of excuse:\n\u201cQ. Why haven\u2019t you resumed any support payments, say for the year 1972 ?\n\u201cA. For 1972, the first part of the year, I have no excuse. ... I should have made an attempt. 1 didn\u2019t. ... I shirked my duty.\u201d\nBecause it is clear that appellee has failed to perform his parental duties for at least the statutory period of six months, I would vacate the decree and remand with instructions to enter a decree terminating the parental rights of appellee.\nJONES, C. J., joins in this dissent.\nAct of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, art. Ill, \u00a7 311, 1 P.S. \u00a7 311 (Supp. 1974):\n\u201cThe rights of a parent in regard to a child may be terminated . on the ground that:\n(1) The parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least six months either has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to a child, or has refused or failed to perform parental duties; . .",
