Plaintiff has resided in the Borough of New Kensington since 1893, and from 1915 to December, 1928, had been engaged, inter alia, in selling defendant’s newspaper, The Press. He appears to have conducted a business relatively large,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> employing a number of distributing newsboys and maintaining a number of newsstands ; his principal store was in the business center of the borough; he not only supplied the borough, but also surrounding territory, in all, a population of “anywhere from fifty to seventy-five thousand, possibly more;” in addition to defendant’s paper, he distributed and sold <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>other papers, one several times mentioned in the evidence being the Sun-Telegraph.</p>

Witnesses who had received the libel, testified that they heard discussions in the community about it in its relation to plaintiff; some, engaged in business, said numerous copies were left in their shops for distribution.</p>

The next two paragraphs announce that plaintiff has refused to pay his debts; has even refused to consider the subject in spite of several months’ effort on the part of defendant to have him do so; the last paragraph reflects on the refusal by comparison with the prompt payment of debts by “the people of New Kensington.”</p>

Plaintiff’s cancelled check showing payment of that account is in the record.

The record is destitute of anything in mitigation. We are not persuaded that the learned court below erred in holding that the verdict was not excessive. The character of plaintiff’s business and the manner of the distribution of the libel have been stated. From such libel damage is presumed; courts take judicial notice that damage follows because that is the common experience of mankind. Defendant also failed to prove its plea of justification. “That the unsustained plea of justification afforded such evidence of actual malice as should enhance the damages, is equally well supported by authority :” Gorman v. Sutton, <a href="/pa/32/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="32 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="986693" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0247-01">32 Pa. 247</a>, 249. See, too, Clark v.
