We note, first, that appellant made no objection until after verdict ; second, that the superseded district attorney made none. Section 907 provides: “Special Attorneys in Criminal Cases. — When the president judge, in the district having jurisdiction of any criminal proceedings before any court of oyer and terminer, general jail delivery, or quarter sessions, in this Commonwealth, shall request the attorney general to do so, in writing, setting <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>forth that, in his judgment, the case is a proper one for the Commonwealth’s intervention, the attorney general is hereby authorized and empowered to retain and employ a special attorney or attorneys, as he may deem necessary, properly to represent the Commonwealth in such proceedings, and to investigate, charge, and prosecute the alleged offenders against the law. Any attorney, so retained and employed, shall supersede the district attorney of the county in which case or cases may arise, and shall investigate, prepare, and bring to trial the case or cases to which he may be assigned. He shall take the oath of office required by law to be taken by district attorneys, and shall be clothed with all the powers and subject to all the liabilities imposed upon them by law.”</p>

L. 85, 16 PS, section 3432, and including the Act of May 2,1905, P. L. 351, 71 PS, section 817 et seq. and the Act of June 7, 1923, article IX, P. L. 498, 550. Appellant says that “a district attorney is a constitutional officer, made so by section 1 of article XII of the Constitution of Pennsylvania which specifies who shall be considered county officers,” and that by section 2 “All county officers shall be elected at the general elections and shall hold office until their successors are duly elected and qualified, but all vacancies in that office shall be filled as provided by law, that is by section 3 of the Act of May 3,1850, P. L. 654, 16 PS, section 1692, by the judges of the court of common pleas of the county.” It is accordingly contended that there was no vacancy in the office, and that the district attorney was neither incapacitated nor disqualified to act. If we should take judicial notice that the office was not vacant, we should still be without evidence that the district attorney was neither incapacitated nor disqualified. As the Constitution does not prescribe the duties of the district attorney, it has been held <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>that the legislature may regulate the performance of the duties of the office and provide for cases in which it would be improper for the elected officer to act: Com. v.

L. 654, 16 PS, section 1691, the attorney general was represented in each county by his deputy who conducted criminal prosecutions; by that statute the office of district attorney was created and that officer was charged with the performance of the duties theretofore performed by the deputy attorney general. Thereafter the prosecutor was elected instead of appointed, but the power of general supervision vested in the attorney general over the performance of a district attorney’s duties in the county was not taken away; that power remained, and it is matter of general information that the power has been exercised from time to time when necessary. In part, this supervision is now regulated by section 907 of the Administrative Code. Consideration of the historic development in this Commonwealth of the office of attorney general and the office of district attorney at once distinguishes the cases cited by appellant from other states said to hold that the legislature may not provide for temporarily displacing prosecuting attorneys.</p>

The appellant and three others were indicted for murder and also for conspiracy to murder. One of them, Michael Gilida, alias Michael Gallagher, was tried and convicted of murder in the second degree (see Com. v. Gilida, alias Gallagher, <a href="/pa/309/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="309 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1141635" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0501-01">309 Pa. 501</a>, the following case). Another, George Steiner, pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree; the fourth, James DiYenno, pleaded guilty to the indictment charging conspiracy. Appellant and Steiner were gamblers, operating gambling establishments, and employed Gilida and DiYenno in that occupation. One of their gambling places was in Devon and the other in Conshohocken. On Saturday night October 10th, two slot machines, containing a small sum of money, were stolen from their gambling room in Conshohocken. Suspecting Spanish, who was interested in what may be considered a rival gambling place in Conshohocken, of the theft, appellant and the other three went in pursuit of him on Sunday evening, driving from Devon, where appellant lived, to Conshohocken where Spanish lived. Shortly after nine o’clock, on the sidewalk in front of Spanish’s gambling place, appellant met one Rossi, alias Fox; asked where Spanish was, and stated that he was “looking for him, because they [Spanish and Harvey] stole our slot machines last night, and I am going to get them.” “If Spanish gets here I will kill him.” Appellant drew his revolver and pointed it at Fox and detained him for perhaps twenty minutes. Steiner and Gilida assisted in detaining Fox, one standing on each side of him, fearing that he might warn Spanish of their purpose. A number of persons saw this occurrence and testified at the trial. Appellant finally permitted Fox to leave, in custody of Fox’s brother, saying to him “Be sure to take him right home.” Appellant remained with Gallagher and Steiner, waiting for Spanish, who, Fox said, would soon arrive. Shortly before ten o’clock Spanish came by automobile. He walked toward the entrance of the gambling establishment and, at the same time, toward ap<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>pellant who was on the sidewalk. Appellant immediately went toward Spanish and from a place within two feet of him, fatally shot him in the abdomen. Spanish turned and fled toward his car while appellant fired a second shot at him at a distance of about twelve feet. Appellant, Steiner and Gilida then got into their automobile and fled, Spanish, mortally wounded, collapsed as he reached his car. He was placed in another car, and rushed to a near-by physician, standing on the sidewalk, who ordered him to the hospital in an ambulance then appearing. He arrived at the hospital at about ten-thirty. The defense was that appellant was intoxicated to such extent, that he was not responsible.</p>

These statements were received against objection and exception, and their admission in evidence is now assigned for error. In the ambulance with Spanish were two persons who were called by the Commonwealth as witnesses, one being Fox, already mentioned. On the way and perhaps ten minutes after the shooting, Spanish, described as moaning in great pain, apparently recovered consciousness and asked Fox to open his collar and to take his money and wrist watch; Fox, then (in the words of a witness) “asked him who did it and Ealph [Spanish] said ‘Jake’ [appellant].” Fox said that “he seemed to be unconscious until he [Spanish] first spoke.” In the circumstances, the accusation is admissible, .within the res gestse rule, as having been made so soon after the shooting as to be part of the general event and, also to exclude any presumption that the statement resulted from premeditation or design. The application of the rule involves the wise exercise of judicial discretion in determining <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>whether a challenged expression is in fact part of the transaction, and therefore admissible, or is a narrative of past events made after the transaction may be said to be fully ended, and therefore inadmissible.

There is evidence that Spanish was conscious and believed that death was near.

In direct examination appellant stated that he had kept a revolver in his car for about a year and a half for purposes of protection, because, he said, “I carried money, quite a bit of money and in case any body would steal it.” He was then asked, “What, if anything, happened to you at the time that caused you to put a revolver in your car?” Refusal to permit him to answer the question is complained of. The jury had the benefit of what he said was his purpose in keeping a revolver in the car. No offer of proof was made to enable the court to judge whether what happened a year and a half before, if any<a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>thing then happened, had any relevance to the issue on trial. Several witnesses were asked whether they had “ever known [appellant] to carry a revolver on his person,” but objections to the questions were sustained. The purpose of the questions, stated by appellant’s counsel, was “to show that this defendant never carried a gun upon his person in his life,” for the purpose of contending later that defendant was not a “gangster.” It does not appear that the witnesses had the necessary opportunities to acquire knowledge on the subject; there is nothing to supply the court with this information of their qualifications, required preliminary to admitting such evidence; while want of knowledge of things open to the senses, in persons with opportunity of knowing such fact if it existed, may be slight evidence of the nonexistence of the fact, the opportunity of knowing must first appear: Cf.

We first note that though the defense was voluntary intoxication rendering appellant incapable of knowing what he was doing, there was abundant evidence to sustain a finding by the jury that there was no foundation for this defense. Appellant’s position appears in the following point, and also in the following extract from the charge. “If you find from the weight of the testimony, that by reason of intoxication the defendant’s reason was so destroyed that he had not the power to distinguish right from wrong, or the power to adhere to the right and abstain from the wrong, he is not accountable to the criminal laws, and if this unfortunate condition existed and was produced by intoxicating liquor, it is of course as available for a defense as if it were the result of a mental disease.</p>

The jury was left free to make the findings or not as it saw fit, and to affix either penalty permitted by the statute. Defendant admitted that he was not only a gambler and had been for more than three years, but that he was proprietor of two gambling places, one in Devon where he lived, and one in Conshohocken where Spanish lived and had his place. Associated with appellant in the same occupation were Steiner and Gil-ida, alias Gallagher, and DiYenno. It is not a misuse of the word “gang” to apply it to men associated as these were, and who were out together for the purpose, as the jury found, of murdering Spanish; nor is it a misuse of the word “gangster” to apply it to any one of them.
