In addition to these reasons founded on the note itself, the court below had before it both the petition from which this appeal was taken and a petition of Mamie Leech to strike off the judgment entered on this note against her, containing the statement that no authority appears on the record empowering William Leech to sign for Mamie Leech, a statement inconsistent with William Leech’s petition alleging he signed for her as agent, and which, if believed, would operate to bind <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>him as principal. Further corroboratory of the conclusion that the note was signed by both parties as principals is the bailment lease to which it was attached, which the court below found signed by both parties as principals. The note itself, and the collateral evidence as well, justify the conclusion of the court below.</p>
