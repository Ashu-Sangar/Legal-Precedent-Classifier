The parties were of course competent to discharge their existing contractual relations and to replace them by a new contract. As judgment was entered on the pleadings, we must therefore turn to defendant’s pleading to see whether he has averred facts that adequately support his contention that a substitution of obligations was made. When we do so we can find no averments that show plaintiff’s position to be without foundation. Plaintiff asks, if such contract was made (which it denies) where is the averment of consideration ? Defendant does not aver that he gave anything for the promise, or suffered any legal detriment or was any worse off afterward than before. He does not say that he has “done, forborne or undertaken to do any thing” <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>or undertaken any counter-obligation or service; Ms position remained what it was from the time he delivered Ms note and collateral.

(Penna. Anno., page 103 et seq.). The statement of claim shows that defendant had neither paid nor increased the security, and that defendant was in default. By the agreement, plaintiff then had the right to enforce the pledge. The affidavit avers no circumstances that could give defendant any standing to interfere with plaintiff’s exercise of that right. If it be said that there was forbearance in consideration of plaintiff’s promise to sell immediately, the question is what did he forbear or omit doing that he might or would have done. What action did plaintiff’s promise induce him to omit? Even then, unless the omission to act was something that plaintiff should have expected him to omit doing, it would not be consideration. See section 90, Restatement, Contracts, Pa. Anno., page 138, and discussion in volume 6, Proceedings, American Law Institute, page 331. Moreover, if he forbore doing anything, he should have averred what it was so that the court could consider its effect. It will not do to say that, after default, he omitted taking things into his own hands and selling the collateral, subject to the pledge, at a price in excess of his debt, because he does not aver that he could have, or even would have, done that; with<a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>out adequate averment, such forbearance is not in the case, without now considering its effect, if averred.</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[242,461,1159,1835]]]'>Defendant also puts his position in this form: On September 14, 1931, he “had the right to satisfy the demands of the plaintiff in one of three ways: First, by depositing with the plaintiff other or additional collateral security satisfactory to the plaintiff; or, second, by paying a portion of his indebtedness to the plaintiff to such an extent that plaintiff would be satisfied that the collateral which it held as a pledge Avas sufficient to protect the indebtedness of the defendant to the plaintiff ; or, third, by paying the entire indebtedness. There would be no default until the defendant had failed to satisfy the plaintiff in one of these three aspects.” But that position finds no support in the record. The averment in the statement of claim is that “defendant failed to give the plaintiff additional security and failed to reduce the indebtedness”; and those facts are not denied in the affidavit; his default, therefore, is a fact in the case that cannot be ignored. Defendant’s recital of the alleged pi*omise is no denial of plaintiff’s averments, and cannot be accepted in that light in passing on the rule for judgment: Snellenburg v. Levitt, <a href="/pa/282/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="282 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1088358" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0065-01">282 Pa. 65</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.%20309" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="127 A. 309">127 A. 309</a>. But, in any event, defendant errs in contending that he Avaived “rights.” What he calls by that name Avere obligations to be performed by him, i. e., he agreed to repay the loan made to him by plaintiff, or to supplement the security. By failing to perform those obligations on demand he was not Avaiving performance by plaintiff of any obligation to him, because none was owing. Plaintiff had the option of making demands on defendant; so far as appears, defendant had none. As, therefore, it does not appear that defendant had any rights to Avaive, he gave, suffered or surrendered nothing as consideration, in the sense argued, for the alleged promise of plaintiff.</p>

This contention he attempts to support by cases in which the point was not presented for decision in this court, and in which, too, with one exception (Penna. Co., etc., v.

Bail, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Grant%20296" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="1 Grant 296">1 Grant 296</a>, it was ruled that the pledgor could not hold the pledgee for loss in the collateral, sustained because the pledgee “would [not] let him [pledgor] have it to collect when it was alleged that Linus [maker of the note held as collateral] was in failing circumstances.”</p>

This follows from the nature of the contract between parties. In a pledge the general property remains with the pledgor and only a special property passes to the pledgee (Collin’s App., <a href="/pa/107/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="107 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="8858925" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0590-01">107 Pa. 590</a>, 605). The pledgee is “within certain limits a trustee [and] is therefore presumed to act for the pledgor’s interest as well as his own, but their interests are not identical, and where they may require different action the pledgee is entitled to regard his own, after having put the other party on his guard, by notice to him that he must look out for himself”: <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>Plucker v.

If bound to act whenever defendant required it, its bargain for a particular security might, without its consent, be broken as soon as made; its judgment would go for naught, and it might lose some or all of its claim, but could never receive more than its debt. Such a contention is too one-sided to receive judicial sanction unless unavoidable. To allow one of the parties to the contract to thus change it without the consent of the other, either express or implied, would come perilously near violating the obligation of the contract, if it did not overstep the constitutional line of inhibition.” See, also, Lenahan v. Clark, <a href="/pa/279/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="279 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1083608" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0297-01">279 Pa. 297</a>, 301, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20798" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="123 A. 798">123 A. 798</a>. In a note to First Nat. Bank v. Hattaway, <a href="/ga/172/0731-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="172 Ga. 731" data-case-ids="154370" data-case-paths="/ga/172/0731-01">172 Ga. 731</a>, 77 A. R. L. 375, the subject is treated at length. We need of course not consider what the effect of such notice might have been if defendant had not executed the collateral contract in this record; his note defines the rights and obligations of the parties, and both are inconsistent with the effect attributed by defendant to the alleged notice to sell (compare Emmons v. McCreery, <a href="/pa/307/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="307 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1138167" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0062-01">307 Pa. 62</a>). In the debtor-creditor relation the debt was due, and plaintiff had the right to sue for the debt before proceeding against the collateral: Harper v. Lukens, <a href="/pa/271/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="271 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="295674" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0144-01">271 Pa. 144</a>, 147, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.%20636" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="112 A. 636">112 A. 636</a>; on the other hand, plaintiff might enforce its rights under the pledgor-pledgee relation. “The fact that [plaintiff] thus had recourse to two funds in no way impaired his right to proceed against either or both, so long as he did not claim or secure more than was justly due”: Fulton’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/65/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="65 Pa. Super. 437" data-case-ids="625338" data-case-paths="/pa-super/65/0437-01">65 Pa. Superior Ct. 437</a>, 442. There was, however, a somewhat similar collateral contract in the Lynch case, supra. But defendant misapprehends the decision. As pointed out to him at the oral argument, the <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>single point decided in that case (being the only point presented by the record for review) was that this court found no abuse of discretion in the action of the trial court in granting a new trial. The trial judge had particularly stated thát a new trial was granted because he thought the verdict may have been “due to [his] failure ......to charge more fully and explicitly on defendant’s counterclaim.” We stated that, as a new trial was ordered, we would not review appellant’s assignment of error complaining that its motion for judgment was overruled. Disregarding this express limitation to the point passed on, appellant would appear to contend that because, in stating the record, the opinion quotes, without disapproval, points of charge that were affirmed, he may treat the instructions so given to the jury (which he says support his argument) as having the approval of this court. Nothing is farther from the fact. The effect of a pledgor’s notice to a pledgee to sell, in contradiction of the terms of the written contract of the parties, was neither presented for review nor was it considered.</p>
