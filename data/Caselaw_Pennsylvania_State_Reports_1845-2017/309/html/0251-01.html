    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[280,458,1156,1337]]]'>The accident occurred at about 6:30 o’clock on the evening of October 8, 1929, in the Borough of Turtle Creek, Allegheny County. Plaintiff, an employee of a tire store, was engaged in replacing the left rear tire on an automobile parked close to the right-hand curb, looking west, on Braddock Avenue, a position which brought him on the highway outside of the parked car and about two feet from the nearest rail of the double line trolley tracks. It was a clear evening, the street well lighted, and when plaintiff first observed the bus it was approximately 400 feet distant traveling near the middle of the street. When he next looked it was within seventy-five feet of him. He leaned close to the car in course of impair, holding the partially adjusted tire in place and looking forward. The owner of the car, who had been standing beside plaintiff, without having seen the approaching bus stepped back of the car toward the curb when the bus was about forty feet away. Although no necessity for doing so was shown, the bus passed so near the automobile that, as it swerved slightly to the left at that point, the rear end struck plaintiff dragging him twenty feet. There is testimony that no other cars were parked along the street and there was no traffic to obscure the view of the bus driver or influence his actions at the time of the accident.</p>

A man is not necessarily guilty of contributory negligence by being outside the line of his car, while doing some temporary work thereon, although it is in the street.
