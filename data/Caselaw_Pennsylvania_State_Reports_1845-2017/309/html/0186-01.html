Despite appellant’s assertion to the contrary, there can be no doubt but that the mortgage in question <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>was properly before the lower court. This is apparent from the first paragraph of the praecipe for writ of scire facias which fully states the record of the mortgage as required by the rules of court of Venango County. Likewise, the docket entries, as set forth in the court’s opinion, show that plaintiff filed a copy of the mortgage which was annexed to and made part of its answer to defendant’s motion to quash the writ of scire facias.</p>
