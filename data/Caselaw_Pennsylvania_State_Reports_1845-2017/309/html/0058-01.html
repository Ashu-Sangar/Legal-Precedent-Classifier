The work progressed until 1907 when, for financial reasons, it was suspended. In 1910, the dam was completed by the Pennsylvania Water and Power Company, another intermediate in the <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>chain of title to the grant. This dam completed in 1910 does not back the river waters on to any part of the Fry property. John Witmer died February 10, 1927.

At the hearing the bill was amended by adding the averment that “the effect of the dam now being built by defendant will be to flood back the waters of the Susquehanna River upon plaintiff’s aforesaid property and to destroy or render uninhabitable the bungalow built thereon.” The prayer for relief was amended by adding: “......and to issue an injunction restraining defendant, its agents and employees, from flooding or continuing to flood the aforesaid property of the plaintiff until or unless it shall have, by proper proceedings, acquired the right so to do.”</p>

The principal distinction between it and an easement appurtenant is found in the fact that in the first there is, and in the second there is not, a dominant tenement. The easement is in gross, and personal to the grantee, because it is not appurtenant to other premises. The great weight of the authorities supports the doctrine that easements in gross, properly so called because of their personal character, are not assignable or inheritable, nor can they be made so by any terms in the grant [citing, inter alia, Tinicum Fishing Co. v. Carter, <a href="/pa/61/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="61 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="428573" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0021-01">61 Pa. 21</a>]. Many cases which seem to be in conflict with this rule are reconcilable because under their facts the rights in question were profits a prendre and not easements in gross. However, it has been held directly that an easement in gross may be assigned [citing only Goodrich v. Burbank, 12 Allen (Mass.) 459]. Under the English law a private easement can be held only as appurtenant to a dominant tenement, and an easement granted to an individual in gross amounts to no more than a personal license; so that, although the grant be accompanied by words of inheritance, the privilege conferred inures only <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>to tlie personal benefit of the grantee, and, since this is so, necessarily dies with him”: 9E.

    <p id="b90-4" data-blocks='[["BL_90.4",90,[285,470,1157,1073]]]'>In the instant case appellant argues that the privilege granted appellee’s predecessor in title was an easement in gross and, therefore, not assignable. Appellee argues that easements in gross in Pennsylvania are not necessarily personal to the grantee and are not necessarily nonassignable. While the precise question of the assignability of such easements has never been definitely raised in the pleadings of any case reaching the appellate courts of Pennsylvania, there is very weighty Pennsylvania judicial dictum against the assignability of easements in gross. In Tinicum Fishing Co. v. Carter, <a href="/pa/61/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="61 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="428573" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0021-01">supra,</a> Justice Shakswood quotes Chancellor Kent to the effect that easements in gross cannot be assigned to any other person or transmitted by descent and he also quotes from Professor Washburne on Easements to the effect that an easement in gross cannot be assigned “nor can it be made so by any term in the grant.” However, in the Tinieum Fishing Company Case the subject of controversy was not an easement in gross, but a profit a prendre.</p>
    <p id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[283,1557,1155,685]]]'>The decision of the case now before us does not turn on the question of the assignability of easements in gross, for the easement created and made assignable by the agreement of June 4, 1902, was an easement appurtenant. It is an established principle in almost all jurisdictions that “an easement will never be presumed to be a mere personal right when it can fairly be construed to be appurtenant to some other estate. Whether an easement is in gross or appurtenant must be determined by the fair interpretation of the grant or reservation creating the easement, aided if necessary by the situation of the property and the surrounding circumstances”: 19 C. J. 868.</p>
    <p id="b90-6" data-blocks='[["BL_90.6",90,[281,2263,1153,152]],["BL_91.1",91,[101,360,1161,2063]],["BL_92.1",92,[294,358,1153,198]]]'>In 9 R. C. L. 737, section 5, there is this statement: “An appurtenant easement is an incorporeal right Avhich, as the term implies, is attached to and belongs with <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>some greater or superior right — something annexed to another thing more worthy, and which passes as incident to it. It is incapable of existence separate and apart from the particular land to which it is annexed. It is obvious that the easement, to be appurtenant, must bí attached to the dominant estate, and it can become legally attached only by unity of title in the same person to both the dominant estate and the easement claimed. In determining whether a particular easement created by grant is or is not appurtenant to land, two matters must be considered — the nature of the right and the intention of the parties. In the first place, it is a rule that nothing can be appurtenant unless it agrees in nature and quality with the thing to which it is claimed to be appurtenant. For example, the right to overflow lands is not an appurtenance agreeing in nature or quality with the land itself but more properly appertains to something that has been put upon the land, such as a mill [Citing Wilcoxon v. McGhee, <a href="/ill/12/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="12 Ill. 381" data-case-ids="2578474" data-case-paths="/ill/12/0381-01">12 Ill. 381</a>, 54 American Decisions 409; Leonard v.

R. 764]. In addition, the easement must bear some relation to the use of the dominant estate. A right not connected with the enjoyment or use of a parcel of land granted cannot be annexed as an incident to that land, so as to become appurtenant to it. Some authorities hold that a way cannot be appurtenant to a close at which it neither begins nor ends; that one terminus must be the land or tenement of the person claiming it; but the more liberal view is adopted that, notwithstanding neither terminus of the way is upon the close to which it is claimed appurtenant, it will nevertheless be so regarded, if it clearly appears to have been the intention of the parties that it should be [Citing Graham v.

It is true that these expenditures were not made and the dam was not built at the time the original grantee, Witmer, assigned his interests in the agreement of June 4,1902, or even at the time he died, but we regard these facts as not controlling. When Fry granted the easement to Witmer, Fry well knew that this easement was to be appurtenant to the dam which Witmer or his assigns planned to build on the Susquehanna River. The quotation from Ladd v. Boston, (supra), is applicable here. It clearly is the purport of the deed from Fry to Witmer to create an easement in Fry’s land for the benefit of the dominant estate, i. e., the power dam to be erected. If, for example, Fry conveyed to Witmer by deed the right to enter upon Fry’s land occasionally to dump refuse into the river flowing by that land, we would have a typical case of an easement in <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>gross, which in most jurisdictions would not be inheritable or assignable, but the easement which Fry conveyed to Witmer and his assigns was no such easement in gross as the one just used in the illustration and which but for its creation by deed would be a mere license. In a document creating Witmer’s easement it was preliminarily set forth that Witmer “desires to cause to be built a dam or dams and other works in and along the Susquehanna River, the effect of which will or may be to back the water of said river and cause it to overflow or be withdrawn from the lands of” Fry. This expressly tied the flooding to the proposed dam. Fry proceeded to convey to Witmer, “his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns the right at any and at all times hereafter to cause the water on the Susquehanna River to flow back upon and overflow” Fry’s land. This agreement clearly implied that Witmer had rights in lands on which a dam was to be built and that this privilege of flooding granted to Witmer or his assigns a right that was necessary to the complete exercise of Witmer’s right to build that dam. To convey to Witmer the right to flood Fry’s lands by building a dam unless Witmer at the time either owned land on which the dam was built or was about to acquire such land, would be to convey to Witmer a right impossible to exercise. Just as in the case of Wilcoxon v. McGhee, <a href="/ill/12/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="12 Ill. 381" data-case-ids="2578474" data-case-paths="/ill/12/0381-01">12 Ill. 381</a>, supra, the right to overflow lands was appurtenant to a mill, so in the case before us the right to overflow the land of Fry and his assigns was appurtenant to the power dam, a dominant estate not in actual existence at the time the easement was created, but which was to be created according to the clear purport of the deed. The building of this dam was expressly within the contemplation of both parties.</p>

It was therefore assignable in law.</p>

      <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>As to the second proposition: A fair construction of the agreement of June 4, 1902, is that Witmer intended to receive and Fry intended to grant rights in perpetuity. The instrument provides that the release of damages binds not only Fry, but also “his heirs and assigns,” and further that the covenant for further assurances binds Fry, “himself, heirs and assigns.” If the instrument were construed as the granting of a right personal only to Witmer, it would follow that on the death of Witmer, the dam would have to be demolished. It is unreasonable to believe that Witmer would enter into an agreement which contemplated making expenditures essential to the exercise of the right which he secured from Fry if this right was to be only of an evanescent nature. A further answer to the second proposition is found in the words of the instrument as follows: “The party of the first part does hereby grant, sell and convey unto the said party of the second part, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, the right at any and all times hereafter to cause the water of the Susquehanna River to flow back upon and overflow the land of the party of the first part.”</p>

The McCall dam is located so far down the river that it does not affect the Fry land in the slightest degree; therefore, in no way can it be construed as either an exercise or an exhaustion of the right of flowage which was granted to Witmer and his assigns by the 1902 agreement. Furthermore, that agreement provides “for the erection of a dam or dams or other works.”</p>

When the water is dammed, they will die, decay, topple over and drift down stream to the prejudice of the defendant’s power plant. The full enjoyment of the rights granted by the agreement of 1902 necessitates the destruction of the trees. The grant of a right involves the grant of whatever is necessary to the enjoyment of that right. Furthermore, the agreement grants to Witmer and his assigns “all of the rights, easements, privileges and appurtenances in and to” Fry’s lands, “which may be required for the full enjoyment of .said rights.”</p>

The basis of plaintiff’s complaint is that his land, — acquired from Fry through various mesne conveyances, and subject, therefore, to the agreement between Fry and Witmer (quoted at length in the opinion of the majority), — will be injured by being overflowed by the waters of the Susquehanna River, if defendant, an assignee of Witmer, is permitted to construct or raise its dam in the river. Plaintiff contends, therefore, that defendant should be enjoined from continuing its work, until it has, by appropriate condemnation proceedings, obtained the right so to do. The agreement between Fry and Witmer expressly provides, however, that it shall bind all subsequent grantees under Fry, one of which plaintiff is, in favor of all later assignees who acquire title to the release specified in the agreement through Witmer, as defendant does, and this stipulates that the land described therein, and now the subject-matter of the present controversy, “shall be free, clear and discharged of all claims on the part of [Fry] his heirs and assigns for damages thereby caused to the <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>said land......[by Witmer or Ms assigns] by the erection of a dam or dams” in the river. TMs being so, plaintiff can have no claim against defendant, and hence cannot insist upon a jury of view to assess damages which legally do not exist. Alleging, as its only answer on this point, that the Fry-Witmer agreement provides for an easement in gross does not aid plaintiff, since the agreement, no matter by what technical name it is called, in unmistakable language excludes all idea of this hoped for recovery of damages: Tide Water Pipe Co. v.
