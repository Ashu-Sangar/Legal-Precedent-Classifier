L. 213, (Act No. 172), which was in force when testatrix died, and is now supplanted and renewed by section Í4 of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, 408, the words “in the event of his death without leaving issue,” as used in this will, or any Avords of similar import, if they followed language importing an absolute estate, would have been construed as meaning death in the lifetime of the testatrix. Appellee contends, however, that this conclusion was changed by the Act of 1897. That statute provides that thereafter such words “shall be construed to mean a want or failure of issue in the lifetime or at the death of such person, and not [an] indefinite failure of issue, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the deed, will or other instrument in which such gift, grant, de<a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>vise or bequest is made or contained.” It is no longer an open question, however, that the statute does not affect cases like the present. In Seewald’s Est., <a href="/pa/281/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="281 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1087059" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0483-01">281 Pa. 483</a>, 486, we said: “The rule established by numerous decisions both before and since this legislation [Acts of 1897 and 1917, supra] is that where an absolute estate is devised, followed by a gift over in event of the death of the donee without issue, such words will be construed as referring to death without issue in the lifetime of testator if the gift is immediate, or during continuance of the life estate if the gift is not immediate, and if the donee survives testator or the continuance of the intervening estate, his interest becomes absolute: Mickley’s App., <a href="/pa/92/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="92 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="491071" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0514-01">92 Pa. 514</a>; Patterson v.

It follows that, unless the legislature amends the act, our construction of it, as above, must have the same effect as if written into the body of the statute at the time of its enactment, and should not be altered by the courts, since so doing might result in unsettling titles to real estate, supposed to be vested because of that construction : Bingaman’s Est., <a href="/pa/281/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="281 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1087015" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0497-01">281 Pa. 497</a>.</p>

We are of opinion, therefore, that the true construction of the gift to the son is to vest in him a fee.</p>
    <p id="b54-6" data-blocks='[["BL_54.5",54,[277,2200,1153,211]],["BL_55.1",55,[111,364,1155,807]]]'>Nor is this character of estate affected by the later provision under which appellee, as executrix, is to rent and repair the property, collect the rents, “the remainder of the rents thereof to be used for the support and <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>maintenance of my son.” In view of the prior gift to the son of a fee simple title to the property, this new provision must he held to apply, as in the case of a guardian of a minor’s estate, only during the son’s minority. Under such circumstances, the words “for the support and maintenance of my son,” normally apply only to that period of life. When the will was made and when testatrix died the son was but about six years of age, could not be expected to attend to the real estate properly, and would, during minority, need some one else to do it, who would suitably apply the net rents to his “support and maintenance.” Presumptively, testatrix knew that, after he reached full age, there would be no such need, and hence provided only for the time the need would normally exist.</p>
    <p id="b55-5" data-blocks='[["BL_55.4",55,[111,1183,1154,688]]]'>What we have said does not affect appellee’s right to a life estate in the two rooms referred to in the second paragraph of the will, and particularly designated in the later provision, hereinbefore referred to, but not quoted. Nothing in this record leads to the conclusion that ap-pellee has lost the right to occupy these rooms. True, she does not now use them as a home, but neither does appellant so occupy the rest of the house. She has not given up the right to occupy them, however; on the contrary, she has been continuously in possession of the property since the death of testatrix’s husband on May 31, 1924, though the son has been of full age during all that time.</p>
    <p id="b55-6" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[110,1892,1155,424]]]'>The decree of the court below is reversed, without costs to either party, and it is now decreed that Ealph E. Lerch, the petitioner, is the owner in fee of Nos. 509 and 511 Market Street, Bangor, Pa., particularly described in the petition in this case, subject, however, to the right of Lillie Achenbach, respondent herein, to occupy, use and enjoy, during her lifetime, the two rooms particularly described in the will of testatrix.</p>
