Appellees, who are executors of Dorrance’s Estate, contend that although, under the Act of April 18,1919, P. L. 72, the testimony becomes part of the record, upon an appeal on certiorari “we cannot weigh conflicting evidence further than to determine whether the decree appealed from is supported by any evidence and whether the court or judge had jurisdiction or authority to do the act complained of.” Citing Walker’s App., <a href="/pa/294/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="294 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1113405" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0385-01">294 Pa. 385</a>. 389.

The determination of decedent’s domicile in this appeal is a conclusion of law, based upon facts, most of which are undisputed.

Dorrance was born November 11, 1873, in Bristol, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where he spent the early years of his life with his parents. In 1895 he graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, after which he attended the University of Gottingen in Germany, where he took his doctor’s degree in chemistry. In 1897 he entered the employ of the Joseph Campbell Preserve Company in Camden, New Jersey, in which company his uncle, Arthur Dorrance, had a substantial interest. He remained with that firm and its corporate successor, the Campbell Soup Company, until his death.</p>

      <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>At the start of his business career he established his residence at a boarding house in Camden, living there until 1905, when he moved to the Robeson Apartments in the same city. In 1906 he married Miss Ethel Mal-linekrodt of Baltimore, Maryland, who survives him as his widow. Dorrance and his wife made their home at the Robeson Apartments until 1908, at which time they moved to Philadelphia and remained in that city until 1911. In 1909 Dorrance purchased a country place known as Pomona Farms in Cinnaminson Township, Burlington County, New Jersey. He later conveyed the title to this property to the Campbell Preserve Company and thereafter leased the premises from that company. Upon completion of alterations to the leased property, Dorrance and his family entered into possession on May 7, 1911, and the Commonwealth concedes that from this date until November 14, 1925, decedent’s domicile was in New Jersey.</p>

The company itself grew into one of the largest canning and preserving enterprises in this country. At the time of Dorranee’s death in September, 1930, it employed between four and five thousand persons, and annually consumed in the business enormous quantities of vegetables and other farm products. Dorrance became the head of the company and from 1915 until his death was the owner of all its capital stock. In 1922 the company was reorganized as the Campbell Soup Company, a New Jersey corporation with offices in Camden. At the time of his death Dorrance had amassed an immense fortune, which both parties agree is to be estimated at a figure exceeding one hundred fifteen million dollars. <em>^</em>

The Commonwealth contends that from this date until his death, almost five years later, Dorrance was domiciled in Pennsylvania. Despite an attempt on the part of the executors to demonstrate that the former home in New Jersey was maintained as the principal home and establishment of decedent, and that there was a mere occasional occupancy of the Radnor place, it is our opinion the evidence clearly indicates that from 1925 until the autumn of 19E0, the Radnor Estate was the real and only home of the Dorrances, and except for ocea-sional visits to Cinnaminson and sojourns in Bar Harbor, Palm Beach and other resorts, as well as trips to Europe, “Woodcrest” was occupied continuously by decedent and his family until his death, and at present is the family home. The place at Cinnaminson was retained in substantially the same condition as before the acquisition of “Woodcrest,” but with the number of servants reduced from ten to two. It was occupied after 1926 by the mother and sister of Dorrance, who remained there until their deaths in 1928 and 1929 respectively. During their occupancy, one or two rooms in the house <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>were reserved for Dorrance and his wife and available for their temporary use at any time. The evidence is not convincing that Dorrance used the Cinnaminson residence for any extended period after removal of his family to Radnor. Undoubtedly he made occasional visits to the place, but these can be-accounted for on several grounds: his mother and sister were both living there and eventually developed fatal illnesses; the Cinnamin-son place was in the midst of the experimental farms of the soup company; ábove all, in addition to a claimed sentimental attachment to Cinnaminson, he was anxious to give color to his asserted intention to retain New Jersey as the place of his domicile.</p>
    <p id="b185-5" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[127,1066,1167,1133]]]'>Much of the vast amount of testimony and exhibits introduced by both appellant and appellees is immaterial to the issue, but there are a number of facts which, in our opinion, establish beyond question that continuously since 1925 the true home of Dorrance apd his family was in Pennsylvania, and that the New Jersey residence was retained by him merely to lend weight to the fiction that' he was domiciled there. Before 1925 Dorrance employed ten servants at Cinnaminson. After 1925 there were never more than four, and after the death of Dorrance’s mother in 1929 only two. At “Woodcrest” sixteen servants were employed in the house and ten to twelve others worked on the grounds. There was a corresponding, difference in the running expenses of the two properties. In 1924 the living expenses at Cinnaminson were slightly over twenty-nine thousand dollars. After 1925 the expenditures were considerably diminished and in 1929 amounted to approximately $6,500. On the other hand, the maintenance of the Radnor Estate exceeded $90,000 in 1929, and the year before amounted to approximately $95,000.</p>

The expenditure of a very large sum of money for a residence <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>which is not adapted to nor designed for mere seasonal occupancy is strong indication of an intention to make it the principal residence and main establishment of the family, particularly where the new residence is more elaborate and pretentious than any former abode. A few figures will readily show the marked difference between the Dorr anee estates. The Cinnaminson property consisted of approximately seven acres located in a country district and surrounded by truck farms. The homestead was more than fifty years old and had been remodeled in 1911. Although situated among fine old trees and surrounded by an extensive lawn, the house “was an ordinary brick mansard roof house of the time that it was <em>built; </em>very ugly,” as Mrs. Dorranee testified.</p>

It originally comprised 119 acres but subsequent additions to protect the boundaries brought the total acreage over 137. The house was an imposing stone residence of modern construction with six rooms and two lavatories on the first floor, and a large center hall which extended to the third floor. On the second floor there were ten rooms and five baths for the use of the family or their guests, and in addition twelve smaller rooms with two baths in the servants’ quarters. The third floor consisted of five bed rooms, a nursery and two baths. There were several smaller buildings on the grounds which were used as living quarters by employees. There was also a garage capable of accommodating seven cars.</p>

The inference naturally arises that <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>a comparison of photographs of the two estates would indicate considerable disparity between them.</p>

A fair conclusion from the evidence is that Dr. Dorranee and his wife made occasional trips to Pomona Farms remaining one or two nights at a time, and that upon their return from Bar Harbor or Jamestown at the end of the summers, a longer period was spent there, but only for the purpose of waiting until the servants had opened the Radnor house and made it fit for occupancy. When leaving for Europe or starting on summer vacations their trunks and other baggage were sent from Radnor and shipped directly back to that place upon returning. Considering the nature of the occupancy of the Radnor Estate, as well as the length of time spent there out of each year, all the facts clearly indicate that it was the principal establishment of Dor-rance and his true family home after 1925.</p>

Dorranee gave a number of large dinner parties there for men, principally business associates and friends, at which more than sixty guests were usually present. He and his wife entertained smaller groups for dinner quite frequently. His children invited their friends to “Woodcrest” for parties. One of his daughters was married in 1926 at the Radnor Church and the wedding reception was held at “Woodcrest”; another, who was at the debutante age, was presented to society at an elaborate affair there in 1929.</p>

The children were entered in schools from the Radnor residence and with their mother regularly attended St. Martin’s Church in Radnor Township. Dorrance himself did not transfer his membership to the Radnor Church but maintained his affiliation with a church in Riverton, New Jersey. This latter was only one of many things which he did to avoid the appearance of identifying himself with the community in which he resided with his family; and that these acts, together with his declarations of residence in New Jersey, were intended to bolster his assertions that he remained domiciled in New Jersey, there can be little doubt. His real motive and the reasons which prompted this course of conduct are apparent.</p>

This he would be able to do under the laws of New Jersey by the accumulation of income for the payment of inheritance and estate taxes, and with the assurance that his wife could not elect to take personalty against his will, which would not be possible under the laws of Pennsylvania. In addition, it was a matter of considerable importance for him to declare himself a resident of New Jersey in respect to the payment of annual taxes on personal property, as his stock in the soup company, as well as United States and New Jersey government securities, were exempt from the tax in that state. By claiming a residence in New Jersey, Dorrance was able to effect a large annual saving in taxation. Taxation matters were discussed by him in his conversations with leading business men and bankers in Philadelphia and empha<a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>sized by Ms New Jersey counsel. For that reason, Dor-rance informed others he hesitated to take up residence at Radnor, and when contemplating the purchase of “Woodcrest” he consulted his attorney, who advised him that retention of his New Jersey domicile “was largely a matter of intention.” Consequently, following his removal to the estate at Radnor, he scrupulously endeavored to declare in formal documents and on many occasions that he was a resident of New Jersey. Upon the advice of his attorney he executed an agreement with his wife that their residence should remain at Cinna-minson despite the occupancy of “Woodcrest” during “a portion of each year.” The agreement stated that both would refrain from voting elsewhere than in Burlington County, New Jersey, and contained other clauses of a similar nature. Dorrance refused to accept a directorship in the Pennsylvania Railroad until assured by the president of the company that it was not necessary for more than a majority of the directors of that corporation to be residents of Pennsylvania. On many occasions and in various formal documents executed after 1925 he stated his residence to be at Cinnaminson, but counsel for the Commonwealth has indicated several instances in which Dr. Dorrance did give his address as Radnor. Mrs. Dorrance was not as consistent as her husband in her declarations concerning residence. Her accounts with merchants and department stores indicated only the address at Radnor. All the members of the family were listed in the social register with address as Woodcrest, Radnor. In 1929, for the first time, the residence at Cinnaminson was included with that of Radnor.</p>

It is conceded also, that no question of the evasion of the payment of a tax in New York is involved here.” In the case of Dr. Dorrance, we have observed he from time to time expressed the belief that he was a resident of New Jersey. On the contrary his acts show a studied attempt to create evidence tending to indicate a legal residence in New Jersey. If he really believed he was a New Jersey resident after 1925, it seems unnecessary for him to have entered into an agreement with his wife concerning the matter, or to have secured his appointment as a member of a commission to investigate the question of compulsory insurance for motor vehicles within the State of New Jersey, or to have written his most intimate friends and associates that he was not a Pennsylvanian.</p>

Assuming such to be the case, there is no doubt that such vague intention of resuming a former domicile will not prevent the acquisition of a new one. “If a person changes his domicile without any present intention of removing therefrom it is none the less his domicile, although he may entertain a floating intention to return, or to move somewhere else at some future period.......

It is true the burden of showing a change from a former domicile is upon the party asserting it, but the fact of residence in a particular place is prima facie evidence of domicile. (As to burden of proof in such case see Collins v. City of Ashland, <a href="/f/112/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="112 F. 175" data-case-ids="6717696" data-case-paths="/f/112/0175-01">112 Fed. 175</a>.)

In our opinion this contention is unsound, for the intention to make one’s home in a new place necessarily includes the abandonment of the former home. This thought is clearly expressed in Ford v. Peck, <a href="/kan/116/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="116 Kan. 74" data-case-ids="1885367" data-case-paths="/kan/116/0074-01">116 Kan. 74</a>, 76, as follows: “It is elementary <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>law that change of domicile, as from Oklahoma to Salina, Kansas, involves two things, designated by classical authors as the factum and the animus. There must be transfer of bodily presence to another place, represented in the statutory definition by adoption of a place of habitation ; and there must be intention to abide at the new location, either permanently or indefinitely, represented in the statutory definition by intention of returning when absent. Sometimes the animus is treated as involving two separate intentions, one to abandon the old location, and one to abide in the new. <em>If the last mten-y tention he formed, it necessarily includes the other. </em>The 1 factum and the animus must finally coexist. Neither alone is enough; but the animus may follow the factum in point of time and, should that occur, the change of domicile is complete.” (Italics ours.)</p>

Dorrance, while to Pennsylvania he owed no such debt.” The large profits which came to him through his ownership of the Campbell Soup Company represented the results of nation-wide sale of his products. His money was acquired from, the country at large and not from any particular state. Moreover, Dorrance was by birth a Pennsylvanian. Even after his marriage he lived in this State three years before locating in Cinnaminson. When he came to Radnor to live in 1925 he was not only resuming his domicile of origin, but was purposely making his home in a neighborhood more congenial to his family and more suitable to his position in life than the New Jersey location which he left. It is appropriately stated by the Supreme Court of the United States in the recent case of Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, U. S. Sup. Ct. Advance Reports, 1931-2, No. 13, page 720: “Enjoyment of the privileges of residence within the state, and the attendant right to invoke the protection of its laws, are inseparable from responsibility for sharing the costs of government.”</p>

His intention to maintain a home, indeed a very lavish home, at Radnor, is undoubted. We fail to find in the record, after careful search, any convincing testimony of a bona fide intention upon his part or that of any member of his family, to occupy “Wood-crest” for any other than an indefinite period, and in fact to make it the “technically preeminent headquarters” of himself and family after November, 1925. “The intention required for the acquisition of a domicile of choice is an intention to make a home in fact, and not an intention to acquire a domicile:” Restatement of the <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>Law of Conflict of Laws, section 21.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Tlie evidence indicates that beyond all question Dorrance’s family home and principal establishment was at Radnor. When either he or the members of his family went away on vacations they started from “Woodcrest” and returned there afterwards. Practically his entire time, except when absent on vacations, was spent there. His friends and acquaintances considered it his home. Indeed we may readily believe that in his heart Dr. Dorrance knew “Woodcrest” to be his true and only home, but for personal reasons he preferred to state in public that it was not his home when every fact and circumstance pointed to the contrary. As already indicated, his mere declarations, undoubtedly made solely for personal reasons, did not prevent the acquisition of a domicile in Pennsylvania. In our opinion the evidence clearly establishes the legal domicile of Dr. Dorrance to be in Pennsylvania and accordingly there is due the Commonwealth an inheritance transfer tax, based upon the agreed value of his estate at the time of his death.</p>

He so badged himself in applying for passports and when he took the oath of office as a director in a bank in New Jersey. He declined election to the board of directors of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company until he was assured that he could under the law be elected and serve as a resident of New Jersey.</p>

To me the testimony overwhelmingly indicates that the Cinnaminson property was just as much an actual residence of Dr. Dorrance as was the house in Radnor and that his intention to keep Cinna-minson as his permanent home remained unchanged to his death. Where a man has two actual residences, he is free to choose between them. This the majority opinion recognizes, because it says: “Nor do we mean that where a man has two actual residences, either one of which might be his domicile, he is not free to choose between them.”</p>

It also demonstrates to my mind the efficacy of the rule that the findings and conclusions of the trial court should be accepted unless they are un<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>supported by evidence or are at direct variance with established law.</p>
    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[286,475,1149,367]]]'>It is my opinion that the decision of the majority is opposed to the established law, and unsettles it as related to domicile. It makes the determination of that question more concerned with the length of time one may spend in the places claimed as residences or domiciles than with the intent to establish a domicile or retain a status already acquired.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[282,854,1154,903]]]'>It is admitted that Dr. Dorrance was domiciled in Cinnaminson prior to 1925. The burden then rested on the Commonwealth to show that this domicile had been abandoned. While section 17 of the American Law Institute, Restatement, “Conflict of Laws,” states, “To acquire a domicile of choice, a person must establish a dwelling-place with the intention of making it his home,” and “The fact of physical presence at a dwelling-place and the intention to make it a home must <em>concur; </em>if they do so, even for a moment, the change of domicile takes place,” yet the converse of this proposition is true in relation to losing a domicile once established. To retain it the intention must persist to make it a home, and physical presence even for a moment concurring with that intent will be sufficient to preserve that status. Measured by such a rule the estate of Dr. Dorrance easily sustains its case.</p>
    <p id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.6",206,[279,1778,1152,641]],["BL_207.1",207,[114,376,1153,863]]]'>The Commonwealth, being required to show that his domicile at Cinnaminson had been abandoned, and that he intended to make Radnor his permanent home or “preeminent headquarters,” cannot assume that because he built a fine residence at Radnor with a more expensive maintenance cost he intended such abandonment or to acquire a domicile at Radnor. Neither the size of the building, the number of servants nor the expenses connected therewith are persuasive as showing abandonment of a domicile long acquired and retained through acts which show a positive intention to hold such domicile. Nor may the fact that much of the family’s social <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>life centered about the new residence be so considered. All such acts are consistent with and. not hostile to the retention of domicile in New Jersey. During the summer and winter his residence was at Bar Harbor, Jamestown, Palm Beach, or abroad; the Radnor residence was closed when the family went away in the summer, but Cinnaminson was kept open the year round to receive him and his family. How much of the balance of the time he spent at either of these places does not definitely appear. It is certain, hoAvever, that much of that time ivas spent at Radnor, but the length of time spent at any particular place does not determine domicile. Concurrent Avith physical presence in a place for any time, there must be the intent to make the place a home. Intention is a state of mind, evidenced, it is true, by acts, but it may be shown by words as well.</p>

His efforts in that direction are styled as “a <em>claimed </em>sentimental attachment,” “to give color to his assertion,” “to bolster his assertion that he retained domicile in New Jersey.” His church affiliation is described as being “to avoid the appearance of identifying himself with the community in which he resided with his family.” He wished to retain New Jersey citizenship because in that state his taxes would not be as heavy as in this State. I cannot see any good reason why a man should be censured when he wishes to avoid a heavy tax rate such as we have in this State, even if it is necessary for him to live in another state. It is not contrary to law to reside in New Jersey rather than Pennsylvania, even if the real purpose is to avoid taxes. “If one has the legal right to do a particular thing, the laAV will not inquire into his motive for doing it”: Beirne v. Continental-Equitable Title &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/pa/307/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="307 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1138144" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0570-01">307 Pa. 570</a>; Vetter’s Est., <a href="/pa/308/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="308 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="1140287" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0447-01">308 Pa. 447</a>. Moreover, even these criticisms emphasize the deliberate intention to retain his domicile in New Jersey. He had <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>his domicile there, wished to retain it, and while he wished to have a .residence in Pennsylvania, surely the fact of his acquiring this residence should not impose on him the obligation of our citizenship with the resultant liability for our taxes.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[286,640,1148,208]]]'>Dr. Dorrance had other reasons for wishing to remain a resident of New Jersey. Our laws as to the devolution of property are different from theirs, as are also our laws with regard to the execution of trusts.</p>
    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[282,859,1154,1185]]]'>I cannot see Dr. Dorrance’s residence in Pennsylvania as other than a “show place,” as Mr. Justice Schaffer has stated. It was an additional place of abode where he and his family might entertain on a larger scale than was possible at the New Jersey home, and where they might be nearer the social life of Pennsylvania. If the penalty for such acts in Pennsylvania is to be assessed with our death taxes, it seems to me that Pennsylvania is assuming a very difficult role in the sisterhood of states.. Radnor was not the home of Dr. Dorrance, nor was it his domicile, and whatever his wife or his children might have thought proper or convenient in this respect, and whatever they did, should not be visited on Dr. Dor-rance ; nor should that be held conclusive in preference to acts in which he did everything in his power to retain his residence in New Jersey. See Mr. Justice Schaf-fer’s dissenting opinion on the facts. He not only voted there, he had his church residence there, he was assessed there for personal property taxes, he was appointed by the governor of that state on a commission, and all his documents on which his address was necessary named New Jersey as his residence.</p>
