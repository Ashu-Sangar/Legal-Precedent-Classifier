The hole was caused by the removal of a nine- or ten-inch plank; she admitted she had known of its absence for approximately three weeks, that she could have taken a safer route, which she generally used at night, instead of one so obviously dangerous for travel in darkness, and that “the difference in walking time between those two routes,” was “not much.” She gave no excuse for her failure to avoid the known danger, and we can only say to her, as we have so often said in the past, that, “Where a person, having a choice of two ways, one of which is perfectly safe, and <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>the other of which [she knows] is subject to risks and dangers, voluntarily chooses the latter and is injured, such person is guilty of contributory negligence and cannot recover:” Levitt v.
