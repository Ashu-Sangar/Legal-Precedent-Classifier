Five days later her dead body was found on the second floor of an empty house at 1021 North American Street in that city. On February 12th, appellant, William Brown, a mulatto, then sixteen years and nine months of age, was taken into custody by city detectives and questioned. A ring found near the child’s dead body was identified by two colored girls as having been in the possession of the defendant. The defendant Avhen on the witness stand admitted that he had previously found this ring. The coroner’s physician testified that the hair <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>found on the child was of the same type of hair as defendant’s. Defendant confessed that he attacked and murdered the child. He was indicted and tried on the charge of murder. At the trial the chief issue was whether the defendant’s confession was made voluntarily or under such duress as to destroy its value as evidence.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[93,752,1155,1615]]]'>Defendant claimed that he was taken into custody about noon on February 12th, placed in a small, hot room at the police station and accused by the officers of the murder of the child, that he was struck by them over the eye with a blackjack, that he was struck altogether about fifteen or twenty times, that the officers continually cursed him and threatened to throw him “out to that mob,” that he was subjected to physical violence until he was taken to his cell about three o’clock the next morning, that he was denied food and water until 12: 30 p. m., February 13th (his last meal having been at 7 p. m., February 11th), and otherwise ill-treated. He testified that he finally said to the officers after they had drawn a gun on him and cocked the trigger back and threatened to blow his “damned brains” out: “You give me something to eat. Give me some water. Don’t beat me any more and I will say I did it. I will say I did it.” He said further: “I couldn’t tell them nothing. I just said I killed her. I killed her. And he said, 'Now tell me how you done it.’ I couldn’t tell him so he told me.” Defendant claimed that the officers supplied the details of the confession. The allegations of abuse and of deprivations of food and of physical injuries were denied not only by the police officers and detectives, but also by a physician who said that the defendant was under his observation at the police station every day during the time in question and that he bore no evidence of any physical violence having been done him, and that the latter made no complaint. A restaurant keeper testified that he furnished meals to the defendant.</p>

Defendant thereafter made a motion for a new trial. This motion was overruled and the defendant was sentenced to death. An appeal was then taken to this court.</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[275,632,1152,415]]]'>Appellant claims that his trial was unfair. This claim is based on certain excerpts from the charge of the court. One of these excerpts (3d assignment) reads as follows: “You have listened to the harangue. You have listened to the statement made in the effort to play upon your sympathy that if you find this defendant guilty it will be too late to do anything else; that you cannot bring him back.</p>
    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[275,1068,1151,195]]]'>“Gentlemen of the jury, you took an oath. You turn as deaf an ear to any harangue of that kind as you do to anything said about evidence that has not been offered in this case.”</p>

It is a constitutional right of the defendant “to be heard by himself and his counsel.” (Section 9, article I of the Constitution.) “Perhaps the privilege most important to the person accused of crime, connected with his trial, is that to be defended by counsel:” Cooley’s Constitutional Limitations, 8th edition, volume 1, page 696. “In guaranteeing to parties accused of crime the right to the aid of counsel, the Constitution secures it with all its accustomed incidents:” Ibid. 700. The weight to be given an address or given the testimony of witnesses is to be determined by the jury and not by the trial judge. For the latter to discredit the arguments of counsel by a contemptuous characterization of them is as much an invasion of the jury’s province and as prejudicial to the defendant as would be a like characterization of the testimony of an impor<a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>tant witness. Arguments of counsel are an integral part of a jury trial. They are not mere trial trappings which a judge is at liberty to dispense with or to instruct a jury to disregard. Juries do not decide issues on naked facts alone that are presented to them; they decide issues both on these facts and on inferences reasonably drawn therefrom. It is the right of opposing counsel to urge jurors to accept as reasonable the inferences which they respectively press upon them, and it is the duty of jurors to consider carefully whether they will accept or reject such inferences.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a>

In the case of McDuff v. Detroit Evening Journal Co., 84 Michigan 1, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20N.W.%20671" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="47 N.W. 671">47 N. W. 671</a>, 22 A. S. R. 673, the Supreme Court of Michigan in an opinion by Mr. Justice Grant said: “Whatever language may be used by counsel in the heat of trial, it is the legal duty of the judge to preside, and decide with impartiality, and to keep counsel within proper bounds. Appellate courts must presume that one occupying so important a position as that of circuit judge can influence a jury. It is their duty to follow his instructions as to the law. Whenever he expresses an opinion on any disputed fact, or of the character of a witness, or compliments one attorney at the expense of <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>the other, or uses language which tends to bring an attorney in contempt before the jury, or uses any language which tends to prejudice them, he commits an error of law for which the verdict and judgment must be promptly set aside. Appellate courts cannot correct mistakes of fact. Trial courts, therefore, cannot be too circumspect and careful to see that questions of fact are submitted to the unbiased judgment of the jury, which, under our jurisprudence, are for their sole determination. To sanction such conduct and language as the above [referring to the trial judge’s remarks] would tend to render trials a farce, and result in a denial of justice.” The third assignment of error is sustained.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[272,1074,1153,1345]],["BL_549.1",549,[110,383,1154,582]]]'>Another excerpt from the charge which is assigned for error (1st assignment) is as follows: “Police methods are sometimes not approved, but brutality is never condoned. I have never sat here and seen a defendant in such a terrible condition by his bandages and his face and the physical state of his body that I have ordered an investigation. I say now, as I did before, that I have sat in this court room as frequently, if not much more so than the other fourteen judges of this community. I cannot testify, but I cannot let statements of that kind go unchallenged, because they are not the truth.” These remarks of the trial judge were apparently made in answer to something the defendant’s counsel said to the jury. If defendant’s counsel in his address transcended the limits of legitimate advocacy by giving testimony, he should have been promptly brought back within bounds. Instead of doing this the trial judge took it upon himself to offer rebuttal testimony. It is no part of a judge’s function (any more than it is a function of counsel) to offer testimony unless he assumes the role of a witness, takes the stand and submits himself to cross-examination. Of course, if a judge appears as a witness,. he should not also try the case. The judge in his charge and counsel, in their arguments have the right to use illustrations from history or literature or any other <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>stock of common knowledge, but they are not privileged to testify unless they assume formally a witness’s role. In Com. v. Tompkins, <a href="/pa/265/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="265 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="1051921" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0097-01">265 Pa. 97</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.%20350" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="108 A. 350">108 A. 350</a>, this court reversed the judgment of the court below because the trial judge belittled the plea of insanity made by the prisoner, by stating that the prisoner was “of a class vulgarly called cranks” and that “those beings, who live with these unsettled minds, who are not taken care of by friends, relatives, or the State, when caught in the act of crime, must be punished.” The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>

But in Eule 37 this court “reserves to itself the right to notice a plain error duly excepted to, though not assigned, or improperly assigned, whenever it deems the justice of the case requires it.” As the case is to be tried again these errors should be pointed out. They are, quoting from the charge, as follows, A, B, C, D and E:</p>

They are your representatives, and if they are what counsel for the defense would have you believe, they are not fit to be your representatives, and there is not one of them who should not only be dismissed, but prosecuted, for doing the things under the law that he has no right to do.” These remarks did not indicate judicial equanimity. They were controversial in tone and phrasing and their import was to ridicule defendant’s evidence and arguments as to the alleged police brutality. On whatever proof of the latter it could offer, the defense relied to exclude the confession, and the issue of duress <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>with the conflicting evidence thereon the court should have submitted to the jury dispassionately.

It <em>toas </em>entirely proper for opposing counsel to discuss the question of punishment, for in the event of the conviction of the defendant of murder in the first degree, the law imposed upon the jury the further duty of determining whether the penalty should be death or life imprisonment. It was the right and duty of defendant’s counsel in appealing for life imprisonment instead of the death penalty, in the event of conviction of the highest <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>crime charged, to discuss the defendant’s age, his upbringing, his environment, and all other matters appearing from the evidence which might assist the jury in choosing the appropriate penalty.

See Smith v.

The law recognizes that some murderers of the first degree are properly punishable by death and others by life imprisonment. In determining the proper punishment in a case of murder of the first degree, a jury must act not arbitrarily, but intelligently in the light of both the evidence and the legitimate arguments of counsel.</p>

A recital of its details naturally inflames human emotions, but this fact only made more imperative the duty of the judge to conduct the trial of the accused with dignity and impartiality. The defendant was presumed to be innocent until the accusation was proved. At all times he was entitled to the protection of the law. On no official is conferred the power to prejudge a cause. No matter how rampant <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>the spirit of lawlessness, or of vengeance may be, it is the duty of a judge to exclude that spirit from the court of justice over which he presides. In the recent case of Powell et al. v. Alabama (Nos. 98, 99 and 100, October Term, 1932), the Supreme Court of the United States, in an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Sutherland (on November 7, 1932) well said that a criminal trial should “proceed promptly in the calm spirit of regulated justice.”</p>

Yet the trial of the assassin was so conducted that no one has ever intimated that either the judge or any of the opposing counsel departed for an instant from the high plane on which Judge Truman C. White early placed that case when he said to the jury: “We can pay no higher tribute to the man who is dead than to observe that exalted opinion and reverence for the law which he would ask if he were here.” As the trial was about concluded he complimented the eminent opposing counsel on the fact that they had “made no attempt to unfairly secure a verdict one way or the other.” At the close of his charge, he told the jurors that the spirit that had characterized that trial from its beginning should continue until the end, and that was the spirit of “a genuine, a tender and a reverent solicitude for the dignity and the majesty of the law.”</p>
