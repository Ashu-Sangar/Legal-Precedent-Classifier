There are exceptions to the rule: it does not embrace literal compliance with an act, the performance of which has been made impossible through no fault of the one whose duty it was to act, where the thing to be done may be done at some future time (Com. v. Hill, <a href="/pa/185/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="185 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="897999" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0385-01">185 Pa. 385</a>); nor does it include the performance of a public duty, the neglect of which works general inconvenience, serious injury, or injustice to those having no control over the person who is to perform the duty: Com. v.

However, where the act to be performed concerns vested rights, procedure, or other similar matters, such as the imposition of a lien or a charge against land, the statute is mandatory and its requirements must be strictly followed. See Wise v. Cambridge Springs Boro., <a href="/pa/262/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="262 Pa. 139" data-case-ids="1044459" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0139-01">supra;</a> In re Road in Salem Twp., <a href="/pa/103/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="103 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="449087" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0250-01">103 Pa. 250</a>; Harris v.

The time designated in the act for the report to be filed was one of the essentials of the proceeding as it affected property owners. It was also part of an orderly pro<a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>cedure designated by the legislature to establish the legality of the lien. Its nonperformance had a grave tendency to imperil the rights of those affected, for after the time thus limited the act gave to such persons another limited period, thirty days, in which to appeal to the courts. If the provision relative to the time wherein the report was to be filed was directory, then as the Act of 1919 amended the Act of 1913 in this particular only, the later act was useless. If appellee’s contention is. correct, there is no limit to the time within which the report must be filed, and all that is necessary is to have viewers appointed within six years and after a hearing their report may be withheld indefinitely. It will be seen a property owner would be put to the’ hazard of having his land subjected to a secret or at least an uncertain lien (Western Penna. Ry. Co. v. Allegheny, <a href="/pa/92/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="92 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="491057" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0100-01">92 Pa. 100</a>, 103; Scranton Sewer, <a href="/pa/213/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="213 Pa. 4" data-case-ids="943403" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0004-01">213 Pa. 4</a>, 8); or of being placed in the unusually vigilant position of ascertaining, in the years following the viewers’ hearing, the date the report might be filed. It is utterly illogical to suppose that the legislature intended such a result. It may as well be urged that the 30-day time within which an appeal can be taken to the courts was directory, and an appeal could be taken at any time. The same reasoning might then be applied to appeals to this court.</p>
