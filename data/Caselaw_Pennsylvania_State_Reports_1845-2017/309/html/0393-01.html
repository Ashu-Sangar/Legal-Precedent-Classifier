Pursuant to this authority, the then director of public safety had the city engineer prepare the plans and specifications, advertised for bids and submitted them to council on December 22, 1931. Council, by a vote of three to two, awarded the contract to the plaintiff on its proposal to construct the plant for $37,950.

In its proposal, plaintiff said: “We guarantee these furnaces......to incinerate 110 tons per 24 hours <em>at a burning rate of 70 lbs. per sq. ft. grate surface." </em>If the burning rate were not 70 pounds per square foot of grate surface, the guarantee would amount to nothing. That council thought it an absolute guarantee is shown by its resolution awarding the contract to plaintiff, in which it is set forth that the contract is awarded in accordance with plaintiff’s proposal, “Said proposal being to remodel the plant so as to increase the capacity to 110 tons per 24-hour day.”</p>

The furnace proposed to be installed is not a Nye Odorless furnace, but such as manufactured by D. N. Corporation.” The return further avers that the plaintiff had no right to construct Nye Odorless furnaces, as the same are protected by United States patents held by the Nye Odorless Incinerator Company. The return also avers that the failure on the part of the petitioner to submit a list of other plants made it impossible for council to get the information it needed to make an intelligent selection of an incinerator. In addition, it is averred that the plaintiff “does not now have in successful operation a plant similar to the one agreed to be installed;......that the failure of the D. N.
