Again, many quasi public corporations extend into and through different municipalities, and as a question of public policy it has not been deemed wise to subject them to the exactions of the taxing officer at every municipal division line but rather to authorize the Commonwealth to impose a capital stock tax upon such corporations, and in appraising <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>the same for the purpose of taxation, the real estate, franchises, earning power, dividends and all other matters which affect the value thereof, must be taken into consideration......

A mere private corporation needs no franchise from the State in order to carry on its business. Men may manufacture shoes without corporate power, but they cannot occupy streets or property of private individuals without corporate power or warrant from the State. They need a delegation of sovereignty and in such cases their works may be properly called public works. In the class of cases in which the double taxation here sought is inhibited, it will be found that this is one of the characteristics.”</p>

Whilst eminent domain is ordinarily an attribute of such a corporation, it is not essential that it shall be given that right. It must be a corporation of a public nature independently of any grant of eminent domain.”</p>

It is not so much a question of what public service the corporation is actually performing as what public services it must perform.” In that very case this court held that though “the State has at last taken firm hold of these institutions [normal schools]” and placed them “wholly within the control of the State,” <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>yet normal schools were not performing such public functions “directly in the public interest, under the law,” as to make them quasi public corporations.

That the State regulates a business does not mean that the State gives it official recognition as vital to the public welfare. Private corporations are regulated by the State to far greater extent now than they were in 1893, when the above cited opinion was written. If every corporation that must perform public service as it is set forth in the public service law of 1913 is to be classed as quasi public and therefore entitled to exercise the power of eminent domain and to be exempt from local taxation on its essential property, the result would be so obviously opposed to public interest as to forbid judicial acceptance of that formula. The implications of this doctrine are that all public service companies as defined by the Public Service Law are quasi public corporations. This doctrine becomes further patently unacceptable when it is realized that under the public service law not only corporations engaged respectively in twenty-six different kinds of businesses but also <em>persons </em>engaged for profit in the same kinds of business are expressly included in the term “public service company.” All these varieties of corporations and also all persons engaged in the same kinds of business are equally subject to the duties and liabilities of public service companies as set forth in article II, section 1, of the public service company law, as follows: “It shall be the duty of every public service company: To furnish and maintain such service, including facilities, as shall in all respects be just, reasonably adequate, <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>and practically sufficient for the accommodation and safety of its patrons, employees, and the public, and in conformity with such reasonable regulations or orders as may be made by the commission.”</p>

A corporation which operates a public inn is under a duty to serve the public impartially, and as the phrase “affected with a public interest” has in recent years been applied to much wider fields of business than heretofore, it would not be extending the phrase much further to say that a public inn is affected with a public interest. If appellant’s contentions in this case were judicially accepted, there are millions of dollars worth of property whose owners with equal justice could claim that it was affected with a public interest and was therefore exempt from local taxation.</p>

The issuance of this certificate is in the nature of a license to organize and do business rather than, like the conferring of the right of eminent domain, official recognition by the Commonwealth that the corporation is performing service of such vital importance to the public that it is virtually engaged in the administration of a public trust.</p>

Railroads render a service that is both important and publicly indispensable. The taking over of the railroads by the national government after this country’s entry into the World War may be cited as an illustration of the federal government’s view that the operation of railroads is essential to the nation’s well being. The exigencies of war merely emphasized this fact. The present evident intention of the national government to extend financial assistance to railroads in this period of economic depression is another official recognition of railroads as public necessities. Omnibuses may be regarded by some as public conveniences but no one can contend that they are public necessities. With our railroads organized and equipped to handle business far in excess of the present volume, with millions of privately owned and operated automobiles, no one can contend that the suspension of all motor bus traffic would, like the suspension of all railroad traffic, <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>mean ecomonic disaster. The fact that the State has delegated to railroads the power which is an inherent attribute of sovereignty itself to condemn and take private property, on just compensation being made, for the railroads’ use, is an official recognition of the fact that railroads are quasi public corporations whose property is devoted to a public use.' No omnibus company in Pennsylvania has received any such recognition from the Commonwealth. Public use does not mean merely general convenience or advantage. Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, 8th edition, volume 2, page 1124, says: “The right of eminent domain does not imply a right in the sovereign power to take the property of one citizen and transfer it to another, even for a full compensation, where the public interest will be in no way promoted by such transfer [citing, inter alia, Mayor et al. v. Scott, <a href="/pa/1/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="1 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="949843" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0309-01">1 Pa. 309</a>]....... Nor could it be of importance that the public would receive incidental benefits, such as usually spring from the improvement of lands or the establishment of prosperous private enterprises ; the public use implies a possession, occupation, and enjoyment of the land by the public at large, or by public agencies....... The reason of the case and the settled practice of free governments must be our guides in determining what is or is not to be regarded a public <em>use; </em>and that only can be considered such where the government is supplying its own needs, or is furnishing facilities for its citizens in regard to those matters of public necessity, convenience or welfare, which, on account of their peculiar character, and the difficulty— perhaps impossibility — of making provision for them otherwise, it is alike proper, useful and needful for the government to provide.”</p>

A corporation cannot obtain judicial recognition as quasi public unless the service it renders to the public or a large part of it are so essential to public well-being that any interference with its functions by local administrative agencies would be insufferable to the sovereign Commonwealth. The functions of the appellant company do not bring it within this class of corporations. It is only a private corporation which does not have to possess even chartered rights, much less sovereign rights, to carry on its activities. It renders no service which cannot be furnished through the ordinary channels of private competitive business. The State has no more solicitude for its continued operation unhampered by local taxing agencies than it has for the continued activity of an individual who owns a jitney and who after receiving a certificate of public convenience engages for his personal profit in the carrying of passengers for hire.</p>
