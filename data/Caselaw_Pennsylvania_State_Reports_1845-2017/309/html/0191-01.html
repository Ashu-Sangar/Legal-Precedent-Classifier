On March 2, 1928, they agreed in writing that defendant would sell to plaintiff the dwelling house and lot in which defendant resided, his office equipment, surgical instruments and certain furniture; that he would “turn over” to plaintiff “his said practice and business and goodwill thereof”; that he would “also introduce and recommend” plaintiff to defendant’s “patients, friends and others as his successor, and will use his best endeavors to promote and increase the prosperity of said practice and business.” Defendant also agreed not to practice, as has been said, “within a radius of fifteen miles from the Borough of Boswell for a period of fifteen years from” date. For that, the plaintiff agreed to pay $15,000, one-third cash, two-thirds by purchase-money mortgage, payable at the rate of $1,000 annually with interest at 4% per annum. The parties made settlement accordingly April 7,1928. Plaintiff took possession and went on with his professional work.. He made the mortgage installment payments as required.</p>

It is therefore clear that defendant is permanently engaged well within the circle in which he agreed that he would not practice, and from which he agreed to withdraw, and in which he agreed to assist plaintiff in establishing himself. As the facts are not disputed, it is unnecessary to refer to the numerous specific instances of his professional work stated in the record in the circle from which he cut himself off for the consideration paid and agreed to be paid to him by the plaintiff.

The meaning of the words used to define the territory from which defendant agreed to withdraw is plain, unambiguous and definitive, easily given practical effect. The distance “by the nearest traveled public way or road” from the Boswell Borough line to defendant’s office in Johnstown is 15.4 miles. If the defendant, as his argument implies, intended to describe a district irregular in shape and extent, as dependent on accessibility by public roads, he should have said so. Such a boundary would necessarily have elements of uncertainty, as there might be dispute about, which of several was the nearest traveled public way. These parties expressed themselves clearly in words of plain and simple meaning; that sense is not varied by the context. It is not suggested that there is any mistake about what they intended to say. The court has no power to substitute for “a radius of fifteen miles” the words “fifteen miles by the nearest traveled public way or road” because the context and the circumstances exclude such inference.

The locality was a built-up section of the city with an established street lay-out requiring considera<a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>tion in defining the words used. The sale of a going business in the city, and the agreement not to engage in a similar business for five years within a radius of five squares north, south, east or west of the premises sold, excluded a part of the meaning ordinarily implied by the circumference of a circle; and this was specially noted in the opinion as follows: “While the words The radius’ usually signify the distance from the center of the circumference of a sphere or circle, yet, as here employed in the original contract, they should be construed as The distance’ so the restriction would embrace a distance of five blocks from the old store. This distance should be computed by the nearest traveled way and not by air line. Judge Shafer so held in Silverman v. Edelstein, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20Pitts%20L.J.%20822" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="64 Pitts L.J. 822">64 Pitts. L. J. 822</a>. In Vidalet v.
