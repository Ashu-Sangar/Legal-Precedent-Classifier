In 1926 he bought seven properties on Second Street and four or five at Thirteenth Street and Pairmount Avenue, and had the titles placed in her name. She had nothing to do with these purchases, and did not contribute any money. When the Thirteenth Street and Pairmount Avenue properties were sold, she signed the deeds, but neither asked nor received any share of the profits of the sales, all of which were kept by her husband. When the Second Street properties were exchanged for the Oregon Avenue garage, she signed the deeds but did not otherwise participate in the transaction. The complainant managed the garage for a year, without interference from his wife or sharing the profits with her. The following year she signed a lease for the garage to Kassay, either along with her husband or alone, but she had nothing to do with arranging it, and subsequently exercised no control over nor received any rent from the property. Shortly before the filing of this bill, she and <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>her husband separated, and only then did she attempt to assert her nominal title.</p>

A double burden rests upon him — to prove the property was purchased with his money, and to overcome the presumption that it was a gift to her. “When a husband purchases property in the name of his wife, the presumption of a gift to her exists, and not a presumption that she is to hold the property in trust for him:” Gassner v. Gassner, <a href="/pa/280/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="280 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="1084473" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0313-01">280 Pa. 313</a>. See also Bowser v.

This may be overcome by evidence that is clear, explicit and unequivocal that his money purchased the property and that no gift was intended: Earnest’s App., <a href="/pa/106/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="106 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="455720" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0310-01">106 Pa. 310</a>.</p>
    <p id="b146-6" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[276,1227,1152,313]]]'>There can be no doubt that the property in question was purchased by complainant and paid for by him with his own money. He had money and his wife had none. She had full opportunity to deny his positive testimony, but did not do so. He has successfully carried the first burden placed upon him.</p>
    <p id="b146-7" data-blocks='[["BL_146.6",146,[273,1552,1154,853]],["BL_147.1",147,[123,356,1154,806]]]'>We think respondent in her answer relieved complainant of the burden of overcoming the presumption that the conveyance to her was intended as a gift. She destroyed that presumption by stating and reiterating in the answer that the property was purchased by her with her own money. This was a complete denial that she received the property as a gift from her husband. If it was purchased by her and with her funds, it could not have been purchased by her husband with his money and presented to her. She is concluded by the statements of fact contained in her pleadings and cannot now claim, in contradiction of her answer, that there was a gift. Her averment has the force of a judicial admission and acts as a waiver of any proof on that point: Wigmore on Evidence, sections 1057, 2589. The effect of the answer was to limit the issue to be determined to but one <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>question: with whose money was the property bought? Since the only issues to be passed upon are those raised by the pleadings (Zook v. P. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/206/0603-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="206 Pa. 603" data-case-ids="931835" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0603-01">206 Pa. 603</a>), complainant was not required to meet one which had been excluded from the case by the averments of the answer. The chancellor found that this property was bought with complainant’s money and put in his wife’s name as a matter of business convenience. In view of the uncontradicted testimony, and the admission in the answer, no other conclusion was possible than that there was a resulting trust. It comes with bad grace from respondent, having failed to offer any evidence in support of the only defense she set up, now to complain because the court assumed her answer under oath to be true and decreed accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b147-5" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[118,1174,1159,916]]]'>Respondent contends that she cannot be declared a trustee of the property for complainant in the absence of an averment in his bill of an agreement on her part to hold the title in trust for him. Aside from the consideration that such an objection, after the filing of a responsive answer, comes too late, the bill clearly contains the substance of such averment. As the court below said in its opinion, it “avers a practice utterly inconsistent with the husband’s intent to make a gift of the real estate to his wife. The ‘resale and renting of such properties,’ necessarily requiring the wife’s signature to deeds and leases, implies her understanding of and acquiescence in such a practice; that is, her agreement that her name be used in her husband’s business as a mere means of temporary holding and passing on of titles without her acquiring any interest therein; her agreement, in other Avords, to hold the titles of properties for her husband.”</p>
    <p id="b147-6" data-blocks='[["BL_147.5",147,[117,2100,1157,308]]]'>The uncontradicted testimony of the complainant and his Avitness, Samuel Kassay, together Avith corroborative proof furnished by his exhibits, easily overcame the responsive answer of the respondent: Smith v. Ewing, <a href="/pa/151/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="151 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="836715" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0256-01">151 Pa. 256</a>.

      <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>However, since respondent executed, as mortgagor, two bonds and mortgages upon the property in question, totaling $16,000, the decree of the court below should have made provision for her protection from loss in the event of subsequent default upon these obligations. While complainant, as real owner, is entitled to a conveyance of the title, he must assume all liability attached to the ownership, and relieve respondent of all risk of loss. It is therefore ordered and decreed that complainant, Morris Katz, upon receiving a conveyance of the described premises from the respondent, Esther Katz, execute and deliver to her a bond with sureties to be approved by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, indemnifying her against any possible loss by reason of her execution of the aforesaid bonds and mortgages.</p>
