The legislature deemed it desirable that the State should contribute to the maintenance of certain hospitals by reimbursing them, in whole or in part, for the cost of “medical and surgical services” rendered by them to the described persons entitled to such service free of charge; it doubtless concluded that unless such charitable and benevolent contribution (cf. Collins v. Martin, <a href="/pa/290/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="290 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="1104453" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0388-01">290 Pa. 388</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20122" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="139 A. 122">139 A. 122</a>) was made to the hospitals the general standard of the service rendered by them might suffer to the detriment of the general public, and that such deterioration should be prevented in the public interest. Obviously that is a single subject of legislation; it does not become two or more subjects (and that is the only criticism) because two or more hospitals may be reimbursed at the same unit standard of repayment; it is to the cost of <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>the same service, rendered by any of the designated hospitals, that contribution is to be made. Moreover, the reimbursement must be made by the state’s officers pursuant to section 2816 of the Administrative Code (April 9, 1929, P. L. 177, 71 PS, section 606, and the Act of March 15, 1899, P. L. 8, 72 PS, section 3482), and sections 307 and 403 of the Fiscal Code (April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, 72 PS, sections 307 and 403). No hospital named in the act may receive any part of the appropriation without rendering the particular service specified and, at the same time, in compliance with the legislation referred to; in this regard, all are treated precisely alike. Though named in the act, a hospital may receive nothing because otherwise not entitled; it may, for example, not render the specified service, or, for other reason, may be unable to bring itself within the requirements of the law. This incident shows conclusively that the subject of the legislation is not multiplied by the number of hospitals named as possible beneficiaries but that it remains the single subject specified in the title.

If the bill in question contains more than one subject it is in violation of both sections. It cannot violate either without violating the other.” The act is of course not a general appropriation bill, nor would the subject have place in such bill, because not in the category of expenditures contemplated by that designation in article in, section 15: Com. v.

Therefore, the act is, in effect, an appropriation to each hospital and the money can be used for no other purpose. This court said in Collins v.
