        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Frazer,\nHarold E. Williams has been twice convicted of murder in the first degree with the penalty set as death. The facts of the crime and the reasons for granting a new trial are set forth in Com. v. Williams, 307 Pa. 134, and Com. v. Prophet, 307 Pa. 122, and need not be again recited. The case comes before us now on defendant\u2019s appeal from the second conviction and sentence, alleging many errors in the trial. We will discuss only a few of the assignments, particularly those relating to improper remarks of the assistant district attorney in the course of the trial and in his closing address to the jury.\nThe defense consisted principally of testimony tending to show insanity at the time the offense was committed, but was supplemented by a claim of self-defense. The Commonwealth introduced expert testimony indicating defendant\u2019s sanity and the jury\u2019s verdict sustained this view. On the part of defendant there was testimony of twenty witnesses tending to show his insanity or weak mentality. Among these witnesses were: Doctor Johnson, who for twenty years had been the mental examiner for the Board of City Trusts of Philadelphia and who testified that defendant was \u201ca moron \u2014 a high grade imbecile\u201d and that he would remain at the mental age of 12 \u201cas long as he lived\u201d; Dr. Winkelman, Professor of Neurology at Temple University Medical School, Professor of Neuro-Pathology in the Graduate School of the University of Pennsylvania, and associate of many hospitals including the Philadelphia General Hospital as chief Neuro-Pathologist, who testified that defendant was a \u201ccase of constitutional psychopathic inferiority, with mental deterioration and a schizophrenic trend......a splitting of the mind, or a splitting of the personality,\u201d and who also gave his opinion that under emotional stress induced by a grievance, real or fancied, he \u201cwould not know the difference between right and wrong\u201d; also Dr. Bochroch, Professor of Mental Diseases at Temple University and neurologist for several hospitals, who characterized the defendant as a \u201cconstitutional psychopathic inferior,\u201d and who gave his opinion that, at the time of the crime, Williams was \u201cin a condition of acute mania\u201d and did not know the difference between right and wrong.\nDespite the testimony of these witnesses, the assistant district attorney who represented the Commonwealth at the trial, said at one point in his closing address: \u201cMembers of the jury, he [defendant\u2019s attorney] has drawn on his experience. He has drawn on it in his characteristically inaccurate way and he has stated in an inaccurate way characteristic of him, ceiTain facts in regard to other cases which are not part of your consideration in this case. He has told you many things, members of the jury, in an effort to sway you. I say to you now that he does not believe for a moment that his plea of insanity is going to prevail. Members of the jury, his effort in this ease is to reduce the penalty. He speaks of murder and he speaks of justice. The effort in this case, members of the jury, is to reduce the penalty. He apparently has abandoned self-defense, because, in an intelligent fashion, such as a lawyer would do, he has not discussed with you the elements of the crime of murder. Oh, no. Not one woi*d relating to manslaughter or its degrees came from his lips, and that is the first duty of defense counsel. Oh, no, not one word.\u201d The plain import of these words was to give the jury the impression the defense of insanity and self-defense had been abandoned, and that defendant\u2019s counsel was merely-seeking to reduce the penalty from the electric chair to life imprisonment. The prosecuting officer then made further remarks which might have confused the jury, by reciting the facts of a disconnected and irrelevant case concerning a man who was convicted of murder in the first degree with the death penalty and whose sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the pardon board. The inference was strong, although, of course, the statement was not actually made, that if the jury fixed the penalty at death, there was every likelihood the pardon board would spare defendant\u2019s life. It is clear that any misunderstanding on this point was vital, inasmuch as the jury returned to the court room for instructions after having been in deliberation for a considerable time, and requested to be relieved from fixing the penalty. The words of the assistant district attorney took away from the jurors the responsibility resting upon them to exercise their discretion in returning a verdict with a punishment which in their judgment as jurors they deemed proper.\nNear the close of the assistant district attorney\u2019s argument he pictured the crime as a most atrocious one and referred to the defendant as \u201cA cold, bloodless demon,\u201d who killed \u201cnot in the ordinary paroxysm of murder,\u201d \u201cbut sitting there as a fiend would, as a demon would, in the ordinary display of the devilment in his disposition\u201d ; defendant\u2019s counsel was declared to be seeking to set the defendant \u201cfree in jail by a verdict of first degree with life imprisonment, a potential murderer to go out and kill again as they do.\u201d These statements, coupled with those already referred to, denied to the defendant any chance for impartial deliberation by the jury, which is an integral part of a fair trial.\nAfter the assistant district attorney had finished his address to the jury, the following colloquy took place, as set forth in the record:\n\u201cMr. Moyerman: I want to enter on the record first of all that I take an exception to the remarks, and I ask for the withdrawal of a juror because of the remarks and comments of the district attorney.\n\u201cMotion overruled.\n\u201cException allowed.\n\u201cMr. Moyerman: I ask that it be noted that whenever he used the word \u2018he\u2019 in his speech, referring to counsel for defendant, he [the Commonwealth\u2019s officer] either pointed his finger or his fist at counsel for the defendant.\n\u201cMr. Carroll: That is a lie.\n\u201cMr. Moyerman: I also want it noted on the record that when he used the words \u2018false defense\u2019 he pointed his finger at counsel for the defense. When he used the words \u2018sex perversion\u2019 he pointed his finger at counsel for the defense. Whenever he mentioned \u2018rotten bones\u2019 he pointed his finger at counsel for the defense.\n' \u201cMr. Carroll: I did in that instance.\n\u201cMr. Moyerman: Whenever he said, \u2018He tells you to pour into the ears of innocent children\u2019 he pointed at me. When he said, \u2018He speaks in defense of murder\u2019 he pointed his finger at me. Whenever he used the word \u2018disgraceful\u2019 he pointed his finger at me. When he used the word \u2018rotten\u2019 he pointed his finger at me.\n\u201cMr. Carroll: I never used the word \u2018rotten\u2019, I don\u2019t go to the gutter for my language.\n\u201cMr. Moyerman: I have asked for the withdrawal of a juror.\n\u201cMotion overruled.\n\u201cException allowed.\u201d\nAs to the use of the word \u201clie\u201d by counsel in contradicting a witness, see Com. v. Swartz, 37 Pa. Superior Ct. 507, and on improper language, see Com. v. Meyers, 290 Pa. 573, 580; Gibbons v. P. R. R. Co., 291 Pa. 141, 143; Holden v. P. R. R. Co., 169 Pa. 1; People v. McGeoghegan, 325 Ill. 337; People v. Black, 317 Ill. 603.\nThat portion of the closing argument of the assistant district attorney taken down by the reporter was chiefly an arraignment of defendant\u2019s counsel, and the character of the language used is significant of that found throughout the trial. The record is literally strewn with improper statements and remarks, too numerous to be here set down. For illustration, when defendant\u2019s counsel misunderstood his expert, Dr. Winkelman, as to a medical term, the prosecuting officer called attention to the error, and defendant\u2019s counsel then suggested \u201cdon\u2019t make fun of me,\u201d to which that officer replied, \u201cI am not making fun of you. Nature performed that act.\u201d At another stage he stated that defense counsel had gone through a period of insanity or a paroxysm of insanity.\nThe court\u2019s attention was called to these improper remarks through exceptions, and although proper instructions might have cured the error, the jury was not instructed to disregard them. That portion of the address to the jury noted in italics might be excused under Com. v. Massarelli, 304 Pa. 335, but coupled with what followed, it cannot be pushed aside lightly. Improper remarks and unfair arguments made during the trial of a case involving a serious criminal charge have heretofore been emphatically condemned by this court. We must again forcibly repeat \u201cThat the district attorney is a quasi-judicial officer, representing the Commonwealth, which seeks no victims, but only justice; that, since he is invested with these grave responsibilities, he should, at all times, conduct the Commonwealth\u2019s case fairly, present it in an impartial manner, and avoid seeking to influence the jury by arousing their prejudices:\u201d Com. v. Cicere, 282 Pa. 492, 495. Moreover, as we said in Mittleman v. Bartikowsky, 283 Pa. 485, 486: \u201cIt is to be regretted that all members of the bar do not always keep in mind what was said by this court years ago, that \u2018A cause is not well tried unless fairly tried and a verdict obtained by incorrect statements or unfair argument or by an appeal to passion or prejudice, stands on but little higher ground than one obtained by false testimony\u2019...... The winning of a verdict should be a hollow reward to the advocate who has brought it to pass by appeals to a jury\u2019s prejudices and not by the strength of the case presented. Such verdicts are, moreover, worthless, for the courts will not let them stand. It is one of the duties of trial judges to keep the argument and remarks of counsel within proper bounds.\u201d\nWe do not wish to be understood as intimating that the assistant district attorney was alone responsible and defendant\u2019s counsel free from censure, for the manner of the latter was undoubtedly the cause of much of the unseemly conduct before the court, but all such actions are reprehensible in a court of justice, and particularly so when the Commonwealth asks the death penalty for murder. This case should have been conducted with the dignity that becomes all trials, especially those for murder. Our examination of the record shows the prosecuting officer did most of the interupting, particularly of defendant\u2019s witnesses, in many instances taking out of counsel\u2019s hands the examination of his witnesses. These improper outbursts and scenes strongly show a wrongful and prejudicial trial of defendant and should have been promptly terminated by the court and counsel reprimanded. The assignments relating to the assistant district attorney\u2019s address to the jury must be sustained.\nThe charge of the court was technically correct in the definition of homicide and all its elements, its various grades and their constituent parts, self-defense, expert testimony, and reasonable doubt, also generally on the defense of insanity, but was not sufficiently definite and instructive as to the application of the testimony adduced. The jurors\u2019 minds were left without sufficient guidance with respect to the testimony bearing upon the latter branch of the case. Nowhere in the charge does the court mention defendant\u2019s testimony tending to show insanity, except, in speaking of another matter, to say incidentally of the Girard College students: \u201cThey tried to tell the truth.\u201d The testimony of these boys (with whom defendant had attended school), defendant\u2019s alienists,- and that of his immediate family, was not mentioned or considered, nor were the jury instructed as to the legal effect of such testimony. Not a single exculpatory circumstance inuring to defendant\u2019s benefit was mentioned. Thus, while the jurors were informed of all relevant legal rules governing the specific ingredients and theories of the case, they were not instructed whether the testimony of defendant was sufficient to sustain his theory as the true one, and the effect of their conclusion when they made such finding. On the other hand, five pages of the charge were devoted to a presentation of the Commonwealth\u2019s case as it related to defendant\u2019s acts. This was not in itself error, but becomes so because of the oversight of the court in not mentioning the position taken by defendant and the testimony in support of his contention. The charge as a whole did not sufficiently present the case, and unduly stressed the evidence of the Commonwealth, as we said in Com. v. Westley, 300 Pa. 16. See also Com. v. Colandro, 231 Pa. 343, 356. The assignments bearing on these matters are sustained.\nThe instructions relating to the confession were inadequate, and the assignments relating thereto, particularly 67, 68 and 69, are sustained. The confession was the strong, pivotal fact in the Commonwealth\u2019s case, without it no conviction could be had. The confession was denied and it was charged it had been procured by force, intimidation, and hope of reward in some form. The general charge did not distinctly direct the attention of the jury to this denial, nor to any position or situation assumed by defendant; neither did it instruct, as requested, as to the possibility of Williams being easily influenced if they found his mind was in fact of the character described by his alienists and friends. The value of statements testified to by defendant\u2019s witnesses should have been pointed out as should those of Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. While, as stated above, there were general statements of the law applicable to confessions, and abstract definitions, we said in Com. v. Wilson, 186 Pa. 1, it is the duty of the judge under such circumstances to give the jury instructions from the evidence as to how they should view the confession. At page 22 of the opinion, this court said: \u201cThis duty of the judge under such circumstances is commented on in The State v. Wentworth, 37 N. H. 218, where the collateral inducement was the desire to obtain a reward that had been offered; in a Virginia case, 14 Gratt. 652, where it was the hope of the prisoner to benefit his mother by his confession; in 94 Cal. 112, when it was to aid his sister; in 22 Maine 171, where it was to save a brother. In all these cases the confessions were admitted, but the collateral inducements [or circumstances] under the influence of which they were made went with them, to enable the jury to determine the degree of reliance to be put upon them.\u201d\nWhile the jury may not have believed the testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses as. to the means employed in procuring the confession, still their attention should have been called to it, and they should have been instructed that if they believed what defendant\u2019s witnesses said, they should not consider the confession in reaching a verdict. The court gave no such instruction on this matter. See Com. v. Sheets, 197 Pa. 69; also Ziang Sung Wan v. U. S., 266 U. S. 1.\nWe have discussed this case as fully as necessary, and after full consideration of the voluminous record, we can reach no other conclusion but that a new trial must be granted for the reasons above stated.\nJudgment reversed and a new trial granted.",
