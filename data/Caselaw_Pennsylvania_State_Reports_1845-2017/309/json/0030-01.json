        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nTestator, Brolasky, died in 1886. In 1900, his niece, Mrs. Hughes, a beneficiary, by formal deed duly recorded, sold and assigned all her interest in his estate for $10,000. In 1908, for $1,000, she made a second assignment, the terms of which are not printed. Appeal, No. 175, is a contest between the two assignees, or parties claiming under them, and the only question is whether her whole interest passed by the first deed.\nTestator gave Ms residuary estate to the Girard Trust Company, trustee, on certain trusts. The residuary estate consisted of (1) real and personal property vested absolutely at the date of his death, and (2) contingent reversionary interests and remainders under deeds of trust, one of which was considered in Brolasky\u2019s Est., 302 Pa. 439, 153 A. 739. The property in the first class (for convenience here called \u201cabsolute property\u201d) duly came into the administration of the trustee in 1886. The second class (here called \u201ctrust property\u201d) did not reach its custody until 1909 when it was awarded to the trustee by decree of the common pleas. This \u201ctrust property\u201d consisted of two classes: (a) that considered in Brolasky\u2019s Est., supra, in which Brolasky had a contingent reversionary interest; and (b) real estate and a mortgage, granted and conveyed to him as trustee for the benefit of his adopted daughter Victoria (married to one Wallace) for life, and, on her death without issue (which happened), \u201cin trust for the use of him the said Jefferson H. Brolasky, his heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d\nThe residuary estate was given in trust to pay the income to testator\u2019s wife for life, then to his adopted daughter Victoria for life, and, at her death without issue and after paying certain pecuniary legacies, to deliver the balance of principal to testator\u2019s nephews and nieces in equal shares. On the death of Mrs. Wallace in 1927, without issue, testator\u2019s wife having died in his life time, the trustee filed its account. It was audited in 1929, and the fund for distribution was awarded to the nephews and nieces, \u2014 the assignor, Mrs. Hughes, being one of them, \u2014 each receiving one-eleventh, subject to prior assignments. No appeal was taken from that distribution.\nThe administration of the \u201ctrust property\u201d was not included in the account audited in 1929 for the following reason: Though Victoria Wallace was entitled to the income for life, she seems wrongfully to have taken charge of the property at Brolasky\u2019s death and for some time to have managed, or caused it to be managed, as her own. On October 13, 1903, she was adjudged a lunatic by a court in Virginia, and her husband was appointed committee. On July 6, 1908, acting by her husband and next friend, she filed a bill in Common Pleas No. 1 of Philadelphia County, averring that she was the owner of the property and praying for a decree that she enjoy it free of the trusts. Among the defendants named in the bill were Mrs. Hughes, and also the assignees of her interest by the first assignment, the second not having yet been made. Before this suit was tried, it was discontinued, February 27, 1909. Two days prior to the discontinuance, however, a number of parties who claimed interests in it (Mrs. Hughes and her assignees by both assignments, among them) filed their joint petition in the record of the equity suit, and asked for the appointment of a trustee to administer this \u201ctrust property.\u201d Among other averments, the petition contained one that, until the bill was filed, petitioners \u201chad no knowledge whatever of their rights under the above recited deeds\u201d to the \u201ctrust property.\u201d Wallace was made respondent individually and as committee for his wife; he answered the petition-by saying (so far as it is necessary now to state the answer) that he believed the averments of petitioners and joined in the prayer for the appointment of a trustee. On that petition the common pleas appointed the Girard Trust Company. In 1928, after the death of the life tenant, the trustee filed its account of the \u201ctrust property\u201d in the common pleas. It was referred to an auditor who decided that the fund passed to the trustee under the will and that the trustee must account in the orphans\u2019 court. This report was confirmed by the common pleas: Brolasky\u2019s Est., supra. The trustee then filed in the orphans\u2019 court its second account composed of the proceeds of property ordered to be retained in 1929 for further accounting, and the proceeds of this \u201ctrust property.\u201d\nAt the audit, claim was made by appellees to one-eleventh (in right of Mrs. Hughes) under her deed of 1900, and also by appellants claiming through the assignment of December 29, 1908. Under the earlier deed appellees claimed the niece\u2019s share on the ground that decedent\u2019s estate at all times had an interest, though contingent, in the proceeds of the \u201ctrust property\u201d and that it passed to them by the words of the deed to be quoted presently. Appellants, standing on the later assignment, based their claim on an allegation that neither Mrs. Hughes nor her assignees in 1900 knew that Brolasky\u2019s Estate had any interest in the \u201ctrust property,\u201d and therefore could not have intended it to pass, and that the deed expressly limited the interest granted to the \u201cabsolute property\u201d by the estimate of $200,000 as the value of the whole estate, a clause also now to be considered. The learned court below was of opinion that the words of the grant included the assignor\u2019s interest in the whole estate and made an award accordingly. This appeal is by parties claiming through the second assignment.\nBy her deed of 1900, (using all the terms commonly used in the sale of land) she sold \u201call the undivided interest to which she is now or may at any time hereafter be entitled in the estate left by Jefferson H. Brolasky by his last will and testament to the Girard Life Insurance, Annuity & Trust Company of Philadelphia, in trust, said estate being worth about $200,000, together with all ......the reversion and reversions, remainder and remainders, rents, issues and profits thereof and of every part and parcel thereof and also all the real estate, right, title, interest, property, possession, claim and demand whatsoever, both in law and equity, of the said party of the first part in and to the said estate with appurtenances ; [and she agreed] for herself, her heirs and assigns, that she and they will at any time hereafter make any further deeds, release, conveyance or other assurances of title which may be necessary to completely release and divest her or their interest in the estate herein conveyed or which the said parties of the second part, their heirs or assigns, may desire.\u201d\nIt is in the interpretation of those words that the parties to this appeal differ, and, to support their interpretation, appellants rely on parol evidence. We think the evidence was clearly insufficient to establish their contention.\nWhat was the subject of the grant? Decedent\u2019s residuary estate \u2014 vested and contingent \u2014 had been \u201cleft\u201d to the trustee; and \u201call the undivided interest\u201d of the grantor in the estate \u201cleft\u201d to the trustee appeared to be the subject of the grant. If the words \u201csaid estate being worth about $200,000\u201d were not in the deed, appellants would doubtless have made no claim, for there could then obviously have been no difficulty in agreeing upon the meaning of the words used. It is elementary that, when necessary to identify the subject of the grant, evidence dehors will be received to show the sense the words bear with respect to the surrounding circumstances concerning which they were used, but that such evidence may not be received to show that words with a fixed definite meaning were intended by a party to mean something different from what is clearly stated in the deed. It is not contended that this is a case for the reformation of the deed on the ground of fraud, accident or mistake. There can be no dispute about what was \u201cleft\u201d to the trustee by the will; it included the \u201ctrust property\u201d now for distribution (Brolasky\u2019s Est., supra), which, therefore, was part of the estate in which the grantor sold all her interest. Conceding that this \u201ctrust property\u201d was \u201cleft\u201d to the trustee, appellants, nevertheless, contend that Mrs. Hughes\u2019s interest in it did not pass by the deed, because in 1900, when the deed was made, the estate was worth much more than $200,000; they contend that the words \u201csaid estate being worth about $200,000\u201d were used in the deed with the intention of restricting the subject of the grant, and for the purpose of showing that the subject was not \u201call the undivided interest to which she is now or may at any time hereafter be entitled in the estate left......to the Girard Trust Company in trust,\u201d but only a part of it. Accordingly, subject to objection by and exception granted to appellees, appellants produced evidence, which the court permitted to go into the record, to the effect that in 1900, part of the property \u201cleft\u201d to the trustee \u2014 the \u201cabsolute property\u201d alone \u2014 was worth $293,300; and that the \u201ctrust property\u201d \u2014 which is to be distinguished from the decedent\u2019s contingent interest in it \u2014 was then worth $132,617. They add these sums, notwithstanding that the contingent interest in the \u201ctrust property\u201d and the vested interests in the \u201cabsolute property\u201d were dissimilar units, and contend that the total is so much in excess of $200,000 that the assignor\u2019s interest in the entire estate cannot have been intended to be the subject of the grant.\nThe contention must fail. In dealing with it, we note, first, that in 1929, when the trustee\u2019s account of the \u201cab< solute property\u201d (said to have been worth $293,300 in 1900) was adjudicated in the court below, no objection was made by present appellants, or any one else, to the award to appellees of their grantor\u2019s share in the proceeds (then in excess of $300,000) notwithstanding the great disparity, now relied on, between $200,000 and the actual value shown in the account. In other words, these parties, and the court, without objection, treated the words \u201csaid estate being worth about $200,000,\u201d as generally descriptive, and not as a stipulation expressing an intention to restrict the assignor\u2019s grant to her share in a $200,000 interest in the estate or to an estate of \u201cabout\u201d that value.\nIt is next to be noted that, at the audit of the account now before us, appellants showed, as has been stated, that the \u201ctrust property\u201d involved was worth $132,600 in 1900. But that evidence is of no value in arriving at the expressed meaning of the parties to the deed, because in 1900 the interest of decedent\u2019s estate in this property was merely contingent, or liable to be divested; there is no evidence of the value of the interest in that contingency. But if there was any market whatever for it, there is evidence that its value must have been far from the then value of the real estate; on this subject we have the very positive declaration of Mrs. Hughes and appellants\u2019 assignors to that effect; for as late as 1908, Mrs. Hughes purported to sell to them a one-eleventh share in it for only $1,000. There is, therefore, no evidence in the record to support any finding that the decedent\u2019s entire estate, vested and contingent, was in 1900 worth much, if any, more than $293,000, the sum which all parties agreed, and which the court held, was not inconsistent with the descriptive $200,000, when the distribution.of 1929, unappealed from, was made. Indeed, so natural is it to regard the words as descriptive, that in appellants\u2019 brief they say at one place that \u201cthe value of the estate which the parties knew about was described in the conveyances as \u2018about $200,000.\u2019 \u201d\nAppellants present another point, which the evidence they rely on does not support, so that we need not consider what the effect would be if the evidence supported the suggested fact. It is based on the petition presented to the common pleas in 1909. As affecting the weight that could be given to it as evidence, we first note that the petition was not executed personally by Mrs. Hughes or by appellees, but only by their attorneys; it was sworn to by E. M. Brolasky, assignee by the assignment of 1908, under which appellants claim, as \u201ctrue and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.\u201d An averment in the petition states that, until the filing of the bill by Wallace against the petitioners, they \u201chad no knowledge whatever of their rights under the above recited deeds,\u201d i. e., the deeds for the \u201ctrust property\u201d in which the estate was contingently interested. On the averment so made in the petition for the appointment of a trustee, appellants now make a contention in these words: \u201cthat neither of the parties to the assignments at the time thereof knew of the existence of the \u2018trust\u2019 properties which it is now claimed are covered by such assignments.\u201d It will be noticed that the contention is something quite different from a denial of \u201cknowledge of their rights.\u201d There is no averment that they did not know of the \u201ctrust properties\u201d or of the reversionary and remainder interests in it of Brolasky\u2019s Estate. While the averment of the petition, if received in evidence in this proceeding, would be subject to explanation or denial by the appellee-petitioners (Com. ex rel. v. Monongahela Co., 216 Pa. 108, 116, 64 A. 909) it can now go no further in this case than it says, i. e., that the parties did not know their \u201crights\u201d under the deeds. The averment is consistent with the fact that Mrs. Hughes and her grantees knew of the deeds, which had been recorded long before testator died; she is not excused for not knowing the law and therefore the meaning of the deeds; without more than the averment quoted, the court may not find as a fact that they did not have such knowledge. Moreover, what do they mean when they say they did not know their rights? Do they mean that Mrs. Hughes, as a niece and heir, was in doubt whether she would take by purchase on the death of the life tenant, or by descent, or was she ignorant in some other respect? But it is settled that this court cannot speculate about it. \u201cWhy should we make such assumption when the effort is to have us reverse the action of the court below? If any assumption is to be made it is to be with respect to facts which make for the support of the action of the court rather than its defeat. Clearly it was the business of the appellant......to develop the facts on which an intelligent conclusion could rest:\u201d Kellerman\u2019s Est., 242 Pa. 3, 14, 88 A. 865.\nReturning now to appellants\u2019 contention that \u201cthe assignment by virtue of the qualifying words \u2018said estate being worth about $200,000\u2019 is ambiguous on its face,\u201d and that those words \u201con their face restrict the assignment to an estate of about $200,000,\u201d it must be conceded that, in the absence of those words, there could be no doubt that the general words preceding them would convey the grantor\u2019s entire interest. The law presumes that a man intends the legal consequences of his words. A general clause having definite legal import, as here, is not limited by subsequent words, when another reasonable construction for them can be found (Anderson v. Nesbit, 2 R. 114; Miner\u2019s App., 61 Pa. 283; Waits v. Bailey, 192 Pa. 562, 44 A. 262; Fellbush v. Egen, 221 Pa. 420, 70 A. 816) because in such circumstances the deed is to be construed most strongly against the grantor: Miner\u2019s App., supra; Smith\u2019s Est., 69 Pa. Superior Ct. 376, 386; Advance I. S. Co. v. Eagle, M. C. Co., 267 Pa. 15, 109 A. 771. Now, as these appellants, with others at the audit of the first account in 1929, treated the words \u201csaid estate being worth about $200,000\u201d as merely descriptive and not as restrictive, and as that was apparently the purpose of inserting them, we can see no reason why they should not continue to be so considered. General words of conveyance must be understood with reference to the estate to which the grantor was entitled at the time of the grant, and, where the meaning of the words is clear, the intent must be gathered solely from them. The meaning of this deed is apparently clear, as the parties themselves seem to have understood at the first audit; it is not ambiguous to the extent of being reasonably capable of more than one construction. Such evidence as was received to interpret the deed by identifying the subject-matter of the grant, was properly received; but the evidence offered to show that some unexpressed intention should nevertheless be given effect, was properly excluded from consideration: Benson v. Miners Bank, 20 Pa. 370, 373; Caldwell v. Fulton, 31 Pa. 475, 489; Laidley v. Rowe, 275 Pa. 389, 396, 119 A. 474; Fellbush v. Egen, supra.\nNo. 176 involves a contest between parties claiming under a deed of assignment by testator\u2019s nephew, Joseph B. Brolasky, made in 1900, and parties claiming under an assignment by Mm made in consideration of $1 on January 20, 1909. The record raises the same question considered in Appeal No. 175, and for the reasons given, this appeal must also be dismissed.\nNo. 177 is a third appeal on the same record, but raising a different question. On November 4, 1903, Mary J. Cohen Young, testator\u2019s niece, with her husband and their children, sold all their interest in the estate to A. Wellington Wallace and another whose personal representatives are appellees. The only question involved (all others having been withdrawn at the oral argument) is thus stated by appellants: \u201cCan a person in the position of a constructive trustee profit by a transaction with a beneficiary of the trust without showing that a full disclosure of the interest of the beneficiary was made to her at the time of the transaction?\u201d The record does not disclose facts raising the question. The suggestion is that as Wallace was appointed committee in lunacy for his wife, October 13, 1903, and a few weeks later purchased the interest of the Youngs, he was a constructive trustee, wherefore, it being averred that no disclosure was made, his personal representative is now not entitled to receive one-half the fund for distribution (no question being raised as to the other half). This point was not thought of at the audit (reliance there being placed on estoppel) but was first presented below to the court in banc, when exceptions to the adjudication were argued.\nThe evidence in the record does not support the conclusion that Wallace was acting in the fiduciary capacity suggested; that lack of evidence may, of course, result from the fact that the point was not thought of at the audit; or it may be that, as Wallace and Mrs. Young and others interested had died, additional evidence could not be procured. We must, however, take the record as it is. Not only is there no evidence of the de facto trusteeship, but it does not appear that the grantors were not fully informed of all the circumstances. Apart from those considerations, too, the delay in asserting the alleged right is fatal, whether calculated from the date of the deed in 1903, or from the date of the equity proceeding in 1908 (to which Mrs. Young\u2019s assignees were parties) which reveal such connection with the \u201ctrust properties\u201d as Wallace had: Ashurst\u2019s App., 60 Pa. 290, 315; Bruner v. Finley, 187 Pa. 389, 403, 41 A. 334; Church v. Winton, 196 Pa. 107, 110, 46 A. 363.\nIn each appeal the decree is affirmed, appellants to pay the costs.",
