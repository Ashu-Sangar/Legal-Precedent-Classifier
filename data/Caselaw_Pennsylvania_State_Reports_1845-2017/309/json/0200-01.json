        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nThomas W. Finley died intestate and his widow was appointed administratrix of his estate. She filed an account, but died before it was settled. When it came up for audit, the court below directed that it should be restated, and her administrator, from the best information he could obtain, endeavored to comply with this direction. The administrator de bonis non of the husband\u2019s estate, and a creditor thereof, each filed exceptions to the restated account, which was audited by the court below, resulting in serious surcharges and a final decree of distribution. Not satisfied with the extent of the surcharges, each of the exceptants prosecuted one of the present appeals. In their statement of the questions involved, they contend that four additional surcharges should have been made, and these we will consider in their order.\nAmong the assets of decedent, at the time of his death, were twenty-four $1,000 bonds of the General Investment Company. They were appraised at one-half their par value, but in fact could not be sold at any price. When the widow, as administratrix, filed her original account, she claimed an additional credit of $7,000, thus leaving an apparent liability of $5,000 against her. The way this arose was as follows: The widow and heirs, thinking there were ample assets to pay all the debts and leave a surplus for division among themselves, agreed to take these bonds and certain other unsalable stocks at a valuation of $5,000, \u201cregardless of their [actual] value\u201d; but when it was ascertained that the debts would more than absorb all the assets, so that they would not have any distributive shares, the administrator of the widow, in the restated account, claimed a credit for the entire $12,000, and this the court below allowed. It could not have done otherwise. There was no evidence that anything could have been realized on the bonds, at the time of or after decedent\u2019s death, and hence there was nothing upon which to base the surcharge.\nThe second objection is because the court below refused to surcharge the administratrix\u2019s estate with the sum of $3,558 realized from the sale of real estate belonging to decedent, and divided between the widow and children. The property was not sold by order of court, nor by virtue of any agreement to which the creditors were a party, nor had they kept alive the lien of their debts on the realty. Hence they had no right to any part of this fund. That the widow, under the mistaken advice of her counsel, had erroneously included it in her administration account, as prepared by him, could not operate to give the creditors any claim upon the fund; nor could it prevent her administrator, when wisely advised by more competent counsel, from excluding it from the restated account.\nThe third objection is to certain credits allowed \u201cfor taxes on coal lands in West Virginia.\u201d It would have been well if appellants had given heed to the admission in their brief that \u201cThe amounts are relatively small, and the point is of little importance.\u201d The sums paid by her were to protect the stocks and bonds of certain West Virginia coal companies, belonging to decedent but held as collateral by the creditor appellant, without the payment of which this asset would have been lost. It may be that, in the light of the subsequent depression through which we are passing, we can now see that it would have been better not to make these payments, but the widow\u2019s estate is not to be depleted because she was not wiser \u201cin her day and generation than the children of light,\u201d and hence did not foresee the trouble ahead.\nThe final objection is to the allowance to her of $155.51 as commissions for her services. Here again appellants .Would have wisely heeded what they say in their brief: \u201cThe amount is too small to argue about,\u201d especially as they knew that, in the matters complained of, she acted on the advice of counsel who was competent at one time, but, through dissipation, had ceased to be so. The auditing judge found as facts, not challenged on these appeals : \u201cThere is no evidence of fraud on her part, but plenty of ill advice by counsel.\u201d \u201cIt is only fair to state on behalf of this helpless widow that she had poor legal aid, from one who had at one time been an able counselor, but an uncontrollable indulgence had impaired his abilities.\u201d In the light of these facts we see no reason why the widow\u2019s estate should be deprived of even the small commission allowed.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed and each appeal is dismissed at the cost of the appellant therein.",
