In that capacity, on the 11th of March 1876, on his own view and at the request and upon the confession of the parties, he convicted as vagrants two poor', houseless strangers and travellers, having no settlement in the county, wandering about and begging, and belonging to that class of persons familiarly known as <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>“ tramps,” and committed them, under the Acts of 21st February 1767, 1 Sm. Laws 269 § 1, Purd. Dig. 1463-4, and of 13th June 1836, Pamph. L. 548, Purd. Dig. 1453, to the common jail of the county at hard labor for the period of fifteen hours, at the .expiration of which time they were discharged from jail without payment of costs. During their imprisonment they performed no hard labor, no opportunity being afforded in the jail or elsewhere in the county for the fulfilment of such a sentence. Both the persons thus sentenced were included in the one charge and commitment, as was the practice with the justice in cases where two or more vagrants were before him at the same time. This was only one of many commitments made by similar magistrates of Doylestown borough. * The plaintiff claimed as costs forty cents for commitment and twenty cents for docket entry and sought to obtain the same from the county, which the commissioners refused to pay, contending that the county was not liable for the payment of these costs.</p>

J., sustained this contention of the commissioners in an opinion, which, after a discussion of the evils of vagrancy, continued, “The punishment of vagrants is provided for by the Acts of 1767 and 1836. The former act makes it lawful for any justice of the peace to commit such offenders (being thereof legally convicted before him, on his own view, or by the confession of such offenders, or by the oath or affirmation of one or more credible witnesses), to the workhouse of said county, if such there be, otherwise to the common jail of the county, there to be kept at hard labor by the keeper of such workhouse or jail, for any time not exceeding one month.</p>

      <em>“ </em>That vagrancy is to be considered a crime within the meaning of this section there can'be no doubt.

This section was in force until 1860. Under it, the Supreme Court held, the county was liable in such cases for costs immediately upon the conviction of the offender, without waiting for his discharge according to law: Commonwealth <em>ex rel. </em>Freytag <em>v. </em>The Commissioners of Philadelphia County, <a href="/binn/6/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Binn. 397" data-case-ids="1795143" data-case-paths="/binn/6/0397-01">6 Binn. 397</a>; Commonwealth <em>ex rel. </em>Barnes <em>v. </em>Commissioners, 2 S. &amp; R. 290. The case of Northampton County <em>v. </em>West, puts the liability of the county expressly upon the ground that the defendant had been sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor.

If the commissioners have such power they may withhold its exercise and a discharge without their authority would not make the county liable for the costs. The sheriff clearly has no power to discharge without payment. If he ■undertakes to do so he may perhaps make himself liable to an action for escape, or to a prosecution for a misdemeanor in office, but he cannot thus impose upon the county the costs accrued against his prisoner.</p>

Whilst it has been held, in the cases of the County of Lancaster <em>v. </em>Brinthall, 5 Casey 38, and the County of Northampton <em>v. </em>West, 4 Id. 173, that the county may become liable for the fees of officers in convictions and commitments for vagrancy, yet this can only happen when the conditions prescribed by statute have been complied with. The Act of 31st March 1860, reads in this manner : “ And in all cases of conviction for any crime, all costs shall be paid by the party convicted; but, when such party shall have been discharged, according to law, without payment of costs, the costs of prosecution shall be paid by the county.” That vagrancy is a crime has been often ruled; such being the case, we may see, by the statute above recited, that the party convicted is the one who is primarily liable for costs, and it is only after the convict has been lawfully discharged, without payment of such costs, that this duty can be cast upon the county treasury. If, indeed, as is intimated by the learned judge, the commitments, in these cases, were intended, not for the punishment of the vagrants, but rather for their accommodation, the officers deserved no costs. As was said by Mr. Justice Lowrie, in the case of Cumberland Co. <em>v. </em>Holcomb, 12 Casey 349, “If such things be done for charity let it not be for the benefit of the magistrate. The jail is not an almshouse, nor jailers the administrators of poor funds.”</p>
