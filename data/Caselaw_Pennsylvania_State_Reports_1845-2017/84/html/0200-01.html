J., it appeared from the evidence that on the 31st of May 1876, the family of the deceased, consisting of himself, his wife Mary, his children Irvin, Alvin, Clara, Alice, the prisoner Allen, a grandchild Flora, and a man named Moses <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>Schug, who boarded with the family, all sat down to take supper. Shortly thereafter one after another of those at the table, in quick succession, were taken suddenly and violently ill. The symptoms of all were alike, differing however in degree, the mother, father and Schug being most violently affected, and the small child Flora and the prisoner the least. All the family were compelled to leave the table. This sudden attack of sickness was followed almost immediately with vomiting and purging, .griping pains, cold and clammy skin and excessive prostration. From the effect of this sickness Mary Ann Laros, the wife of Martin Laros, died at seven o’clock on the following morning, Martin Laros about one in the afternoon, and Moses Schug on the following day in the afternoon. Two of the family testified as to the peppery taste .on their lips and tongues and burning sensation in the throat produced by drinking the coffee at the supper, and two physicians testified to a like sensation experienced from actual experiment with white arsenic in solution. It was in evidence that all partook of the coffee except perhaps the prisoner. A post mortem examination discovered traces of arsenic in the stomach of the deceased. In the coffee-pot, which had been used by the family, a white sediment was found, which upon analysis was discovered to be arsenic, and from appearances about four ounces and a half had been deposited therein. The analysis was made by Dr. Mclntire, a reputable physician of Easton, and Mr. Davidson, of Lafayette College, according to the most approved scientific tests, and both pronounced the sediment to be arsenic. It was shown that the prisoner, a day or two before the poisoning, had purchased in a drug store in Easton of Dr. Yoorhees about four and a half ounces of arsenic, for the purpose, as he alleged, of killing rats, and that at the same time he had bought a bottle of Brown’s Camphorated Dentifrice. The prisoner, subsequent to the poisoning, made declarations to witnesses about having made such a purchase of the dentifrice about the time named and the bottle was found in the house of the deceased. He also made certain declarations about the concealment ’of money belonging to the deceased and Moses Schug, and money was found at the place indicated. William Schug testified that in reply to a question as to what he meant by doing a deed of that kind, alluding to the poisoning, the prisoner said, “ Bill, I don’t know why I done it; I had no cause to do it, and I am sorry it is the way it is; but it is too late.” It appeared that the prisoner was at home an hour or two previous' to the supper and could have had opportunity to have deposited the poison in the coffee-pot.</p>

But a careful review of the testimony, running in its current and along with the bills of exceptions as they were taken, discloses that they are groundless. The case was carefully tiled, and the rulings fair and substantially correct. In such a case as this slight inaccuracies, doing no substantial hurt to the prisoner, ought not to turn aside the course of justice. The desperate condition of offenders often leads to many shifts to escape. Insanity is a common resort, but the burthen of its proof lies on the prisoner, and it is not every proposition he makes must be allowed, especially when it tends to mislead the jury.</p>

We shall confine our discussion to those most strongly urged. The objection to the question to Dr. Green as to his knowledge of Dr. Mclntire’s learning in the science of chemistry and his qualification to make an analysis quantitative and qualitative is not sustained. Dr. Mclntire had testified to his own knowledge and competency, and the testimony offered was only confirmatory. The <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>question related to Dr. Green’s knowledge, as a matter of fact, derived from observation.

It is needless to inquire into the competency of the testimony of the prisoner, before the coroner’s inquest, Avhen Dr. Yoorhees himself testified to the fact admitted by the prisoner. The doctor sold him the bottle of dentifrice when he sold him the arsenic, and identified the prisoner as the purchaser. Nor is it necessary to inquire into the competency of the confession made to William Bitters, relative to the concealment of the money, referred to in the 11th assignment, when it is proved that in consequence of the information search Avas made at the place described by the prisoner, and the money found there. An admission not competent as a confession is admissible when its truth is proved by the revelation of the fact by search.</p>

They were all offers collateral or secondary to the proof of insanity, and Avere not admissible until direct evidence of the prisoner’s insanity had been given. A court is not bound to hear eAÓdence of the insanity of a man’s relatives, or evidence of his proper instruction in morals and religion, or of the kind treatment of his relatives and friends, as grounds of a presumption of possible insanity, until some evidence has been given that the prisoner himself has shoAA'n signs of his own insanity. Noav when these offers were made,- no evidence of his own insanity had been given. That he had at long intervals before the Aveek of the murder suffered spasms or fits of some kind affecting him- bodily is all that had been proved, but no mental unsoundness has been sho^n. These offers were not renewed after evidence was given of an affection resembling epilepsy, and a possible epileptic insanity. Indeed the eAddence of even a possible epileptic insanity was so weak it would scarcely have been substantial error to reject the evidence a second time. It must not be forgotten that according to the evidence, or even according to common observation, epilepsy is not commonly followed by insanity, until after a long time from the first attack, and that the proof of epilepsy furnishes no immediate presumption of insanity. There was no error in the rejection of these offers when made.</p>

The case was not one wholly of circumstantial evidence. <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>There was the prisoner’s admission of his act mad^ to William Schug. In answer to Schug’s question, what he meant by doing a deed of that hind, he said: “ Bill, I don’t know why I done it; I had no cause to do it, and I am sorry it is the way it is; but it is too late.” The circumstances themselves were very strong. The purchase of the poison, its quantity, the quantity found in the coffee-pot, and the facts attending the poisoning, were very direct.</p>

    <p id="b210-7" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[282,995,1175,1382]]]'>The 28th assignment presents an apparent difficulty. Standing isolated from the charge it seems to be unsound. But taken in its proper connection, and according to the meaning of the court, the latter branch of the sentence which contains the alleged error is not justly chargeable with error. The court had said, the only remaining question is upon the insanity of the prisoner, that he is presumed to be sane, and the burden is on him to ¿.prove to your satisfaction that he is insane. Then the objected sentence follows: “ You cannot hwever infer insanity from the heinous and atrocious character of the crime, or to constitute it as an element in the proof of actual insanity.” The court did not mean to say that when proof of insanity is given the horrid and unnatural character of the crime will lend no -weight to the proof; but meant only that the terrible nature of the crime will not stand as the proof itself, or an element in the proof of the fact of insanity. There is a manifest difference between that Avhich is actual evidence of a fact and that which merely lends weight to the evidence Avhich constitutes the proof. This is all the court meant. That part of the charge con-tained in the 30th assignment is not objectionable when read with its context and properly understood. The court did not say that the jury <em>must </em>find insanity on the day of the purchase of the pqison in order to acquit. On the contrary, the jury ivero instructed in several parts of the charge that the insanity must have existed at the time of the commission of the offence. The paragraph containing the sentence objected to Avas employed in presenting the matters of fact relied upon by both sides as evidence upon the question of epileptic insanity preAnous to the time of the poisoning. The fact of sanity or insanity on the day of the purchase of the poison had a very direct bearing on the fact of insanity when the poison Avas administered. Hence the court properly submitted the fact of sanity or insanity on both days, as bearing directly upon the issue, but not as both necessary to an acquittal.</p>

It seems to us, however, that no right of trial by jury is involved in the question. A jury having found a verdict against the plea of insanity when set up as a defence to conviction, subsequent insanity cannot be set up in disproof of the conviction. The plea at this stage is only an appeal to the humanity of the court to postpone the punishment until a recovery takes place, or as a merciful dispensation.</p>
