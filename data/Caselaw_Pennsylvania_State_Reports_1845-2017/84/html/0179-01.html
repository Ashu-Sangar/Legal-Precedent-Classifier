L. 617, provision was made for a system of common school education in all the counties of the state, and every township, borough and city then existing or thereafter to be constituted were to become a school district subject to the act. By the same act all former acts inconsistent therewith were repealed. Thereby all independent districts were abolished, and townships, boroughs and cities were made the districts, and courts chartering boroughs were denied the discretion of permitting them to remain connected with the old district. By the Act of 8th May 1855, Pamph. L. 509, a supplement to the Act of 1854, the Quarter Sessions were authorized upon petition to decree separate and independent school districts, and provision was also made therein for the division of' school property, “ whenever a new district shall be erected according to the provisions of this act.”</p>

Not the independent districts, for the Act of 1855 provided for them. No new districts are authorized by the Act of 1862, and it is evident the new districts intended by the Act of 1862 are those created by the erection of boroughs, townships and cities which, by the Act of 1854, are made <em>new </em>districts whenever created, and the Act of 1862 therefore was to supply deficiencies in former laws. The legislative definition of <em>new </em>districts in the first section of Act <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>of 17th April 1865, Pamph. L. 62, confirms this view. It provides that “ the clerks of the Courts of Quarter Sessions of the several counties of this Commonwealth shall forward to the superintendent of common schools a certified copy, under seal, of the decree of said court, of their respective counties creating any <em>new </em>school district, whether it be formed by the incorporation of a borough, the creation of a new township, or the formation of an independent district.”</p>

It was not established by any decree of court, upon any petition for that purpose, by any persons residing within its limits. It became a school district by operation of law upon the creation of the borough of Jenkintown, and does not fall within that class of new school districts which must account to other districts for the value of the school real estate which happens to fall within their limits.</p>
    <p id="b181-7" data-blocks='[["BL_181.9",181,[109,1144,1173,652]]]'>Formerly there was no such accountability in any case, and when it was afterwards created it was only applied to such new districts as were directly established by the courts upon the petition of their inhabitants, and never where, as here, the school district was imposed upon the inhabitants without their asking. Appellant in his argument admits that prior to 1862, the school law provided for the apportionment of this description of property only, in the case of independent school districts erected by the court upon the petition of twenty taxables; and that no such provision existed for cases where, as here, the school districts resulted simply from the formation of a new borough or township. But he insists that the Act of 1862 has changed the law in this respect, and for this he quotes from the 11th section of that act. But an analysis of the section will show that the word “new” was not intended to be applied to <em>every </em>new district, without regard to the manner of its creation.</p>
    <p id="b181-8" data-blocks='[["BL_181.10",181,[106,1797,1177,561]]]'>But the most pregnant argument is contained in the discrimination of the section as between the old and the new district. It will be observed that it makes no provision for any compensation by the old district to the new for any undue proportion of the real estate falling within the bounds of the former. If by operation of law the division ensues, the accountability and apportionment should be reciprocal, or not at all. But if the separation is made upon the petition of the inhabitants of the new district, it is not unfair that the new district, created by its own action, should make the compensation provided for to the old district, which had no part in the act. And for the same reason it might be deemed unjust that the old district, having had no hand in the proceeding, should be' forced to make compensation to the new one in such a case.</p>

To this end, it has been found necessary to provide, among other things, for the alteration and division of school districts, and the creation of new ones, corresponding with rhe municipal subdivisions- of counties, or sometimes independent of them, as the public convenience seems to require; and, in so doing, to provide for an equitable division of funds on hand, or compensation for school property acquired by the expenditure of the common funds. In giving construction to any part of the law, therefore, regard should be had to the entire system, and such parts as are remedial in their object should receive a liberal construction in order that the just and beneficent objects, intended by their enactment, may be promoted.</p>

Independent districts were already provided for, and as the incorporation of every new borough by the court, <em>ipso facto </em>created a new school district, provision for the equitable adjustment of claims against them was needed. Moreover, the language employed, viz., “ where a new school district is formed,” &amp;c., applies fully as well to new districts established by the incorporation of boroughs and erection of townships, as it does to independent districts created by the court, according to the provisions of the Act of 1855. There is nothing in the language by which its operation can fairly be restricted to districts of the latter class.
