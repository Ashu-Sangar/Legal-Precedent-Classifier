Wilson and Frederick Turner, enjoining them from proceeding further in an action at law brought in the Circuit Court of Jefferson county in said state by Lowry against one George Dull, who was jointly sued with Wilson and Turner. The injunction, it appeared, was to prevent the defendants from u'sing a certain claim they had against Lowry, as a set-off. From the 18th of June 1850, until April 17th 1857, there seemed to have been no further proceedings when Turner and Wilson filed their answer in the nature of a cross-bill denying the matters contained in the complainant’s bill, and making a claim against Lowry for a sum due them and prayiqg for a decree against him.

S. Bodley, Esq., is elected special chancellor. This is the only recital in the record which shows the plaintiff, W. H. Lowry, either appeals to the cross-bill or knew that it had been filed, until after the submission to the special chancellor and the so-called hearing was had. Had the present defendant, W. H. Lowry, notice of the filing of the cross-bill or did he appear by himself or counsel to answer it ? If he did, he is concluded by the adjudication and your verdict must be for the plaintiff. If he had no notice, and did not appear by himself or counsel, the subsequent proceedings were to all intents and purposes ex parte, and the alleged decree or judgment entered therein can have no effect upon the party against whom it was rendered, outside of the jurisdiction of the court making such decree. That the plaintiff was entitled to notice of the filing of the cross-bill, before any valid proceedings could be had under it, is'shown by the'nature of the cross-bill and the decree it prayed for, being matter and subjects not contained in the original bill and foreign to its purpose, as well as by the fact that the court issued process for the plaintiff, which, however, was never served. Upon the question whether there was an appear'ance for William H. Lowry, you have no evidence besides the records, except the testimony of Hon. J. E. Bullitt, who was the only attorney Lowry had in Kentucky at the time. If you find from this testimony that Lowry did not appear to the cross-bill, either in person or by counsel, until after the submission and hearing, the decree can have no extra-territorial effect, and your verdict should be for the defendant. The subsequent appearance of Mr. Bullitt, in his efforts to have the decree vacated and to have a hearing upon the merits, can not have the effect of giving the court jurisdiction in making the decree.”</p>

What those laws authorized was a matter to be decided by that tribunal, and their decision was open to appeal to their highest court, and could be there reviewed, but not re-examined collaterally in any other court, nor in the courts of any other state in which an action might be brought upon the record. Eor if it could not be examined collaterally in the courts of the state in which it is rendered, neither could it be so examined in the courts of any other state. The constitution of the United States declares that “full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other state,” and the Act of Congress of May 26th 1790 has enacted that “the said records and judicial proceedings shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state from whence the said records are or shall be taken.”</p>

So, also, the practice of the court in the proceeding upon that bill. Having jurisdiction of the person of Lowry, we cannot inquire whether the proceedings were regular, whether he or his attorney had notice of the cross-bill, whether the selection of the special chancellor was proper, or whether he or his attorney had notice of the hearing. We are bound to presume that everything was rightly done according to the common maxim. To illustrate this by a simple and familiar case. If a party is sued in a common-law court in Pennsylvania, is duly served with process and appears, and judgment is thereupon entered against him for want of a plea without a declaration; rule to plead and service of such rule, such judgment is irregular and would be set aside or reversed on writ of error. But surely in an action on that judgment in another state it cannot be reviewed and set aside as no judgment. It may very well be that according to settled principles of equity pleading and practice, a cross-bill cannot be an original bill, but must be for some matter growing out of the subject of the principal suit. But that presented a question to be decided by the court in which it was filed. It is enough that Lowry being in court is presumed to have had notice or was bound to take notice. The questions presented on this record were all considered and decided by this court in Lowry <em>v. </em>Guthrie, Western District 1875; opinion filed November 1st 1875.
