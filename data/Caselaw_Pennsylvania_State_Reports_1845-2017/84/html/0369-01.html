    <p id="b372-8" data-blocks='[["BL_372.9",372,[248,996,1168,688]]]'>Suit was originally brought against the three makers, on their joint note, payable to the order of the plaintiff. The summons was served on William Nell, the principal in the note, and judgment was entered against him by default for the full amount of the plaintiff’s claim. The two sureties were not served. The judgment against William was conclusive as to him, and while it remained unreversed he was not in a position to controvert his liability either as against the plaintiff or the sureties, in case they had discharged the debt and had been subrogated to the rights of the plaintiff. The plaintiff having failed to obtain satisfaction of his judgment against the principal, proceeded against the other two by an <em>alias </em>summons to August Term 1873, and a <em>plumes </em>to January Term 1874, which rvas served on the 26th December 1873. The defendants appeared and made defence that the note had been altered after its execution and without their knoAvledge or consent, by adding the Avords “with interest from date.”</p>
    <p id="b372-9" data-blocks='[["BL_372.10",372,[248,1684,1164,591]]]'>The proceeding by alias and pluries summons was irregular. The Act of 1830 does not contemplate a continuance of the original suit against those on whom the original process has not been served. It provides that the judgment against those served “shall not be a bar to a recovery, <em>in another suit, </em>against the defendant or defendants not served with process.” The proceeding against Jacob and Henry is in the nature of an original suit by summons, instead of an alias summons. As was said by Mr. Justice Bell, in Wann <em>v. </em>Pattengale, 2 Harris 313, “ Suits brought under the Act of 1830 cannot be esteemed in the nature of secondary process under continuances of the original suit, for the reason that the statute contemplates a judgment in the first action before a second can be commenced.” The irregularity, however, is but slight and formal, and may be amended.</p>

If this were so, he was entitled to recover at least the amount of the note as originally drawn.</p>
