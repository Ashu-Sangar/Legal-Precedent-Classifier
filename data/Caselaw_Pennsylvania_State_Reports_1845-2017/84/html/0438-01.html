That section provides .that no such acceptance of the act shall be construed to be a <em>repeal </em>or <em>surrender </em>of any rights, powers, privileges and franchises, heretofore by law conferred on such city, <em>not inconsistent </em>with the provisions of this act.</p>

The other requires all the real estate of the Seventh Ward to be assessed and returned for taxation, with a certificate designating such lands as are used exclusively as farms, which shall be taxed at a rate equal to one-third of the highest rate of taxes to be assessed for city purposes for the current year. This is simply a mode or means of fixing a valuation on the farm land, for the purposes of taxation for city purposes, so as to cause the burden to bear an equitable and fair relation to the advantages derived from the city government. Such is the purpose of the Act of 1872, as declared in the preamble.</p>
