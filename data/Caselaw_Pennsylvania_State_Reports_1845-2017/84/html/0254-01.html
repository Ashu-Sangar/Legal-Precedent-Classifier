Why, then, he having been so permitted to testify on the trial, should the lips of the defendant, Avho Avas so unfortunate as to be alive and present at the trial, be closed, and he not permitted to speak in answer to the testimony of the original party to the cause against him. Justice and equity certainly do not require it. It is not to be presumed that the plaintiff, whose testimony was admitted on the trial, Avas less interested when he testified as to the contracts, conversations and transactions between him and George K. Reed, the defendant, out of which his cause of action originated, than the defendant was Avhen we permitted him to testify. Therefore the policy of the law-on the ground of interest does not require <em>it </em>— actus <em>legis nemini facit injuriam. </em>As w-e have seen ‘ the tendency of both judicial and legislative action 'is against the exclusion of evidence on the ground of interest;’ and the Act of 15th April 1869, is an enlarging and enabling act.

But this witness is dead. What to him (so far as the purposes of this trial are concerned) was death but absence — absence caused by the act of God ? And shall the manner of his taking off, or the reason of his absence, work to the great injustice and injury of the defendant by preventing him from testifying in answer to the deposition of the absent witness ?

    <p id="b257-8" data-blocks='[["BL_257.9",257,[159,1124,1157,642]]]'>This record presents a single question. That is, whether the defendant was competent to testify to matters which transpired during the life of the original plaintiff. That he was incompetent is clearly ruled by Pratt <em>v. </em>Patterson, 31 P. F. Smith 114. That case is very similar to the present one. There, in a former suit, in the lifetime of both parties, each party had testified, and the testimony had been reduced to writing. The verdict was set aside and the suit discontinued. A second suit between the same parties was brought for the same subject-matter. Before the trial the defendant died, and his executors were substituted. On the trial at Nisi Prius, before our late brother Williams, the plaintiff was offered as a witness to testify in regard to matters which occurred in the lifetime of the defendant. The witness was rejected. On the case being certified to this court for review, we affirmed that ruling.</p>

Each party stands on an equal footing. The deposition of each party may be taken, subject to cross-examination by the opposite party.

It by no means follows that because the testimony of the deceased party, duly taken in his lifetime, was given in evidence on the trial, therefore the surviving party is madé competent to go on the stand to testify in his own behalf. When the testimony of the party since deceased, was taken, he was a competent witness. He was subject to cross-examination by the opposite party. The lips of the survivor were not then dosed. He could then have offered himself as a witness to explain <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>or contradict the testimony of the opposite party. If he did so he thereby perpetuated his own testimony, and it is now available. If he then failed to perpetuate it, there is no equality in now permitting him, after the death of his adversary, to go on the stand to testify to anything which transpired during the life of the opposite party. The lips now closed in death cannot prompt any cross-examination, nor explain or contradict the testimony thus given.</p>
