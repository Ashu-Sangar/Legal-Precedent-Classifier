    <p class="summary" id="b388-14" data-blocks='[["BL_388.18",388,[282,1518,1163,816]]]'>James Hamilton was a prominent communicant and member of the board of trustees of the Second Presbyterian Church of Carlisle, for forty years. He was one of its founders, and always took a deep interest in it. In the summer of 1870 the congregation of that church resolved to erect a new house of worship. It was completed in the early part of 1872, at an aggregate cost of about $45,000. To meet this expense three subscriptions were made by members of the congregation: one in 1870, one in 1871, and the other in 1872. In the first Mr. Hamilton gave $2000. On November 20th 1871, Mr. Hamilton made a will, in which he directed his executors to sell certain real estate in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and to invest the proceeds of such sale in government bonds, or real estate security, and when the principal and interest amounted to a sum sufficient to pay off the indebtedness of the Second Presbyterian Church, with any other benefactions or contributions of others for the new church and lecture-room, to pay over the same to the trustees of said church. At that time the liabilities incurred by the church were about $24,000, and the real estate so devised was worth $7000.</p>

Mr. Hamilton died on January 23d 1873. By the codicil to the last will it was made conditional upon his living until March 1st 1873. Having died before that time the courts decided that the will of 20th November 1871, was the operative disposition of his property in order to effectuate his intentions to preserve his charitable legacies. Both these testamentary papers, with <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>the codicil, were proved and recorded in the register’s office of Cumberland county. The devises therein referred to above are made part of this case, as if fully set forth. The said real estate has been sold for $7000. This sum, with the amount of the third subscription, including the one of Mr. Hamilton for $1000, is required to pay off the indebtedness of the church. The other subscribers have treated the requisite amount as raised by this legacy from Mr. Hamilton and have paid or agreed to pay their several subscriptions. The question for the court is, Are Mr. Hamilton’s executors under these circumstances liable to pay the said sum of $1000 to the church, in addition to the proceeds of the real estate directed to be sold ?</p>

The debt of the church at that time was about $14,000. Mr. Hamilton verbally subscribed $1000 on condition that “ the whole amount be raised.” It never was raised. On January 10th 1873 $7000 of the $14,000 had been subscribed. This included Mr. Hamilton’s subscription. On that day he was asked to pay this $1000. He said he would do so “ if several other gentlemen would pay theirs.” One only of them paid. Thus the matter stood at the time of Mr. Hamilton’s death. His executors <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>are now called upon by the cburcb to pay this subscription. The court below gave judgment against them upon the case stated. This was error. The subscription was not binding upon Mr. Hamilton during his lifetime; as we have before said it was conditional; the subsequent promise to pay was conditional; the condition had never been performed. It was <em>nudum pactum </em>and imposed no liability upon Mr. Hamilton’s personal representatives after his death. It may be that he would have paid this $1000 had he lived. We .are not to interpret this subscription by what he might have done had his life been spared; nor by what the members of the church may think he intended to do. We must look only at what he contracted to do. We find no binding contract to pay. We are dealing with the subscription of a dead man; one too who appears to have been very generous to this church in his lifetime, and gave it a munificent donation by his will. But the law in distributing his estate knows nothing of generosity. It merely protects and enforces the legal rights of parties. It is our duty to see that no injustice is done to Mr. Hamilton’s estate. It was strongly urged upon the argument that the devise in Mr. Hamilton’s will in favor of the church fulfilled the condition of the subscription and made his estate liable. We are unable to see the force of this suggestion. The subscription -was to be good when the whole amount of the debt should be raised. Raised by whom ? Not certainly by himself. He was willing to contribute $1000 if other parties would contribute the residue of the debt. This is what the subscription meant. We need not enlarge upon this point. It is too plain.</p>
    <p id="b391-6" data-blocks='[["BL_391.6",391,[342,1617,990,129]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and judgment is ordered to be entered in favor of the defendants upon the case stated, with costs.</p>
