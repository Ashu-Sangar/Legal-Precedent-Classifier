It ayos alleged that it was the intention to bring the action for this land, and the misdescription was a mistake of the attorney Avho dreAv the praecipe.</p>

The land covered by said Avrifc lies Avholly Avest of a tract of land for Avhich a patent Avas issued from the CommonAvealth of Pennsylvania to Edmund LockAvood, on the 9th day of May 1870, in pursuance of a survey made October 16th 1839, on Avarrant dated October 5th 1839. That upon the 21st December 1866, said deponent purchased by contract of said Edmund LoekAA'ood, part of the tract of land covered by said survey and warrant, containing about seventy-two acres.</p>

The suit as brought and the writ covers no point of said deponent’s land, nor of any lands of which he ever had any possession nor to which he laid any title or claim. To permit the amendment asked for to be made will be a relinquishment of all the land now covered by the writ,- and extended to other lands, no part of which is now covered by the writ, and will cover lands of said deponent which he holds and claims to own both by possession and by legal title. Therefore, as said amendment would do great injustice to your deponent, and might defeat his title by possession, he earnestly protests against its allowance.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b72-7" data-blocks='[["BL_72.5",72,[273,1044,1171,952]]]'>“ It seems to the court that this amendment would introduce a new cause of action. The description as filed runs round an entirely different lot. If the description indicated the lot, but was defective in some particulars, doubtless an amendment correcting the mistakes would be allowed. But it is proposed to change the description from one lot to another, and an entirely different lot. A suit is brought in 1861, for one form, and in 1872, it is proposed to change the action so as to embrace another form. I think this is going too far, especially when such amendment might destroy a title acquired under the Statute of Limitations. In Wright <em>v. </em>Hart’s Adm’r, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20455" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Wright 455">8 Wright 455</a>, it is said c the plaintiff below could not amend his declaration so as to introduce a new cause of action; and this is very especially true, where the new cause is so old as to be barred by the Statute of Limitations.’ In this case, the plaintiff counted upon a promissory note, and many years afterwards was permitted to amend by declaring upon another rule, which, at the time of the amendment, was barred by the statute.' I am not able to distinguish the two cases upon principle; and the amendment must, therefore, be refused, so far as it relates to the description. There can be no objection to the plaintiffs substituting the parties in interest. The first branch of the rule is made absolute, and the latter branch is discharged.”</p>

    <p id="b73-8" data-blocks='[["BL_73.11",73,[152,960,1170,173]]]'>The court should have allowed the amendment asked for by the plaintiffs. The misdescription, no doubt, resulted from a mistake in commencing at the north-east corner of the Lane and Travers tract, instead of the north-east corner of the tract in controversy.</p>
    <p id="b73-9" data-blocks='[["BL_73.12",73,[148,1133,1174,904]]]'>Even before the passage of the Acts of 1871 and 1872, a defect of this kind might have been cured by filing a new description: Sample <em>v. </em>Robb, 4 Harris 305. Since the date of those acts, amendments may be permitted in all cases, and at any stage of the proceedings. But as the amendment will necessarily substitute a tract of land entirely different from that described in the writ, it cannot be permitted to relate back to the commencement of the action, and thus affect the rights the defendants might otherwise have under the Statute of Limitations. The mistake, if mistake it was, arose from no fraud or default of the defendants, hence their rights must remain just as they are found at the time of the amendment, or as though the writ had issued at that date, or more correctly, at the date when the amendment was applied for. As Avas said by our brother Mercur, in the case of Kille <em>v. </em>Ege, 1 Norris 102: <em>“ </em>Amendments, depriving the opposite party of any valuable right, shall not be allowed. Hence Avhen the name of a person was added as plaintiff in ejectment after suit brought, it Avas held, that if at the time of the amendment, the title of the neAV party was barred by the Statute of Limitations, he could not recover;” citing Trego <em>v. </em>Lewis, 8 P.
