Yanderbelt, deceased, wherein Barbara J. Vanderbelt, his widow, and others were plaintiffs, and Thomas Myers and wife and others defendants. The contestants were the sisters of the deceased. William R. Vanderbelt died at the age of fifty-six, on the 31st of December 1873, leaving a will dated the 9th of January 1872. He left a widow but no children. His will, which was duly probated, was written and signed in pencil. There were no subscribing witnesses. It was in all respects properly drawn.</p>

A. Borman and wife, Albert Eschenbach and D. S. Andrus, in a music store in Williamsport.' Andrus had been reading a Sunday School paper in which he had found the form of a will. A conversation occurred about the propriety of every person making a will, and acting upon a suggestion made, wills were prepared, by the several persons present, after the form found in the paper. The <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>wills of the others were written in ink and had subscribing witnesses and all were written upon sheets of note paper. That of Mr. Vanderbelt was written in pencil, part by Mr. Andrus and the rest by Mr. Vanderbelt, and there were also a number of interlineations in pencil. Mr. Vanderbelt did not sign the instrument at the time, but subsequently signed it in pencil also and his signature was proven. Upon his return to his house on the day the will was made, he related to his wife what had taken place at the store and gave her the will to read, expressing the hope that she was satisfied. When he was taken sick he informed his wife that his will was in his coat pocket and desired her to have the coat carefully laid away. This was done and after his death the will was found in the side pocket of his coat where he was accustomed to carry his valuable papers.</p>

Wills transmit personal and real property. They are links in the chain of title to real estate; their provisions are important, not only to the objects of a testator’s bounty, but to society at large. Whatever tends to weaken them — whatever opens the door to alterations or to erasures, or renders them susceptible of fraudulent change, should be carefully guarded against.</p>

      <em>Writing </em>is not confined to the ordinary and popular signification of the term— the formation of letters by <em>pen </em>and <em>ink. </em>The mode or manner of impressing the letters is no part of the substanoe or definition of writing: Kent, Ch., <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Johns.%20491" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Johns. 491">14 Johns. 491</a>. The law has gone so far as to prescribe the material <em>upon which </em>the writing is to be made, and hence a deed is required to be written on <em>paper </em>or parchment, and not on wood or stone. But the instrument, or the material <em>by which </em>letters are to be impressed on paper or parchment, has never yet been defined. “ Writing with a <em>lead pencil </em>has been held sufficient in many cases2 Burrill’s Law Diet. 630. And to the same effect are the remarks of Chancellor Kent in Clason <em>v. </em>Bailey, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Johns.%20490" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 Johns. 490">14 Johns. 490</a>.

In Chit, on Oont. 91, it is said that “ it seems that, even where writing is necessary, it may be made in pencil, and that ink is not essential.” Byles on Bills 134, is to the same effect. In 1 Redf. on Wills 165-6, the author says : “ The English Statute of Frauds expressly required that a will of lands should be in writing.

In Blackstone’s Com., Book.II., p. 297, it is said “a deed must be written or I presume printed, for it may be in any character or any language; but it must be upon paper or parchment. For if it be written on stone, board, linen, leather or the like, it is no deed.” This writer does not prescribe whether the writing shall be in ink or in pencil. He stops with declaring the substances on which it shall be made.</p>
    <p id="b513-11" data-blocks='[["BL_513.14",513,[158,1426,1165,429]]]'>Writing is the expression of ideas by visible letters. It may be on paper, wood, stone or other material. The ten commandments were written with the finger of God on tables of stone : Exod. xxxi. 18. The general rule undoubtedly is, that whenever a statute or usage requires a writing, it must be made on paper or parchment; but it is not essentially necessary that it be in ink. It may be in pencil. This view is sustained by numerous authorities, as applied to contracts generally: Chitty on Cont. 91; Jeffery <em>v. </em>Walton, 2 E. C. L.

F. Smith 459, but the opinion by Mr. Justice Williams contains a strong declaration against the propriety of writing or signing in that manner. The reason given against it, is the facility with which the writing may be altered or effaced. There is force in this suggestion. No prudent scrivener will write a will in pencil, unless under extreme circumstances. Whenever written, any appearance of alteration should be carefully scrutinized. Yet inasmuch as the statute is silent on the question, we cannot say the mere fact that it is written or signed in pencil, thereby makes it invalid. It is nevertheless a writing, known and acknowledged as such by the authorities, and fulfils the requirement of the statute.</p>
