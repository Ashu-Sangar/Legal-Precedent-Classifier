He states that then they left this side room and he treated the party, including Coleman, and there spent the twenty-five cents which had been given him by Carroll, and returned to Carroll’s and found McGehan, Duffy and Boyle on the stoop, and he asked them what they wanted, and Duffy said, ‘ I’m going to have him, Yost, to-night.’ The witness then says that he remonstrated against the killing of Yost, as he had had a difficulty with McCarron before, and he might be blamed for the murder. He then says that either McGehan or Boyle, and he cannot recollect which, spoke up and declared that he had come there three times to do this job and they were not going back till they did it. He states that he saw McGehan in possession of Rbárity’s pistol; he states that there was a wrangle about the pistol, and that McGehan said he was all right, that he had Roarity’s pistol, and he pulled it out, and the witness knew the pistol; that then Carroll went into the bar-room, went behind the counter, opened a drawer, took from it a little single-barrelled pistol, a breech-loading one-shooter, and he there saw Carroll put in the bullet and hand the pistol to Boyle, saying, at the same time, that it was a poor thing for such a job, and that Boyle put it in his pocket.</p>

Kerrigan does locate Roarity there at this time, and the other .testimony in the case is that Roarity’s wife was sick that afternoon. To contradict this testimony, Mrs. Catharine O’Donnell was called by the defence. She is the mother of Mrs. Carroll, and she testified that she was at Carroll’s from 6 o’clock to 12 o’clock on the night of the 5th of July 1875 ; that she was in the kitchen there all the time and that these parties were not there, as testified by Kerrigan. She states that she saw Edward Herron there, and he testifies that he was there during part of this time, and went into the kitchen for a drink of water; and that he saw none of these parties there. There is corroboration of this statement in the tes<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>timony of Patrick Nolan, and there is a similarity of statement between Nolan and Kerrigan in every particular, except one. Nolan testified that Kerrigan came to his house, rapped at the dóor, and that the door was opened by his wife, and Kerrigan came into the bar-room, where there was no person but himself, Nolan, and his wife and Patrick Coleman; that Kerrigan tapped him on the shoulder and took him into another room, and there asked him for the loan of a revolver to protect a man going to Summit Hill or Mauch Chunk, one of the two places; that he told Kerrigan he had none, and that Kerrigan then proposed to treat, and produced the twenty-five cents, and that he, Kerrigan, and Nolan drank. Nolan alleges that he did not receive any money from Kerrigan, but that Kerrigan threw the money on the counter and he pushed it back to him. Whether Nolan took the money or not is the only discrepancy between his statement and Kerrigan’s as to that part of the testimony. Kerrigan alleges that he spent the money there and Nolan alleges that he declined to receive it. This, as far as we now recollect, is the corroboration of Kerrigan and the contradiction of his testimony in relation to this conversation. This evidence is important as showing the connection of Carroll at least with this transaction in the preparation they had made for the killing of Yost, and showing, if you believe it, that he tried to procure a pistol, and failing to do so, furnished Boyle with the one-shooter, which he said was not sufficient for the purpose.</p>

      <em>“12. </em>Kerrigan testifies to other" points, in which he is corroborated by other witnesses. He testifies that Barney McCarron fired two shots after the men as they ran in the direction of the cemetery, and that McGehan fired a shot in return. This is corroborated by the testimony of Barney McCarron, and by the testimony of Yost, and other witnesses. One witness stated that four shots were fired, and others stated that they heard more than two. The testimony of Kerrigan, Yost and McCarron, shows that there were about five shots fired at that time. Kerrigan then testifies to a conversation that he had with McGehan immediately after this shooting took place. He states that he said to McGehan, ‘ I know that you shot Yost, and he was not such a bad fellow. Barney McCarron is ten times worse.’ McGehan said, ‘ I don’t ask better sport than to put such men out of the way, but I don’t like to draw an Irishman’s blood.’ McGehan said he did not know whether Yost would die or not, but he knew that he shot him. The witness in giving his testimony then comes down to the 1st of September 1875, in which he alleges a conversation with McGehan, in which Mc-Gehan said they got home all right, and said he had told Doyle and Kelley that the road they took would be a good road for them to take when they shot Jones; that they did not meet anybody but Robert Breslin, and he was a dirty fellow, who had tried to get the men to work for the company, and he was afraid that Bob would squeal on them.

Mc-Gehan said they told Breslin they had not time. Then Breslin asked them where they had been and what they were doing there at that time in the morning, and McGehan said he and Boyle had been to a ball at Mauch Chunk, and had got lost, and did not know where they were till they got there.</p>

To confirm the testimony of the accomplice in all points, and also to trace the possession and establish the identity of the Roarity pistol, the CommonAvealth proved, under the offers excepted to, and now assigned for error, that Kerrigan was met upon his return from Summit Hill on the night of the 15th of July, by Churchill and McLaughlin ; that on the 27th of July, Kerrigan exhibited the Roarity pistol to McParlan and McNellis, and sént it by the latter to Roarity the same day; that on the 1st of September, Kerrigan and the parties named were at McGrehan’s saloon; that the counter in the saloon was examined, and a piece cut therefrom, and offered in evidence, Avhich showed the mark of the bullet, and the pistol offered in evidence, showing that the ball therefrom would have occasioned the indentation therein; that the pistol, with the Roarity pistol, Avas found on the 4th of September, in the place Avhere Kerrigan stated they had been placed; that Roarity confessed to McParlan, that he had lost his pistol by reason <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>of its being found in the bushes at Tam aqua; that Robert Breslin had met MoGehan and Boyle on a by-path from the road to Tamaqua.</p>
    <p id="b122-6" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[264,515,1167,301]]]'>Surely, if corroboration is required of the statements of an accomplice, no rule has ever been established or declared, that the corroboration may not extend to every part of his testimony, as to the acts and declarations of the defendants. And if a confession or statement is to be introduced in evidence, one very necessary element would seem to be, that parties who reside miles apart should be in such position as to render the making of that confession possible.</p>
    <p id="b122-7" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[264,816,1166,345]]]'>The ninth assignment of error relates to the admission of the evidence of Mrs. Breslin, who testified to the time her son, Robert Breslin, had returned home on the morning of the 6th of July. The witness, Robert Breslin, had testified to his return home that morning, and to meeting near his home McGehan and Boyle on a bypath leading from the Tamaqua and Mauch Chunk road. The Commonwealth simply fixed by the witness, Mrs. Breslin, the fact of the return of Robert Breslin that morning to his home and the time.</p>

If this were so there might be an endless series of corroborations. The main error in our estimation arose under the second and third assignments. Until it had shown the conspiracy the Commonwealth had not the right to make the offer it did. Before testimony of the character given was allowed, good legal reasons therefor should have been shown. Its introduction was equivalent to the death warrant of these prisoners. The connection of the prisoners with the order of “Molly Maguires” had not been shown. Certain facts were testified to by Kerrigan, and the Commonwealth proceeded to make the offer in regard to the order. The testimony of Kerrigan shows that the enterprise was an individual one and not inspired or arranged in the order of “ Molly Maguires,” and after the Commonwealth had failed to sustain their offer with his evidence we asked the court to withdraw the evidence, which was refused. It was an attempt to show a general wicked practice and without any connection with this particular case. It will be observed also that the conversation in regard to the trade of the death of Yost for that of Jones was after the murder of Yost and was not therefore the consideration for the murder of Yost. If there was any consideration it was between the parties as individuals and not in pursuance of any arrangement of the order of “ Molly Maguires, ” and we contend therefore that it was dangerous and incompetent testimony to prove the practices of an infamous organization and let it go to the jury to show that these prisoners belonged to it.</p>

      <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>The county of Schuylkill constitutes a separate judicial district, having five judges, of whom three are learned in the law, and two are associates. One of the judges learned in the law and an associate were engaged in the trial of Thomas Munley for homicide from the 27th of June until July 12th 1876. The case of these prisoners, James Carroll, James Boyle, Hugh McGehan and James Roarity, was called for trial July 6th 1876, before President Judge Pershing and Judge Walker, an associate learned in the law. In consequence of motions for a change of venue and to quash the array of jurors, the jury for this trial taken from the panel for the second week was not completed until Saturday July 8th, the last day of the term. The jury being sworn could not be discharged, and consequently the trial was laid over until the next week. Circumstances in relation to the business of the court existed, in consequence of which the actual hearing began on the 13th of July, and the trial lasted then until the 22d. It is objected that there was no power thus to continue the case from day to day after the expiration of the term. The objection is groundless. At one time this argument might have had some force, but the strictness of the common law has been beneficially removed by legislation. The two Acts of the 18th of March 1875, Pamph. L. 25, 28, the Act of 7th April 1876, Pamph. L. 19, and the decision in Briceland <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 24 P. F. Smith 463, remove all doubt of the legality of the proceedings in the court below. Under these laws it is competent, in such a district as that of Schuylkill, to hold two courts of Oyer and Terminer at the same time; to issue separate venires, and to make all necessary and convenient orders for the despatch of business. The jurisdiction was therefore complete. According to Briceland <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, a trial begun on the last day of the term may be continued afterwards. A jury sworn cannot be discharged without prejudice to the interests of justice, and offenders must often escape if the mere modes and forms of procedure are to be held so strictly. The continuance of the case by adjournments from day to day, from Monday until Thursday, when the trial proper began, was .a matter necessarily within the sound discretion of the court. The Court of Oyer and Terminer must know the state of its own business better than we, and what is proper in order to administer justice to all persons before the court. We cannot say that its discretion was abused. It does not appear to us that its authority was illegally exercised.</p>
    <p id="b123-6" data-blocks='[["BL_123.6",123,[157,2160,1164,341]],["BL_124.1",124,[238,435,1182,1471]]]'>We come to the exceptions taken in the trial. On the morning of the 6th of July 1875, about two o’clock, Benjamin F. Yost was shot by two men, while he was in the act of extinguishing a lamp, in the borough of Tamaqua, Schuylkill county. Hugh McGehan and James Boyle, the men shown to have shot him, resided at Summit Hill, about eight miles distant, and were strangers to him. No motive, such as ordinarily influence men to commit so great a crime, was shown to exist on their part. They were neither insane <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>nor intoxicated, so that it might be inferred that the murder was without an ordinary motive, or done by persons unconscious of the wickedness of the act. Without a moving cause, the killing was so unreasonable and so contrary to human observation upon the commission of great crimes, the case would have been barren of those elements which lead the mind to a conviction of the guilt of persons who were not recognised at the time of the act, and against whom the evidence would have been altogether circumstantial. Under these circumstances a jury might reasonably doubt the identity of the prisoners McGehan and Boyle, and would find nothing satisfactory to rest upon for the conviction of James Carroll and James Roarity, the prisoners indicted jointly with them, but who were not present at the commission of the homicide. That the evidence as given convicts all of the murder is beyond a reasonable doubt, yet this certainty of the proof was to be solved by facts more strange, unnatural and horrible than ever disclosed hitherto in the annals of crime in this country — facts which nothing but the clearest evidence could compel us to believe. The leading feature of this singular case is the existence of an order, or band of men, having its head in Ireland, extending into the United States and spread by ramifications throughout the coal regions of Pennsylvania, each •minor division governed by a body-master of its own locality, to A?hom the secret passwords, signs and tokens of recognition, called “ goods,” are transmitted through a descending grade of officers from the head of the order to the body-master, and by them distributed to the members. When we are informed that these men traded in blood, taking life for life by compact, burned houses, mills, breakers and valuable structures at the instance of 'each other, and banded together, by means of concealment, money and perjury, to shield each other from punishment, our incredulity is so excited Ave would fail to believe the tale from the mere mouths of two or three witnesses ; and nothing less than facts clearly and fully proved could command our belief. These the Commonwealth undertook to prove, and strange as it may seem, proved beyond the possibility of a doubt.</p>
    <p id="b124-6" data-blocks='[["BL_124.6",124,[250,1904,1174,605]],["BL_125.1",125,[157,420,1168,990]]]'>The chief witnesses by whom the organization called the “ Ancient Order of Hibernians,” but more commonly knoAvn as the “Molly Maguires,” was shown to exist, and its purposes, practices, passwords and signs, Avere James Kerrigan, a member of the order, and a party to the killing of one John P. Jones in return for the killing of Benjamin E. Yost, and James McParlan,- a detective, who procured himself to be admitted a member of the order for the purpose of obtaining its secrets and frustrating its designs. Standing alone, the testimony of Kerrigan would be Avorthless, and even McParlan’s, without confirmation, Avould be weak and perhaps unconvincing. Hence, the Commonwealth felt the necessity of sustaining the narratives of these witnesses by a long array of circumstances, beginning before the murder of Yost and running doAvn to the subsequent killing of Jones by way of return. These circumstances constituted <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>a chain of evidence, branching out for the proof of two distinct, yet completely connected matters. One, primarily, for the identification of the prisoners, McGehan and Boyle, by whom the murder of Yost was committed; the other, secondarily, for the proof of the causes and motives for the commission of the act, and the privity of Carroll and Roarity as accessories before the fact, and liable, therefore, as principals, under the 180th section of the Criminal Code of March 31st 1860, and 44th section of the Criminal Procedure Act. The chain of circumstances was, therefore, double, having a twofold relation to the case, which made the occurrences after the murder, competent evidence. The facts which proved the existence, purposes and practices of the order known as the <em>“ </em>Molly Maguires,” as the means of exhibiting the causes and motives leading to the murder of Yost, and the participation of Carroll and Roarity with McGehan and Boyle, in the execution of the deed, were not necessarily all antecedent. Some were, others were not, but by confessions and direct links were traceable to those having a prior existence. Hence the evidence of these subsequent events, while having no direct bearing on the identification of McGehan and Boyle as the actual perpetrators of the murder, had a strong and pertinent bearing upon the causes and motives operating upon them in the perpetration of the crime, and upon the connection of Carroll and Roarity with them, as participants in their guilt.</p>
    <p id="b125-6" data-blocks='[["BL_125.6",125,[154,1411,1163,728]]]'>Thus the entire body of the evidence became necessary to show the conspiracy which linked all the prisoners together, to show that they were combined in the most intimate relations, and in a common purpose, that their subsequent conduct and confessions were thereby connected and made competent against each other, and that all these combinations and purposes led directly to the commission of another murder, that of Jones, as the return price of the killing of Yost, which became linked to each other, as a part of the evidence exhibiting the nature and effect of the combination leading to the killing of Yost. The whole network of the evidence is so complicated, and so clearly united and connected together in proving the guilt of all prisoners, and their motives and the agencies employed, it is not possible to strike out the subsequent facts without destroying to a great extent the unity and relevancy of those which preceded the act. McParlan’s testimony strongly corroborates Kerrigan’s, and both are sustained and supported by other witnesses as to facts, before, at the time of, and after the murder.</p>
    <p id="b125-7" data-blocks='[["BL_125.7",125,[151,2143,1164,300]],["BL_126.1",126,[271,428,1164,475]]]'>When these two purposes of the testimony are borne in mind we see clearly that the objections to the evidence constituting the second and third errors, and fourth to the ninth inclusive, are without weight. We must look at the real competency of the evidence and not at the order of its reception; and when we find that it was all finally competent, we will not reverse, because of the time or order of its introduction. In this connection we may notice that part of <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>the offer set out in .the second assignment of error, in which it is stated that the murder of Yost was to be the price or consideration of the murder of John P. Jones. Now, though when the murder of Yost was undertaken, that of John P. Jones was not then stated or understood to be the consideration for it, yet it became an important fact in the disclosure of the purposes and practices of those who participated in the murder of Yost, and of the nature and customs of the order to which they belonged, which made the murder of Jones a return compensation for the-murder of Yost. The evidence under that offer was therefore properly retained in the case, and the court committed no error in refusing to strike it out.</p>
    <p id="b126-6" data-blocks='[["BL_126.6",126,[268,902,1163,388]]]'>The relevancy of the evidence set out in the assignments of error down to the 16th, is made manifest by what has been said. The evidence is not simply corroborative of the testimony of Kerrigan, it is to a large extent confirmatory and independent, lending strength to those parts which in themselves tend to establish the guilt of the prisoners. This case is well illustrated by ¿Esop's fable of the bundle of rods. One by one each stick may be taken away and easily broken, but the united fagot resists the strength that would destroy it.</p>
    <p id="b126-7" data-blocks='[["BL_126.7",126,[268,1289,1162,87]]]'>The evidence being properly before the jury we cannot perceive that the court committed error in charging upon it.</p>
    <p id="b126-8" data-blocks='[["BL_126.8",126,[442,1375,986,165]]]'>The sentence of the Court of Oyer and Terminer is therefore affirmed, and the record is ordered to be - remitted for execution of the sentence according to law.</p>
