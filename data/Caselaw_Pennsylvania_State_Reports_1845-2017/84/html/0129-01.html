Howell a note with confession of judgment, for a partnership debt, and signed the note with the firm name, Humphrey &amp; Ross. Judgment was entered upon the note against both Humphrey &amp; Ross, upon which an execution was issued and levied upon the partnership property of the firm. Ross came in with an affidavit denying that he executed said note, or authorized Humphrey to sign the firm name to the warrant to confess judgment, and asked to have the execution stayed as to him, and that the sheriff be enjoined from selling his interest in the partnership effects of Humphrey &amp; Ross. The court stayed the writ as to Robert Bruce Ross, but declined to enjoin the sheriff from selling the entire partnership property. Ross being dissatisfied with this ruling, asked the court to allow him a writ of <em>audita querela </em>against Howell, which the court allowed, and directed a scire facias to issue, wherein Howell was required to show cause why the execution should not be so stayed or set aside that the interest of Ross should not be sold on the same.</p>

Here the judgment should be treated as against Humphrey, not against Humphrey &amp; Ross. While it is admitted that the judgment is for a firm debt, that fact is <em>dehors </em>the record. The execution must follow the judgment and be warranted by it, and it therefore depends upon the nature and form of the judgment and not on any matter <em>dehors </em>the record: Kneib <em>v. </em>Graves, 22 P. F. Smith 105. A judgment against Humphrey cannot support a fi. fa. against Humphrey &amp; Ross. It is contended, however, that on a judgment and a fi. .fa. against one partner for a firm debt you may sell the firm property. This makes the fi. fa. follow the nature of the debt and not the character of the judgment. It is true a creditor could not object to this, but this rule cannot apply to a non-assenting partner. The cases cited by the defendant in error are those where creditors and not a non-assenting partner contested the judgment. York Bank’s Appeal, 12 Casey 459, rules this case, where the non-assenting partners asked leave to have the lien of judgments for film debts limited to the separate property of the partner who confessed the same, and the court made an order accordingly.
