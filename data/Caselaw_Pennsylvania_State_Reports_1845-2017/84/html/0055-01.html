It is without endowment fund, or other means of support than voluntary contributions and the pay received from such patients under treatment as possess the means of payment. It is located in the centre of one of the large coal fields of Pennsylvania, in a city of not less than twenty thousand inhabitants, and many of the patients are persons suffering from accidents incident to mining — persons whose skill and labor have added largely to the taxable wealth and resources of the county. The institution has been humanely, judiciously and economically managed, and through its ministrations to the sick and suffering, and to the wants of the destitute, has doubtless relieved the county and the adjoining poor districts of liabilities which they would otherwise have incurred. The hospital is not owned or controlled by any religious sect or denomination, and the land appurtenant to it is owned by the corporation in fee simple, and is free from encumbrance.</p>

L. 220, Purd. Dig. 1882, § 1, &amp;c. The 1st section provides that <em>‘ </em>it shall be lawful for the managers or trustees of any hospital for the cure of the sick and injured, which is now or may hereafter be established and duly incorporated, in any city or borough of this Commonwealth, containing a population of not less than twenty thousand inhabitants, to make requisition, quarterly, upon the commissioners of the county in which such hospital may be situated, for the support of such poor patients under treatment in such hospital, as are unable to pay for their treatment; for which requisitions the said commissioners shall grant orders upon the treasurer of the county, who shall pay the same to the treasurer of such hospital.’ The second section limits the amount to be allowed for the treatment of a patient to a sum not exceeding $1 per day, and provides that no greater sum than $5000 shall be paid out of the county treasury to any such hospital in one year.</p>

The act in question authorizes the managers of the hospital, a corporation, to make requisitions upon the commissioners of the county, ‘for which requisitions the commissioners shall grant orders upon the treasurer of the county, who shall pay the same to the managers of such hospital.’ The county is by this act authorized and directed to appropriate money for a corporation; but the constitution says the legislature shall not authorize such appropriation. The object of the constitutional provision is to prevent the money of the taxpayer from being-given to a corporation or institution; but the Act of Assembly directs its appropriation to' this prohibited object.

By that act, upon petition setting forth certain matters relative to the number of children cared for, the expenditures, condition and wants of the school, it is made the duty of the Court of Common Pleas, after full investigation, to order and direct the commissioners of the county or city in which the school is situated, to pay to the treasurer of such school, out of the county funds, such sum of money and in such instalments, as the court -shall deem just and necessary.

The latter clause of the amendment of 1857 omitted the word “appropriate.” The convention of 1873 inserted this word to give the clause a wider effect. In the case of Speer <em>v. </em>The School Directors of Blairsville, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20150" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="14 Wright 150">14 Wright 150</a>, the amendment of 1857 wás thoroughly discussed, and it was held that the words “to obtain money for, or loan its credit to any corporation, association, institution or party” did not apply to raising money on the bonds of the municipality for a public purpose, such as the payment of bounties to relieve the people of the municipality from an impending draft, by lot, into the military service. In such a case, the purpose is payment in discharge of a duty or obligation lying upon the municipality, not a loan or advance for purposes private in their nature, or made in aid of private corporations or parties. It was said there, “ There is not a word in the amendment which interdicts the borrowing of money merely, or the pledging of the public credit for municipal purposes, to be laid out by authorized public officers. The purpose was to prevent the money of the people from passing into the control of private irresponsible associations or parties, and from being squandered in undertakings of doubtful propriety, or being liable to be lost through the want of integrity of those engaged in its disburse<a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>ment. It intended to confine the municipal expenditures not only to public objects, but to public officers or agents under their direct responsibility to the municipality.” This interpretation given to the amendment of 1857 was well known to the members of the convention of 1873, for the subject of bounties was one which engaged the attention of the whole state; and the decision came home to every borough, city, township and county. The convention did nothing to weaken the force of the amendment of 1857, and on the contrary added to its strength by inserting the word “ appropriate,” and substituting the word “individual” for “party.” The words “ obtain money for or loan its credit to” applied only to the use of the liability or the credit of the municipality ; but the insertion of the word “appropriate” expanded the effect of the section, so as to embrace money in the treasury itself. A law enabling a private incorporated hospital to make requisitions upon a county, for the payment of its charges for the support of patients under treatment, even though they be paupers, is an appropriation of money by the county to the corporation and comes within the prohibition of the constitution. It is not a payment of any debt incurred by the county, but is a transfer of the money by operation of the Act of Assembly from the treasury of the county to that of the hospital. The hospital exercises no municipal function, but takes as a private institution by a mere act of appropriation. It is under no obligation to open its doors to municipal inspection or visitation, and cannot be controlled or called to an account for the moneys drawn upon requisition — once paid the money is beyond the control of the county. Thus its expenditures may be lavish, and the public funds are liable to be misdirected or squandered, without check, through extraordinary charges and unfair requisitions.</p>

The essential powers of government must not be crippled by a too stringent withholding, while it will not do to endanger the public interests by an extension of pecuniary obligations, which, owing to the hands which expend, may result in financial embarrassment and injury. The constitutional restriction is wise in its purpose and ought to be liberally construed for the protection of the people, and strongly against the inhibited institutions aud parties.</p>
