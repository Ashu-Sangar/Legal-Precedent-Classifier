After this endorsement by Harmon, the bonds were transferable only by endorsement; and there being no endorsement to Whitney, his right is incomplete as against the holder of the first two bonds, which were transferred bona fide by endorsement. Furthermore, in analogy to negotiable paper, these bonds were not passed to Whitney in the usual course of business, but as collateral security for past liabilities, and future loans of an indefinite amount.</p>

From the terms and nature of the mortgage, the time and manner of the transfer of each are not material; the only real question being whether each holder is entitled to it. The question of ownership, whether it be at law or in equity, is not material. If the holder of a bond is entitled to its proceeds, the holder of other bonds cannot set up mere informalities in the manner of its acquisition. The distribution, according to the act, must be according to equity as well as law. They are therefore entitled to come in pro rata on the mortgage fund.</p>
