The Act of February 20th 1735 was the first; the Act of April 6th 1802, Pamph. L. 178, in many respects a reenactment of the former, followed; and again, the General Road Law of June 13th 1836, Pamph. L. 556, in which there was almost an entire incorporation of the provisions of the previous acts, took its place upon the statute book. Thus far, however, the authorizing of private roads by the legislature extended only to the surface of lands ; but the Act of April 16th 1838, sect. 19, Pamph. L. 642, lengthened the reach; it authorized the construction of private roads under the surface, to connect with coal mines. This was afterwards supplemented by the Act of April 13th 1868, Pamph. L. 92, conferring authority to establish private roads to coal mines either under or over the surface of intervening lands. But it was held in Neeld’s Road, 1 Barr 352, that the Act of April 16th 1838 was crude and imperfect, and that it could only be carried into effect by adding it to our road system, and treating it as if it was a section in the General Road Law. Since then it has been thus treated uniformly.</p>

A supplement to it was enacted March 28th 1840, Pamph. L. 196, which extended the provisions of the original act to subterranean railways, and otherwise enlarged its scope in many respects. Subsequently it was further extended to the construction of canals, by the 13th section of the Act of May 5th 1841, Pamph. L. 342. Then followed the 10th section of the Act of April 24th 1843, Pamph. L. 361, relating to the use of landings by lateral railroads at the junction of railroads and canals, and to the assessment and payment of compensation; and, still later, the 3d section of the Act of January 6th 1848, extending more generally the provisions of the 10th section of the Act last referred to, followed also, both thus becoming part and parcel of our lateral railroad system.</p>

We scarcely need to cite authorities in support of the doctrine, that where there are several statutes relating to the same subject-matter, they are to be construed together as interpreting and 'enforcing each other. We have already seen that the 19th 'section of the Act of April 16th 1838, authorizing the underground construction of private roads to coal mines, was held to be a part of the general private road system, as established by the Act of June 13th 1836; so, in Keeling <em>v. </em>Griffin, 5 P. F. Smith 305, it was likewise held that the 2d section of the Act of March 28th 1840, supplementary to the general act of May 5th 1832, but extending its provisions to subterranean railways, was in <em>pari materia </em>with the original act, and should be so construed. Adopting this view of construction, the provisions of. the Act of June 13th 1874 must be construed accordingly ; and, hence, •it can make no difference whether we regard the act as a part of our private road system, or as a part of our lateral railroad system.</p>

The right of the legislature to establish private roads over the land of one man for the benefit of another, for the purpose of access to highways or places of necessary public resort, or even to private ways leading to highways, has never been seriously doubted in Pennsylvania; on the contrary, that right has been distinctly recognised and affirmed; it has, too, been exercised almost continuously ever since the settlement of the province. It is plain, therefore, that the exclusive consideration of the rights of individuals to whom legislative authority to construct private ways has been accorded, does not form the true ground on which the constitutional^ of these acts has been predicated. On the contrary, it is the coflnection of these private ways with public higlrways, or with places of necessary public resort, together with the implied right or license of the public to use them, at least in <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>going to and from the premises of the person laying them out, quite as much, if not more, as the consideration of purely individual rights, that have won for these acts judicial recognition of constitutionality.

Iron ore, bituminous coal, limestone, fire clay, and indeed all other minerals underlying these same rivers and streams, are left outside of its compass altogether. It is general, also, because the apparent reach of its provisions is everywhere within the Commonwealth, but special, nevertheless, because their actual reach is limited necessarily to the few counties where anthracite coal exists.</p>

L. 533, entitled ‘ An Act to encourage the further development of the mineral resources of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,’ the right to dig and mine for iron, coal, limestone, sand and gravel, fire clay and other minerals, was authorized to be granted; nor are these ‘ other streams,’ in a single instance, perhaps, either ‘public’ or ‘navigable.’ Furthermore, there are extensive collieries already in operation, and located quite near to these ‘ rivers’ and ‘ other streams,’ and quite near also to the ownerships and leaseholds referred to. Now, under this act, an operator of one of these collieries, no matter whether an individual or corporation, having acquired the ownership, or become the lessee of the anthracite coal under a lot lying on the other side of one of these,‘rivers’ or ‘streams,’ but separated from the colliery by the intervening lot of another over which such river or stream flows, may, ‘for the better and more convenient mining’ of his own ‘anthracite coal,’ take the private property of the owner of such intermediate lot, and appropriate it for a private way to his own colliery, although such private way does not in any manner connect with ‘ a public highway or place of necessary public resort,’ or with ‘ a private way <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>leading to a highway.’ To use the language of a very clear and able writer on this subject (see Amer. Law Review, vol. 6, p. 197), this is legislative authority for a private way which ‘may have both termini in private lands, and be laid out solely to connect A.’s white-acre lot with A.’s black-acre lot, separated by the land of B.’ The constitutionality of such legislation never yet has received judicial sanction in Pennsylvania, nor, indeed, in any of our sister states.</p>

As we have seen, the Act of May 5th 1832, entitled ‘An Act regulating lateral railroads,’ was the first relating to this subject. It provides that ‘ if any owner or owners of land, mills, quarries, coal mines, lime kilns, or other real estate, in the vicinity of any railroad, canal or slackwater navigation, made or to be made by any company or by the state of Pennsylvania, and not more than three miles distant therefrom, shall desire to make a railroad thereto,-over any intervening lands,’ he or they may do so, upon compliance with other provisions of the act relating to location and to the assessment of damages. As we have seen, also, this act was from time to time supplemented, and its scope thus greatly enlarged; but none of the supplements, no, not one, ever authorized the construction of lateral railways, except they connected with public improvements, railroads or highways of some description, as enumerated in the original act or in the supplements, respectively. Keeling’s case, 6 P. F. Smith 305, involved like this, an underground right of way, and it was held, therein, that there is no authority for the connection of lateral railways, excepting with public improvements, railroads or highways of some description, as enumerated in the Act of 1832, and its supplements.</p>

It makes no provision for the connection of the right of way it assumes to authorize, with any ‘ railroad, canal or slackwater navigation;’ it is barren of even a reference to them, or to any public improvement whatsoever. The single constitutional requirement of compensation, it does, however, profess to meet. But how ? ‘ It shall be the duty of the viewers and jury to take into consideration in assessing the damages, the advantages and disadvantages which may result to the owner or owners of the lands passed through by the said way.’ What advantages, pray, could fever result to one of these owners ? None of them would have the right to use the ‘way,’ except by contract; besides, if it connected with no public highway, what possible use could it be to them under any circumstances ? And, yet, upon a mistaken comparison of the ‘ advantages and disadvantages,’ the ‘ viewers and jury’ might <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>impose on such ‘ owner or owners’ a portion of the cost of constructing such ‘way,’ by lessening the allowance for compensation.</p>

Now, one of the recognised and generally accepted meanings of the words, ‘dispose of,’ is to sell. Webster has it thus : ‘ To dispose of; to part with; to sell; to alienate; as, the man has <em>disposed </em>of his house, and removed.’ In addition, then, to the fact that the doctrine held in Lyon <em>v. </em>Grormley, 3 P. F. Smith 263, is at open war with the provision just quoted, independently, indeed, of it altogether, this act, not by a strained or perverted meaning of its terms, but by a construction in exact accord with the commonly received meaning of language, proposes to legalize the taking of the private property of one man, so far as it lies ‘ within the bounds of said way,’ and giving it to another as his private property, upon payment by the latter of such compensation as may be fixed by certain other men.</p>

Now, nothing is more common in the development of anthracite coal, than the recognition of an estate in the surface of land, another in the first underlying vein of coal, another in the second, another in the third, and so on in respect of all the underlying veins. Concerning any possible proposed legislative disturbance of estates of this character, Judge Sharsw-ood remarks in Palairet’s Appeal, 17 P. F.
