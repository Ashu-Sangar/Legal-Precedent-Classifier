The action was instituted by the presentation to the Court of Common Pleas of York county, on the 7th of September 1874, of a petition for the appointment of viewers to assess damages alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff on account of the construction of the works of the defendant. Both parties appealed from the report of the viewers, and on the 30th day of August 1875, the court directed an issue to be framed in the case by treating the petition for the appointment of viewers to assess damages presented by the plaintiff as a declaration, the defendant to plead “Not guilty,”, and the cause to be tried on the issue formed on such pleadings, without regard to the form of action. <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>The petition of the plaintiff set forth that the Ashland Iron Company was a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of Maryland, and authorized by Acts of Assembly of the state of Pennsylvania to take and hold land in Pennsylvania in fee simple or otherwise; that it was and had been for six years the owner of a tract of land in Heidelberg township, York county, containing about twenty-four acres, more or less, further described by named adjoiners; that there was in and upon said tract of land a large and valuable bank of iron ore; that a considerable stream of water had always flowed by its natural channel in, over, upon and across said tract of land, until diverted as in said petition further set forth; that said stream of water afforded the petitioners a water-power of great value to them; that they were enabled by its use to propel their machinery used in mining and preparing and washing their ore' and to wash and prepare said ore for smelting ; that the defendant had erected a dam on said stream at a point above where it had always been accustomed to enter the petitioners’ land, and had wholly diverted the water from its accustomed flow by the natural channel aforesaid and prevented its flow into and over the petitioners’ land, whereby they were entirely deprived of the use of said water for propelling their machinery or washing their ore, or watering the stock on their land, to the great damage of the petitioners; that the said land was chiefly valuable as an ore property for the purpose of mining iron ore, and that the petitioners averred and believed that said iron ore could not be profitably mined without the use of said water in its former accustomed flow; that the defendant by its servants and employees,- had entered upon said tract of land and made extensive excavations therein and laid pipes therein, to the great damage of the petitioners. They alleged that they could not agree with the Hanover Water Company upon the amount of compensation to be paid to them for the said damages, or upon three dis- . interested and competent persons to assess the damages — and prayed the court to appoint three such men, to ascertain and report to the court what damages the petitioners were legally entitled to recover from the said Hanover Water Company, by reason of the acts and matters alleged in the petition, and what compensation should be paid to them therefor by the said Water Company.</p>

It is true that the first point of the plaintiff below was inaccurately worded, and the unqualified affirmance of it might have misled the jury if it had stood alone to think that the measure of damages was the value of all the water that would pass through the pipe even to the extent of the whole stream. But the meaning evidently was that as the iron company might have the whole stream taken from them at any future period and their damages were now to be ascertained and found once for all, the jury had a right to consider that fact in its legitimate bearing upon the market value of the land and ore-bank. If this stream of water added greatly to the value of the property, as the jury might well find, certainly the fact that it might at any future period be exhausted by means of the pipe laid to convey it to the Borough of Hanover, would necessarily operate to depreciate <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>its market value.

Now it was entirely competent for the iron company to prove that though it' had not been worked for a number of years it was not exhausted, and the working of it might be resumed with profit whenever they determined to do so. But why they had abandoned it, if it was still unexhausted and workable, was entirely irrelevant; not calculated to enlighten the jury upon the only true issue, but on the contrary to turn aside their attention to side issues. What the intention of the owners in the future might be could have no legitimate bearing upon the question of the value of the land and ore-bank in the market immediately before or after the appropriation of Gift’s run by the water company. We think, therefore, that the first, second and third assignments of error must be sustained.</p>

When asked the value of this land it was objected that the greater portion of the claim of the iron company was for an alleged deprivation of their ore land of the water for washing, and the witness therefore could not speak of the value of this land from the bare knowledge of the value of farm land in the vicinity. But the witness then testified that he knew the general value of ore lands in the neighborhood; that he knew this tract and that it had on it an ore-bank. Why then should he not have been allowed to give his opinion ? It is true he said in answer to questions by the court that his knowledge of sales of ore land was derived only from hearsay, and that he had no practical knowledge of ore lands never mined. The knowledge -that the best experts possess upon this subject is derived from hearsay. It is not necessary that they should be actually present and personally know the sale. Indeed it was held by this court in East Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Hiester, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%2053" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Wright 53">4 Wright 53</a>, that after a witness has given his opinion of the value of land, it was improper for him to give particular instances, because there might thereby be introduced into the cause as many issues as there were instances. We think, therefore, the fifth assignment of error must be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b285-8" data-blocks='[["BL_285.8",285,[206,2174,1163,221]]]'>We find no error in the rejection of the assessments. It is true the assessors and public officers are sworn to do their duty. But the assessment is nothing but their ex parte statement, and their opinion was not subjected to the test of a cross-examination. The sixth and seventh assignments, therefore, are not sustained.</p>

Small was admis<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>sible. It was testified, indeed, that he was acting for the iron company in carrying on the work at the bank, and the offer was to prove a statement by him to one of the miners, “ that every ton of ore they got out there cost a little over five dollars a ton to mine it.” This was certainly not within the scope of his authority as .superintendent, and it would be very unjust to allow such loose declarations of a mere agent to affect his principal. It was no part of the <em>res gestee </em>upon the broadest construction of the rule which admits the acts and declarations of an agent. Such acts and declarations must be in the course of his duty.</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[264,846,1159,389]]]'>The ninth assignment has been already adverted to and needs no further examination. As to the tenth, the answer to the third point of the defendant below was in part erroneous in introducing the element of the intention of the iron comjnany to remove the ore-bank, the evidence as to which was, as we have seen, irrelevant and ought not to have been admitted; but it would have been correct to say that the fact that the mine was not worked ought not of itself to prejudice the iron company if it was still an unexhausted mine and added to the market value of the property.</p>
