Shortly thereafter, Dohan complained of other symptoms which appeared to <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>him to indicate a heart attack. Upon Dohan’s request, the Appellee contacted the family physician, Dr. C. Stephen Stahlnecker, who agreed to come immediately. When Dr. Stahlnecker had not arrived at the Dohan residence within a half hour, the Appellee contacted the Concordville Fire and Protective Association to have her husband taken to Riddle Memorial Hospital (Riddle). Riddle was a few miles from the Dohan residence. The Appellee thereafter advised Dr. Stahlnecker that she was taking her husband to Riddle. Dr. Stahlnecker then advised Riddle that Mr. Dohan, who was complaining of chest pains, would be coming to its emergency room. Dr. Stahlnecker was not on the staff at Riddle,- but did have staff privileges at another community hospital, Lankenau Hospital. Mr. Dohan arrived at Riddle at 7:40 a.m., preceded by Dr. Stahlnecker by one or two moments. Mr. Dohan was taken to the emergency room which was staffed by a registered nurse, a practical nurse, a resident physician with a subspecialty in cardiology and an EKG technician.</p>

Both Dr. Stahlnecker and the resident assistant read the EKG, which confirmed that Mr. Dohan had in fact suffered a heart attack. Mr. Dohan also received an injection of Demerol from an emergency room nurse. After determining that Mr. Dohan had a coronary occlusion, Dr. Stahlnecker advised Appellee and her husband that Mr. Dohan be admitted to the coronary unit of Lankenau Hospital.</p>

This was done in full view of Riddle’s emergency room staff and without objection. Furthermore, this transfer occurred even though the resident in the emergency room did not execute a signed approval as is required by Riddle’s by-laws. While en route from Riddle to Lankenau Hospital, Mr. Dohan died.</p>

Through the action of the trial court, the jury was permitted to draw the inference, “that it could disregard entirely the court’s instructions with respect to the affirmative duties owed by the hospital to Mr. Dohan under the facts of this case.” <a href="/pa-super/313/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="313 Pa.

If the jury found that the hospital acted unreasonably in allowing the decedent to be removed from the hospital, and it was foreseeable that such removal would aggravate or increase the danger of the existing physical condition, the hospital would be liable. Whether or not the decedent was a “patient” of Riddle is immaterial, for as the trial judge instructed the jury, “even if you find that the attending physician remained in charge of the decedent David Dohan, Riddle Hospital, nevertheless remained responsible for those services or acts which according to good medical practice it should have performed.” R. 1015a. Accordingly, a jury could conclude that the decedent was not a “patient” of Riddle and still find Riddle liable for failing to act reasonably in permitting Dr. Stahlnecker to remove the decedent; or, the jury could have concluded that the decedent was a “patient” of Riddle, and the hospital did not act unreasonably. Although the issue of whether or not the decedent was technically a patient of Riddle was not critical to the disposition of this case, it does appear from a review of the record that it was a question of fact to be determined by the jury. As such, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>

    <p id="b694-6" data-blocks='[["BL_694.6",694,[265,844,1147,731]]]'>Thus, at the conclusion of his instruction, when the trial judge restated the duty of care the hospital owed to Mr. Dohan, the court was merely reemphasizing the position and points of law which it previously discussed. Notwithstanding the disagreement of the parties as to the status of the decedent, the sole issue for the jury’s consideration was whether the hospital acted reasonably once it had been determined that the hospital undertook to render services to the decedent. There is no dispute that the hospital rendered services to the decedent even though it was disputed as to the extent and manner of those services.
