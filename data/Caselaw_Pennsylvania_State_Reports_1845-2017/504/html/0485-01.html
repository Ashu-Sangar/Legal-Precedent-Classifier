Beasley, was convicted of murder of the first degree, and sentenced to death, in connection with an incident in 1980 in which a police officer was shot to death at a restaurant in Philadelphia. The officer had gone to the restaurant in response to a radio dispatch alerting him that a man with a gun was present there. Upon arriving at the restaurant, the officer was fatally wounded by the appellant.

Nevertheless, the extent to which a court tolerates leading questions, or suggests how questions asked by counsel should be rephrased, are matters within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>Thus, in his opening argument, while discussing evidence to be presented regarding events leading up to the shooting, the prosecutor inferred the following about appellant’s state of'mind:</p>
    <blockquote id="b612-5" data-blocks='[["BL_612.4",612,[284,517,1100,358]]]'>“[T]his defendant knows that he’s in big trouble if he’s caught with a gun ...

    <p id="b612-6" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[243,894,1144,466]]]'>Clearly, this statement was proper, for the prosecutor merely asserted that the motive for the shooting was appellant’s desire not to be discovered with a gun in his possession. The Commonwealth’s evidence did supply the basis upon which this argument was founded, for it demonstrated that appellant was in possession of a gun when approached by the police officer at the restaurant, that appellant had previously threatened a patron, and that, when approached, appellant fatally shot the police officer.</p>
    <p id="b612-7" data-blocks='[["BL_612.6",612,[242,1376,1145,467]]]'>Appellant next cites a portion of the opening statement in which, after describing the shooting incident and appellant’s desire not to be arrested, the prosecutor stated, “Beasley then decides that he’s got to go.” Here, the prosecutor simply stated the obvious fact that, after the shooting, appellant made a decision to flee. The Commonwealth’s evidence showed that appellant did in fact flee immediately after the shooting, and, hence, the prosecutor’s statement was beyond reproach.</p>
    <p id="b612-8" data-blocks='[["BL_612.7",612,[241,1861,1145,467]],["BL_613.1",613,[199,313,1137,256]]]'>In his closing argument, the prosecutor argued as follows to advance an explanation as to why appellant did not shoot at an additional police officer who pursued him for purposes of arrest after the shooting incident, “He didn’t shoot him because the weapon was empty ... He didn’t shoot him because he saw it was empty at the time____” We reject the assertion that this statement constituted unfounded speculation as to appellant’s thought processes, for it is plainly a legitimate inference as to appellant’s motive for <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>conducting his flight in the manner shown by the Commonwealth’s evidence. The evidence indeed established that appellant’s gun contained, at the relevant time during flight, no more live ammunition; only spent shell casings then remained.</p>
    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[197,616,1138,762]]]'>The next portion of the closing argument alleged to have been prejudicial was that in which, during a discussion of appellant’s abandonment of weapons at the end of his flight, the prosecutor inferred that appellant’s actions were attributable to consciousness of guilt, stating, “And from that moment, what’s in his mind? This is an individual who knows that the shooting has just occurred. That he has done it. That he is being pursued and they’re up to him. What is he going to do? Get rid of the weapons.” Again, appellant’s flight and abandonment of the weapons were firmly established by the Commonwealth’s evidence, and this portion of the closing argument merely advanced a reasonable inference as to appellant’s motive for abandoning his guns.</p>
    <p id="b613-6" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[192,1416,1141,925]]]'>The final portion of the closing remarks challenged by appellant is that in which the prosecutor inferred that a glove had been discarded by appellant in the back of a police van after the arrest because the glove was one that, had appellant had time to don it prior to shooting a weapon, he would have worn as protection for his hand. The glove was established by the Commonwealth’s evidence to have been seen in appellant’s rear pocket at the time of arrest, and was later found hidden underneath the seat of the van in which appellant was transported to the police station. Inasmuch as the arrest occurred on a night in the month of July, when appellant would not have been carrying a glove as a precaution against inclement weather, the prosecutor’s inference as to the purpose of the glove was not unreasonable. In summary, therefore, we find no merit in any of appellant’s allegations that opening and closing remarks by the prosecutor exceeded permissible bounds of argument.</p>

In reviewing an identical claim of vagueness asserted against the corresponding portion of the death penalty statute of the State of Florida, which employed virtually identical language, the Supreme Court of the United States rejected the vagueness claim, noting that a jury’s evaluation of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as enumerated, requires no more line drawing than is commonly required of a factfinder in any lawsuit. <em>Proffitt </em>

Examination of the record reveals, however, that the trial court read to the jury the entire statutory list of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d), (e). Although the court did not elaborate as to which of the ones listed might apply in this case, we do not believe the jury could have been confused by the mere fact that the listing of such circumstances was, therefore, more extensive than was necessary. In connection with this claim, appellant argues that there is no record of what circumstances the jury found, and, thus, that there can be no meaningful review of whether the jury understood the instruction. This contention is plainly erroneous. The record <em>does </em>contain a verdict sheet upon which the jury clearly indicated that it found two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. Such findings are supported by the evidence, and demonstrate the jury’s clear understanding of the instruction in question.

The death penalty statute provides that if the jury finds at least <em>one </em>aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances, then the verdict <em>must </em>be death. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(l)(iv).

The sole witness offered by the defense at the penalty proceeding was appellant’s mother, Ethel Beasley. Mrs. Beasley testified that appellant was, at the time of trial, twenty-nine years old, and that at an unspecified time in the past he had received treatment at a psychiatric hospital. Counsel then asked Mrs. Beasley why appellant received treatment, whereupon an objection by the prosecutor was sustained. After a sidebar conference, however, Mrs. Beasley <em>was permitted to testify, </em>without objection, that appellant received treatment because he drank excessively, to the point of blacking out. Defense counsel then asked the following question: “And when he blacked out, sometimes he wouldn’t know what happened for days at a time?” Mrs. Beasley answered with a “no,” but the prosecutor objected, and the objection was sustained. The Commonwealth contends that this question was properly excluded, taking the position that the question was leading, that it called for an answer that could have been based only on hearsay, and that the question was proper only for a medical expert to answer.</p>
