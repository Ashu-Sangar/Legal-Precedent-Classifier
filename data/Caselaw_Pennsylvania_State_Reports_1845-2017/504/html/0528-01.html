This means that 73 per cent of the cases filed with the Administrator have not been resolved. Even worse, six of the original 48 cases filed in 1976 remain unresolved, despite the passage of four years. No extraordinary circumstances have been offered to explain this intolerable delay.

City of Philadelphia, supra. </em>Not only, as previously stated, is the fashioning of an alternative scheme an inappropriate judicial function, but also the suggested scheme would have been clearly contrary to the legislative expression of public policy. The scheme advocated by those who attempt to distort <em>Mattos </em>substitutes concurrent jurisdiction in the panels for exclusive jurisdiction expressly provided by the legislature. There is no doubt that the legislature intended to establish a compulsory scheme of arbitration, an integrated system in which the <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>arbitration panels had “exclusive original jurisdiction”. The exclusivity of the jurisdiction was crucial to the legislative design in that the Act could accomplish its stated purpose of prompt and fair dispute resolution only if the parties were compelled to proceed through the system.</p>
    <p id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.4",654,[236,596,1146,790]]]'>Since <em>Mattos, </em>properly interpreted, did in fact strike down the arbitration process, it necessarily follows that section 604(a) no longer has vitality. While a statute may be partially valid and partially invalid, that can only occur where the provisions are distinct and not so interwoven as to be inseparable. <em>Saulsbury v. Bethlehem Steel Co., </em><a href="/pa/413/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="413 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="1888552" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0316-01">413 Pa. 316</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.2d%20664" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="196 A.2d 664">196 A.2d 664</a> (1964); <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v.

Article II sets forth the liability of non-qualifying health care providers. Articles III, IV and V create the arbitration panels and the office of Administrator. Article VI deals with awards. It contains six sections. Only two refer to arbitration panels. The other sections of this Article deal with: (a) the reduction of awards by any public collateral source of compensation or benefits and the denial of subrogation, (b) attorney’s fees from <em>any </em>award, (c) the statute of limitations on the liability of the Catastrophe Loss Fund established in Article VII and (d) the requirement of a special contract in writing to create a guaranty of cure. Article VII creates the Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund and provides for the liability of excess carriers. Article VIII requires the Insurance Commissioner to create a plan, consisting of all insurers authorized to write insurance under The Insurance Company Law of 1921, Act of May 17, 1921, P.L. 682, 40 P.S. § 382 <em>et seq., </em>which would “provide equitable apportionment of the financial burdens of insurance provided to all applicants ... and the costs of operation of the plan among all participating insurers____” Article IX directs the Medical, Osteopathic and Podiatry licensing boards to appoint investigators, attorneys and hearing examiners to fully implement their authority to revoke, suspend, limit or otherwise regulate the licenses of physicians. Finally, Article X contains six mis<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>cellaneous provisions for immunity from liability for the licensing boards, requiring notice prior to cancellation of professional liability policies, establishing the act’s prospective application only, setting forth penalties for non-payment of assessments and establishing a joint committee.</p>

The language in Section 604, 40 P.S. § 1301.604, refers to “a plaintiff represented by an attorney in the prosecution of his claim” and limits plaintiff’s attorneys fees from “any award”.

Separation of powers is not just a mechanism to be dragged out on occasion to protect special interests or the prerogatives of a particular branch of government. It is a coherent policy underlying all American constitutional theory. It requires the courts actively to protect the prerogatives of all three branches of our government, not supinely to permit the aggrandizement of one branch, or one profession, at the expense of the other two. Article V, Section 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution gives this Court “the power to prescribe general rules governing, practice, procedure and the conduct of all courts ... including the power to provide ... for admission to the bar and to practice law, <em>... if </em>such rules are consistent with this Constitution and <em>neither abridge, enlarge nor modify </em>the <em>substantive rights of any litigant. </em>” (Emphasis added).
