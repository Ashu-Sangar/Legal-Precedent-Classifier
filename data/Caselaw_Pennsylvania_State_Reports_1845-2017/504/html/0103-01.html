They were suspects in two separate shootings which had occurred at 3:47 a.m. and 6:45 a.m. on that day. The shootings were apparently racially motivated incidents which involved the random selection and shooting of three black men who were on the street; one was killed and two were wounded by bullets fired from one or more large caliber handguns. McGrath and a companion were taken into police custody shortly after 7:00 a.m. on the morning of the shootings after having been chased, lost and re-chased by several police vehicles. Both men were released later the same day as there was insufficient evidence at that time to charge them with a crime.</p>

On September 5, 1979, the Philadelphia police informed the Marine Corps at Paris Island that McGrath was the subject of an arrest warrant for homicide and other charges. The Philadelphia police and the Marine Corps agreed that the warrant was to be transmitted to the Buford County Sheriff’s Department which would arrest McGrath and hold him in the county jail until Philadelphia police arrived to assume custody.</p>

(A “Series” consists of 254 to 296 recruits.) According to the testimony of McGrath, the drill instructor who gave him this order also told him that he was wanted in Philadelphia for a shooting and that he would have to go to jail. The testimony of Lieutenant Macintyre was introduced, by stipulation, as follows: in response to a request from the legal division on the base at Paris Island, he interviewed McGrath. During the interview, he informed McGrath that he had been advised of McGrath’s possible fraudulent en<a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>listment, and that there was a warrant for McGrath’s arrest in Philadelphia charging him with homicide and other charges. Lieutenant Macintyre took McGrath through a “rising chain of command”, which culminated with Captain Walter Gaskin, the Commanding Officer of “F” Company. (A Marine Corps “Company” consists of five “Series”; thus Captain Gaskin commanded approximately 1300-1500 recruits.)</p>
    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[254,732,1146,730]]]'>Captain Gaskin’s testimony was that he interviewed McGrath in his office in response to receipt of a memo from the battalion legal division concerning McGrath’s “possible fraudulent enlistment.” The memo mentioned that McGrath might have a police record (which presumably was not disclosed on the enlistment papers), but did not mention an outstanding warrant. Accordingly, at the time Gaskin interviewed McGrath, he asserted he knew nothing of the warrant or the homicide charges against McGrath, even though Lieutenant Macintyre and other Marine Corps personnel did know of the warrant and the charges. The reason offered for this discrepancy was that Macintyre, being McGrath’s immediate superior officer, was given more detailed information from the legal division.</p>

He also said that he would have to make a recommendation to the colonel as to whether McGrath should be retained in the marines or discharged, and that if McGrath wanted to explain in order for the captain to have “a clear picture,” he could do so.

After McGrath told his story, the essence of which was that he was present at the shootings but had not pulled the trigger, the captain <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>called in the Chief Drill Instructor, Master Sergeant Jones, and McGrath then repeated his story three or four times. The captain, who found the story “phenomenal”, stated: “I was concerned about what he had said and I asked him to say it again and then I would ask him specific parts about it. [He repeated] the actual whole story maybe twice but different parts of it three or four times.” N.T.S.H. 543.</p>
    <p id="b224-5" data-blocks='[["BL_224.4",224,[264,700,1146,734]]]'>The captain also testified that when McGrath entered his office pursuant to his order, McGrath stood at attention and could not speak unless spoken to. Other testimony indicated that at a later stage of the interview, McGrath stood “at ease” while repeating his statement. Although the captain testified that when he gives an order, he expects to be obeyed, he also testified that McGrath should have known that he did not have to answer the captain’s questions under the Uniform Code of Military Justice: “He can refuse. As a matter of fact, in this time I had no reason to offer him rights but I asked him if he wanted me to help him. He could have voluntarily explained to me what had occurred. If he’d have said he didn’t, I’d have said very well.” N.T.S.H. 547.</p>
    <p id="b224-6" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[263,1476,1147,840]]]'>Captain Gaskin indicated that when McGrath left his office, he was taken to a holding center, under supervision by drill instructors, to await transfer to the custody of civilian authorities (the Buford County Sheriff’s Department). There were no specific orders given to McGrath at that time restricting his freedom of movement, but none were necessary because “from the time a recruit arrives until the time he leaves Paris Island he’s under constant supervision. So there was someone with him at all times anyway”. N.T.S.H. 557. The captain also testified that he learned of the Philadelphia arrest warrants only after completing the interview with McGrath and that the memo concerning “possible fraudulent enlistment” had, in fact, been a “mistake”. That is, the captain later became aware that McGrath’s matter was “not a fraudulent enlistment case at all but a warrant”. N.T.S.H. 563.</p>

McGrath testified that after his initial encounter with the first drill instructor at which he was told that he was going to jail in Philadelphia because of a shooting, he was interviewed by Lieutenant Macintyre and two or three other drill instructors, including Master Sergeant Jones. One of the drill instructors read the charges to him and the lieutenant questioned him about the charges. He was then taken to pack all of his belongings and was told that he was being taken to Philadelphia. Within two hours of being interviewed by the lieutenant, after he had packed his belongings, he was interviewed by Captain Gaskin. With respect to this interview, McGrath was asked at the suppression hearing, “Were you aware that you had the alternative of not to explain these things to him?” McGrath answered: “No I didn’t. I didn’t understand it, you know, I had a right to say no to an officer”. N.T.S.H. 575. McGrath also testified he believed that if he did not tell the captain about the shooting incident he would go to jail for not obeying an order.

From the time he was first ordered to report to Lieutenant Macintyre until his transfer to the custody of the Buford County Sheriffs Department, McGrath was under the constant supervision and control of Marine officers and non-commissioned officers, including the Commanding Officer of his Company, the Commanding Officer of his Series, and his Chief Drill Instructor. Then boot-camp-private McGrath was informed by Lieutenant Macintyre that a warrant for McGrath’s arrest on charges of homicide had been lodged in Philadelphia, and he was then taken through the “rising chain of command” and ordered to Captain Gaskin’s office for questioning. At least for part of that questioning, McGrath stood at attention before several of his superiors, could speak <em>only </em>when spoken to, was (as always) expected to obey his superiors, and was “asked” to repeat his story three or four times. Under these circumstances, this Court cannot seriously entertain the naive notion that McGrath was not in custody or significantly deprived of his freedom of action when “interviewed” by his superior officers.

The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus reflects the fact that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police. A practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation.
