Post- trial motions were filed and denied, and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and a consecutive term of two to seven years on the other convictions.

Appellant — Romeri—had been Mrs. Bremmer’s paper boy and was her neighbor. Appellant’s version of what transpired in the house is that after taking a small amount of money, the two discovered Mrs. Bremmer in bed in an upstairs bedroom and that Reinhard held her down while appellant struck her with something. Reinhard’s version is that after entering the house, he waited in the kitchen while appellant explored the living room and then the second floor. After hearing muffled sounds upstairs, Reinhard went up to find appellant standing with a pipe in his hand next to Mrs. Bremmer’s bed, where her bloody body lay. The two ran from the house and had a snack at a local store, then returned to the house to see if Mrs. Bremmer was dead. She was not, and after covering her body with a sheet — according to Reinhard, while she continued to moan — they took more money and left the house. Mrs. Bremmer subsequently died of the beating.</p>

      <em>The Morning Call </em>(Monday, April 2, 1979). Beginning on April 3, 1979 prospective jurors were called for <em>voir dire, </em>and on April 9, 1979 after <em>voir dire </em>testimony comprising 970 pages of transcript in which extensive questioning of prospective jurors was carried out, a jury was sworn. Counsel for appellant moved for a change of venue after this newspaper article appeared. The trial court held this motion under advisement until the jury was selected on April 9, and at that time the motion was denied.
