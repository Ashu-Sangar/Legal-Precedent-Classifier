A majority of this Court has properly refused such a request.</p>
    <p id="b142-8" data-blocks='[["BL_142.9",142,[250,1114,1145,788]]]'>Article V, Section 18 of our Constitution creates the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board. In doing so, the citizens of this Commonwealth created a constitutionally <em>independent </em>Board to review the action of the members of the judiciary. According to Article V, the Board is vested with the power to receive and review complaints, and if so warranted, conduct a hearing into those matters complained of. If, after taking testimony and reviewing all the evidence, the Board is of the belief that action is required, the Board shall make such recommendations as it deems appropriate. Although Subsection (j) of Article V, Section 18 empowers this Court to prescribe rules of procedure for the Board, this power does not include the power to usurp the clear mandate of our Constitution to have a distinct and independent Board.</p>

(See the Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142 § 2, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 3331 et seq.) Similarly, this Court has adopted specific rules by which the Board is to act.

Implicit therefore in the exercise of this power, is the existence of Court action. The Board is not a court as defined under this Act. The Board was established as an independent Board not beholden to this Court until a recommendation of discipline is filed. Therefore, a matter before the Board is not pending before a “court” for purpose of plenary jurisdiction. To hold otherwise would be to permit this Court to interfere at anytime in the proceedings before the Board, even to the extreme of prohibiting the Board from considering an action properly filed. This position is clearly in contravention of the constitutional powers and purpose of the Board.</p>

From the dissent it appears that the author may have knowledge of the contents of the Removal Petition under seal, even though only designated as "XYZ”. If this be the case, how then can the author objectively participate. If the author is correct in his assertions, than according to public information, he was a principal witness in the proceeding to which he refers. Despite this, he now undertakes the additional, critical, and impermissible role of judge and decision-maker. In American jurisprudence, a lawyer who is a witness in a case is not permitted to argue that case. It is even more impermissible for a witness to assume the more important role of judge and decision-maker.</p>

Surrick, through his counsel, James Eiseman and Robert J.

The basis of that objection is Article 5, Section 18(i) of the Pennsylvania Constitution which prohibits, without qualification, a justice from participating “in any proceeding involving his suspension, removal, discipline or compulsory retirement.” It was argued in support of the refusal of Mr. Justice Larsen to recuse himself that it was not apparent the matter under consideration was related to the charges currently pending before the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board against Justice Larsen.
