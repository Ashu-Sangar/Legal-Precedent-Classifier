Ms. Storm then drove toward Uniontown where both women were attending classes at the Uniontown Beauty Academy. While enroute, Ms. Storm and Ms. Martin observed appellant following them in a blue automobile. (Other witnesses described appellant’s vehicle as a blue Buick with temporary tags.) Between Fairbanks and New Salem, appellant passed the two women, pulled in front of them and slammed on his brakes. Ms. Storm braked and drove around him. Appellant then repeatedly bumped Ms. Storm’s car from the rear with his car. At one point on New Salem Road, Ms. Storm pulled off the road and appellant followed her. Ms. Storm then pulled out and appellant continued to follow, harass and bump her vehicle. After Ms. Storm turned on Route 40, appellant repeatedly drove his car into the rear of her vehicle. Shelby Storm lost control of her car and it came to rest on a cement median strip in front of the entrance to the Uniontown Mall. Appellant pulled in behind her car, walked up to the driver’s side, and fired a shotgun three times through the glass. Ms. Storm suffered two wounds, one a fatal head wound. Some of the pellets from the shotgun blast struck and wounded Ms. Martin.</p>

Ms. Martin’s account of the incident was corroborated by three motorists who observed the shooting and positively identified appellant as the man who shot Shelby Storm.

    <p id="b579-6" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[192,950,1137,465]]]'>On the evening prior to the killing, Ms. Storm had filed a complaint with a District Justice charging appellant with harassment, and a warrant for appellant’s arrest was issued upon that complaint. On that same evening, an acquaintance of appellant, James Groves, Jr., had visited him at the residence which appellant shared with Shelby Jean Storm to obtain the return of a sixteen gauge shotgun. Appellant declined to return the gun, informing Mr. Groves that “he couldn’t take anymore ...” and “she. [Shelby] has to die.”</p>

The front of appellant’s vehicle was damaged and police found paint chips from Ms. Storm’s vehicle on it.

At that time he made an oral statement in the presence of Lt. Jones, Sergeant Campbell and Officer Wright of the Uniontown City Police. Appellant admitted that he had killed Ms. Storm and Mr. Glad. He told the officers that he had <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>planned to kill Ms. Storm and that he shot Mr. Glad after he had asked Mr. Glad to move his pick-up truck and Glad did not do so. Appellant told the officers he had taken Glad’s truck which the officers found in front of the police station. Inside the truck was the shotgun used in both killings. Later that night appellant made separate inculpatory statements to Trooper Lukachik and Trooper Holmberg of the Pennsylvania State Police. In his statement to Trooper Lukachik, he again admitted he killed Ms. Storm and said he killed “the man” because “his car was in the middle of the road and he wouldn’t move it.”</p>

He told Trooper Holmberg he was upset because Ms. Storm was leaving him and he said that they had argued about his drinking. He also said that much of the incident was “a blur”. He said he would have found a way to kill Ms. Storm even had he not had the shotgun.</p>
    <p id="b580-6" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[237,1326,1146,564]]]'>At trial, appellant testified that he had lived with Shelby Storm on and off for seven or eight years and that they had a daughter. The night before the killing he put the shotgun in his car to take it to Uniontown because he had told Mr. Groves that was where it was, and “he didn’t want to be a liar”. That night he drank ten shots and five beers during a six hour period of bar-hopping and he then drank several shots and beers at home. Around 6:00 a.m. the next morning, he woke up and drank two shots, and at 7:30 a.m., he went to the Peacock Casino and had two more beers and three more shots.</p>

Appellant also stated that he had seen another lady in the car with Ms. Storm.</p>

Its driver (the second victim, Joseph Glad) “mumbled something”. Appellant panicked because he was “closed in” and shot Glad.</p>

I believe, after fulfilling my statutory obligation of independent review,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> that the record discloses arguable ineffectiveness by appellant’s trial counsel during the penalty phase of the trial proceedings. Consequently, this Court properly raised the effective assistance issue, <em>sua sponte, </em>during oral argument. I am, however, unable to resolve the issue of whether that arguable ineffectiveness was prejudicial to appellant in the face of appellate counsel’s unquestionable ineffectiveness in failing to raise any issues concerning the penalty phase during either the original argument or reargument. In short, I can see an argument; but in the absence of advocacy, I am unable and unwilling to resolve its effect. The court appointed post-tri<a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>al and appellate counsel admitted at argument that he raised only those ineffectiveness issues appellant himself pointed out and trial counsel included in post-trial motions, that he had not read the United States Supreme Court’s cases on capital punishment in preparation for this case and had never tried a homicide. This coupled with the lack of <em>any </em>argument by <em>anyone </em>regarding the penalty phase, convinces me that we have here the rare case where defendant was effectively denied basic due process because of the absence of even minimally competent appellate advocacy. Accordingly, I would remand to Common Pleas for appointment of new counsel and a hearing on ineffective assistance of trial counsel at the penalty phase of the trial.</p>

The defense argued that because defendant had ingested drugs on the day he committed homicide and, allegedly, robbery, he could not form the specific intent to commit either first degree murder or robbery. However, trial counsel failed to properly develop his client's only defense and, therefore, the California Supreme Court ruled that the evidence of diminished capacity presented at trial was too insubstantial to-require submission of the defense to the jury. <a href="/citations/?q=599%20P.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="599 P.2d 587">599 P.2d at 596</a>.

In a capital case a reasonably diligent preliminary investigation of this type is necessary to provide the factual framework within which to make a competent, informed tactical decision regarding the most effective presentation of a diminished capacity defense.

Stoyko’s appellate brief raises the following issues: whether the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and against the law, whether the court erred in consolidating the cases for trial and whether the court erred in admitting certain Commonwealth exhibits into evidence. I agree with the majority that none of these have merit.</p>
