To the contrary, criminal liability may be imposed by the mere non-compliance with the reporting requirements of the act. The public official, therefore, on the one hand, is required to file financial information concerning himself and his immediate family, and failure to do this may result in criminal liability; but on the other hand, the official may have no means to acquire and file the information he is required to produce.

Thus, under the terms of the Ethics Act, criminal liability may result from non-compliance with reporting requirements with which a public official may have no ability to comply. Imposition of such criminal liability offends due process, for it is axiomatic that criminal liability may not be imposed for the failure to perform acts which a person has no power to perform. Rather, the essence of our criminal law is the imposition of criminal liability for voluntary, culpable acts, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 301, 302, which are offensive to public order and decency. Thus, the reporting requirements of the Ethics Act do not withstand a due process challenge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Such disclosure is in my view based on outmoded notions of spousal unity and subservience. Although I share the dissent’s concern that removal of this requirement may render the act meaningless in its application to some officials who are members of traditional families, I believe that concern is outweighed by the danger of imposing the sanction of removal or the sanctions of the criminal laws on other public officials whose spouses commonly follow independent private careers and would be unwilling or unable to make the disclosure called for by the statute. In such cases the requirement of spousal disclosure seems to me to subject such officials to prosecution based on status. That result seems to me to offend the provisions of Article I, Section I, of the Declaration of Rights in our Pennsylvania Constitution. On this independent state ground alone, analogous to Fourteenth Amendment due process, I agree with the majority that a public official cannot be required to disclose spouse’s financial interests under pain of criminal sanctions.</p>

The constitutionality of legislation which impinges upon this right to confidentiality is determined by balancing the public interest to be served against the personal interest affected. In addition, there must be a rational relationship between the means employed by the legislature and the goals sought to be achieved. <em>See Dandridge v. Williams, </em><a href="/us/397/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="397 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="12055070" data-case-paths="/us/397/0471-01">397 U.S. 471</a>, <a href="/us/397/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="397 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="12055070" data-case-paths="/us/397/0471-01">90 S.Ct. 1153</a>, <a href="/us/397/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="397 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="12055070" data-case-paths="/us/397/0471-01">25 L.Ed.2d 491</a> (1970).</p>
    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.4",320,[279,1056,1145,253]]]'>The privacy interest implicated in the instant matter, namely the right of the spouse of a public official to confidentiality in his or her financial dealings, clearly falls within the “confidentiality” category. Thus the balancing test and the rational relationship test are here applicable.</p>
    <p id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[277,1328,1148,678]]]'>Employing the balancing test, I am of the view that the state interest in strengthening and maintaining public confidence in government far outweighs the interest of spouses of government officials in their personal financial affairs. I do not believe such a conclusion works an undue hardship. Public service, with its attendant sacrifices to spouses as well as office holders, is not forced upon the public official. The spouse of a public official undoubtedly plays a role in that official’s career and shares in the prestige and honor as well as the inevitable sacrifices of public office. Thus the burden of public financial disclosure is merely an additional inconvenience that must be accepted by the marital unit if one of the members seeks to hold public office.</p>

This Court has declared on innumerable occasions that it is not our function to pass upon the wisdom of legislation. <em>E.g., Wanamaker v. Philadelphia School District, </em><a href="/pa/441/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="441 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="1933864" data-case-paths="/pa/441/0567-01">441 Pa. 567</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=274%20A.2d%20524" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="274 A.2d 524">274 A.2d 524</a> (1971); <em>Commonwealth v.

Section 5 of the Ethics Act, 65 P.S. § 405, which specifies the <em>contents </em>of a statement of financial interests, is not mentioned in section 9(b). The majority nevertheless interprets section 9(b) as imposing absolute criminal liability upon individuals unable to comply with section 5, and bases its finding of a due process violation upon that interpretation. Such a reading violates two well established principles of statutory construction. First, it must be presumed that the General Assembly does not intend to violate the Constitutions of the United States or of this Commonwealth. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3).
