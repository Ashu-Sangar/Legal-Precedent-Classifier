While respondent admits he commingled clients’ funds, he argues <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>that discipline harsher than public censure is inappropriate because his conduct, while not excused, was mitigated as the product of his self-confessed alcoholism. He points out that he recognized that problem, sought help and treatment for it and began recovery from it by abstaining before these proceedings began. Moreover, he argues no client suffered actual loss from his commingling and that his alcoholic rehabilitation shows suspension is unnecessary to protect the public. We agree that respondent should be disbarred because claimant’s continuing unethical conduct after this investigation began leads us to believe his continued practice is likely to pose a danger to the public. His continued concealment of his juggling of clients’ funds after this investigation began and especially his unwillingness to release the names of current clients to the Board so that the records he submitted in support of his assertion that all current client funds were accounted for could be verified by audit procedures normal in the accounting profession leaves us unconvinced of his total honesty with himself and the Board. Under such circumstances the admitted conversion of client funds is insufficiently mitigated to avoid disbarment. Therefore, we hold respondent must be disbarred for the protection of the public.</p>

    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[241,434,1146,564]]]'>Charge I relates to respondent’s representation of Dorothy and Edward Cameron in a personal injury action arising from an automobile accident in which Mrs. Cameron was injured. The Board found that respondent had represented to the Camerons that their claim had been settled for an amount higher than the actual settlement. Respondent obtained the Camerons’ signatures on a release which reflected the higher amount, then placed the Camerons’ signatures on the settlement draft for the lower amount actually offered by the insurer without the knowledge or consent of the Camerons.</p>
    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[237,1025,1148,942]]]'>Charge II, also arising from the Cameron case, relates to respondent’s handling of the settlement funds. The Board found that the funds were deposited in an account labeled “escrow account” from which respondent subsequently made withdrawals for his own use without the knowledge or permission of the Camerons. As a result of the withdrawals, the balance in the account fell below the amount necessary for a full distribution to the Camerons and one of Mrs. Cameron’s treating physicians. The Board further found that the funds ultimately used to pay the Camerons belonged to other clients and were improperly withdrawn from escrow. Moreover, respondent had withheld from the Camerons certain monies owed to Mrs. Cameron’s physician and used this money for his own purposes. Despite the fact that the money had not been paid to the doctor, respondent showed it as paid on the Statement of Distribution which he gave the Camerons. The money was later paid only after Disciplinary Counsel inquired into the matter.</p>

Respondent contends that since the purpose of the disciplinary system is not to punish but to determine the continued fitness of an attorney to practice law, the two year suspension recommended by the Board is excessive. Respondent contends that his restitution to his clients, his reformed conduct and the fact that all his misconduct was directly related to his alcoholism should reduce the sanctions imposed on him to public censure with supervised probation.</p>
    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[213,934,1137,674]]]'>Respondent’s argument has some merit. However, it is totally dependent on the factual premise that his rehabilitation has progressed to the point that his continued practice of law is not likely to endanger the public. Unfortunately, that premise is belied by two facts. First, respondent persisted in his misrepresentations concerning his dealings with clients’ funds after this investigation began. Most important, however, although he corrected these specific misrepresentations, he thereafter refused to provide Disciplinary Counsel with the list of clients which would have enabled Disciplinary Counsel to verify the accuracy of respondent’s records and the truth of his statement that he had a sufficient escrow to cover all clients’ funds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

      <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>While we thus hold that respondent’s conduct warrants disbarment, and reject his contention that his affirmative defenses require us to impose only censure, we also reject the underlying thrust of Disciplinary Counsel’s argument. This argument would not only make <em>Knepp, Lewis </em>and similar cases<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> controlling in the present case, but would create the equivalent of a <em>per se </em>rule requiring disbarment of any attorney who commingled or converted clients’ funds or improperly shifted funds in escrow accounts, regardless of the other facts in the case. We decline to adopt such a rule. While we are mindful of the need for consistency in the results reached in disciplinary cases so that similar misconduct is not punished in radically different ways, we are also concerned that each case, subject as it is to our exclusive jurisdiction and <em>de novo </em>review, be decided on the totality of facts present. The position urged by Disciplinary Counsel would provide uniformity at the expense of the discretion and fact-specific considerations needed to fashion appropriate discipline. The gravity of any disciplinary proceeding requires not only the presentation of all relevant facts, but also our retention of the discretion necessary to evaluate those facts. Such discretion is incompatible with the <em>per se </em>rule urged by Disciplinary Counsel.</p>

Respondent cites <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel v.

Its primary function is rather to determine the fitness of an attorney to continue the practice of law. It thus serves to protect the courts and the public from unfit lawyers. This does not mean that the system does not possess a set of sanctions or that these sanctions are not punitive. The system is designed to determine whether misconduct has occurred and to what extent that misconduct indicates unfitness to practice law. Sanctions, admittedly punitive, are imposed in accord with the misconduct. Respondent’s argument, taken to its logical conclusion, would preclude <em>any </em>sanction against an attorney found guilty of misconduct because that sanction would be punitive, <em>i.e., </em>it would be a punishment for misconduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The disciplinary system could not fulfill its dual functions of determining fitness to practice and protecting the courts and the public if it could find an attorney to be so unfit that he should be suspended or disbarred and yet lack the power to effect the appropriate response.

His placing of the Camerons’ signatures, without their permission, on a settlement which was materially different from the settlement he had told them he had reached involves not only unethical but also illegal conduct <em>{i.e., </em>forgery). Finally, petitioner’s misrepresentations to Disciplinary Counsel are in themselves unethical acts and evidence a lack of appreciation for the seriousness of his misconduct. This is especially evidenced by his initial refusal, even though on advice of counsel, to release his current clients names to Disciplinary Counsel because <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>he did not wish them to know he was being investigated.

The Hearing Committee found that he had not violated this disciplinary rule, but the Board, holding that "[a] long term pattern of misconduct involving <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>forgery, conversion of clients' funds, commingling of their funds with his own, and failure to maintain records of receipts and disbursements” could justify a finding that DR 1-102(A)(3) had been violated.

While the <em>Knepp </em>and <em>Lewis </em>cases are similar to the present case, there are also factual differences which should be noted. Both the <em>Knepp </em>and <em>Lewis </em>cases involved the commingling and conversion of clients’ funds. The <em>Knepp </em>case also involved neglect of legal matters and the charging of excessive legal fees. The <em>Lewis </em>case involved the intentional failure to properly represent a client. These latter violations are not present here.</p>

Respondent’s counsel, at oral argument, attempted to take sole responsibility for this refusal and indicated his client was then willing to produce the necessary records. We are not inclined to accept this excuse. Respondent had admitted to acts which posed a serious risk of disbarment. We do not see how he could have thought his effort to protect his practice by attempting to minimize the chance of his current clients learning of the existence of these proceedings, the reason counsel gave for advising refusal, was justified. We must <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>agree with counsel that his advice to respondent was ill-advised. We note that no claim of client privilege was advanced.</p>

Presumably suspensions and disbarment are improperly “punitive” under respondent’s interpretation.</p>
