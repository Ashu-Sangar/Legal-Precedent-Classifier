These statutes had been enacted in several states. Apparently as a result of the issue paper, the Washington legislature considered testimony from Dr. Ted Loomis, Ph.D., M.D., Professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Washington. In a letter to Senator Dan Marsh, Dr. Loomis indicated, among other things, that there is an abundance of scientific support to indicate that with a BAC level of 0.1 percent, <em>all persons are significantly affected. At that level, all persons will have lost one quarter of their normal driving ability, some persons will have lost as much as one half of their normal driving ability and a few people will not be able to even sit up in the driver’s seat. </em>Dr. Loomis concluded:</p>

Consider further the consequences of an erroneous judgment as to the blood alcohol content. Where the drinking driver errs on the side of caution and imbibes an amount of alcohol that keeps the blood alcohol content under 0.10%, that person has lost only some immediate gratification felt by the consumption of one or two additional drinks. He or she has foregone, perhaps, that “one for the road”. If, however, the driver errs on the high side of the calculation, <em>i.e. </em>the blood alcohol content is greater than 0.10%, the possible and probable consequences to innocent people and society are tragically obvious. Moreover, the widespread availability of charts as a guide to the amount of alcohol that can safely be consumed by persons of varying weights has been judicially noticed in other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g. State v. Franco, supra and Burt v. People, supra. </em>Similarly in Pennsylvania, the use of such charts, provided for instance by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board and the American Automobile Association and frequently published in newspapers and magazines, particularly near the holidays, can greatly ameliorate the relatively minor inconvenience to the drinking driver.</p>

The requirements of due process have clearly been met to the extent that the legislature has acted in an area properly the subject of its police power, and has not done so arbitrarily. The question presented for our determination is whether the legislature has acted “with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em><a href="/us/461/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="461 U.S. 352" data-case-ids="11298570" data-case-paths="/us/461/0352-01">461 U.S. 352</a>, —, <a href="/us/461/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="146" data-cite="461 U.S. 352" data-case-ids="11298570" data-case-paths="/us/461/0352-01">103 S.Ct. 1855</a>, 1858, <a href="/us/461/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="461 U.S. 352" data-case-ids="11298570" data-case-paths="/us/461/0352-01">75 L.Ed.2d 903</a>, 909 (1983). The statute clearly does not “encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” A person driving a vehicle either has blood alcohol greater than .10% or he does not. There is no room for discretionary determinations by enforcement officers whether the conduct violates the statute or not. If the statute is to be found impermissibly vague, then, it must be because it fails to define the offense “with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.”</p>

This argument, I think, goes more to the reasonableness of the legislative judgment than to whether fair notice has been provided as required by due process.

If it did, there would be no question as to <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>vagueness. Rather, the statute proscribes the operation of a motor vehicle after a person has ingested a particular measure of alcohol, but there is no way for an ordinary person to know when he has reached that statutorily proscribed level.</p>
    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[189,589,1138,738]]]'>I am in complete agreement with the majority and with the legislature that measures must be taken to prevent drunk drivers from killing innocent people on our highways. The immediacy of the goal, however, has never and cannot now serve to justify the enforcement of statutes which provide no meaningful notice as to what behavior has been proscribed. Had the legislature, on the other hand, seen fit to enact a statute, for example, prohibiting the operation of a motor vehicle within eight hours of the consumption of <em>any </em>alcoholic beverage, similar to the regulation of the Federal Aviation Administration, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion at n. 9, such a provision would pass constitutional challenge of the sort raised here, for there could be no mistake as to what was prohibited.</p>
    <p id="b387-5" data-blocks='[["BL_387.5",387,[189,1351,1136,140]]]'>For these reasons, I would affirm the lower court and hold that the statute is unconstitutionally void for vagueness.</p>
