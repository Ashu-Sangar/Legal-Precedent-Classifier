Appellant was found guilty of murder of the first degree, robbery, and two counts of burglary. Following the jury’s verdicts of guilty, a sentence of death was imposed on the verdict of murder of the first degree. Concurrent sentences of ten to twenty years’ imprisonment were imposed on the related robbery and burglary verdicts and ordered to run consecutive to the death sentence, and a sentence of five to ten years’ imprisonment was imposed on the second burglary verdict and ordered to run consecutive to all other sentences.</p>

Upon motion of the Commonwealth, these charges were initially consolidated with the charges which form the basis of this appeal. Subsequently, the court granted a defense motion for severance, and the Commonwealth chose to try appellant first on the charges <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>relating to Barbara Coates.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On May 17, 1977, following a trial by jury, appellant was found not guilty on all counts.</p>
    <p id="b152-5" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[259,414,1149,1157]]]'>Trial on the charges relating to Sara Tiers was initially scheduled to commence one week later, on May 24, 1977. Defense counsel, however, requested and was granted a continuance in order to obtain the notes of testimony of the Barbara Coates trial, at which evidence relating to all the offenses with which appellant was charged had been admitted. Counsel also immediately filed a motion to dismiss the charges relating to Sara Tiers and Carol Havey on double jeopardy grounds, on the theory that evidence of these offenses had already been presented as part of the Commonwealth’s case-in-chief in the Barbara Coates trial. This motion was denied on November 4, 1977. Subsequent petitions for extensions of time filed by the Commonwealth pursuant to Criminal Procedural Rule 1100(c) were granted, resulting in the postponement of jury selection until October 16, 1978. Following the voir dire of a forty-five member jury panel on October 16, but prior to the selection of a jury, defense counsel became ill. He subsequently died in February 1979. New counsel was appointed to represent appellant, further Commonwealth extensions of time were granted, and jury selection ultimately began again on June 11, 1979, two years and ten months after appellant’s arrest.</p>

Over defense objection, the court ruled that the case would be considered a capital case, in which the parties would be permitted to question the veniremen concerning the death penalty and would each be permitted to exercise twenty peremptory challenges.

In appellant’s view, because he had previously defended against the Commonwealth’s evidence when it was introduced at the earlier Barbara Coates trial, at which he was acquitted, he should not have been required to defend against this evidence a second time.

Appellant’s argument is premised on the view that, because the Commonwealth presented all offenses at the first trial as evidence of a common scheme, the jury’s verdict of not guilty must necessarily have reflected a finding that appellant was not guilty of any aspect of the scheme. This argument is not supported by the record of the first trial. The Commonwealth presented eyewitness identification tes<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>timony placing appellant near the scenes of the offenses against Sara Tiers and Carol Havey, but did not present any similar eyewitness testimony placing appellant at the scene of the offenses against Barbara Coates.

There appellant had defended against these confessions, as he did again at the second trial, by alleging that they had been fabricated by police who physically coerced him to sign the incriminating statements. In' appellant’s view, because the first jury returned a verdict of not guilty, that jury must have believed appellant’s testimony that the confessions were coerced, and the Commonwealth should accordingly have been estopped from introducing any of the confessions at a second trial and relitigating the issue of voluntariness.</p>

Because the jury had to determine appellant’s guilt or innocence only for the offenses relating to Barbara Coates, the jury did not need to reach an ultimate determination as to the voluntariness of appellant’s confessions to the other crimes.

Although under the present statute the defendant may introduce any evidence relevant to the existence of mitigating circumstances and is not limited to an exclusive list of mitigating circumstances as he was under the 1974 statute, the existence of one or more mitigating circumstances is no longer an absolute bar to the imposition of the death penalty as it was under the 1974 statute. That statute provided: "If a murder of the first degree ... is accompanied by at least one of the following mitigating circumstances the person convicted shall be sentenced to life imprisonment.” Section 1311(d). Instead, under the 1978 statute, "[t]he verdict must be a sentence of death ... if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.” Section 1311(c)(l)(iv). Accordingly, because the jury found that there were mitigating circumstances in appellant’s case and nevertheless returned the death penalty, a result that would have been impermissible under the law in effect at the time the offenses were committed, appellant argues that he has been subjected to an <em>ex post facto </em>law under the standard announced in <em>Dobbert.</em>
