At the time of his accidental death, the minor-decedent was an insured under a no-fault automobile insurance policy issued by appellant, Donegal Mutual Insurance Company.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a> Subsequently, the minor decedent’s father, John G. Freeze, Jr. (Appellee) was duly appointed administrator of the minor-decedent’s estate. Appellee applied to the appellant for payment of no-fault wage loss benefits. Appellant Donegal refused to pay the claim. Appellee instituted a complaint in assumpsit against appellant Donegal seeking to recover work loss benefits pursuant to the policy of insurance and the Pennsylvania No-fault Insurance Act. The appellant filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer asserting that under the Pennsylvania No-fault Act, work .loss benefits are not provided for an eleven year old minor who has not entered the labor market prior to his death. The lower court agreed and sustained appellant’s demurrer. The court also, sua sponte, granted appellee leave to amend his complaint to seek survivor’s benefits and funeral expenses. The appellee chose not to amend and filed an appeal. The Superior Court reversed the lower court decision and held that the estate of a deceased victim is entitled to recover work loss benefits under the No-fault Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">5</a> Appellant filed a petition for allowance of appeal which we granted.</p>

    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[268,572,1148,623]]]'>In <em>Heffner, </em>it was decided that the right to work loss benefits is not terminated by the demise of a victim. We held that “survivors” of deceased victims are entitled to payment of these benefits under the terms of the No-fault Act. It follows then that, if work loss benefits do not terminate upon the death of a deceased victim, absent a statutory bar those benefits are recoverable by the deceased victim’s estate. This is the natural, logical and compelling extension of our holding in <em>Heffner. </em>Upon a close and careful examination of the No-fault Act, we find no language which precludes the. recovery of work loss benefits to the estate of a deceased victim.</p>

    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[199,882,1136,202]]]'>In support of the argument that only “survivors” are entitled to the wage loss benefits of a deceased victim, the appellant points to the No-fault Act and Section 201(a) which provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b339-6" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[241,1098,1095,200]]]'>If the accident resulting in injury occurs in this Commonwealth, any victim or any survivor of a deceased victim is entitled to receive basic loss benefits in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</blockquote>
    <p id="b339-7" data-blocks='[["BL_339.6",339,[200,1318,1136,303]]]'>Appellant argues that the language, <em>“any victim or any survivor of a deceased victim </em>is entitled to recover basic loss benefits,” demonstrates the legislative intent that only survivors of a deceased victim and not the estate may receive wage loss benefits. Apparently, this is because the estate of a deceased victim is not specifically mentioned.</p>
    <p id="b339-8" data-blocks='[["BL_339.7",339,[200,1640,1136,199]],["BL_340.1",340,[268,295,1150,751]]]'>The appellant’s argument, however, overlooks the very basic and fundamental fact that a person who dies as a result of injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident is, within the meaning of the No-fault Act, a victim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">11</a> That an <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>injured victim is entitled to basic loss benefits under the Act is beyond question. The fact that a “victim” dies as a result of his injuries and becomes, a “deceased victim”, makes him no less a “victim” entitled to benefits under the provisions of the Act. A personal representative in the person of the executor or administrator of his estate stands in the shoes of the deceased victim as far as entitlement to benefits is concerned. The event of a victim’s death activates the rights of statutory survivors to benefits under the Act. However, the activation of survivors’ rights does not diminish or erase the victim’s rights even though he now be a deceased victim. If it was intended that a victim’s right to benefits be extinguished at his death, the legislature could have and would have said so directly.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[264,1111,1147,585]]]'>The appellant argues that if work loss benefits are required to be paid to estates of deceased victims even where there are no statutory survivors, the work loss benefits would be, in effect, a $15,000 life insurance policy. Appellant’s argument assumes payment to be automatic and fails to take into account all of the requirements of the Act which necessitate a showing of the loss claimed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">12</a> Nevertheless, even if payment is automatic as appellant suggest, estates of deceased victims are entitled to work loss benefits under the No-fault Act unless and until the legislature amends the statute to the contrary.</p>

The court raised this issue because the lower court’s order granted the plaintiff Freeze leave to amend his complaint to seek “survivor’s loss” benefits and funeral benefits. Ordinarily, where <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>a court sustains preliminary objections without dismissing the complaint or otherwise terminating the action, the order is interlocutory and lacks the finality needed to be appealable. The court went on to say, however, that if the amendment permitted by the order would, for all intents and purposes, put him out of court on the question he seeks to litigate, then the order is definite and final and is appealable. The court found that in this case, the amendment permitted by the order would drastically alter Freeze's cause of action so as to effectively put him out of court on the issue he sought to litigate, therefore, the order is final and appealable.

In the case of a “seasonally employed” victim, probable weekly income, determined by dividing probable annual income by “the number of weeks he normally works,” is multiplied by “the number of work weeks, or fraction thereof, the victim was unable to perform and would have performed work <em>during the accrual period </em>but for the injury.” 40 P.S. § 1009.205(b)(2). In the case of a “not employed” victim, probable weekly income, determined in the same manner as in the case of a regularly employed victim, is multiplied by “the number of work weeks, or fraction thereof, if any, the victim would reasonably have been expected to realize income <em>during the accrual period.” </em>40 P.S. § 1009.205(c)(2). Section 106(a)(1) of the Act provides that “No-fault benefits are payable monthly as loss accrues. <em>Loss accrues not when injury occurs, but as allowable expense, work loss, replacement services loss, or survivor’s loss is sustained.” </em>40 P.S. § 1009.106(a)(1).</p>

As is seen from a reading of section 106(a)(1), which provides for the monthly payment of benefits “as loss accrues,” the Legislature further intended to tailor the schedule of the payment of work-loss benefits to the amount of work loss actually suffered by the victim, rather than to require that the duration of the “accrual period” be estimated at the time of injury.</p>

If decedent had survived the accident, he would have had to show, pursuant to subsection (c)(2) of section 205, that there were work weeks during which he “would reasonably have been expected to realize income during the accrual period.” 40 P.S. § 1009.205(c)(2). Because of decedent’s age at the time of the accident, such a showing could not realistically have been made until several years after the accident, as until then decedent would not likely have entered the labor market. Under <em>Heffner </em>and today’s decision, decedent’s estate automatically qualifies for decedent’s work-loss benefits at the instant that the accident occurs, on the theory that decedent would have become employed at some point in the future, and would have worked long enough to have earned $15,000. Yet under the mandate of section 106(a)(1) of the Act, the work-loss benefits may not be paid to decedent’s estate until the “loss accrues,” a situation which would not occur until decedent’s hypothetical entry into the labor market, several years after the actual injury.</p>
