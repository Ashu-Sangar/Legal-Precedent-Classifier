However, Commonwealth Court incorrectly determined that appellee’s application for a stay pending its review is within Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction. 42 Pa.C.S. § 761. A stay, like a supersedeas, is an auxiliary process designed to supersede or hold in abeyance the enforcement of the judgment of an inferior tribunal. <em>See Conston v.

Thus, such applications for relief will not generally be entertained until after a notice of appeal or petition for review has been filed. Pa.R.A.P. 1702(a). In any case, any order granting a stay or supersedeas prior to an appeal will be vacated if no timely appeal or petition for review is filed. Pa.R.A.P. 1702(b). Moreover, an application for a stay pending action on a petition for review initially “shall ordinarily be made to the government unit.” Pa.R.A.P. 1781. Thus, an application for a stay pending review pursuant to the Rules of Appellate Procedure is within the appellate, not the original, jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Rule 311(a)(4) provides for an interlocutory appeal as of right from “an order granting continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to modify or dissolve injunctions.” As a practical matter, this Court cannot interpret Rule 311(a)(4) to also permit interlocutory appeals of right from the grant or denial of a stay or supersedeas by Commonwealth Court.</p>

It contends, however, that its claim challenges the Department’s power to revoke a license without a pre-revocation hearing under § 3761-7(b) of the State Lottery Law.

Generally speaking a license granted by a sovereign is <em>“a </em>permission by a competent authority to do some act which without such authorization would be illegal...” Black’s Law Dictionary (Rev’d. 4th Ed.1968). Government licenses generally constitute a form of property insofar as they are an entitlement to engage in a valuable activity. The grant of certain types of licenses, particularly a license to engage in a profession or occupation, may create a right or entitlement which triggers procedural rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The government cannot, on the one hand, create a business which is dependent on a permit and then, with the other, destroy it by revoking the authorizing permits without first affording “sufficient” due process. <em>Doran v.

However, the Commonwealth, after having learned of appellee’s convictions on charges of theft by deception, revoked that license, thereby denying it the benefit of the contract. If, as appellee claims, this denial was improper, the remedy, as I see it, would be a breach of contract claim.
