The Upper Bucks County Area Vocational-Technical School is operated by a Joint Committee formed by the Quakertown, Pennridge, and Palisades School Districts for the purpose of providing a vocational-technical education program to the residents of the districts.

A strike by members of the Vo-Tech faculty <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>delayed the start of Vo-Tech instruction until September 24, 1980. The home school districts were open during this period, and students enrolled in the Vo-Tech program remained at their home schools during the half-days that they would otherwise have gone to the Vo-Tech facility. As a result of the strike, sixteen instruction days were lost from the Vo-Tech program. The Joint Committee, on October 16, 1980, approved a calendar for the school year identical to that which had been issued prior to the school year, thereby failing to make up the days lost because of the strike.</p>

    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[251,402,1152,1788]]]'>“The requirement that an interest be ‘direct’ simply means that the person claiming to be aggrieved must show causation of harm <em>to his interest </em>by the matter of which he complains.” <em>Wm. Penn, </em><a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">464 Pa. at 195</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">346 A.2d at 282</a> (emphasis added). The Appellees argue, and the Commonwealth Court held, that as taxpayers of the constituent school districts they have an interest which is harmed by the failure of the Committee to schedule 180 days, because the districts will lose a <em>pro rata </em>portion of a state subsidy for each day less than 180. We cannot agree. Nowhere in the complaint or in the record is there an allegation or evidence that links the loss of the subsidy with the plaintiffs’ interest as taxpayers. The plaintiffs do not allege that the loss of the subsidy will in any way affect their status as taxpayers, for example, by causing a tax increase to offset the lost funding. Although “[cjertain cases exist which grant standing to taxpayers where their interest arguably does not meet the requirements of <em>Wm.

We find that the Commonwealth Court erred in determining that this is such a case. A careful reading reveals that the exceptional cases referred to in <em>Biester </em>involve situations where there is <em>some </em>degree of causal connection between the action complained of and the injury alleged, although it is too small to ordinarily confer standing. We reiterate that in the present case, reading the record and drawing all inferences in light most favorable to the plaintiffs, there is <em>no </em>connection between the failure of the Committee to schedule 180 days and harm to the plaintiffs in their status as taxpayers.</p>

The United States Supreme Court has phrased this guideline as whether “the interest the plaintiff seeks to protect is arguably within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.” <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em><a href="/us/397/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="397 U.S. 150" data-case-ids="12050959" data-case-paths="/us/397/0150-01">397 U.S. 150</a>, <a href="/us/397/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="397 U.S. 150" data-case-ids="12050959" data-case-paths="/us/397/0150-01">90 S.Ct. 827</a>, <a href="/us/397/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="397 U.S. 150" data-case-ids="12050959" data-case-paths="/us/397/0150-01">25 L.Ed.2d 184</a> (1970). We think it is clear that the sole purpose of the 180-day requirement contained in the statute and in the departmental regulations is to benefit the students of the Commonwealth. Any benefit to the teachers arising out of its operation or non-operation is purely incidental, and not within the zone of interests sought to be protected. Accordingly, the individual plaintiffs as teachers, and the union as their representative, do not have such an immediate interest as to confer standing to maintain the present action.</p>
