In return for a plea to charges of murder and robbery, the Commonwealth certified that the murder rose no higher than third degree and nol prossed all remaining charges.

After his plea appellant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years for third degree murder, and <em>2lh </em>to 5 years for robbery. No petition to withdraw the plea was filed nor direct appeal ever perfected; rather, appellant sought relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (hereinafter “PCHA”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Following a hearing on the petition, appellant’s requested relief was denied.

The record also adequately reveals that appellant understood the nature of the charges against him, the acts which comprised the offenses with which he was charged, and the permissible range of sentences which might be imposed. He affirmatively stated that he understood that he possessed a right to a trial by jury from twelve of his peers, and that should he proceed with a jury trial, he would be presumed innocent until every single element of the crimes he was charged with were proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the Commonwealth. (N.T. at 13, 22.) Moreover, the trial judge specifically cautioned appellant that he would not accept his plea unless he was in fact guilty of the crimes charged. After a satisfactory answer, he proceeded to question appellant about the voluntariness of his plea. Appellant’s response for entering his plea was “because it is a life sentence that I have seen so far.” (N.T. at 18.)</p>

At that point the trial court conducted its own inquiry to clarify his reasons for considering withdrawal. Appellant’s sole response was that he “didn’t fully understand it” when he entered it. He did not elaborate, however, on any particular aspect of the plea or bargain he failed to understand. The trial court then reminded appellant of his previous on-the-record unequivocal admissions of guilt and testimonial understanding of his guilty pleas, and the contradictory position that his present statement would place him. After having been given an opportunity to renounce his previous statements, the appellant declined to do so and reaffirmed his earlier statements. The appellant then changed strategy by asking the court for probation in lieu of imprisonment. The court unsatisfied with the progression of the dialogue granted a short recess to allow the appellant time to confer with family members and counsel. <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>After a short recess and in appellant’s presence, his counsel addressed the court on his behalf and said:</p>

At the hearing on July 7, 1976 and prior to the imposition of sentence rather than protesting his innocence, appellant reaffirmed both his guilt and his understanding of his plea. He then expressed specifics about the extent of his involvement in the incident.

There was thus no evidence at the hearing from which it could be concluded that counsel’s decision not to appeal lacked a reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s best interests. Indeed, the reason for not appealing is clear from the face of the record. The evidence overwhelmingly proved guilt of second degree murder, punishable by life imprisonment. The plea agreement arranged in this case eliminated some of the charges against the Appellant and, most importantly, gave certification that the murder charge rose no higher than third degree, punishable by a maximum of 10 to 20 years imprisonment.
