The accident occurred while the Appellee was traveling on State Road. State Road, Legislative Route 09001, was adopted as a state highway by the Act of June 22,1931, P.L. 594, 36 P.S. § 1738-1. Appellee’s complaint asserted that his injuries were caused by the negligent design, construction and maintenance of State Road by the Appellant and/or PennDOT.</p>

In <em>McCracken, </em>the issue presented was whether a borough may be held liable for an automobile accident which was caused by an accumulation of ice on a highway which had been taken over by the Commonwealth’s Department of Highways. We held that the assumption by state officials of the duty to improve or reconstruct the highway did not relieve the borough of its duty to keep the highway free from obstructions. This holding was based, however, upon this Court’s interpretation of the Sproul Act of 1911 and is not applicable in this action. As we stated in <em>Stevens v. Reading St. Railway Co., </em><a href="/pa/384/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="384 Pa. 390" data-case-ids="1263058" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0390-01">384 Pa. 390</a>, 403, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20A.2d%20128" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="121 A.2d 128">121 A.2d 128</a> (1956) (Emphasis supplied):</p>

The Commonwealth could avoid liability by failing to correct a design defect after the municipal road was adopted as part of the state highway system.
