At the time of her death, the decedent was covered by a No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance policy issued by appellant Erie Insurance Exchange (Erie). Appellee, C. William Nye, Jr., the decedent’s father and administrator of her estate, submitted a claim to Erie for payment of work loss benefits under the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> His claim was denied by Erie.</p>

    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[169,796,1151,1053]]]'>On February 4, 1981, the trial court found that appellee Nye lacked standing to sue all defendant insurance companies, except Erie, and dismissed the complaint against those defendants. On April 30, 1981, the trial court additionally found that appellee’s complaint failed to allege a cause of action against Erie, and granted him leave to amend his complaint. Appellee chose not to amend and on June 4, 1981, suffered dismissal of his action. The trial court did not have an opportunity to determine whether Nye’s action should be certified as a class action pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1710, since the complaint was dismissed before appellee had an opportunity to file a motion for certification pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1707. Appellee appealed from the February 4th and June 4th orders of the trial court, and, on December 10, 1982, the Superior Court reversed both orders. <em>Nye v.
