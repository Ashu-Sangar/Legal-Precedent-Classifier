When one intends to publish a book, they must do more than print the pages. The pages must be cut from the large flat sheets of varying sizes, cut to uniformity and sequenced. The proposed pages may vary in color, weight and texture, requiring skill and labor to paste, sew, cut, fold, fasten and assemble into the proposed book. Bindex contends they make something different, new and usable from the material they receive. They contend that while they do not conceive or print the pages, arrange the typography or the layout, what they do, through skill and labor, makes what was processed into what was intended, a book. We agree.</p>

As is evident, the concept underlying the definition is the transformation of material or things into something different from that received. The difference cannot be a superficial change that does not alter or change the thing. For example, a cosmetic change performed merely to facilitate the ease of handling, storing, packing or shipping the product or material does not constitute manufacturing. What is required is that the basic materials or goods be given a new identity by the current producer, one which can be easily traced to such producer. This identity must be the product of skill and labor. Skill involves education, learning, experience or knowledge one <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>acquires in a particular business, trade or profession; while labor is the physical characteristics and methods utilized to employ one’s skills. When labor is used in conjunction with skill to produce a different product than the original, one with a new identity, manufacturing has occurred.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b704-4" data-blocks='[["BL_704.4",704,[280,610,1146,743]]]'>The case of <em>Philadelphia School District v. Rosenberg, supra, </em>is illustrative and apposite. There the taxpayer was in the business of selling men’s apparel. The garments and the other items which eventually made up the clothing were manufactured by others. The taxpayers designed the patterns for the finished clothing by cutting and assembling the material for sewing into a finished garment. This procedure is functionally equivalent to the cutting and folding done by Bindex. Similarly, the sewing in <em>Rosenberg, </em>which was performed by another contractor, was analogous to the ultimate binding done by Bindex. Even though the taxpayer did less than Bindex, under those facts this Court found the putative taxpayer to be a manufacturer. <em>Id. </em>at <a href="/citations/?q=402%20Pa.%20368" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="402 Pa. 368">402 Pa. 368</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20259" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="167 A.2d 259">167 A.2d 259</a>.</p>

These decisions established that the business of commercial bookbinding is manufacturing for Pennsylvania tax exemption purposes. In both cases, the issue was whether the taxpayers were organized exclusively for manufacturing so as to be exempt from a capital stock tax. In <em>William Mann Co., supra, </em>this Court said that a corporation organized to manufacture blank books and stationery was a manufacturer of these and other related products. <em>Id. </em>at <a href="/citations/?q=150%20Pa.%2070" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="150 Pa. 70">150 Pa. 70</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20A.%20601" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="24 A. 601">24 A. 601</a>.
