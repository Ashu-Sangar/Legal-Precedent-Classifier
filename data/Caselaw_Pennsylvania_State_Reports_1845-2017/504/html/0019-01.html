    <p id="b139-4" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[193,383,1138,1269]]]'>Since the actual disposition of the criminal charges against Swaydis did not control whether Swaydis could be held accountable for his conduct in a court martial proceeding, the Governor was not deprived of a material fact to be considered in deciding whether to approve such a proceeding when the Commissioner failed to provide notice that the criminal charges had been dismissed. The memorandum from the Commissioner to the Governor, describing specific acts of misconduct of which Swaydis could be accused in a court martial proceeding, enumerated specific Pennsylvania State Field Regulations alleged to have been violated by Swaydis. Violations of those regulations supplied the basis for a court martial proceeding to be convened. The fact that criminal charges arising from the same misconduct had been dismissed would not, to any extent, preclude a court martial board from determining that violations of those regulations had occurred. Thus, we believe Commonwealth Court erred in holding that the court martial proceeding was rendered void by the Commissioner’s not having informed the Governor as to the district magistrate’s disposition of criminal charges. Dismissal of the criminal charges was, in short, not dispositive of the question of whether Swaydis should be held accountable for the acts of misconduct described in the Commissioner’s memorandum to the Governor.</p>
