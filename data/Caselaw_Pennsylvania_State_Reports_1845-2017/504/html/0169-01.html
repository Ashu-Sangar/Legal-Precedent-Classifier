Following an Arbitration Hearing appellees were awarded compensation for the fair mar<a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>ket value of their automobile.

The Superior Court reasoned that as a result of the Pennsylvania No-Fault Act, there now exists separate causes of action for personal injury and property damage and appellees were not obliged to join these claims in one petition. The Superi- or Court further noted that even if injured parties know that a no-fault threshold for their personal injuries has been reached before they institute their initial action for property damage, there is no requirement that they join the two claims. Appellant herein petitioned this court for review and we granted allocatur. After consideration, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

Thus, appellees were required to bring all their claims, and the failure to join both their property damages and personal injury actions bars the second action. <em>Spinelli v.
