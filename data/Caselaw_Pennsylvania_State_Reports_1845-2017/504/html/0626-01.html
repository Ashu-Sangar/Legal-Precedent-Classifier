Subsequent to that, Appellee filed an election to take against the will on the basis that she was the wife of the decedent by way of a common law marriage. A trial was held on July 2, 1980 before the Honorable William S.

      <em>McClain, </em>the plurality opinion relied on by both courts below, was an attempt at overruling prior case law holding that the <em>devisavit vel non </em>exception was operable only when the interested parties were all of the same class, either all taking by devise or all taking by descent. <em>McClain </em>held that the exception was operable even where some of the parties involved were claiming by devise and some by descent. Based upon this, the lower court reasoned that Appellee, claiming by descent, could testify even though the other beneficiary was taking by devise. This arguably would be a reasonable application of <em>McClain </em>were it not for the fact that Appellee must first establish her status as a descendant before she can qualify to testify under the exception. In this respect it can be said that Appellee is <em>sui generis </em>from those situations covered under the exception, the reason being that in the instant case the testimony of the Appellee does not go directly to questions surrounding the will or the decedent’s intent thereof, but rather is an attempt to establish the common law marriage. It is therefore apparent that the purpose behind which we except this class and allow them to testify is not present here. For, upon closer examination, what the Appellee must do before she comes within the purview of the exception is to overcome the hurdle of establishing her status. Once she has done that, she would fall within the exception and be competent to testify. Appellee’s attempt at overcoming that hurdle, however, must be accomplished without resort to any exception to the Act, since at that point she is <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>not yet within the exception. Additionally, we have held that a common law marriage is a civil contract, <em>McGrath’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/319/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="319 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="1162279" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0309-01">319 Pa. 309</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20A.%20599" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="179 A. 599">179 A. 599</a> (1935), and therefore what the Appellee would really be testifying to is a contractual relationship between herself and the decedent. This is clearly proscribed under the Dead Man’s Act, and we have so held, albeit without setting forth the rationale at length. <em>Wagner Estate, </em><a href="/pa/398/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="398 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="1289102" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0531-01">398 Pa. 531</a>, 536, 538, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20495" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="159 A.2d 495">159 A.2d 495</a>, 498 (I960).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Clearly, therefore, this case presents a “controversy ... between parties respectively claiming such property by devolution on the death of such [property] owner____” Hence, “all persons [are] <em>fully </em>competent witnesses.”</p>

It is a fundamental precept of statutory construction that, “[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(a).</p>

In so reasoning, the majority reads <em>Estate of McClain </em>far too restrictively and resurrects the error that we corrected in that case. As we made clear therein, the <em>devisavit vel </em>non<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> exception is <em>“not limited to ‘issues as affect the beneficiary under an alleged will. </em>’ We have recognized the applicability of the exception to cases where all parties claim by intestacy,” as well as cases where some parties claim by will and other parties claim by operation of law. <a href="/pa/481/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="481 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="1747272" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0435-01">481 Pa. at 443-45</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="481 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="1747272" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0435-01">392 A.2d at 1374-75</a>. It is of no legal significance that appellee’s testimony does not “go directly to questions surrounding the will or the decedent’s intent thereof,” for the appellee’s claim is predicated upon the operation of law, namely the Pennsylvania Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code which permits a spouse to elect to take a portion of a <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>decedent’s estate against a will. 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 2508. Since the <em>sole issue </em>regarding appellee’s claim to decedent’s property by operation of law concerns her status as a common law wife, the majority requires her to prevail on the merits of her claim before allowing her to testify. This is in direct conflict with the reasoning and holding in <em>Estate of McClain </em>wherein appellants’ claim was premised <em>solely </em>on their status as descendants (grandnieces). This Court held that testimony by the descendants was admissible <em>to demonstrate that status. </em>If a grandniece may testify under the <em>devisavit vel non </em>exception regarding her status as grandniece, there is no perceptible basis, under the Dead Man’s Act, for refusing to allow a spouse, common law or otherwise, to testify regarding her status as spouse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

While the evidence may not have been overwhelming, nevertheless there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to permit the lower court to find the existence of a marriage. A number of witnesses testified that the appellee and the decedent held themselves out to the community as husband and wife and that they were reputed to be husband and wife. It is also undisputed that the appellee and decedent had cohabitated for at least a portion of the time they were reputed to be married and that they had a child. Although, cohabitation and reputation are not a marriage, they are circumstances that raise a rebuttable presumption of marriage. <em>Pierce v.
