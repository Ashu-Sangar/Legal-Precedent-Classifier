In <em>Ziccardi </em>we held that, under certain circumstances, an employee’s remedy for the conduct complained of in Count II is an action against his union for damages resulting from the union’s bad faith failure to proceed to arbitration, not a proceeding before the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board. As stated in <em>Ziccardi, </em>the employee’s burden in such an action is heavy, his pleading and proof must be specific and “[T]he union ... must be given broad discretion in determining whether to pursue the remedy.” <a href="/pa/500/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="500 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="1781172" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0326-01">500 Pa. at 330</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="500 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="1781172" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0326-01">456 A.2d at 981</a>.
