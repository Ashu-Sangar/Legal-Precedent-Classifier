Moreover, Section 2704, 66 Pa.C.S. § 2704, restating former Section 411 of the 1937 Public Utility Code, Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1053, 66 P.S. § 1181, deals specifically with that power in cases of rail-highway crossings. The history of Section 2704 and its predecessor is instructive.</p>

In enacting Section 411, the legislature had attempted, in rail-highway crossing cases, to reverse the general common law rule that relocation costs are the utility’s sole responsibility, by giving the P.U.C. authority to allocate rail-highway crossing relocation costs “unless such proportions are mutually agreed upon and paid by the interested parties”. Thereafter in 1963, the legislature added language to Section 411 expressly giving the P.U.C. power to allocate the cost of relocating any kind of public <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>utility facility at or adjacent to a rail-highway crossing among the public utilities, municipal corporations or the Commonwealth in such proportions as the Commission may determine:</p>

It then construed such “execution” as payment. The subliminal justification for this somewhat strained exegesis was the potential for constitutional problems in interfering with the utilities’ early 20th century street permit applications, which the majority construed to be preexisting “contracts”. These applications were required by then existing city ordinances.</p>
