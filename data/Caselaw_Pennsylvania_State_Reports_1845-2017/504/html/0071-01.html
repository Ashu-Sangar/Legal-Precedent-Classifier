The board entered an award on December 27, 1974, establishing the terms and conditions of employment for the police officers for the calendar year 1975 (1975 award).

On appeal in this Court, the Department relies upon Pa.R.J.A. 2101(a)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> which was in effect at the time of the issuance of both awards. It chose not to rely upon the Commonwealth Court’s basis of <em>Poiarkoff v. Town Council, Borough of Aliquippa, supra. </em>The Department urges that the exclusivity of the Commonwealth Court’s jurisdiction to hear appeals from arbitration awards under Pa.R.J.A. 2101(a) precludes consideration of the illegality question in a mandamus action. It rests primarily upon <em>Skiles v. City of Lancaster, </em><a href="/pa-commw/24/0580-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="24 Pa. Commw. 580" data-case-ids="1873543" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/24/0580-01">24 Pa.

In <em>Skiles </em>the plaintiff/firemen brought an action in mandamus to compel compliance with a city ordinance that mandated equalization of the salaries and compensation of fire department employees and other civil service employees. An arbitration award, pleaded in the complaint, had violated the ordinance by awarding the firemen $50.00 less than had been awarded policemen for longevity increments. No appeal had been taken from the award. The Commonwealth Court held that the plaintiffs were improperly attempting to obtain review of the award <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>by their action in mandamus based upon the city ordinance. Thus, <em>Skiles </em>did not expand Pa.RJ.A. 2101(a) to vitiate a defense of illegality of an arbitration award in a mandamus action. Rather, <em>Skiles </em>prohibited mandamus as an alternative action for a party dissatisfied with an arbitration award; it did not eliminate a defense to a mandamus action.</p>
