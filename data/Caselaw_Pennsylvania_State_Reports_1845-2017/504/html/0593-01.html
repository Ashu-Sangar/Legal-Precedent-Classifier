Henry were the Republican candidates for County Commissioner of Westmoreland County. On November 28, 1983, the Westmoreland County Board of Elections certified that Miller had defeated Henry by three (3) votes. On December 2, 1983, Henry and sixty-four other <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>registered electors filed a petition<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> to recanvass the voting machines in seventeen (17) districts.

No challenging testimony was offered with regard to the petitions for three of the districts and a recanvass was ordered in those three districts. With respect to the fourteen remaining districts, testimony revealed that in four districts the affidavits verifying the petition had not been signed in the presence of a <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>notary public.

When, during the hearing, these errors became apparent, counsel for Henry and the other petitioners moved to amend the defective verifications. The hearing court held that the failure of the notary to administer the oath to the affiants invalidated the affidavits and, therefore, dismissed the petition as to those ten districts.</p>

Under this reasoning, if computation were completed in six days, for instance, the recanvass petition would have to be filed within five days thereafter, thereby rendering the twenty <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>day provision completely superfluous. We do not agree with this interpretation. It is clear that the legislature intended, under Section 1702, to give a prospective petitioner twenty days after the date of the election or primary within which to file a petition to recanvass voting machines; but if the computational canvassing took longer than twenty days, for example, under Section 1703 the candidate would have five days after computation in which to file. This is the only interpretation that preserves both sections of the Act.

We find further support for this interpretation in the language of Section 1230 of the same Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> This Section deals with the removal and storage of voting machines and states: “The voting machines shall remain locked against voting for the period of twenty days next following each primary and election, and as much longer as may be necessary or advisable because of any existing or threatened contest over the result of the primary or election.”</p>
    <p id="b714-5" data-blocks='[["BL_714.5",714,[217,1673,1146,522]]]'>In sum, we hold that a candidate has twenty days after the date of a primary or election, or five days after the computation is completed, whichever period is longer, within which to file a petition to recanvass. Here, the Election was held on November 8, 1983. The County Election board certified the vote on November 28, 1983. Henry’s recanvass petition was filed on December 2, 1983. Therefore, Henry’s petition to recanvass, having been filed within five days after certification of the results of the election, was timely.</p>
