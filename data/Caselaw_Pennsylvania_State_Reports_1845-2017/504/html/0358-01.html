A trial court’s rulings concerning the scope of voir dire must be considered in light of the factual circumstances of a particular criminal episode, and, in a given case, circumstances may be presented which render the case racially sensitive, thus making it necessary to inquire into racial attitudes of potential jurors. <em>Commonwealth v. Christian, </em><a href="/pa/480/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="480 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="1745032" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0131-01">480 Pa. at 137</a>, <a href="/pa/480/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="480 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="1745032" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0131-01">389 A.2d at 547-548</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Christian, </em>a rape case involving a black defendant and a white victim, there was need on voir dire for inquiry into the possible racial prejudices of potential jurors, since the case was rendered racially sensitive by the prosecution’s trial strategy of attempting to establish the black defendant’s sexual proclivity for white women. In <em>Brown, </em>another rape case in which the defendant was black and the victim white, this Court held that it was error for the trial court to have refused to inquire during voir dire as to whether prospective jurors were specifically biased against seeing a black man and a white woman walking together and holding hands, where, under the facts of the case, such an area of inquiry was considered relevant.</p>
    <p id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.5",478,[253,2097,1146,253]]]'>A criminal prosecution is not, however, rendered racially sensitive by the <em>mere </em>fact that the defendant is black and the crime victim is white.

    <p id="Ahp" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[175,704,1140,772]]]'>The present case, however, is not one where any racial differences between the defendant and victim were emphasized by evidence presented at trial. Superior Court concluded that the instant case was particularly race-sensitive, as a result of the mere fact that the defense alleged that intercourse between the black defendant and white woman was consensual. We disagree, and fail to find basis for reasoning that merely by raising the defense of consent, a defense so frequently employed in rape cases regardless of whether the defendant and alleged victim are of different races, the case is imbued with a heightened aura of racial sensitivity. Intensive voir dire examination along racial lines, more extensive or specific than that provided by the trial court, was, therefore, not necessary, in view of the absence of race-related issues.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

We believe that, under the circumstances, where there are not factors present to infuse the case with an enhanced racial sensitivity, and racial differences were not a focus of evidence at trial, the one voir dire question posed by the trial court was sufficiently specific and probing to reveal prejudices which might have bearing upon the case.</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[275,695,1148,1416]]]'>Despite the trial court’s explicit inquiry into possible racial prejudice, Superior Court held that prospective jurors should have been questioned as to whether they believe that black people are generally more dishonest than white people (third question, <em>supra.), </em>whether they believe that black men like to rape white women (fourth question, <em>supra.), </em>and whether they would be inclined to believe the testimony of a white victim rather than that of a black defendant merely because the victim was white (fifth question, <em>supra.). </em>By posing such questions, however, the trial court would have risked creating racial issues in a case where such issues would not otherwise have existed. Further, the questions would have given credence to base stereotypic racial fallacies, serving no purpose but to exacerbate prejudices which the law should combat with all of its vigor. Asking potentially offensive questions regarding racial stereotypes in a case such as this would serve no legitimate interest of the defendant, but might focus jurors’ attentions upon skin color rather than upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, thereby characterizing as important the fact that the defendant is black and the victim is white. Thus, such questions might interfere with the delicate balance of an impartial trial atmosphere, thereby beclouding, the trial with prejudicial suggestions and implications. Hence, since the scope of voir dire examination conducted by the trial court reveals no abuse of discretion, the order of the Superior Court is reversed.</p>
