In addition, the agreement provided that the appellant, in its discretion, could advance an additional $250,000.00 to the borrower. At the same time, Bernard DiSabatino executed and delivered to the appellant a promissory note in the amount of $1,100,000.00 secured by five mortgages. The mortgages were on properties owned by Bernard DiSabatino located in four Pennsylvania counties and included the Lancaster County real estate. The amount of each mortgage was $1,100,000.00. The mortgage on the Lancaster County property, a first mortgage, was given by John DiSabatino and Bernard DiSabatino and was recorded on April 25, 1973. That mortgage has been in default since April 26, 1974.</p>

Frank O’Donnell, Esquire, represented both DiSabatino and St. Paul Title Insurance Company at the closing of the mortgage executed in connection with appellant’s loan to DiSabatino. Before the mortgage settlement, DiSabatino personally gave O’Donnell bills for real estate taxes owed on the Lynnebrook Apartments tract. O’Donnell paid these bills under the mistaken belief that he was paying back taxes on the adjoining property which is the subject of the instant lawsuit. The receipts for these tax payments showed the map number for Lynnebrook Apartments, Inc., not for the contiguous parcel. O’Donnell never inquired as to the title designation referred to on the receipts. Moreover, in all his correspondence with the Lancaster County Tax Claim Bureau, O’Donnell merely stated that the enclosed tax payments were made on behalf of Bernard DiSabatino without identifying the property by description and map number.</p>

Appellant admits these facts. <em>See </em>Memorandum in Opposition to Petition and Motion to Quash Appeal at 9. Appellee further maintains that, with respect to each of the three mortgaged properties, appellant failed to file a petition to fix the fair market value of the property within six months of the sheriff’s sale as required by the Deficiency Judgment Act. Appellee, therefore, concludes that DiSabatino’s debt to appellant has now been deemed satisfied by operation of law and that the mortgages on all the properties, including that on the Lancaster County tract, are discharged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

(“[p]ayment of the debt secured by the mortgage discharges the mortgagor’s liability on both the bond and mortgage”). In addition, appellee claims that she is a “person interested in ... real estate which would ... be bound by <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>the judgment” and, as such, is entitled to the substantive protection afforded by Section 8103(d) of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[187,422,1137,677]]]'>In reply, appellant contends that the Deficiency Judgment Act is not applicable to the facts of this case. Appellant correctly notes that the objective of the Deficiency Judgment Act is to relieve a debtor of further personal liability to his creditor wherever the debtor’s property has been sold in execution for less than the judgment debt. <em>Cheltenham Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc. v. Pocono Sky Enterprises, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/305/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="305 Pa.

Appellant argues that the Act comes into play only when the lien creditor pursues his debtor personally on his obligation and has no application where the mortgagor elects only to institute <em>in rem </em>foreclosure proceedings which it argues is all it ultimately seeks to do here.</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[190,1116,1136,672]]]'>Appellant asserts that it foreclosed on three properties securing DiSabatino’s loan and then purchased them at sheriff’s sales in accordance with terms of a settlement agreement between appellant and the DiSabatinos under which the bank agreed to look only to the real estate in the four counties and not to pursue the mortgagors personally. <em>See </em>Reply Brief for Appellant at 13, n. 10. Thus, appellant concludes that since it appellee has not sought or obtained a personal judgment against the DiSabatinos in Lancaster County or in any other county, appellee is not included among the persons who have standing to invoke Section 8103(d) of the Deficiency Judgment Act. <em>Id. </em>at 8. ■ These facts are not contradicted.</p>

This is particularly true where, as in this case, the debtor is a developer of residential and commercial properties. Where the mortgaged properties securing one loan are separate parcels in different jurisdictions, it is virtually impossible to proceed against all the properties in one execution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Thus, we do not think <em>Tutino </em>which in<a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>volved a creditor’s election to execute a personal judgment against one of two parcels in the same county controls here. A lender, who necessarily issues successive executions on mortgaged property to collect his debt, and who is required to petition the court for a deficiency judgment in connection with every individual foreclosure action, will perceive that the value of its collateral has been significantly reduced. Lending institutions’ reluctance to extend financing under these circumstances would be likely to significantly reduce the credit available to enterprises with real estate in several counties.</p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[272,918,1147,692]]]'>Under appellee’s theory, a mortgagee would have to proceed against every mortgage securing the debtor’s obligation in a single execution in order to avoid application of the Deficiency Judgment Act. We believe a creditor who has bargained for a specific lien on several parcels should, instead, be able to issue successive executions against those specific parcels until he collects his debt from various parcels of the debtor’s real estate. However, appellee contends that if the creditor so proceeds, and the first parcel is sold to him by the sheriff for an amount less than the debt owed, he cannot institute foreclosure proceedings against a second parcel unless he obtains a deficiency judgment with respect to the first.</p>
    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.6",306,[273,1647,1142,524]]]'>Appellant observes that the practical effect of appellee’s construction of the Act is to force mortgagees to obtain a deficiency judgment simultaneously with every mortgage foreclosure. This result, the Bank claims, is fundamentally inconsistent with the policy objective of the Act, <em>i.e., </em>to protect a debtor from personal liability by limiting liability to the fair market value of real estate collateral. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Reply Brief at 17. We agree with appellant on this point and therefore need not deal with its other arguments on the deficiency judgment issue.</p>

The direct procedural way to raise this issue is by petition to satisfy pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8103(d) in the county in which appellant first purchased a mortgaged parcel at execution sale. Indeed, appellee did this in Delaware County and after its petition was dismissed failed to appeal. On that basis appellant argues appellee not only improperly by-passes 8103(d) by raising the issue on its motion to quash this appeal, but is indeed collaterally estopped. While this argument is appealing it is first raised in a footnote to a reply brief to which there has been no response.
