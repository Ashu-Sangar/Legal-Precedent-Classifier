      <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>We must reject Sterling’s contention that DER’s disciplinary action exceeded its authority under the Act. Appellant concedes that DER has the power to demote an employee to a lower class with a right to a hearing, but argues that DER lacks the authority to “demote” an employee within the same class without the right to a hearing. We note initially that Appellant’s argument is based upon a faulty premise, i.e., that every disciplinary action resulting in a reduction of an employee’s compensation is a demotion. “Demotion” as used in this Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">3</a> is unambiguously defined as “... a change [in status] to a position in a class carrying a lower maximum salary”. This clearly does not encompass the disciplinary action undertaken by DER. Thus, we need not resort to principles of statutory construction, as urged by Appellant, in interpreting the plain language of this provision of the Act.</p>

The Civil Service Act grants neither DER nor the Civil Service Commission unbridled authority to regulate civil service employes; rather, the legislature placed in the Act numerous provisions governing the circumstances and manner in which employes may be appointed, promoted, transferred, furloughed, suspended, removed, or demoted. <em>See </em>71 P.S. §§ 741.501, 741.602, 741.705, 741.706, 741.802, 741.803, 741.807. When an agency finds it necessary to discipline a regular employe,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">2</a> the Act provides that the employe may be demoted if he “does not satisfactorily perform the duties of the position to which he was appointed or promoted,” 71 P.S. § 741.706; that he may be suspended without pay “for good cause,” 71 P.S. § 741.803; or that he may be removed “for just cause,” 71 P.S. § 741.807. Any disciplinary action which does not comply with the provisions of the Act — for example, a reduction of the salary of an employe on account of unsatisfactory performance of duties, or for disciplinary reasons, to a lower salary rate within the salary range prescribed for his position<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">3</a> — is beyond the scope of power conferred upon the agency by the legislature and cannot stand.

The tenor of Appellant’s brief suggests a concern that an agency may use its power to reduce an employee’s pay to circumvent review of its action in an adjudicatory hearing. The Appellant's claim, if established, would not affect our holding that a reduction in pay is not a demotion which would entitle the Appellant to a hearing under § 951(a) of the Act. Under § 951(b) of the Act, however, any person who is aggrieved by an alleged violation of § 905.1 of the Act, relating to discrimination in personnel actions because of non-merit factors, <em>inter alia, </em>is entitled to a hearing. A hearing under § 951(b) is available, therefore, to redress abuses of an agency’s authority to discipline its employees.</p>

Even if such a hearing were not required by statute, I believe it would be required by due process: appellant’s loss of pay during the period of his "demotion” clearly constitutes a taking of his property by a governmental body. Further, the language of the regulation relied upon in this case cannot remove appellant’s "demotion” from the protection of due process simply by deeming it to be something other than an involuntary demotion. An agency may not deem an action to be constitutional when, in fact, it is not.</p>
