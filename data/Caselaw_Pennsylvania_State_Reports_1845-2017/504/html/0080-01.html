Conrail made no substantial settlement offer, and the case proceeded to trial. The jury awarded Mrs. Colodonato $250,000 in compensatory and $500,000 in punitive damages. That verdict was subsequently molded by the trial court to include delay damages of $115,208.29, representing ten percent annual interest on the total award of $750,000 for the period from October 16, 1979 to April 29, 1981.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As a result, two-thirds of the delay damages assessed, or $76,805.53, consisted of interest on the jury’s punitive damage award. Conrail appealed to the Superior Court, which ordered a remittitur of the portion of the judgment representing delay damages on the award for punitive damages.

That section provides for the augmentation of the amount of compensatory damages by the addition of damages for delay through a simple computation. Section (a)(1) instructs “the court or the arbitrators” (hereinafter “court”) to add “damages for delay at ten (10) percent per annum, not compounded” to “the amount of compensatory damages” already awarded. Proper grammatical construction would require that the phrase “ten (10) percent per annum” can only refer back to “the amount of compensatory damages,” the award which the rule is explicitly intended to affect. Since Rule 238 provides for an increase in the amount of compensatory damages through the use of a percentage formula, common usage indicates that the in<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>crease intended is a percentage of the compensatory damage award. Thus, the enhancement of the amount of compensatory damages mandated by Rule 238 is accomplished by simply multiplying that figure by ten percent for each year of “delay” or portion thereof.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Restated, the damage for delay is to be computed in the form of simple interest on the amount of compensatory damages at an annual rate of ten percent.</p>

Appellants argue that the unavailability of delay damages on punitive damage awards will eliminate the motivation of defendants to settle in all cases in which punitive damages are sought. This argument is wholly unpersuasive. We reject the contention that the exclusion of delay damages on punitive damage awards will negate the motivation to settle created by Rule 238’s provision for delay damages on awards for compensatory damages. It would be contrary to reason to conclude that a defendant exposed to potential punitive damages in addition to compensatory and delay damages will be less motivated to settle a case than a defendant who is not faced with the prospect of punitive <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>damages. Punitive damages, like damages for delay, involve an award in <em>excess </em>of actual damages. It is this exposure to additional financial liability which creates the incentive to settle. A demand for punitive damages thus generates its own motivation. The augmentation of punitive damage awards with delay damages would not only be improper but also, in our view, unnecessary to accomplish the salutary purposes of Rule 238.</p>
