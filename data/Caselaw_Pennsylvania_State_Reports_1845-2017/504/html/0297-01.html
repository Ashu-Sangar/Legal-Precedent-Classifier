On direct appeal, appellees <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>argued, and Superior Court agreed, that an inference of other criminal activity was improperly raised at trial and that the trial court’s refusal to grant a mistrial was error. Thus, a three judge panel of Superior Court, <a href="/pa-super/311/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="311 Pa.

Apparently, however, the police were aware that at least one of the appellees had been involved in other burglaries where human defecation was found at the scene, for twice during the trial, as discussed, <em>infra, </em>officers’ testimony indicated the police made a logical connection between the presence of human feces at the scene of a burglary and appellees’ criminal activities. It is the evidence of this apparent logical connection which forms the basis for appellees’ complaint.</p>

    <p id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[200,491,1139,743]]]'>Appellees and Superior Court placed great weight on the fact the witness was a police officer, called by the Commonwealth, and, therefore, presumably appreciative of the inadmissible character of evidence of other crimes. However, it is noteworthy that Chief Conklin supplied the objected to answer only after an extended and persistent line of questioning by defense counsel, which was clearly designed to prove there was no physical evidence at the scene to connect appellees with the crime. A fair reading of the record indicates that Chief Conklin was duly reluctant to supply evidence of other crimes, and that he was compelled to do so by a relentless line of cross-examination. Under these circumstances, admission of the evidence cannot justify grant of a new trial.</p>

      <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>Although the question propounded by the prosecutor clearly sought an inadmissible response, inasmuch as the answer was interrupted no express reference to other criminal activity was made.

Thus, the motion for a mistrial was addressed to the discretion of the trial court to determine whether the accused was prejudiced by the objectionable comment. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Gardner, </em><a href="/pa/490/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="490 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1763834" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0421-01">490 Pa. 421</a>, 426, <a href="/pa/490/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="490 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1763834" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0421-01">416 A.2d 1007</a>, 1009 (1980). The trial court noted that the objectionable testimony was “very brief and very generalized in that it did not specifically link either defendant to the defecation trait.” Thus, the prejudicial impact, if any, as to either appellee was minimal.</p>
