        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThe appellant, Leslie C.X. Beasley, was convicted of murder of the first degree, and sentenced to death, in connection with an incident in 1980 in which a police officer was shot to death at a restaurant in Philadelphia. The officer had gone to the restaurant in response to a radio dispatch alerting him that a man with a gun was present there. Upon arriving at the restaurant, the officer was fatally wounded by the appellant. Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(h), we are called upon to review the record for errors at trial, and to determine whether the sentence of death should be affirmed or vacated.\nI. TRIAL ERRORS\nAppellant\u2019s primary allegation is that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial when the prosecutor, during cross-examination of the only fact witness presented by the defense, discredited the veracity of the witness. Examination of the circumstances under which the discrediting comments were made, however, reveals that the comments did not warrant the grant of a new trial.\nThe witness in question testified that on the night of the shooting, he, appellant, and another man named \u201cChurch\u201d were present at the restaurant, and that it was \u201cChurch\u201d rather than appellant who shot the police officer. On cross-examination, the witness testified that after the shooting incident he went to Georgia, where he was convicted for committing a series of robberies, for which he was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. The following exchange then occurred.\nPROSECUTOR: And that was the one for which you were sentenced for 20 years?\nWITNESS: That\u2019s the one that you told me that if I would testify against Mr. Beasley that you would help me out on the 20 years and I told you I wasn\u2019t going to do that.\nPROSECUTOR: You\u2019re talking to me?\nWITNESS: Yes.\nPROSECUTOR: You say that I said that, sir?\nWITNESS: Yes, sir.\nPROSECUTOR: [Y]ou know that very well is an outright lie.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: I object to [the prosecutor\u2019s] statement, testimony, and I move for a mistrial ... you have intentional prosecutorial misconduct.\nTHE COURT: Just a minute.\nPROSECUTOR: Because I never talked to you.\nTHE COURT: [Prosecutor], just a minute. Please, sit down, and control yourself, will you?\nYou will disregard the [prosecutor\u2019s] last statement. Motion for mistrial is denied.\nNow, calm down.\nPROSECUTOR: [W]hen have I talked to you? Mention one? When did I speak to you? When did I ever speak to you?\nWITNESS: You spoke to me quite a few times.\nPROSECUTOR: How many times____?\nWITNESS: Well, you was upstairs one day talking to me about helping me out with the 20 years if I said Mr. Beasley killed the police officer. The same when you were talking to other people that was there.\nPROSECUTOR: Pm talking about how many times \u2014 You say that was one time I came to you? Was I alone or with someone else?\nWITNESS: You were by yourself.\nPROSECUTOR: No one else that you can bring? Do you want me out of this case; is that what you\u2019re trying to do?\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: I object to that statement and I move for a mistrial.\nPROSECUTOR: Your honor, I will state this as an absolute fact. I have never seen him before. I\u2019ve never seen this man before.\nTHE COURT: Just a minute. All right. Just a minute.\nPROSECUTOR: Except at the preliminary hearing.\nTHE COURT: Just a minute. Now, please. Gentlemen, will you shut-up a minute? Will you? Please. Now, everybody sit down and keep quiet. Please. This is not a circus. Gentlemen, there are ways of doing this and let\u2019s do it the proper way. I don\u2019t like to be angry.\nPROSECUTOR: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: (To the witness) You just answer questions.\nTHE COURT: (To the [prosecutor]) You just ask questions. No side comments, okay?\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor\u2014\nTHE COURT: The motion for a mistrial is denied. The jury will disregard all of the last outburst.\nPROSECUTOR: How was I going to do that?\nWITNESS: You told me you had connections with the D.A.\u2019s office down there and you could possibly give\u2014 you know, get me a lesser sentence if I would help you out. And I told you I wasn\u2019t going to lie.\nPROSECUTOR: And you\u2019re going to \u2014 you\u2019re saying that with a straight face, aren\u2019t you?\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: I object to the comments, Judge. [Defense counsel did not, in response to this last prosecutorial comment, make another motion for a mistrial.]\nClearly, as a general rule, it is improper for a prosecutor to express his personal belief as to the credibility of a witness. Commonwealth v. Kuebler, 484 Pa. 358, 363-364, 399 A.2d 116, 118-119 (1979); Commonwealth v. Potter, 445 Pa. 284, 286-287, 285 A.2d 492, 493 (1971). Not every unwise or unwarranted remark made by counsel during the course of a trial, however, warrants the grant of a new trial. Commonwealth v. Stoltzfus, 462 Pa. 43, 61, 337 A.2d 873, 882 (1975); Commonwealth v. Goosby, 450 Pa. 609, 611, 301 A.2d 673, 674 (1973). It is axiomatic that \u201ccomments by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney do not constitute reversible error unless the \u2018unavoidable effect of such comments would be to prejudice the jury, forming in their minds fixed bias and hostility toward the defendant so that they could not weigh the evidence objectively and render a true verdict.\u2019 Commonwealth v. Van Cliff, 483 Pa. 576, 582, 397 A.2d 1173, 1176 (1979) (citations omitted).\u201d Commonwealth v. Anderson, 501 Pa. 275, 461 A.2d 208, 211 (1983). Viewed in context, the instant prosecutorial comments could not have so prejudiced the jury as to have interfered with attainment of a true verdict.\nThe witness\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor had offered him a deal in exchange for testimony against appellant was not responsive to any question posed by the prosecutor. The testimony was, in fact, a direct attack upon the integrity of the prosecutor which produced an emotional reaction, consisting of a denial of the witness\u2019s accusation, under circumstances where the prosecutor would no doubt have felt that remaining silent in the face of such an accusation would be construed by the jury as an admission of its truth.\nOf great significance is the fact that the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not relate to the substance of the witness\u2019s primary testimony, namely the witness\u2019s assertion that \u201cChurch\u201d, rather than appellant, shot the police officer. Hence, the prosecutor\u2019s comments related solely to the witness\u2019s veracity as to a purely collateral matter, i.e., the prosecutor\u2019s prior communications with the witness.\nThe risk of prejudice was further vitiated by the trial court\u2019s prompt responses, whereby the court on two occasions during cross-examination of the witness instructed the jury to disregard the comments in question. Commonwealth v. Brightwell, 479 Pa. 541, 545, 388 A.2d 1063, 1065 (1978) (improper prosecutorial questions cured by prompt cautionary instruction); Commonwealth v. Martinolich, 456 Pa. 136, 149, 318 A.2d 680, 687-688 (1974) (prompt instruction cured improper remark of prosecutor). The following day, the court consulted with counsel about this matter to determine whether additional cautionary instructions were desired. Defense counsel objected to any further instructions being given at that time, but suggested that the matter could be addressed in final instructions. Accordingly, during final instructions, the court cautioned the jury as follows:\nIt is part of the function of the jury to decide the credibility of the witnesses. You are the triers of the facts. No one, including the attorneys and myself as judge, have a right to usurp your authority to determine credibility of witnesses that you have seen as to who is or who is not telling the truth.\nIf you find that anyone has given his personal views as to the truth or falsehood of any witnesses, you\u2019re not to be influenced by his personal viewpoint.\nIn addition, the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks should be evaluated within the context of the entire trial. See Commonwealth v. Byrd, 490 Pa. 544, 559, 417 A.2d 173, 181 (1980). The instant exchange between prosecutor and defense witness was an isolated incident in the course of a trial which spanned nearly seven days, and no further mention of the exchange occurred during the remainder of the trial. More significant, however, is the fact that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence against appellant was so overwhelming, and the testimony of the defense fact witness in question so weak, that the impact of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was necessarily de minimis. Cf. Commonwealth v. Norris, 498 Pa. 308, 317-318, 446 A.2d 246, 250-251 (1982); Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 410, 383 A.2d 155, 164-165 (1978).\nThe Commonwealth presented the testimony of three eyewitnesses who saw appellant shoot the police officer. In addition, appellant\u2019s possession of the murder weapon just moments before the shooting was established, as were his flight after the shooting and possession of and attempt to discard the murder weapon at the end of that flight.\nThe testimony of the defense fact witness in question, however, cannot be regarded as having been of significant, or perhaps any, value to the defense, and this fact would remain unchanged even if the comments of the prosecutor had not been made. In his testimony, the witness admitted to having been convicted of a number of crimes in the past, including a series of robberies in Georgia for which he was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. Further, he admitted to having taken narcotics just prior to the shooting incident. His testimony that \u201cChurch,\u201d rather than appellant, committed the shooting was impeached with a statement he gave to police on the night of the crime in which he denied seeing who shot the police officer. Incredibly, however, the witness testified that the statement was entirely fabricated by the police, except for one sentence. That sentence was one in which the witness concededly told the police, \u201cI don\u2019t like cops, ... I told him [the fatally wounded officer], mother fucker, I hope you die.\u201d\nThus, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks having been confined to a collateral issue, rather than being directed at the substance of the witness\u2019s primary testimony, and the risk of prejudice having been countered by prompt cautionary instructions to the jury, and the Commonwealth\u2019s case having been of overwhelming strength while the witness in question\u2019s testimony was of little value to the defense, we believe that the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial was not error.\nAppellant\u2019s second contention is that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor allegedly made use of leading questions on thirty-two occasions while conducting direct examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, and that the prosecutor repeated, on eight occasions, small portions of testimony while phrasing questions during direct examination. Nevertheless, the extent to which a court tolerates leading questions, or suggests how questions asked by counsel should be rephrased, are matters within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Jones, 487 Pa. 183, 185, 409 A.2d 25, 26-27 (1979); Commonwealth v. Gockley, 411 Pa. 437, 455, 192 A.2d 693, 702 (1963). We have examined the record, but find no pattern of abuse in the phraseology of the prosecutor\u2019s questions to witnesses. In fact, most of defense counsel\u2019s objections to supposedly leading questions were overruled, and appellant has offered no argument as to why those rulings might be erroneous. Appellant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s style of phrasing questions, and no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion is perceived.\nThe third claim of error raised by appellant is that the prosecutor made improper comments during opening and closing arguments, such comments being directed at what appellant may have been thinking during and immediately after commission of the crime. It is well established, however, that a prosecutor may argue all reasonable inferences that may be derived from the evidence. Commonwealth v. Glass, 486 Pa. 334, 345, 405 A.2d 1236, 1241 (1979); Commonwealth v. Lipscomb, 455 Pa. 525, 529 n. 3, 317 A.2d 205, 207 n. 3 (1974). Examination of the challenged remarks reveals that they contained only legitimate inferences as to appellant\u2019s motives for committing the shooting and for fleeing from the crime scene.\nThus, in his opening argument, while discussing evidence to be presented regarding events leading up to the shooting, the prosecutor inferred the following about appellant\u2019s state of'mind:\n\u201c[T]his defendant knows that he\u2019s in big trouble if he\u2019s caught with a gun ... He then reaches for the gun and being worried about being caught with that ... He did know that he did threaten [a patron of the restaurant] ... All he knows is a police officer shortly thereafter is coming towards him ... [H]e pulls out the weapon ... And he. holds that weapon steadily and fires.\u201d\nClearly, this statement was proper, for the prosecutor merely asserted that the motive for the shooting was appellant\u2019s desire not to be discovered with a gun in his possession. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence did supply the basis upon which this argument was founded, for it demonstrated that appellant was in possession of a gun when approached by the police officer at the restaurant, that appellant had previously threatened a patron, and that, when approached, appellant fatally shot the police officer.\nAppellant next cites a portion of the opening statement in which, after describing the shooting incident and appellant\u2019s desire not to be arrested, the prosecutor stated, \u201cBeasley then decides that he\u2019s got to go.\u201d Here, the prosecutor simply stated the obvious fact that, after the shooting, appellant made a decision to flee. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed that appellant did in fact flee immediately after the shooting, and, hence, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was beyond reproach.\nIn his closing argument, the prosecutor argued as follows to advance an explanation as to why appellant did not shoot at an additional police officer who pursued him for purposes of arrest after the shooting incident, \u201cHe didn\u2019t shoot him because the weapon was empty ... He didn\u2019t shoot him because he saw it was empty at the time____\u201d We reject the assertion that this statement constituted unfounded speculation as to appellant\u2019s thought processes, for it is plainly a legitimate inference as to appellant\u2019s motive for conducting his flight in the manner shown by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The evidence indeed established that appellant\u2019s gun contained, at the relevant time during flight, no more live ammunition; only spent shell casings then remained.\nThe next portion of the closing argument alleged to have been prejudicial was that in which, during a discussion of appellant\u2019s abandonment of weapons at the end of his flight, the prosecutor inferred that appellant\u2019s actions were attributable to consciousness of guilt, stating, \u201cAnd from that moment, what\u2019s in his mind? This is an individual who knows that the shooting has just occurred. That he has done it. That he is being pursued and they\u2019re up to him. What is he going to do? Get rid of the weapons.\u201d Again, appellant\u2019s flight and abandonment of the weapons were firmly established by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, and this portion of the closing argument merely advanced a reasonable inference as to appellant\u2019s motive for abandoning his guns.\nThe final portion of the closing remarks challenged by appellant is that in which the prosecutor inferred that a glove had been discarded by appellant in the back of a police van after the arrest because the glove was one that, had appellant had time to don it prior to shooting a weapon, he would have worn as protection for his hand. The glove was established by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence to have been seen in appellant\u2019s rear pocket at the time of arrest, and was later found hidden underneath the seat of the van in which appellant was transported to the police station. Inasmuch as the arrest occurred on a night in the month of July, when appellant would not have been carrying a glove as a precaution against inclement weather, the prosecutor\u2019s inference as to the purpose of the glove was not unreasonable. In summary, therefore, we find no merit in any of appellant\u2019s allegations that opening and closing remarks by the prosecutor exceeded permissible bounds of argument.\nII. DEATH PENALTY\nAppellant raises a number of constitutional challenges to the death penalty statute, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711, including assertions that the statute unconstitutionally 1.) restricts the mitigating circumstances that a jury may consider in determining whether a sentence of death is mandated, 2.) places upon the defendant the burden of proving mitigating circumstances, 3.) fails to provide an express standard to be applied in weighing mitigating factors against aggravating factors, and 4.) imposes a cruel punishment prohibited by Article I, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. These assertions do not warrant further discussion, for each has recently been considered and rejected by this Court in Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 454 A.2d 937, 958-969 (1982), cert. den. \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983).\nAppellant further contends that certain language employed in the statute\u2019s enumeration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, to be weighed by the jury in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed, are so vague as to invite arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty. The challenged language includes, inter alia, the phrases \u201csignificant history of prior criminal convictions\u201d (42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(e)(1)), \u201cextreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d (42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(e)(2)), \u201cage of the defendant\u201d (42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(e)(4)), \u201cparticipation in the homicidal act was relatively minor\u201d (42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(e)(7)), \u201ccapacity of the defendant ... to conform his conduct to the requirements of law____\u201d (42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(e)(3)). In reviewing an identical claim of vagueness asserted against the corresponding portion of the death penalty statute of the State of Florida, which employed virtually identical language, the Supreme Court of the United States rejected the vagueness claim, noting that a jury\u2019s evaluation of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as enumerated, requires no more line drawing than is commonly required of a factfinder in any lawsuit. Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242, 257, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 2969, 49 L.Ed.2d 913, 925-926 (1976). We agree.\nIt is next alleged that the death penalty statute is unconstitutionally applied where the trial court charges the jury on voluntary manslaughter when there is no evidence that would support such a verdict. This contention is without merit. Commonwealth v. Frey, 504 Pa. 428, 475 A.2d 700 (1984).\nAppellant next asserts that the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury on the death penalty was incomplete and unclear in that it did not instruct as to which aggravating and mitigating circumstances were to be considered in this case, and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an adequate charge. Examination of the record reveals, however, that the trial court read to the jury the entire statutory list of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d), (e). Although the court did not elaborate as to which of the ones listed might apply in this case, we do not believe the jury could have been confused by the mere fact that the listing of such circumstances was, therefore, more extensive than was necessary. In connection with this claim, appellant argues that there is no record of what circumstances the jury found, and, thus, that there can be no meaningful review of whether the jury understood the instruction. This contention is plainly erroneous. The record does contain a verdict sheet upon which the jury clearly indicated that it found two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. Such findings are supported by the evidence, and demonstrate the jury\u2019s clear understanding of the instruction in question. Since the instruction was in fact adequate, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to request an adequate charge.\nOne of the aggravating circumstances found by the jury was that the victim was a peace officer who was killed in the performance of his duties, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(1). Appellant concedes that this was proved at trial beyond a reasonable doubt, as is the requisite burden of proof upon the Commonwealth when establishing the existence of aggravating circumstances, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iii). Nevertheless, appellant asserts that the verdict of death was not adequately supported by the evidence. The death penalty statute provides that if the jury finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances, then the verdict must be death. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv). Because the jury found at least one proper aggravating circumstance, viz. the killing of an on-duty police officer, and no mitigating circumstances, appellant\u2019s sentence of death was not only supported by the evidence, but was required.\nThis Court has recognized a duty to conduct a proportionality review in cases where a death sentence has been imposed, to determine whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the circumstances, taking into account all similar cases, and considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant. Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. at 62-63, 454 A.2d at 961; Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 502 Pa. 474, 467 A.2d 288 (1983). In a case such as the present one, where there is no evidence of mitigating circumstances but there is present the aggravating circumstance of. the victim having been a police officer, the death penalty is not imposed as a result of the jury\u2019s weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Rather, the jury has no discretion as to the sentence, for the verdict of death is required, and, thus, all similarly situated defendants should, of necessity, receive the same sentence. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv). We have reviewed the Pennsylvania Death Penalty Study conducted by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts and find, based upon the available data, no conviction in which the death penalty was not sought and obtained by the prosecution where there were present the same aggravating circumstances, and lack of any mitigating circumstances, as in the present case. Appellant\u2019s sentence, therefore, is not disportionate to those of other similarly situated defendants.\nThe final contention of trial court error is that the presentation of certain evidence of mitigating circumstances was improperly restricted when there was sustained a prosecutorial objection to one question posed to a defense witness at the penalty proceeding. The sole witness offered by the defense at the penalty proceeding was appellant\u2019s mother, Ethel Beasley. Mrs. Beasley testified that appellant was, at the time of trial, twenty-nine years old, and that at an unspecified time in the past he had received treatment at a psychiatric hospital. Counsel then asked Mrs. Beasley why appellant received treatment, whereupon an objection by the prosecutor was sustained. After a sidebar conference, however, Mrs. Beasley was permitted to testify, without objection, that appellant received treatment because he drank excessively, to the point of blacking out. Defense counsel then asked the following question: \u201cAnd when he blacked out, sometimes he wouldn\u2019t know what happened for days at a time?\u201d Mrs. Beasley answered with a \u201cno,\u201d but the prosecutor objected, and the objection was sustained. The Commonwealth contends that this question was properly excluded, taking the position that the question was leading, that it called for an answer that could have been based only on hearsay, and that the question was proper only for a medical expert to answer.\nNevertheless, on cross-examination, Mrs. Beasley admitted that the treatment in question had been administered to appellant twelve years before, in 1969, when appellant would have been only seventeen years of age. We do not regard the excluded testimony, which related only to the duration of childhood alcoholic blackouts suffered by appellant so many years previous, as having been evidence of mitigation relevant to the present offense. Appellant was not, therefore, denied the opportunity to present evidence of mitigation.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS, Former Chief Justice, did not participate in the decision of this case.\nNIX, C.J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. In accordance with our duty under 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(h), we have examined the trial record for errors in addition to those alleged by appellant, but none have come to our attention that could warrant relief.\n. Viewing the evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, Commonwealth v. Keblitis, 500 Pa. 321, 456 A.2d 149, 150 (1983), we find this evidence more than ample to sustain the jury's verdict of guilt.\n. We note that the jury also found that a second aggravating circumstance was present, namely that appellant \"has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(9), based upon the fact that appellant concededly was convicted of murder once before, in 1972, for having shot to death a man in New Jersey. The presence of, and correctness of, a jury\u2019s finding of a second aggravating circumstance is not relevant in a case such as this where there have been found no mitigating circumstances, since one aggravating circumstance alone requires a verdict of death.\n. The Pennsylvania Death Penalty Study reviewed the sentences sought and obtained in all convictions for murder of the first degree between the effective date of the relevant sentencing procedures, September 13, 1978, and February, 1984. See Commonwealth v. Frey, 504 Pa. 428, 475 A.2d 700 (1984).",
