    <p class="summary" id="b537-4" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[148,664,1149,923]]]'>The defendant has capital stock of $2,000,000. By its charter the dividends on its capital stock are limited to seven per cent, per annum. The premiums upon the ordinary life policies are payable annually, semi-annually or quarterly, and the premiums upon the industrial policies, which are for smaller sums, are payable weekly. The policies are classified as participating and nonparticipating. In fixing its premium rates the company allows a margin of safety and the premiums named in the policies are generally higher than necessary to carry the risks. This leads to the accumulation of a surplus “arising out of excess or overpayment of premiums by the policyholders in the early years of their policies.” The company makes periodical allotments of accumulated surplus to the credit of policyholders, calling the same bonuses when the policies are nonparticipating and dividends when the policies are participating.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b538-6" data-blocks='[["BL_538.7",538,[712,1051,221,25]]]'>DISCUSSION.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b538-7" data-blocks='[["BL_538.8",538,[249,1153,1147,699]]]'>The taxing statute is the Act of June 1, 1911, P. L. 607, which provides in Section 16, page 616, as follows: “Every insurance company or association of another state or foreign government authorized to do business in this Commonwealth shall make report to the insurance commissioner on or before March first of each year, under oath of its president or secretary, showing the entire amount of premiums of every character and description received from business transacted in the Commonwealth during the year or fraction of year ending with the thirty-first day of December preceding, whether said premiums were received in money or in the form of notes, credits or any other substitute for money.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b538-8" data-blocks='[["BL_538.9",538,[248,1862,1144,537]],["BL_539.1",539,[131,351,1154,924]]]'>The tax is imposed upon the entire amount of pre* miums of every character and description “received in money or in the form of notes, credits or any other substitute for money.” The defendant company contends that the statute does not impose any tax upon the allowances and allotments to policyholders in reduction of their premiums. The tax is imposed only upon premiums received in money, notes, credits or other substitute for money. These allotments and allowances were not received by the company at all. Because of excess <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>premiums previously paid by policyholders the company relieved the policyholders from payment to the extent of such excess premiums so paid, with the result that the company did not receive this sum either in money, by note, credit or other substitute for money. . These allotments and allowances do not appear to be covered by the language of the taxing statute, which must be strictly construed. We have just considered, this subject at length in our opinion filed in the case of Commonwealth v. Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company, 18 Dauphin 206, and refer to the discussion and authorities cited therein in support of the conclusion we shall announce here. In addition to the authorities cited in our opinion just referred to, we may cite the case of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company v. Herold, 198 Fed. Repr. 199 (affirmed in 201 Fed. Repr. 918) in which case Judge Cross thus discusses and decides the question raised here:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b539-3" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[134,1285,1151,688]]]'>“It appears that what the company received in cash and all that it so receives where the dividend is applied in abatement of renewal premiums, is the difference between the stipulated premium and the so-called dividend. In such cases the dividends are not sums paid to the policyholders and by him returned in cash. They are not income received. The policyholder has not paid the premium stipulated in his policy, but a premium reduced by his share of a fund as ascertained by the directors composed of excess premiums. This seems to be the view which has been uniformly taken by the courts in so far as their decisions have been brought to my attention.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b539-4" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[135,1995,1150,255]]]'>We are of opinion that the allotments and allowances here deducted from the amount of premiums fixed in the policies are not money received by the company either in cash, by notes or credits, and that the same is not liable to taxation under our statute.</p>

An annuity is generally understood as an agreement to pay a specified sum to the annuitant annually during life. The consideration for an insurance contract is generally spoken of as a premium, which is payable annually, semiannually, monthly or weekly. The consideration for an annuity contract is not generally regarded as a premium and is usually covered by a single payment. The power to make insurance contracts and to grant annuities seems to be recognized as entirely distinct in the Pennsylvania statute providing for incorporation of insurance companies. Our Act of July 9, 1897, P. L. 239 (2 Purdon 1941) provides that, “Any ten or more persons, citizens <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>of this Commonwealth, may associate......and form an incorporation for any of the following purposes, to wit:</p>
