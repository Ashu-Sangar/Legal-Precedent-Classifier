Alexander Stewart Wetherill, under the devise in the will of John M. Wetherill, was not seized of a fee in the Lower Providence premises, and, therefore, Isabella M. Lefferts did not inherit this property as his heir and next of kin. 2. Henry E. Wetherill, the oldest nephew of the testator of the family name of Wetherill, living at the death of Alexander Stewart Wetherill, took a life estate in the said property situate in Lower Providence Township, upon the death of the said Alexander. The devise over, if the said Alexander should die without a son surviving, is limited to the oldest nephew living at Alexander’s death, and does not embrace the whole series of nephews. There is no intent found in the will that the oldest in succession, after Henry’s death, without a son, should take a life estate in the property. 3. The fee in remainder, after the death of Henry E. Wetherill, cannot vest in his oldest son nor in the right heirs of the said nephew. It is a limitation too remote, because it may not take effect within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years thereafter. 4. The void ulterior devises of the fee in remainder, after the death of Henry E. Wetherill, do not destroy or invalidate the prior life estate given to him. 5. The remainder devised after the life estate to Henry E. Wetherill being in violation of <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>the rules against perpetuities is void. 6. This remainder does not pass into the residue which the testator divides and distributes, under the fourth clause of his will. The Lower Providence property was itself a part of the rest, residue and remainder devised by the testator. It was part of the residue of the testator’s estate which he distributed by the third clause of the will at the same time that he divided the balance of the said residue under the fourth clause of his will, to wit: at the death of his sister, Rachel.”</p>

Lefferts, the sole heir and next of kin of Alexander Stewart Wetherill, and the heirs at law and residuary devisees of John M. Wetherill, the testator, is what he calls in his will his “real estate in Lower Providence Township, Montgomery County.” Mrs. Lefferts contends that Alexander Stewart Wetherill took a fee in the said real estate under the third clause of his uncle’s will, and, having died intestate, the same descended to her as his only heir. The devise of the real estate to Alexander Stewart Wetherill was “for and during the term of his natural life with remainder in fee to his eldest son and his heirs.” The remainder was given to the eldest son of the nephew Alexander, and to the heirs of that son. The inheritance in remainder was not to the heirs of the devisee for life as heirs, and the rule in Shelley’s Case is without application: Guthrie’s App., <a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>. The word “son” is primarily a word of purchase, and, there being nothing in the context of the will of the testator indicating any intention on his part to use it as a word of limitation, the correct conclusion of the learned court below was that Alexander Stewart Wetherill took but a life estate in the property: Stout v. Good, <a href="/pa/245/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="245 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="326013" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0383-01">245 Pa. 383</a>.

The Act of June 4, 1879, P. L. 88, provides that, “unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will, such real estate or interest therein as shall be comprised or intended to be comprised in any devise in such will contained, which shall fail or be void by reason of the death of the devisee in the lifetime of the testator, or by reason of such devise being contrary to law or otherwise incapable of taking effect, shall be included in the residuary devise, if any, contained in such will.”</p>

This view was not sustained by the learned court below, and we cannot regard it as correct. It is conceded that if the fourth clause of the will is not the residuary clause, the said devise passes to the testator’s heirs at law. By the third clause of his will he disposes of a part of his re.siduary estate, and by the fourth he gives, upon the death of his sister, Mrs. Hewson, to a designated class what he had not specifically devised in the preceding clause. A specific devise in the third clause is of the real estate in controversy. At the time fixed by the testator in the fourth clause for the distribution of the remainder of his residuary estate his real estate in Lower Providence Township, Montgomery County, constituting a part of his residuary estate specifically devised by the third clause, was to pass to a named nephew, if living for life, with remainder to his eldest son; and if such nephew should have died without issue, then to another nephew, with remainder over. What, then, was the manifest intention of the testator as to what should pass under the fourth clause of his will? He clearly in<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>tended that his brothers and sisters living at the time of Mrs. Hewson’s death should take, at the time fixed by him for the final distribution of his estate, what was left after the provisions of the third clause of his will had been carried out, and nothing more. He manifestly did not intend that what he had directed Francis I). Wetherill, as trustee, to convey to his nephew, Alexander Stewárt Wetherill, upon the death of Mrs. Hewson, should ever become a part of his residuary estate, disposed of by the fourth clause of his will. Nothing was given by it to the brothers and sisters except what was distributable upon the death of Mrs. Hewson, and this could not have included the land in controversy. In view of the clear intention of the testator, as gathered from the third and fourth clauses of his will, the contention of' the residuary devisees, that they take the testator’s farm in Lower Providence Township, Montgomery County, under the fourth clause of the will, cannot be sustained. Aside from the testator’s intention, the void devise having formed a part of his residuary estate, disposed of by the third and fourth clauses of the will, would not fall back into that estate: Gray’s Est., <a href="/pa/147/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="147 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="829776" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0067-01">147 Pa. 67</a>; Wain’s Est., <a href="/pa/156/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="156 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="844935" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0194-01">156 Pa. 194</a>.</p>
