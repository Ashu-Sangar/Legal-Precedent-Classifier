The gift is an absolute one: “May to get one thousand dollars out of My estateand the direction to withhold the payment until such time as she is likely to make proper use of the money is an attempt to circumvent the rule of public policy forbidding restraint in the use or disposition of property in which no one but the beneficiary has an interest : Shallcross’s Est., <a href="/pa/200/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="200 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="924420" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0122-01">200 Pa. 122</a>.</p>

The word “wen” in the testator’s vernacular means “if,” and he manifestly intended that if the appellant should marry in his lifetime she should get from his estate, if he failed to give it to her, what she is now claiming. No other conclusion could have been reached by the learned court lie-low, and its decree is affirmed, with costs to the appellees, on its opinion denying appellant’s petition for an “outfit.”</p>
