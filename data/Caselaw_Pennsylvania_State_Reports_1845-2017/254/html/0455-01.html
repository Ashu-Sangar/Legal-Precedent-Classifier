The executors of the attorney deposited with a bank certain bonds in pursuance of an agreement reciting the desire of the executor to make restitution and setting forth that such bonds were “to be held for said (substituted) trustee as security for the forthcoming of the principal fund upon settlement of the estate.”......Thereafter the amount due from the attorney’s estate to the trust estate was ascertained by the court and paid in full. Subsequently the executor petitioned the Orphans’ Court for a return of the bonds; but it was contended by persons interested in the trust estate that the bonds had become part thereof by such deposit and that the bank held such bonds as trustee ex maleficio. <em>Held, </em>the court properly awarded the bonds to the executors of the attorney.</p>

Sturdevant was appointed trustee in the estate of Charles Streator, deceased, in 1885, and died in 1909. His administrator was cited to file an account for the deceased trustee, which he did in 1911. To this account exceptions were filed by certain Streator heirs and were to the effect that the trustee had received certain assets not accounted for, and that all the assets of the trust estate had been misappropriated by W. P. Ryman in his lifetime, except $175. While the depositions were being taken, the executors of W. P. Ryman, deceased, came in and intervened and thereafter participated in all the proceedings. The exceptions to the trustee’s account were sustained as against the accountant and a surcharge of $4,494.21 was entered, and the account as amended and restated by the court was confirmed absolutely. The court at the same time found that the Ryman executors, interveners, were indebted to the trustee for the use of the life tenant in the sum of $229.35, and to the Streator heirs in the sum of $10,531.75. From these findings two of the Streator heirs appealed, and in Streator’s Est., <a href="/pa/241/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="241 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="976084" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0142-01">241 Pa. 142</a>, the appeals were dismissed. Later the Ryman executors paid into court the amounts above stated, which had been found due the Streator estate from the Ryman estate, with interest. The first and final account of the deceased trustee was duly audited in 1915, and at the said audit the counsel for .the Streator heirs stated that as the fund arose from two separate sources, a real estate fund and a personal property fund, there should be separate distributions of the two funds, <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>because the real estate fund was all in court. The audit was closed and in making distribution the request was followed. All the Streator heirs, including J. S. Pettebone, guardian of Milton B. Streator, respondent herein, by the hand of their counsel, receipted upon the docket for their respective distributive shares. The fund so distributed was paid into court by the Ryman executors, and the trustee’s estate is unable to pay the balance of the amount found due from the trustee upon settlement of his account. The Streator heirs and the surety of the trustee hope to collect this balance of $4,844.50, with interest from June 19,1911, through the agreement quoted above in full. There is at present no trustee in the Streator estate, for the trust has terminated, and there is no administrator d. b. n. c. t. a., and we think none is required.</p>

This course was departed from when the executors of the Ryman estate came in and intervened in the hearing of exceptions to the final account of the trustee in the Streator estate. The said account was regularly advertised and, hence every person who was interested in the fund had notice. It being a final account any omission of assets was the proper subject of exceptions. It was maintained by ex-ceptants that Ryman had illegally absorbed assets of the trust éstate, and Ryman’s executors came in and asked to be made parties: Watts’ Est., <a href="/pa/158/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="158 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="848178" data-case-paths="/pa/158/0001-01">158 Pa. 1</a>. The court, therefore, had jurisdiction of the subject-matter, the trustee’s administrator, the Streator heirs and the Ryman executors, who were all the parties in interest. In disposing of the exceptions we found that Ryman had taken from the trustee the sum of $229.35 belonging to the life tenant and the principal sum of $10,531.75 belonging to the Streator heirs. These sums, with interest, the executors paid into court, and thus pro tanto re<a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>duced the balance found due from the trustee’s administrator. The court sustained the exceptions to the trustee’s account and surcharged the trustee with assets not accounted <em>for; </em>but refused to find that Ryman had received these assets except to the extent stated. The failure of the court to find that Ryman had appropriated other assets of the Streator estate which the trustee had received, was expressly assigned as error in the Streator Est., <a href="/pa/241/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="241 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="976084" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0142-01">241 Pa. 142</a>.</p>

In the Streator estate the final account has been confirmed and the audit closed and all the heirs have accepted partial distribution of the money paid in by the Ryman executors. The account could now be reopened only by petition for review and no cause has been shown which would warrant the court in allowing it: Hawkins’ O. C. Practice, paragraph 190. If the bonds deposited by the executor thereby became the property of the trustee, and we do not think they did, then the Streator heirs should have excepted to their omission from the trustee’s final account, which they did not do,, although they knew of the agreement. The Streator heirs have had their day in court and all their rights under the agreement have been adjudicated and they have accepted the fruits of that adjudication.

    <p id="b490-7" data-blocks='[["BL_490.8",490,[252,619,1143,908]]]'>The bonds which the court below ordered the Miners’ Bank of Wilkes-Barre to turn over to the executor of W. P. Ryman, deceased, were deposited with it by him to secure the payment of a claim made by the Streator estate against the Ryman estate. The amount found by the court below to be due to the former by the latter has been paid by Ryman’s executor, and accepted by the Streator heirs, this appellant having, through his attorney, receipted for the share of his ward. The bonds deposited with the bank for a special purpose never belonged to the Streator estate, and those interested in it do not now have the shadow of a claim upon them as security for what may be due from the estate of S. B. Sturdevant, the deceased insolvent trustee. The bank is not complaining of the decree, and, as it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant to complain of it, his appeal is dismissed at his costs.</p>
