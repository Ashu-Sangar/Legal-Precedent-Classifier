Certain funds were deposited in bank by a husband to the order of himself or wife and certificates of deposit were issued. The husband died, having appointed his wife and another person executors of his estate. In the account of the executors of the husband’s estate, the deposits were included as an asset without objection on the part of the widow; the widow had signed the account but it had been prepared by her coexecutor; she was aged and infirm and had possession of the deposit certificates, which she treated as her own. Upon petition of the executor of the wife’s estate, the Orphans’ Court struck from the account of the executors of the husband’s estate the amount of the joint deposit. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

During the preceding year he had made eleven separate deposits of money in the Citizens’ National Bank of Connellsville, Pa., taking in each case a certificate of deposit, some of which were made “payable to the order of himself or wife” and the balance “payable to the order of William Sloan or wife”; which certificates, amounting in all to $5,319.33, were so held at his death. His widow and John Risdon were appointed and qualified as executors. She was sixty-seven years old and in poor health, in fact she was qualified as such executor at her residence, and Mr. Risden took active charge of the settlement of the estate. An inventory was made in which she appears to have taken no part, and wherein ten of said certificates, amounting to $4,999.33, were inventoried as “Cash in Bank (Cit. Nat. Connellsville) $4,999.33.”</p>
    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[255,1222,1147,959]]]'>She removed to Allegheny County in the fall of 1912, and the first account of the executors, the one here in question, was filed January 16, 1914. To it appear the signatures of both executors; however, it is sworn to only by Risdon. What if any part she took in preparing the account does not appear. In it the executors are charged with the amount of the inventory, to wit: $56,-071.33, which includes said item of Cash in Bank $4,-999.33. The eleventh certificate of deposit above mentioned, for $320, was collected by Mrs. Sloan as her own and not included in the inventory. She retained possession of the other ten certificates, had them reissued in one certificate to herself individually and disposed of the same as a bequest in her last will. And aside from the account, and what inference might be drawn from the inventory, there is nothing to indicate that she ever regarded any of those certificates as belonging to her husband’s estate.</p>

She died testate February 20,1915. Both Mr. and Mrs. Sloan died without issue. She never elected to take against his will, <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>although it gave her less than she would have received under the intestate laws.

    <p id="b375-5" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[215,511,1148,531]]]'>Shortly after her death the executor of her estate filed his petition in the Orphans’ Court, in this case for a review of said account, averring inter alia that said certificates were held by Mr. and Mrs. Sloan by entireties and that the title thereto vested in her by right of survivorship, and that inadvertently and under a misapprehension they had been included as a part of his estate. The court so found and granted the relief prayed for by striking the said item of |4,999.33 from said account. Actual distribution had not been made. •</p>

If so the embracing of said item of $4,-999.33 in the inventory and account as property of the husband’s estate was at least on her part an entire mistake.

Considering her age and health and all the circumstances, inferences should not be too rigidly drawn against her because of what appears in said inventory and account, especially as Risdon was the active executor. The conclusion is justifiable that a mistake was made, which did her estate grave injustice; and which the court below, after hearing, properly corrected. This wrongs no one and is within the equitable power of the Orphans’ Court. Such court in its discretion may correct its own records in the interest of justice, even to protect parties from the effect of their own mistakes or blunders.
