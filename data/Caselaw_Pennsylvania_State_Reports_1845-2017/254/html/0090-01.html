There is not a particle of evidence, nor an admission, of any communication between the testatrix and defendant, or of the exertion by him upon her of any influence, on the subject of her will or the disposition of her estate, nor of any expression by her while living of her purpose concerning either, nor of any promise by him to her, direct or indirect, express or implied, as to what he was to or would do with such part of the estate as should be left to him, nor of his presence at the execution of the will. There is positively nothing in the evidence to which plaintiff points beyond the letter of Nov. 29, 1912. That letter does not refer to any understanding between the defendant and the testatrix, or any wish or design on her part, concerning the defendant’s enjoyment or application of the share left to him in the will. If it did that, (as the writings in Brooke’s App., McAuley’s Est. and Washington’s Est., above cited did,) or if such an understanding, etc., were shown independently of the letter so as to raise a reasonable presumption of a connection between it and such understanding, etc., its effect might be different. But standing alone as it does, its interpretation as indicating the existence of a trust imposed by the testatrix and accepted by defendant can rest upon nothing but a mere guess, which is not permissible. Ignoring defendant’s explanation of it, it may just as well be taken as an original voluntary declaration of trust, or as evidencing a <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>family arrangement since the testatrix’s death. Neither the one nor the other of these, both being at variance with the right alleged in the plaintiff’s bill, would serve his case or warrant a decree in his favor. The possibility, however, of the conflicting acceptations of its meaning makes the letter unavailable as proof of what plaintiff wants to show by it. An item of evidence equally calculated to prove one or two other things, inconsistent with the proposition contended for, cannot be made the basis of a finding affirming that proposition: Breuckman v. Twibill, <a href="/pa/89/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="89 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="1063216" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0058-01">89 Pa. 58</a>, 59; Mead v.

No doubt, for the purposes of this case, and in the absence of anything to connect the letter with a promise by defendant to the testatrix, the most it can amount to is a noncontractual admission, which, on familiar principles: see 2 Whart. Ev., Sec. 1077, 3d Ed., is open to explanation and repudiation by the declarant. And in truth, looking at the whole of the letter, and especially in the light of its closing sentence, it seems that, even without defendant’s explanation and a fortiori in view of it, it ought to be understood, not as an acknowledgment of a liability at all, but as an expression of a mere brotherly interest and good feeling, — a purpose to let plaintiff and Thamos and Despina share with him in the estate, beyond what the will gave them and to an extent equalizing them all. In other words, it furnishes no basis for inferring the existence of a legally or morally binding duty imposed by the testatrix and assumed by defendant. It may, to be sure, be conjectured that the testatrix, when she gave to defendant more than one-half of her estate, hoped and believed he would take an interest in the affairs of his brothers and sisters and in case of need assist them financially, and that with this thought and confidence she put him in a position to help them without crippling himself, if and when he might see occasion for doing so. His relations with <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>théin in the past and his position as the oldest of them may possibly warrant such an assumption. But it is a long way from that to the creation of a trust: Schultz’s App., <a href="/pa/80/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="80 Pa. 396" data-case-ids="1042384" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0396-01">80 Pa. 396</a>, 405; Hodnett’s Est., O’Reilly’s App., <a href="/pa/154/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="154 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="842426" data-case-paths="/pa/154/0485-01">154 Pa. 485</a>, 490. Of the latter there is here no competent evidence, and that being.the sole issue in the case, the plaintiff’s bill must fail. It is hardly necessary to add that the question whether there is any or sufficient evidence to sustain plaintiff’s position is one of law: see Fisher v. Scaharadin, <a href="/pa/186/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="186 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="989714" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0565-01">186 Pa. 565</a>, 569, and therefore legitimately the subject of legal conclusion.</p>
