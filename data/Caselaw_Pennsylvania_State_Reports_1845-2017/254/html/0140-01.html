All his real estate, including lands in Luzerne and Lackawanna Counties, was devised to his widow, Anna E. Breck, as sole residuary legatee. Defendant, C. S. Woodruff was appointed and qualified as his executor, without special powers. Said decedent at the time of his death was indebted to Emily Fischer, the above plaintiff, in the sum of eight thousand dollars, secured by a bond and mortgage upon land in Luzerne County. The estate being involved and having an advantageous opportunity to sell the land covered by said mortgage in Luzerne County, the executor and Mrs. Breck as such sole, legatee requested plaintiff to accept a payment on said indebtedness and discharge the mortgage, and to take as security for the balance thereof a judgment upon the lands of said estate in Lackawanna County. Relying upon their assurance that such would be perfectly valid, she consented thereto, and on August 10,1907, received from the executor a note for $6,673.47, for the balance of such indebtedness.
