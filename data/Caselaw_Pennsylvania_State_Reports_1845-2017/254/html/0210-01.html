Catherine took out letters testamentary upon her husband’s estate and on May 25, 1900, filed what purports to be her first and final account, confirmed absolutely July 6, 1900, charging herself with coal royalties amounting to $155.46, and taking credit for preferred claims of $242.47, leaving a balance of $87.01 as due the executrix.

The purpose of the citation is to compel her to account as ex-' ecutrix for all coal royalties she has received under the will of her deceased husband Asahel, on the theory that the widow is entitled only to the interest on the royalties accruing during her lifetime and not to the royalties themselves. The widow admits the receipt of royalties paid to her of $5,596.57, or an average of $385.82 per year, which is the entire income from her husband’s estate. She claims the principal of these royalties as her own, as life tenant under her husband’s will.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b238-4" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[264,954,1145,532]]]'>Asahel, our decedent, died seized under his father’s will of a one-ninth interest in the royalties accruing under the said leáse. In passing from the father who opened the mine to his son, the estate underwent no alteration as to kind or nature. It possessed all the legal qualities in-the hands of the son that it did in those of the father, and their rights thereto were exactly similar. Asahel gave to his widow Catherine an estate of the same kind as his father gave to his widow Mary, viz:' a life estate in his coal royalties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_238.6",238,[265,1499,1144,694]]]'>Asahel gave to his widow all his estate during her natural life, which means that he gave her the income of all his estate as long as she lives, with remainder to his children. It is contended that the bequest was to her as executrix, and not personally; but as an executrix as such does not have a natural life it is clear testator had no such intention. That he intended to give his widow the principal' of the coal royalties we have no doubt. They were practically all the estate he had and the principal is sufficient for her support only with great economy, and the interest on them would not keep her alive. No trust was created by his will, for under the law none was necessary.</p>

Before that decision it was repeatedly held that the rents accruing from <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>a coal lease, whether the mine was already opened at the death of the testator or power given in the will to sell, were “income” -within the meaning of the will, and as such should be paid absolutely to the life-tenant: Eley’s App., <a href="/pa/103/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="103 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="449168" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0300-01">103 Pa. 300</a>; Woodburn’s Est., <a href="/pa/138/0606-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="138 Pa. 606" data-case-ids="11252449" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0606-01">138 Pa. 606</a>.

It is true that, in Gardner’s Est., <a href="/pa/199/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="199 Pa. 524" data-case-ids="922676" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0524-01">199 Pa. 524</a>, it was held that after the death of the owner royalties go to the executors, and not to the heirs; but it is explained in Duffy’s Est., <a href="/pa/209/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="209 Pa. 390" data-case-ids="936196" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0390-01">209 Pa. 390</a>, that that is the rule only where they are subject to debts existing at testator’s death and costs of administration of his estate. It was also held in the latter case, that the widow was entitled to collect the royalties herself without the intervention of the executor, there being-no debts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b239-4" data-blocks='[["BL_239.5",239,[198,1445,1149,741]]]'>Nor can we see how McFadden’s Est., <a href="/pa/224/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="224 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="963054" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0443-01">224 Pa. 443</a>, supports the contention of the petitioners. In that case counsel for appellants conceded that where the lease is made in the lifetime of the testator, or where the lease is made under a power given in a will, the royalties are income and payable to the life-tenant. All that the court there found was that, where a testator died seized of two tracts of land, the life tenant was not entitled to the royalties from the tract on which there was no open mine in the lifetime of the testator and concerning which he had given no power in his will to lease or sell. There is in that decision no denial of the right of the life-tenant to the principal of the royalties in the tract opened in testator’s lifetime.</p>
