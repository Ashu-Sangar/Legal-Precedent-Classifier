In an action' of replevin to recover jewelry which had been pledged to defendant trust company as security for a loan, it- appeared that plaintiffs had leased the jewelry to a contractor under a written agreement which did not authorize the pledge thereof and that such contractor subsequently pledged the jewelry to defendant. Defendant offered evidence to show that the leases did not contain the entire transaction between the plaintiffs and their pledgor and that the jewelry was delivered to the contractor by <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>plaintiffs' with tbe express understanding that it was to be pledged by Mm as security for loans of money.

In 1914 defendant, John W. Emery, was á contractor doing a large business and reputed to be a man of wealth, but being in need of funds to use in his business was advised by the cashier of a bank, not the Guarantee Trust and Safe Deposit Company, to buy diamonds on long credit and pledge them for a loan. For that purpose he obtained an introduction and recommendation to plaintiffs, who were engaged in the jewelry business; and on <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>June 2, 1914, obtained from them on inspection some loose unmounted diamonds, leaving a memorandum therefor. Those he shortly returned and on June 24th secured from plaintiffs seven diamond rings and one pair of diamond earrings, leaving a memorandum stating in effect that they were taken on inspection and approval and meantime to remain plaintiffs’ property. On July 6, 1914, Mr. Emery executed to plaintiffs a long time lease for said jewelry providing for monthly payments of rent. Prior however to executing said lease he had pledged the diamonds to his codefendant, who received same in good faith, as security for a loan. Later, on August 4th of same year, Mr. Emery obtained from plaintiffs possession of another pair of diamond earrings and seven additional diamond rings, giving therefor a like memorandum, and later on August 26th, a lease therefor of like import with the former'. Subsequently under similar circumstances he pledged the diamonds last mentioned to his codefendant for an additional loan. Emery failed and the two loans amounting at time of trial to $4,941.25, were not paid. The jewelry here involved is valued at about ten thousand dollars, and as rent therefor Mr. Emery made plaintiffs some small payments.</p>

Emery and the plaintiffs; and that as a matter of fact all of said diamonds were delivered to him by them with the express understanding that they were to be pledged by him as security for loans of money. This was all denied by plaintiffs and the evidence was very conflicting. The learned trial judge fairly submitted the case to the jury, with instructions that if they <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>found there was no such express understanding to render a verdict for plaintiffs, and if they found there was then to render a verdict for plaintiffs on condition that they pay the defendant company the amount loaned on the security of the diamonds, which conditional verdict was so rendered. The jury also found that the transaction did not constitute a sale of the diamonds to Emery.</p>
