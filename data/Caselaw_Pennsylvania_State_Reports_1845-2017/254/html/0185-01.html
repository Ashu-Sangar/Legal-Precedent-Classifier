    <p class="summary" id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[196,449,1151,1130]]]'>It therefore follows that- the legislature might have imposed upon boroughs, in the annexation Act of 1903, the same liabilities as are now imposed by the Act of 1915; and it might have provided for the annexation of boroughs to cities without the vote of the people at all. Their consent was a mere detail, which was not essential to the validity of the statute. The thing, therefore, which the people of West Liberty acquired by the provisions of the Annexation Act of 1903 wás but a privilege, as distinguished from a right of contract. It was in a sense a gratuity on the part of the lawmakers, but there was no relinquishment of power over municipal indebtedness. It follows that the privilege thus obtained was revocable at the pleasure of the grantors. If this be true, then no contract rights were created by the proceedings for the annexation of West Liberty to the City of Pittsburgh. Consequently, the Act- of 1915 in no wise impaired any contractual obligations. The aúthorities cited for our conclusions in the case of Troop v. Pittsburgh, et al., <a href="/pa/254/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="254 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1025476" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0172-01">254 Pa. 172</a>, need not be repeated here.</p>

It is a general law in form and in fact. Hence, the objection is not well taken, <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>because the regulation of affairs of counties, etc., by general law is not prohibited.</p>

These sections limit tbe power of a municipality to incur new debt and prescribe tbe details that must be observed in so doing. It is well settled that annexation or consolidation, such as is provided in tbe Act of 1903, does not operate as an increase of debt. It is tbe incurring of new debt that is limited by tbe sections of tbe Constitution, to which reference has just been made.</p>

It was provided in tbe original for tbe continued existence of tbe cities and tbe annexed boroughs, until tbe pre-existing indebtedness of each is paid, as well as for tbe collection of any assets due such municipalities. In addition, authority was given for levying a separate indebtedness, tax. Tbe annexations, therefore, were not entirely complete.
