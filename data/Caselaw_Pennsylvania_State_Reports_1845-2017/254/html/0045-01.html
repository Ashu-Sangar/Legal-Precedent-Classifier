L. 524, still in force, and subsequent legislation, standards of weights and measures have been fixed in Pennsylvania, with divers provisions icompelling compliance with these standards. By the Act of April 15,1845, Section 2, P. L. 444, copies of the original standards were to be transmitted to the county commissioners of any county upon application being made by said commissioners, and by the fifth section the governor was authorized to appoint one sealer of weights and measures for the City of Philadelphia, one sealer for the County of Philadelphia, and one sealer <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>for each county which obtained copies of the standards; which sealers were paid by fees payable by the several dealers using weights and measures. “Said sealers of weights and measures shall hold their offices three years, unless sooner removed by the governor.” By the Act of April 14, 1859, P. L. 633, the Act of 1845, was repealed as to Clearfield County, and was also by several acts repealed as to many other counties. This subject was considered in the Constitutional Convention, and by a large vote Article III, Section 27, was adopted, as follows : “No State office shall be continued or created for the inspection or measuring of any merchandise, manufacture or commodity, but any county or municipality may appoint such officers when authorized by law.” By several acts provisions have been made for the inspection of divers commodities in various parts of the State, and by the Act of June 26, 1895, P. L. 386, it is provided: “The Governor of this Commonwealth shall appoint such number of inspectors as may be designated by the County Commissioners in the cities of the first and second class,” with certain drastic provisions as to inspection, etc.; but it was not until the Act of May 11, 1911, P. L. 275, an attempt was made to impose upon all the counties the office of inspector of weights and measures. No more conclusive evidence of the popular regard in which this position is held could exist than that it has become so odious and evidently useless that the people took pains to imbed into the Constitution a section forbidding the State to create these inspectors, and though it was provided that the legislature could authorize any county or municipality to so appoint, such legislation was not passed as to the whole State for nearly forty years. The court greatly regrets that it is not in its power to prevent the existence of this office (the only serious demand for it is the demand for the place); but this is foreign to the question pending. The Act of 1911, following the Constitution, merely authorized “the several Boards of ■ County Commissioners” “to appoint such number of <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>competent persons as inspectors of weights and measures as they may deem proper,” with such compensation as the commissioners should fix. The next step was the Act of July 24, 1913, P. L. 960, which undertook to make appointment compulsory. “The several Boards of County Commissioners shall” “appoint one or more competent persons as inspectors of weights and measures” “whose salary shall be no less than a thousand dollars per annum” and expenses. This is a queer piece of legislation. Under the guise of an amending act it recites and modifies each section of the Act of 1911 in important particulars. It undertakes to compel the counties to create this office, though the Constitution restricts the legislature to a mere authorization of such appointment, and, if this act is in force, according to its terms there has been imposed on this county an officer who will hold the place for life, if he chooses and is of good behavior, who cannot be removed by the will of the appointing power, except for the causes specified in the act, and who possesses drastic and far-reaching powers, which he may continue to exercise regardless of their uselessness or the public discontent.</p>

A single legal question is presented: Had the board of county commissioners, on February 7, 1916, the power of removal? Upon the answer turns this case. The Constitution of Pennsylvania, Article VI, Section 4, is in part: “Appointed officers, other than judges of the courts of record and the superintendent of public instruction, may be removed at the pleasure of the power by which they shall have been appointed.” Is the inspector an “office” within the meaning of this section? This involves a consideration of the powers and duties of the inspector. The Act of 1913 defines his duties and grants <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>to him powers of summary and extensive character.

An examination of many definitions fails to disclose a single one which would not so describe this place. That it is a public office is quite as certain; exercising only duties and powers defined by legislation, acting for the protection of the general public, paid out of the public funds, and occupying a position which concerns a part of the sovereign power of the State, the place is one which, needs no citation of decisions to establish that it is a public office. The Constitution calls the position an office (see Article III, Section 27) and the incumbents officers, and the Act of 1913, says “shall hold their office.” Were such positions in the minds of the framers of the Constitution when they drew Article VI, Section 4? That they were in contemplatiofi during the framing of the Constitution plainly appears from Article III, Section 27, and an examination of the debates of the Constitutional Convention shows that the exact question was discussed relative to Article VI, Section 4. The sentence relative to removal of appointive officers was in the constitutional draft as reported, and on motion of Mr. Buckalew was referred to the Committee on Revision, with direction to <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>strike it out; this being done the article was again brought before the convention, when Hon. Harry White moved to amend by restoring the omitted sentence, which, after debate, was done by a decisive vote. Mr. Buckalew pointed out that this sentence made a radical change in the law, but the convention decided to make the change and the very class of officer now considered was specifically mentioned. Mr. White saying, in his address, “The Governor has the appointing power of a number of officers......and all over the Commonwealth sealers of weights and measures and other officers of that kind.” The conclusion is inevitable that this position is an office within the meaning of Article VI, Section 4, of the Constitution.</p>

Ency. of Law, Yol. 23, page 431. It is entirely settled that when the Constitution has declared the grounds or mode of removal the legislature had no power to authorize removal for any other reason or in any pther mode; it cannot provide additional causes, restrict or lessen the causes, or alter the method. On this subject there is no substantial difference in the decisions of the various states and we are not without judicial authority in Pennsylvania.</p>

L. 965, by the first section of which it is enacted that the word “commodity” shall be taken to mean any tangible personal property sold or offered for sale. Section 9 is as follows: “It shall be the duty of the proper city and county inspectors of weights and measures to enforce the provisions of this act.” If what was already clear needed confirmation, it would be found in this act, and it cannot seriously be contended that a place such as the inspector of weights and measures is not a public office, and for reasons heretofore stated it is equally clear that the incumbent is an officer within the meaning of Article YI, Section 4.</p>
