If such debts are to be so counted, then clearly the debt-incurring capacity of the city itself is largely in excess of two per centum of the assessed valuation of property. If they are not to be so counted, then the two per centum limit has not been passed. Therefore, the questions for decision are:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[335,996,934,38]]]'>First. What is the effect of said Acts of 1915?</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b204-6" data-blocks='[["BL_204.7",204,[286,1107,1150,1245]]]'>First. It is clear that, by the terms of these Acts of 1915, all the debts of the constituent units of the Greater Pittsburgh, no matter how created, are now to be paid by the consolidated city. But do these statutes change the character of such indebtedness, as the same existed prior to their passage? In answering this question, we must consider what the power of the legislature is. The Constitution of Pennsylvania prohibits municipalities from incurring debt in excess of seven per centum of the assessed valuation of property within their territorial limits. It, besides, makes a distinction between debts that may be created by such municipalities. They themselves may incur debt not to exceed two per centum of such valuation. They may incur debt beyond two per centum and not to exceed seven per centum of such valuation, but, before doing so, they must obtain the assent of the electors. Thus there are two classes of indebtedness recognized in the Constitution, one called for convenience “councilmanic,” which is created without the assent of electors, and another called “electoral,” which must be authorized by the electors. It is immaterial in what order these powers of a municipality are exercised: Keller v. Scranton, <a href="/pa/202/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="202 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="992313" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0586-01">202 Pa. 586</a>.</p>

It has no power to authorize a municipality to incur debt in any manner, in excess of the seven per centum limit. Neither has it any power to authorize a municipality itself to incur debt, in excess of the two per cent, limit. And, if it has no such power, it is equally impotent to require a consolidated city to assume indebtedness of its constituent units, which would result in the councilmanic debt exceeding the two per cent, limit. Of course, the legislature may not do indirectly that which it may not do directly.</p>

The legislature would thereby be doing, under the guise of consolidation and annexation, what is expressly forbidden in the Constitution. But do these acts bear the interpretation which the complainant has placed upon them ? We do not think they do. While the greater city is undoubtedly made liable for these preexisting debts of the constituent units, yet there is not a word in these statutes concerning the character of said debts— whether they are “councilmanic” or “electoral.” There is no attempt made in terms to change the status of the debts. In other words, these statutes leave said preexisting debts just as they were. They are to be regarded in the future administration of the city’s affairs, just as they' were before the legislation. The debt of a unit, which was councilmanic, becomes a councilmanic debt of the consolidated city, and the debt of a unit, which was electoral, becomes an electoral debt of the consolidated city; and they are to be treated accordingly. This we regard as the fair meaning of the language employed. The legislature must be presumed to have proceeded in accordance with the law. As We have seen, the Constitution distinguishes between councilmanic and electoral indebtedness, The status of each class of debts was fixed <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>as of the date of its creation, and this cannot be thereafter changed. This was one of the points for decision, as we understand, in a late case that came before the Supreme Court. It was there said:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[269,570,1152,970]]]'>“The first question raised.....is as follows: Whether certain funding bonds consisting of two issues, one of $700,000.00 and one of $400,000.00 respectively, issued with the assent of the electors, but which were issued and the proceeds used for the payment of a floating indebtedness incurred prior to such assent, are an indebtedness incurred with or without the assent of the electors within the meaning of the Constitution. It is clear that the obligations which these bonds were intended to replace, were created without the vote of the people, and the authority afterwards granted by the people to fund this existing indebtedness which had been incurred without their consent, cannot be held to operate to transfer such indebtedness from the councilmanic class to the electoral class. The funding or refunding of a debt previously created and existing is not an increase of that indebtedness, but is merely a continuation thereof”: Schuldice v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/251/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="251 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="1019656" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0028-01">251 Pa. 28</a>, 31.</p>

Thereby, there was no possibility that the councilmanic debt of the greater city would exceed two per cent, of the valuation of property, because such indebtedness of eách unit must have been within such limit, and therefore that of the consolidated city could not pass it. In like manner the total indebtedness of each unit must have been within the seven per cent, limit, and therefore that of the consolidated city could not pass the same. It seems to us that the only fair construction we can place upon this statute is the one above indicated. If we are correct, the indebtedness mentioned in Findings of Fact 6 cannot be counted in <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>ascertaining the clebt-incurring capacity of the City of Pittsburgh itself.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[182,457,1152,970]]]'>That the legislature had power to transfer liability for the preexisting indebtedness of the constituent units of the greater city to the latter seems to be well settled by authority. Such is not an increase of indebtedness at all. It is a purely legislative question. Consolidation of municipalities and annexation of one municipality to another are not prohibited by the Constitution. The legislature may authorize such consolidation and annexation upon such terms as it may see fit to impose. It may adjust the indebtedness equitably among the units, or it may not, as in its discretion seems ptoper. Therefore, the argument on behalf of complainant, that a portion of Greater Pittsburgh will become responsible for “electoral debts,” which were never authorized by such portion, seems unsound. By no possibility, as we have heretofore shown, will the total indebtedness of the greater city exceed the seven per cent, limit. In a recent case, considering the Act of 1906, it was said:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.6",208,[261,890,1148,806]]]'>It is argued, however, that these Acts of 1915 are in fact amendments of the said Acts of 1903 and 1906, and that therefore" the form of the legislation is contrary to Article III, Section 6 of the Constitution. We do not think that these acts are to be regarded as mere amendments. They are practically supplemental to the legislation contained in the original acts, and the subjects are undoubtedly germane to those-of the original acts. The titles of the Acts of 1915 give specific notice of the contents thereof, and likewise make reference to the acts which they are intended to supplement. They are therefore self-supporting and may stand as independent enactments. We can do no better, in discussing this subject, than to quote from a decision involving the same principle:</p>

What is the legal acceptation of the two words, amendment and supplement? Do they mean one and the same thing, either in their drdinary and common acceptation or in the law? Ordinarily when we speak of amendment, we refer to the correction or change in some part of something fully existing or intended to have force, but rendered uncertain because of want of clearness of expression, or error of statement, or omission of something intended to be embraced therein. When we speak of a supplemental act, we intend something added to, something <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>new, and in legislation we mean by a supplement to an act already in force, to add to it something not contained in the original, which new and added legislation is nevertheless germane to the subject of that already in force.”</p>
