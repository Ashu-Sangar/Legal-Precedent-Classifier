That the sale of an inlot or an outlot by the Commonwealth to an individual is an implied covenant and contract that the streets laid out in the plot shall forever be and-remain public highways, being a contract as if it were between private parties and is protected by that clause of the Constitution of the United States and of the Commonwealth which provides that neither congress nor a legislature shall pass any act in violation of contracts.
