The learned court below thus properly refers to this: “All the questions involved in the settlement of this estate have been before the auditor for his consider<a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>ation upon three occasions. The learned auditor at the first hearing, after taking a large volume of testimony principally furnished by the accountant, restated the final account, and surcharged the accountant with numerous items. Upon exceptions filed, the report of the auditor was resubmitted, for the purpose of permitting accountant to sustain exceptions filed to the re-stated account; the second report was again submitted to the auditor for the purpose of permitting accountant to prove a contract for services rendered decedent as attorney-in-fact. And the matter, is again before the court upon exceptions to the third report of the auditor.”</p>

It is, therefore, affirmed at his costs.</p>
