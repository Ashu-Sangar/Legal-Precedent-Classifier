When the account of the trustee of a trust created by the will, was called for audit it appeared that the judgment had been opened, a new' trial had and a verdict rendered sustaining the will. It further appeared (1) that no judgment had been entered on the second verdict, (2) that no proper return thereof to the Orphans’ Court had been made, (3) that no order setting aside the decree annulling the will had been entered, and (4) that there was no decree directing the probate of the will. The Orphans’ Court ordered the trustee to perfect the record in the Orphans’ Court and thereafter the trustee offered a certified copy of the docket entries in the Common Pleas showing that judgment had been entered on the second verdict sustaining the will. The record did not show an order .of the Orphans’ Court setting aside its decree annulling the will or directing a probate, or that the original will returned by the Common Pleas to the Orphans’ Court had been remitted by the latter to the former for the purpose of the second trial, or that any effort to cure such defect had been made.

    <p id="b415-3" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[190,481,1157,1911]]]'>In testing the correctness of the refusal of the Orphans’ Court to proceed with the adjudication, we must first look at the Act of March 15,1832, P. L. (of 1831-2) 135, as affected by subsequent changes. The 18th section of this act provides the form of precept which shall go to the Common Pleas whenever a caveat is entered against the probate of a testamentary writing; it shows that the precept must be accompanied by the original writing offered for probate, and that the Common Pleas must “certify the result of the trial” had before it to the register, when the order comes directly from that official, or to the Orphans’ Court when from the latter tribunal. Section 25 of the act in question provides for a register’s court, and Section 31 for appeals thereto; while Section 39 gives to such court, on an appeal from the register, power to “do all such judicial acts...... as belong and of right ought to belong to the office of said register.” Then, Section 41 provides that “whenever a dispute upon a matter of fact arises before any register’s court, the said court shall, at the request of either party, direct a precept for an issue to the Court of Common Pleas of the county for the trial thereof, in the form hereinbefore prescribed for the direction of registers, changing such parts thereof as should be changed, according to the circumstances of the case; and the facts established by. the verdict returned shall not be re-examined on any appeal.” Finally, Section 22, Article Y, of the Constitution of 1874, provides: “In every county Orphans’ Courts shall possess all the powers and jurisdiction of a register’s court, and separate registers’ courts are hereby abolished”; and Section 6 of the Act of May 19, 1874, P. L. 206 (No. 134), that the Orphans’ Courts respectively “shall have and exercise all the jurisdiction and powers now vested in ......the registers’ courts.”</p>
