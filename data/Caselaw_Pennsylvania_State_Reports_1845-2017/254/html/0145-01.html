The subsequent letters referring to the contract, without repudiating it, the fact that it was turned over to Mr. Balph with the other papers, that nothing was said to Mr. McGillick whose interest was known, as well as other facts support our conclusion. The finding of the amount expended disposes of the claim of false representations. The concealment of McGillick’s interest was not of a material fact and did not harm the defendants.</p>

At the moment <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>when it was signed the four individuals could not bind the corporation but, having settled the terms upon which the property Avas to be operated they immediately took their places in the corporation, through which' the contract was to be performed, and being all of the directors (except one nominal director) and all of the stockholders, the contract was carried out so far as it could be done, that is, the corporation purchased Beltz’s stock and the four individuals paid into the treasury the agreed price. It was one transaction. It was for the benefit of the corporation. It was without funds and had no assets, except the property, and could not raise any money. The stock which Beltz delivered was ultimately sold for $23,525. The fact that the capital was later decreased and then increased does not affect this conclusion. A corporation may purchase its own stock: Dock v. Schlichter Jute Cordage Co., <a href="/pa/167/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="167 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="866777" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0370-01">167 Pa. 370</a>; Coleman v.

If it can purchase, it may agree to pay and limit the source of payment to profits. This was to its own advantage. The promise to pay was not renewed after Garrison and Fritch became directors and did not appear.upon the minutes, but the transfers of stock were upon the records of the company. The adoption of a contract may be inferred from acts done, although no resolution is passed: Bagaley v.

The company received the benefits and cannot be relieved of the burden. The principle upon which a corporation is held liable for the acts of its promoters is, that it cannot receive benefits Avitho.pt assuming the burdens: Bell’s Gap R. R. Co. v.
