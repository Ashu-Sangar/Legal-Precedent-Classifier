Brown died and the burden of liquidating falls upon the two surviving brothers. It is for them to do the best they can in determining what each member of the firm is entitled to receive. The two brothers, sons of the same Philip Brown, continue in the business and at the same place. The firm of Philip Brown’s Sons, in one sense of the word, neither loses nor gains by the death of John A. Brown, because Philip Brown’s Sons still remain in the other two brothers at the same place of locality, and they are bound to account for the business. Shall they destroy the firm’s name and thereby injure all parties concerned? The record shows the business was continued in with the consent of all, and all parties benefited thereby, until April 13, 1911, when by mutual consent the widow of John A. Brown sold her interest “in the said balance of the goods and chattels as contained in the said inventory,” still leaving her interest in the real estate to be determined in the future.</p>
