        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Potter,\nThis is an appeal from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, dismissing a petition for k- review of the adjudication of the\u2019account'of the trustee of the est\u00e1te of William Carter, deceased. The authority for granting a review by the Orphans\u2019 Court is the Act of October 13, 1810, Sec. 1. \u25a0 It refers to the accounts of executors, administrators and guardians, but it would seem that it may properly be construed as including accounts .of testamentary trustees. But\u2019 the act contains a proviso that it \u201cshall not extend to any cause when the balance found due shall have been actually paid and discharged by any executor, administrator or guardian.\u201d The opinion of the court below, and the docket entries, show that distribution had been made in accordance with the adjudication before appellant filed his petition for review. It might very well have been refused for that reason. The adjudication also shows that the question raised by the petition for review was raised and considered at the audit. Appellant is not therefore se\u00e9king a review for the purpose of presenting a question which was overlooked. It is rather in the nature of an application for a reargument. However, the court below chose to treat the petition, as in the nature of an exception to the adjudication. In so doing it gave the fullest consideration to the claim of petitioner, as possible ultimate remainderman.\nThe power of appointment given by William Carter to his son is as follows: \u201cUpon trust for such of the children or issue of the said Joseph James Thomas Carter in such shares and manner as he shall by will or codicil appoint.\u201d The donee of the power, after reciting his intention to execute the power, provided: \u201cI give, devise and bequeath all the residue of my father\u2019s real and personal estate over which I have the power of appointment under his said will, to my only living son, Hugh-William Carter, to him, his heirs and assigns.\u201d This language, standing by itself, would unquestionably vest an absolute interest in the donee\u2019s son, who is the only member of the class to which the power was restricted.' But the donee goes on to say: \u201cBut if at the time of my death I have other children living, or the issue of a deceased child living, then I give, devise and bequeath the said residue of my father\u2019s real 'and personal estate over which I have the power of appointment as aforesaid, to my children and the issue of any deceased child, to be equally divided among them Share and share alike, the issue of a deceased child to take the share a par\u00e9nt would take if then living, in trust nevertheless in all events for a period of twenty years immediately after the date of my death, that he or they may enjoy the income, interest and nse thereof during that time, and at the expiration of that period, I give, devise and bequeath the said residue of my father\u2019s real and personal estate absolutely to my child or children, and the issue of any deceased child, living at the expiration of the above named period of twenty years, to them, .their heirs and assigns forever, the issue of a deceased child to take the share a parent would take if then living, provided, however, that if all my children die during my lifetime or within twenty years after my death, without issue, then I give, devise and bequeath the said residue of my father\u2019s real and personal estate absolutely to my brother, Richard Champion Thomas Carter, to him, his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d The auditing judge held that the remainder of the clause, beginning with the words, \u201cbut if\u201d was \u201ccleanly an alternative appointment to take effect only if he should die leaving other children or issue of deceased children.\u201d Appellant contends, on the other hand, that the portion of the clause, beginning \u201cin trust nevertheless\u201d was intended to apply to the gift to Hugh-William, as well as to gifts to other possible children or issue of deceased children. In support of this contention appellant calls attention to the use by the donee of the words \u201cin all events,\u201d \u201che,\u201d \u201cchild,\u201d and \u201call my children.\u201d The court below, although admitting that there was much force in appellant\u2019s contention, adopted the construction of the auditing judge, saying: \u201cThe expression \u2018in trust,\u2019in our opinion, refers to the alternative gift and to that alone.\u201d We agree Avith this conclusion. The gift to Hugh-William which is expressly \u201cto him, his heirs and assigns\u201d indicates plainly that he was to take a present absolute interest, and as against this, the intention of the testator in the latter part of the clause, is, to say the least, not free from doubt. \u201cIn cases of doubtful construction the law leans in favor of an absolute rather than a defeasible estateSmith\u2019s App., 23 Pa. 9.\n\u201cThe construction, if it is necessary to resort to the established rules, should be in favor of......an absolute or vested estate rather than of a defeasible or contingent one:\u201d Jackson\u2019s Est., 179 Pa. 77, 83. If the appointment- to Hugh-William was not valid, he would, under the will of William Carter, take, only in case he attains the age of twenty-one years. But no such condition was imposed upon the appointees of Joseph. It must be admitted that the latter exceeded his authority in attempting to create an estate in his brother who was not a member of the class to whom the power of appointment was limited. But that feature of the will is separable from the valid portion, and may be disregarded. We are satisfied that the power of appointment conferred by the will of Wiliam Carter was properly exercised in the will of his son, Joseph, and that under the true interpretation of the latter will, Hugh-William Carter took an absolute present estate.\nThe assignment of error is overruled, and the decree of the court below dismissing the petition for review is affirmed.",
