After the filing of the remittitur, the court proceeded with the cause and found that \u201cno 'fraud had been shown to induce us to change our former decree confirming the auditor\u2019s report,\u201d and dismissed the petition for the bill of review. The petitioner has taken this appeal. A review of the testimony has not convinced us that the court committed error in finding that no fraud was shown to have entered into the decree or induced it, and we, therefore, see no reason for interfering with the discretion of the court in entering the decree dismissing the petition.\nDecree affirmed.",
