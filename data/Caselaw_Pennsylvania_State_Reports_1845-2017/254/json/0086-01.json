Heilman an independent contractor. Defendant company, as owner, did nothing to change the relation established by said contract. Plaintiff had no contractual relations Avith the owner: therefore, his action, if maintainable, is against his employer. It follows that defendant\u2019s point in bar should have been affirmed: hence, the rule should be made absolute.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed.",
