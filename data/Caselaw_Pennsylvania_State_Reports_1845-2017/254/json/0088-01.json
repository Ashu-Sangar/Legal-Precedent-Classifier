Where a testator makes an absolute gift he cannot couple with it a direction to withhold payment until such time as the legatee is likely to make proper use of the money.\n2. Testator\u2019s will contained the following provision: \u201cto my Dear May Darde of Broth Reupen a good outfit to start housekeeping when she\u2019 get married, before I die, and May to get One thou-\n-.sand Dollars out of my estate and be given to her when my wife Amnia see fit to give it to her that she make Proper use of it: without Intres.\u201d, The niece, May, daughter of testator\u2019s brother Reuben married after the death of the testator and claimed both a sufficient amount for an outfit and the sum of $1,000. Held, the intention of testator was disclosed to make a gift of an outfit if his niece had married in his lifetime and he had not furnished her such an outfit, but if she did not marry in his lifetime she was to have an absolute gift of $1,000, but no outfit and that the attempt in the will to restrain the payment to her failed for invalidity.\nArgued April 27,1916.\nAppeal, No. 37, Jan. T., 1915, by May Biery, from decree of O. C. Berks Co., Jan. T., 1915, No. 37, directing distribution in Estate of George W. Schwartz, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Potter, Stewart and Moschzisicer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for citation on executors to show cause why they should not comply with the provisions of the will of the decedent with reference to legacy bequeathed to petitioner.\nThe testator died on November 6, 1908, and his niece May Biery was married on June 21,1910. Further facts appear in the following opinion by Btjshong, P. J.:\nThe present proceeding was instituted for the purpose of determining the rights of May Biery in the estate of George W, Schwartz, deceased.\nThe decedent\u2019s will so far as it relates to the question at issue, is as follows: \u201c......and she (the widow) to my Dear May Darde (daughter) of Broth (brother) Reupen (Reuben) a good outfit to start housekeeping wen she get married, before I die, and May to get One thousand Dollars and (out) of my estate and be give to her wen my Wife Amme see fit to give it to her that she \u25a0 make Proper use of it: without Intres.\u201d\nThe legatee referred to above was May Schwartz, -the decedent\u2019s niece, who lived in his family for a number of years before his death and some time after his death married James E. Biery.\nThe will is obviously one written by an illiterate man. The intention, however, is clear that the testator had in mind the furnishing of an outfit only in case his niece married in his lifetime \u2014 the words being \u201ca good outfit to start housekeeping wen she get married before I die.\u201d\nWhy the testator made such a provision cannot now be known. The only reasonable explanation is that he had in mind the contingency of his niece\u2019s marriage in his lifetime without his providing her with an outfit and he in such case wanted her to have it; and that if she did not marry in his lifetime, she was to have $1,000 \u2014 instead of the outfit.\nSince Mrs. Biery in the court\u2019s opinion is not entitled to an outfit, it is unnecessary to determine from the testimony taken what would constitute a proper one.\nThe court is of the opinion that $1,000.00 should be paid out of the estate to May Biery at once. The gift is an absolute one: \u201cMay to get one thousand dollars out of My estateand the direction to withhold the payment until such time as she is likely to make proper use of the money is an attempt to circumvent the rule of public policy forbidding restraint in the use or disposition of property in which no one but the beneficiary has an interest : Shallcross\u2019s Est., 200 Pa. 122.\nAnd now May 7,1915, it is ordered that the prayer of the petition so far as it relates to an outfit is refused, and that so far as it relates to the payment of $1,000.00 the executors do pay the said sum to May Biery, the costs of the proceeding to be paid by the estate.\nThe lower court entered a decree refusing the prayer of the petition so far as it related to an outfit, and directed that the executors pay the sum of $1,000 to May Biery, petitioner. Petitioner appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was the decree of the court.\nWilliam Kerper Stevens, for appellant.\nD. N. Schaeffer, of D. N. Schaeffer & Son, for appellee.\nMay 15, 1916:"
