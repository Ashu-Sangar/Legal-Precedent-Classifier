The propriety of this rule as adopted by the court below cannot be questioned. It was here found as a fact, that counsel for defendant had notice of the filing of the amended statement, and that he failed to file an affidavit of defense thereto. Judgment was, therefore, properly entered for the plaintiff.\nJudgment affirmed.",
