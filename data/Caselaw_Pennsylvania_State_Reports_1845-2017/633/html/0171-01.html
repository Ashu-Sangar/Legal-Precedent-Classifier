River Station’s Brief at 14-15. River Station adds that Pa. R.C.P. 1651-1661 are dispositive herein and reasons that because a joint reading of the aforementioned statutes clearly requires a complaint to obtain judgment on a mechanics’ lien claim to be filed as a new action, Terra Technical did not commence an action when it filed its complaints under the same court and term numbers as the mechanics’ lien claims, for the filing merely became part of an existing action. River Station’s Brief at 17-18. River Station highlights that Pa. R.C.P. 1653 requires an action upon a mechanics’ lien to be commenced by the filing of a complaint or an agreement for an amicable action and that such action is not commenced by the mere filing of a mechanics’ lien claim or where a party files a mechanics’ lien claim followed by a complaint in civil action to obtain judgment upon the mechanics’ lien claim in the same proceeding. River Station claims a complaint to obtain judgment upon a mechanics’ lien claim must be commenced as any other civil action which “necessarily, though incidentally,” requires the prothonotary to assign a new court and term number and the plaintiff to serve the complaint by original service of process.

River Station’s Brief at 19 <em>quoting </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1652(a). In addition, River Station contends Pa.R.C.P. 1656’s requisite that the complaint set forth the name and address of each party to the action and indicate the court terms and number along with the date of the filing of the mechanics lien claim and attach a copy thereof as an exhibit to the complaint <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>indicates the complaint must be filed separately as an original civil action.

It acknowledges that Pa.R.C.P. 126 allows courts to overlook only those procedural defects which do not prejudice an opposing party’s rights and argues that to do so herein would certainly prejudice it in light of the trial court’s July 25, 2012, Order striking the mechanics’ liens.

River Station concludes that, notwithstanding, this Commonwealth’s Rules of Civil Procedure supersede any local rules and other practices of the courts of common pleas which makes these arguments merit-less.

As the Superior Court stressed in <em>Hogg, </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1659 indicates an owner’s praecipe for a rule directing a claimant to file a complaint within twenty days, and the claimant’s subsequent filing of the complaint in response to the rule, logically would be filed to the existing docket number as would the issuance of the rule. In addition, the prothonota-ry’s entry of judgment if a complaint had not been filed <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>necessarily would be to the same docket number as the previously filed claim.</p>

While River Station contends this rule would be unnecessary were it possible for an action to obtain judgment upon a mechanics’ lien claim to be maintained as part of the underlying claim, it cited only Subsection (a) in support of this argument; under Subsection (b) it is feasible for a complaint to obtain judgment upon several previously filed lien claims against property situated in several counties to be filed in just one of those counties. Under such circumstances, the mandates of Pa.R.C.P. 1656(2) would be apposite, for the existing claims in the other counties would not be a part of the docket assigned to the complaint filed in a single county. Furthermore, Pa.R.C.P. 1657 provides “[n]o other cause of action may be joined with an action to obtain judgment on a [mechanics’ lien] claim except that where the improvement is located in more than one county and claims have been filed in more than one of said counties the plaintiff may join the claims in a single action.” Pa.R.C.P. 1657. Once again, the joining of multiple, previously filed mechanics’ lien claims in a single complaint to obtain judgment thereon would explain a need for the complaint to set forth the court and number and date of filing of all prior claims and to attach them as an exhibit, as such information would not be readily available in the complaint’s docket.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">17</a>
