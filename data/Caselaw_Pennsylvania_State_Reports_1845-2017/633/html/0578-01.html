Stradley and Krekstein, <em>Corporate Taxation and Procedure in Pennsylvania </em>§ 856 (1942). This tax was initially applied only to the gross annual receipts of railroad, canal, and transportation companies which were incorporated in Pennsylvania and which did not pay income taxes. However, gradually, as the industrialization of our Commonwealth progressed, the scope of the tax was expanded by the legislature, such that, by the late 1870’s, it included companies which received extensive revenue from the utilization of emerging technologies, including, <em>inter alia, </em>steamboat, streetcar, telegraph, and pipeline corporations. <em>See </em>Act of June 7,1879, P.L. 112, Section 7.</p>

Thereafter, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue, with the approval of the Pennsylvania Auditor General (“Taxing Departments”), prepared a proposed “tax settlement” with Verizon which increased its total taxable gross receipts to $2,427,676,531, and assessed Verizon an additional $47,657,590 in gross receipts tax.

The court—the Honorable Frank B. Wickersham—ruled that the gross receipts stemming from both activities were subject to the gross receipts tax since they were within the business purpose for which Bell had been incorporated, i.e., the rendition of telephone service.</p>

      <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>In <em>Bell II, </em>Judge Wickersham considered the effect of the 1925 amendments to 72 P.S. § 2181, which levied the gross receipts tax on revenue a telephone company acquired from “telephone traffic” occurring wholly within Pennsylvania, on the taxable status of the gross receipts Bell received from sales of advertising in phone directories, and from the installation of telephone equipment and service by its employees, including the performance of custom work at the subscriber’s request. Judge Wickersham concluded that the legislature’s substitution of the term “traffic” for “business” in 72 P.S. § 2181, via the 1925 amendments, rendered both of these activities non-taxable.</p>
    <p id="b640-4" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[266,947,1155,1172]]]'>Judge Wickersham found that, while the legislature did not specifically define the term telephone “traffic,” the shift in the focus of the statutory language from “business” to “traffic” was, to him, indicative of the legislature’s intent that “traffic” was to have a different meaning than “business” and was to encompass a narrower class of activities. In Judge Wickers-ham’s view, it was significant that the legislature had also amended 72 P.S. § 2181 in 1925 to provide that gross receipts from the business of electric companies would no longer be taxed, but, rather, that only gross receipts from the sale of electricity would be taxable. Judge Wickersham considered this to be indicative of the legislature’s intent to make uniform the imposition of the gross receipts tax on electric light, water power, hydro-electric, and telephone and telegraph companies by allowing it to be assessed only on the provision by these companies of particular services; thus, he interpreted telephone traffic to mean the transmission of telephone messages. Applying this interpretation, he concluded that gross receipts from the sales of phone directory advertising and from the installation of telephone equipment and service were not taxable since such revenues were not received by the company from its transmission of telephone messages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The court acknowledged that <em>Bell III </em>did not specifically address the question of the taxability of directory assistance services; nevertheless, the court interpreted that case as requiring that the gross receipts tax be assessed on revenue obtained from the provision of any service which makes the transmission of telephone messages more effective and satisfactory. The court also noted that, in order for one of Verizon’s customers to obtain directory assistance, or to be connected to the number he or she was looking for, the customer was required to dial one of Verizon’s operators, or its automated directory assistance platform—an act involving transmitting a telephone message.

The court determined that, similarly, when Verizon’s employees installed, moved, or changed telephone lines and service for its customers, or repaired their telephone lines, no transmission of phone messages was involved; thus, it concluded that revenue Verizon received from these activities was not subject to the gross receipts tax under 72 P.S. § 8101(a)(2).</p>

In Verizon’s view, our <em>Bell III </em>decision was erroneously decided, and, thus, it argues we should not adhere to the doctrine of <em>stare decisis. </em>Instead, <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>Verizon urges that we reconsider that decision and refuse to apply its holding to resolve the question of whether revenue it derives from the services and equipment at issue in this appeal is subject to the gross receipts tax. In support of this contention, Verizon argues that our Court in <em>Bell III </em>wrongly referenced the <em>Pullman </em>decision, <em>see supra </em>note 10, as support for our holding because that ease involved the interpretation of a different version of the gross receipts tax not at issue, and, also, because, in its view, our Court did not properly recognize that the legislature’s change in the subject of the gross receipts tax paid by telephone companies, from telephone “traffic” in the 1925 version of the gross receipts tax, to “telephone messages transmitted” in the 1929 version of the gross receipts tax, signified its intent to ascribe a wholly different meaning to the latter phrase. Verizon, relying on Section 1921(b) of the Statutory Construction Act, proffers that our Court should undertake a reinterpretation of the words “telephone messages transmitted” and define them in accordance with what it characterizes as their plain meaning.</p>
    <p id="b647-4" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[159,1324,1155,1013]],["BL_648.1",648,[268,282,1150,415]]]'>To establish what it considers to be the plain meaning of the terms “message” and “transmitted,” Verizon relies on various secondary sources, such as telecommunications industry manuals which define a message as a “completed call, i.e., a communication in which conversation or exchange of information took place between the calling and called parties,” and dictionaries of the English language such as Webster’s, which defines “transmitted” as “to send or convey from one person or place to another.” Appellant’s Brief at 25-27 (quoting, <em>inter alia, Newton’s Telecom Dictionary </em>592-93 (24th ed.2008) and <em>Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, </em>1329 (11th ed.2012)). Based upon these definitions, Verizon argues that the plain meaning of “telephone messages transmitted” limits the application of the gross receipts tax to only completed phone calls which take place entirely within Pennsylvania, and, thus, such tax should be assessed only on a per-message basis. Verizon maintains that its suggested interpretation is also supported by the fact that, when the legislature extended the tax in 2003, it specified a required origin and billing address <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>for interstate telephone messages in order to make them taxable,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Verizon argues that, when the legislature has intended that a tax be calculated on telecommunications services other than on a per-message basis, it has plainly said so in the taxing statute, citing as an example the sales tax which is imposed on the total amount customers pay for telecommunications services, whether or not such service is charged to the customer by flat rate or by individual message.</p>
    <p id="b648-4" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[269,718,1151,509]]]'>Additionally, Verizon suggests that the Federal Excise Tax (“FET”) as it existed in 1919 provides suitable guidance on how the 1929 version of our gross receipts tax should be interpreted, as the FET was also imposed on the transmission of telephone messages, but separately levied any wire leased from the telephone company. Thus, in Verizon’s view, the fact that Congress did not consider an excise tax on messages to be broad enough to encompass charges for private lines should inform our interpretation of the 1929 gross receipts taxing statute.</p>
    <p id="b648-5" data-blocks='[["BL_648.5",648,[269,1256,1152,624]]]'>Further, Verizon, relying on the expert report and deposition testimony of Dr. William E. Taylor, an economist with expertise in telecommunications issues, argues that our Court failed to take into account important public policy and economic considerations in determining what constituted “telephone messages transmitted” in the 1929 version of the gross receipts tax. Verizon claims that it was the General Assembly’s desire to promote universal access to the telephone network by not imposing the tax on equipment or services which only allowed access, but, instead, restricting the tax to use of the telephone network to send long distance messages, which was a luxury only a few subscribers could afford at that time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

The Commonwealth argues that, because the General Assembly did not alter this controlling statutory language after our Court interpreted it in <em>Bell III, </em>even though it has amended the gross receipts tax statute repeatedly since the time of that decision, this establishes that our Court’s interpretation is in accord with the General Assembly’s intent as to the proper meaning of this phrase.</p>

The Commonwealth also disputes that the 2003 amendments to 72 P.S. § 8101(a)(2) had any effect on our Court’s interpretation in <em>Bell III </em>since, in its view, those amendments merely expanded the scope of the tax to include interstate commerce, but did not change the operative language—“telephone messages transmitted”—which remains the same and is applied in the relevant intrastate and interstate commercial contexts.</p>

As the Commonwealth Court and the parties have recognized, our Court in <em>Bell III </em>construed this very language, which was also contained in the 1941 version of the gross receipts tax, 72 P.S. § 2181 (repealed), at issue in that case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> Consequently, the majority of Verizon’s arguments, which are structured as if our Court were undertaking an original interpretation of this terminology by urging that we employ traditional methods of statutory construction to ascertain its meaning—e.g., looking to dictionary definitions, the interpretation of similar language in federal laws by federal courts, and public policy considerations—have little applicability.

As discussed <em>supra, </em>in 2000, the General Assembly amended 72 P.S. § 8101 to expressly exclude from the category of subjects of taxation comprising “telephone messages transmitted” certain services which telephone companies such as Verizon directly sell to all customers, namely, sales of access to the internet. 72 P.S. § 8101(a)(2)(i).

First, Verizon argues that, under the plain language of 72 P.S. § 8101(a)(2), only receipts it derives from the actual transmission of messages are taxable, and, thus, the revenues it garners from its provision of private lines to its customers are not taxable since it does not bill its customers for this service <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>based on the number of telephone messages which are transmitted over the private lines, but, rather, it charges them one flat monthly fee for the lines.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> Verizon deems it irrelevant that the private lines may be used to transmit telephone messages, as it reasons that only charges for actual telephone messages, i.e,, completed calls, are taxable. Verizon further contends that the Commonwealth Court’s decision improperly expands the scope of the <em>Bell III </em>decision inasmuch as it views that decision as resting on Bell Telephone’s concession that standard equipment and main lines are taxable; hence, according to Verizon, it was logical that our Court would conclude that the supplemental equipment and lines attached to the main lines were, by extension, also taxable.

The Commonwealth urges that Verizon’s present argument should also be rejected, since, just like the auxiliary lines in <em>Bell III, </em>the private lines at issue in this case have no other purpose except for transmitting messages; thus, receipts from the provision of those lines should be considered subject to the gross receipts tax.

We, therefore, have little difficulty in concluding these private lines render the process of telephone communication more effective and satisfactory for Verizon’s customers who purchase such lines.

A customer uses Verizon’s directory assistance service when he or she does not know the telephone number of the party he or <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>she is trying to call; thus, in those situations, when the customer pays Verizon a fee for use of this service, the purpose of the payment is for Verizon’s employee, or its automated program, to access Verizon’s telephone subscriber database and find the phone number the customer needs, in order for the customer to call the party he or she is trying to reach. Since dialing the correct telephone number is an indispensable component of the customer’s actual placing of the telephone call to the party he or she is trying to reach, the customer’s payment for access to this number is not merely, as Verizon suggests, to acquire the information about the number for its own sake; rather, the customer is paying the fee so that he or she can then use the information to perform the act of transmitting a telephone message to the party. Thus, because Verizon’s directory assistance service fulfills the purpose of making the process of the transmission of telephone messages more satisfactory to the customer by enabling the customer to transmit the telephone messages to the party of his or her choice, fees Verizon charges its customers for that service are properly taxable under 72 P.S. § 8101(a)(2), as the Board of Finance and Revenue and the Commonwealth Court determined.</p>

This service enables a customer, while on the line with the operator who has retrieved the telephone number from Verizon’s database, or while still connected to Verizon’s automated directory assistance platform, to have that operator or the platform immediately place a call to that telephone number. The customer thus avoids the need to transcribe the number, disconnect the call with the operator or platform, and then redial the number of the party with whom he or she wishes to communicate. This saves the customer time and enables him or her to make the telephone call, i.e., to transmit a telephone message, in a more expedient and convenient fashion; hence, the Connec-tReQuest service makes the process of transmitting a telephone message more satisfactory for the customer than had <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>the customer not used it.

Instead, in the Commonwealth’s view, the Commonwealth Court incorrectly applied Judge Wickersham’s ruling in <em>Bell II, </em>which interpreted the 1925 statute which had different language and is no longer in effect. The Commonwealth contends that our Court specifically recognized in <em>Bell III </em>that revenue from code calling systems and signal apparatus constituted taxable gross receipts, since such equipment allowed the transmission of telephone messages to take place by informing a person away from his or her telephone that there was an incoming call—thereby permitting that person to answer the call and receive the message.</p>

Verizon argues this is consistent with its view that the plain language of the statute allows the tax to be imposed only on actual messages transmitted and, thus, its imposition is restricted to completed telephone calls. Verizon again renews its contention that allowing services to be taxed, merely because they render telephone communications more effective or satisfactory, significantly expands the scope of the gross <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>receipts tax to include all business activities of telephone companies, as, from its perspective, the majority of such activities are done for the purposes of customer service.

As we have discussed above, the 1925 statute interpreted by Judge Wickersham in <em>Bell II </em>imposed the gross receipts tax on telephone “traffic,” not on “telephone messages transmitted,” as did the 1941 statute at issue in <em>Bell III, </em>and as does the current version of the gross receipts tax. Consequently, our Court’s interpretation of “telephone messages transmitted” in <em>Bell III </em>was the first time our Court construed this language, and, as that decision remains the governing interpretation regarding the taxability of the sales of telephone equipment and services, it controls the disposition of this matter.</p>

Thus, we agree with the Commonwealth that, when a customer pays Verizon a one-time fee for its installation of telephone lines, this unquestionably makes his or her ability to transmit telephone messages more effective, since, absent those lines, the making and receiving of telephone calls is impossible. Likewise, when a customer pays for repair service for telephone lines, this also has the result of making telephone service more effective, since, as the Commonwealth suggests, the customer would not pay for such repairs unless he or she <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>was experiencing difficulty transmitting messages through the telephone lines. As the performance of the repair service removes the customer’s obstacles to the transmission of telephone messages by fixing the problems with the lines that led to the impediment, it ultimately makes the customer’s ability to transmit telephone messages more effective.

National Bell Telephone Company—founded in 1877 by its namesake and the original patent holder for the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell—had been in existence at that time for only a little over a decade, but it underwent rapid growth and expansion of its customer base thereafter, so that, by 1889, it had a national network of wholly owned subsidiary corporations responsible for building and maintaining the physical infrastructure of “local" phone networks, i.e., the networks situated within individual cities and states. These local networks transmitted phone messages between subscribers to the network and provided the equipment for customers to send and receive such messages in their homes and businesses. (In Pennsylvania, National Bell’s subsidiary was incorporated in 1879 and originally known as the Bell Telephone Company of Philadelphia, which was later changed in 1907 to Bell Telephone of Pennsylvania, a corporate predecessor of Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania, which, in turn, became Verizon Pennsylvania. <em>See </em>(Verizon Bell Atlantic Corporation, Corporate History, available at <em>http://ti-ansition.fcc.gov/wcb/armis/carrier-filing-history/COSAJHistory/ bntr.htm)). </em>National Bell, through a separate subsidiary, American Telephone and Telegraph ("AT &amp; T”), built and operated long distance lines for transmission of interstate phone messages and sold long distance phone service to customers separately from the local phone services offered by its other subsidiaries.

Amicus </em>contends that the rationale of <em>Bell III, </em>which regarded the purchase of telephone equipment and services as synonymous with "messages transmitted,” was the product of Bell telephone’s monopoly status at that time, since Bell both transmitted telephone messages on its network, and also provided to the customer all telephone equipment, wiring, and installation services.

Thus, it is only a telephone company’s receipts from the sale of those pieces of equipment which facilitate the transmission of telephone messages by acting as an instrumentality for the electromechanical sending and receiving of such messages, and only a telephone company’s receipts from the sale of those services which make the process of sending and receiving telephone messages more satisfactory for the purchaser, which are subject to this tax. This tax, therefore, does not cover receipts which a company such as Verizon derives from other aspects of its overall business activities which do not serve these core purposes.</p>

I find this state of affairs an unhappy one and would welcome a decision by the <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>legislative branch to enter the field and provide guidance; in the interim, however, I am constrained to concur with the majority’s position that the judicial gloss set down in <em>Bell III </em>applies here. With that said, we should, at a minimum, construe <em>Bell III </em>strictly by not extending its rationale to items that are even less connected with actual “telephone messages transmitted” than those at issue in <em>Bell III.</em>

Yet, this rationale conflates the difference between making something more effective or satisfying, and making something possible. To say the transmission of telephone messages is more effective or more satisfying is to measure the degree of a customer’s contentment with existing services or apparatus against his contentment with additional services or apparatus. Said another way, for the transmission of telephone messages to be more effective or satisfying, there must be a baseline that is increased by additional services or apparatus provided by the telephone company. Here, however, there is no baseline increased by Verizon’s installation, repair, or relocation of telephone lines because these services simply make transmission of telephone messages possible, but do not improve it; these services <em>are </em>the baseline that <em>other </em>services and apparatus, such as those discussed in <em>Bell III, </em>make more effective or satisfying.</p>

First, the Majority suggests the repairing of telephone lines makes the transmission of messages more effective because, prior to repair, transmission is impossible. <em>Id., </em>at 609-10, 127 A.3d at 764. However, I believe this reasoning broadens the <em>Bell III </em>standard far beyond the bounds intended by this Court, and may result in the taxation of nearly all “troubleshooting” services that make transmission possible if provided to customers at a charge. Second, the focus of the Majority’s rationale regarding Verizon’s relocation of customers’ telephone lines is misplaced. As noted above, the <em>Bell III </em>Court centered its analysis on the purpose of the service or apparatus used. Here, however, the Majority ignores the purpose of the service provided by Verizon, <em>ie., </em>making the transmission of telephone messages possible, and instead focuses on the purpose of the customer’s request for service, <em>ie., </em>“to better suit the customer’s needs and wishes!.]” <em>Id., </em>at 610, 127 A.3d at 764.
