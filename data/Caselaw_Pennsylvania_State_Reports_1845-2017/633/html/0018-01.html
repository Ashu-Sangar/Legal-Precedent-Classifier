He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (“ICU”) and given medication, which failed to alleviate his symptoms. As a result, Decedent, who suffered from a number of pre-existing conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, was intubated and placed on a ventilator in order to assist with his breathing. Decedent remained on a ventilator in critical condition for ten days.</p>
    <p id="b76-8" data-blocks='[["BL_76.9",76,[262,1661,1152,469]]]'>On January 9, 2009, in an attempt to wean Decedent from the ventilator, a physician at the Hospital performed a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure in which an opening is made through the neck into the trachea,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and a tube is inserted through the opening in order to provide an airway. Because Decedent was going to be placed back on a ventilator after the tracheotomy, a tracheotomy cuff, which is an inflatable device that secures the tracheotomy tube to the sides of a patient’s trachea, was placed around the tube and inflated.</p>
    <p id="b76-9" data-blocks='[["BL_76.10",76,[261,2154,1151,97]],["BL_77.1",77,[187,288,1155,686]]]'>On January 10, 2009, Decedent was seen by his pulmonary physician, Dr. Eugene Lugano, who documented a plan to <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>wean Decedent off the ventilator and use a “trach collar,” which would allow Decedent to receive oxygen through an aerosol mask instead of a mechanical ventilator. The plan was implemented that day at approximately 12:30 p.m., at which time the tracheotomy cuff was deflated. At approximately 4:30 p.m. that afternoon, Nurse Lori Yakish noticed a moderate to large amount of blood coming from the site of Decedent’s tracheotomy<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and reported this to the attending physician, Dr. John Sprandio. Dr. Sprandio advised Nurse Yakish to monitor the situation. Approximately one-half hour later, Nurse Yakish rolled Decedent over so she could clean his back, at which time a large amount of fresh blood began to squirt from the tracheotomy site.</p>
    <p id="b77-4" data-blocks='[["BL_77.5",77,[189,999,1154,1219]],["BL_78.1",78,[289,280,1150,521]]]'>A team of medical personnel, including anesthesiologist Dr. Stephen Glasser, immediately responded to Decedent’s room, and determined that Decedent’s tracheotomy tube had become blocked, depriving Decedent of an airway. Dr. Glasser testified that, when he arrived, other medical professionals were attending to Decedent’s tracheotomy site, and Decedent appeared stable. At approximately 5:00 p.m., Dr. Nora Malais-rie, an ear, nose, and throat (“ENT”) physician, arrived in Decedent’s room. At this time, Dr. Glasser received another page, requiring him to leave the room, but he asked two of the nurse anesthesiologists to remain. Dr. Malaisrie attempted to ascertain the location of Decedent’s blockage using a broncho-scope. She observed clotted blood near the bottom of the tracheotomy tube, and attempted to clear it using a saline lavage. Unable to clear the blockage, Dr. Malaisrie inserted a tube into Decedent’s mouth and used an “ambu bag” to try and force air through the tube into Decedent’s lungs. When those measures failed to remedy Decedent’s inability to breathe, Dr. Malaisrie removed the tube from Decedent’s mouth and attempted to reinsert another tube through the existing site in Decedent’s neck; however, the tube went into Decedent’s thorax, rather than into his trachea, as intended. As a result, when medical personnel began to force air <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>through the improperly-placed tube, the air accumulated outside of Decedent’s lungs, causing his lungs and trachea to collapse. At this point, Dr. Glasser returned to Decedent’s room, and determined that Decedent was not getting air into his lungs. Dr. Glasser instructed that the improperly-placed tube be removed, and that Decedent again be intubated through his mouth. Once properly intubated, Decedent began to receive air into his lungs; however, by this time, Decedent had suffered cardiac arrest, and he was pronounced dead at 6:36 p.m.</p>
    <p id="b78-5" data-blocks='[["BL_78.5",78,[289,824,1151,628]]]'>Appellant, as executor of Decedent’s estate, commenced a negligence action against the Hospital and several individual defendants, including Nurse Yakish, in June 2009. Appellant alleged that Nurse Yakish was negligent and deviated from the appropriate standard of care by failing to properly care for and treat Decedent following his tracheotomy procedure; by moving Decedent too soon after his tracheotomy procedure; and by failing to properly monitor, observe, and oversee Decedent following his tracheotomy procedure. <em>See </em>Fourth Amended Complaint, at Count IV. Appellant further alleged that the Hospital was vicariously liable, <em>inter alia, </em>for the negligence of Dr. Malaisrie.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b79-4" data-blocks='[["BL_79.5",79,[190,454,1155,1370]]]'>At the close of Appellant’s case, the Hospital moved for a nonsuit as to all defendants, with the exception of Nurse Yakish. The following day, the trial judge granted a nonsuit as to all defendants, including Nurse Yakish. With regard to Dr. Malaisrie, the trial court acknowledged that Appellant presented expert testimony that Dr. Malaisrie had deviated from the standard of care, but concluded Appellant failed to establish that Dr. Malaisrie was an ostensible agent of the Hospital, as required under the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Act, 40 P.S. §§ 1303.101-1303.910 (“MCARE Act”). Specifically, the trial court determined that Appellant failed to offer any evidence that a reasonably prudent person in Decedent’s position would have been justified in the belief that the care in question was rendered by the Hospital or its agents. <em>Id. </em>§ 1303.516(a)(1). The trial court highlighted that Appellant did not present any witnesses to testify regarding “how the agency structure of the hospital was set up regarding ENT physicians ... in the Hospital’s facilities,” nor did Appellant present the testimony of Appellant’s brother “as to how Dr. Malaisrie presented herself as to agency, or whether a reasonable patient would believe she was an agent of the hospital.” Trial Court Opinion, 4/15/13, at 3-4. With regard to Nurse Yakish, the trial court opined that Appellant “failed to demonstrate that any action taken by or attributable to Nurse Yakish was the cause of Decedent’s death.” <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>
    <p id="b79-5" data-blocks='[["BL_79.6",79,[191,1857,1153,463]]]'>Appellant’s subsequent motion to remove the nonsuit and his request for other post-trial relief were denied. On appeal to the Superior Court, Appellant argued that the trial court erred in removing the question of the ostensible agency of Dr. Malaisrie from the jury, and, additionally, erred in precluding Nurse Pierce from offering an opinion as to whether Nurse Yakish’s negligence was a medical cause of Decedent’s death. A split three-judge panel of the Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s order.</p>

Pennsylvania Hosp., </em>2868 EDA 2012, unpublished memorandum at 7, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%201095" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="96 A.3d 1095">96 A.3d 1095</a> (Pa.Super. filed Jan. 30, 2014). Specifically, Judge Platt concluded that Appellant failed to offer any evidence “as to the extent of Dr. Malaisrie’s duties or responsibilities at Pennsylvania Hospital, let alone the manner in which she presented herself to Decedent while treating him.” <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. Acknowledging Appellant’s argument that Decedent sought care from the Hospital, rather than from a specific physician, Judge Platt noted that Appellant “fails to acknowledge that, throughout the litigation, the Hospital denied that Dr. Malaisrie was its agent, nor did Appellant present evidence to establish the extent of Dr. Malaisrie’s relationship with Pennsylvania Hospital.” <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[271,1253,1155,729]]]'>Judge Platt further rejected Appellant’s contention that the trial court erred in precluding Nurse Pierce from testifying that Nurse Yakish’s actions were a cause of Decedent’s injuries, noting that the case on which Appellant relied in support of his argument, <em>Freed v.

Judge Platt further observed that the trial court specifically found that Nurse Pierce could not testify “outside the area of his expertise,” a determination Appellant failed to acknowledge. <em>Green, </em>2868 EDA 2012, at 15.

However, regarding the ostensible agency issue, Judge Shogan dissented, concluding that the facts, when viewed in the light most favorable to Appellant, indicated that Dr. Malaisrie was involved in Decedent's care as part of the emergency team that responded to <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>the Hospital’s page when blood began to discharge from Decedent’s tracheotomy site, and that, because Dr. Malaisrie attended Decedent at the request of the Hospital, not Decedent himself, the question of whether a prudent person in Decedent’s position would have been justified in the belief that the care he received was rendered by the Hospital or its agents should have been decided by the jury.</p>

In our view, the requirement for establishing ostensible agency under Section 1303.516(a)(1)—where the evidence must show that a reasonably prudent person in the patient’s position would be justified in the belief that the care in question was being rendered by the hospital or its agents—is substantially the same as the requirement for establishing ostensible agency under Section 429 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts—where the recipient of services must demonstrate a reasonable belief that the services were rendered by the employer or by his servants. Accordingly, <em>Capan, Simmons, </em>and the cases from our sister states are instructive on the underlying question of whether, and under what circumstances, a reasonably prudent person in Decedent’s position would be justified in believing the care in question was being rendered by the Hospital or its agents.</p>

It is undisputed that Decedent first entered the Hospital through the emergency room, and ultimately was admitted to the ICU. The Hospital does not dispute that, after Nurse Yakish observed blood “squirting” from Decedent’s tracheotomy site, anesthesiology and ENT services were paged. <em>See </em>N.T., 6/5/12, at 60 (Dr. Salgo testifying that “the ENT service and anesthesiology services were asked to help. Anesthesiology showed up and so did ENT after anesthesiology.”); N.T., 6/6/12, at 7 (Dr. Glasser testifying that at approximately 4:30 p.m. on January 10, 2009, “there was a page for anesthesia services to come to the Intensive Care Unit. The page we get on our beeper or an overhead page.”). Dr. Glasser testified that he remained in Decedent’s room “until the ENT physician arrived, and whose patient it primarily was.” <em>Id. </em>at 11. He estimated that Dr. <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>Malaisrie arrived in Decedent’s room ten minutes after he did. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Dr. Glasser further testified that, shortly after Dr. Malaisrie arrived, he received another page and left the room. <em>Id. </em>at 42 (“I was paged to go to the other area. I wouldn’t have gone to the other area, but the Doctor had arrived and she was the primary service for that patient for the tracheotomy so I did leave, yes.”). When Dr. Glasser returned approximately 15 minutes later, he observed that Decedent was “stable,” but coughing and “breathing on his own, possibly intermittently. They were assisting him with the bag, but it wasn’t at all times. And he was stable at that time, but he was still having the coughing and bleeding a little bit.” <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>

Accordingly, we hold that the trial court’s grant of a nonsuit under Section 1303.516(a) was erroneous in the instant case, and that the question of whether a reasonably prudent person in Decedent’s position would be justified in his belief that the care rendered by Dr. Malaisrie was rendered by her as an agent of the Hospital should have proceeded to the jury.
