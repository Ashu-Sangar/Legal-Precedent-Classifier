According to the Superior Court, the notice of potential falsity in <em>Weaver </em>came from the plaintiffs defamation complaint that informed the author that his statement was false, “as tested against public record.” Super. Ct. Mem. Op. at 45. Specifically, the defamatory statement in <em>Weaver </em>included an assertion that the police officer had been arraigned on charges of sexual molestation, a fact which the police officer denied in his defamation complaint and which could have been tested by reviewing the public record. The Superior Court reasoned that unlike the complaint in <em>Weaver, </em>the facta contained in the Garb and Feudale opinions could not be verified against the public record because of their association with secret, grand jury proceedings. Accordingly, based on this factual distinction, the Superior Court held that unlike the defamation complaint in <em>Weaver, </em>the Garb opinion was not relevant evidence “that rises to the level of official ‘notice’ sufficient to cause the [NJewspaper to doubt its articles or to show the [Njewspaper’s actual malice’ ” with regard to the publication of any of the articles.

The Newspaper emphasizes that this inference flows only from a defendant’s decision to republish the defamatory statement despite notice that the statements are verifiably false. In this respect, the Newspaper relies on a Superior Court case which held that publication of a statement in the face of the plaintiffs denial of the truth of that statement may be probative of actual malice only if the denial is verifiable, <em>see Curran v.

In this respect, the Newspaper argues that the notice document in <em>Weaver </em>(the plaintiffs defamation complaint) alerted the defendant to the falsity of the objectively verifiable fact that the plaintiff had never been arraigned for a crime, a matter of public record. By contrast, according to the Newspaper, the judicial opinions were not verifiable and therefore did not provide it with obvious reason to doubt the veracity of its January 12, 2004 article, and cannot support a reasonable inference of actual malice resulting from the subsequent articles. The Newspaper perceives this difference to be dispositive.</p>
    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[261,1034,1155,843]]]'>The Newspaper further focuses on the fact that neither Judge Garb nor Judge Feudale were present when Appellants testified before the grand jury, and their review of the cold record could not reveal anything about the jury’s reaction to their testimony, which was the subject of the Newspaper’s articles. Characterizing the judicial opinions as mere personal views rather than factual adjudications, the Newspaper asserts they are non-binding dicta entitled to no weight or authority and are insufficient to provide notice of falsity that would lead to a reasonable inference of malice arising from republication. According to the Newspaper, the Superior Court properly applied <em>Weaver </em>to these facts and concluded that the judicial opinions were not relevant to actual malice because they did not amount to a verifiable denial or otherwise provide it with an obvious reason to doubt the veracity of its reporting.</p>

The Newspaper continues that permitting the jury to hear the judges’ <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>hearsay impressions about a newspaper article reporting on what the grand jurors said and how they felt about Appellants’ testimony would be fundamentally unfair because none of the individuals would be in court and subject to cross-examination. According to the Newspaper, Appellants’ argument that the judicial opinions are being offered merely to show that the Newspaper had notice of their content (casting doubt on its source) does not cure the hearsay problem because the jurors would have to believe the judges’ statements contained therein to understand what the opinions were being offered to prove. Nor would a limiting instruction cure the risk that the jury would consider the judicial opinions for their truth because, the Newspaper argues, the court’s instruction would absurdly have to advise the jury as follows: that it could consider the judicial opinions as evidence that the Newspaper knew its January 12, 2004 article was false (or recklessly disregarded whether it was false), but that it could not consider the opinions as evidence of whether the article actually was false.</p>

All agree they are hearsay opinions about falsity and thus not admissible on the issue of falsity. I dissent because I believe a limiting instruction is insufficient to ensure the jury will not consider these opinions as proof the publications were in fact false; it would be asking the impossible of jurors to do so, and thus, I find them unfairly prejudicial if admitted before the jury finds the articles are in fact false.</p>
    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.9",312,[265,1123,1155,823]]]'>With all due respect to counsel’s choice of trial strategy, that “right” is hardly sacrosanct or absolute, nor is it even remotely of constitutional magnitude. There are always considerations that can cause counsel’s plans to give way, particularly where strategy confounds the prospects of a fair verdict—a fair trial must trump a lawyer’s strategy every time. And there really is but one strategic reason to insist on introducing the opinions before proving the articles are false, and that reason is obvious—limiting instruction or no, judicial opinions saying the articles are false simply cannot be ignored by jurors who have the task of deciding whether those articles are false. No other reasonable strategic rationale appears, and it is a good strategy, for after having heard that evidence, can we honestly believe the jury could return with a verdict that says those judges lied, that despite what these judges said, the articles are <em>not </em>false?</p>

    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[178,615,1156,737]]]'>With all respect, in my view, this general notion of “amelioration by instruction” is unrealistic here. The evidence of malice and falsity cannot be sequestered by merely instructing the jury to ignore the judges’ statements that the articles are false before deciding whether the articles are, in fact, false. <em>See generally </em>McCormick on Evidence § 59, at 408-09 (7th ed. 2013) (“Some hearsay problems cry out for the invocation of Rule 403. Assume that the proponent offers an out-of-court statement for a nonhearsay purpose but on its face the declaration asserts facts directly relevant to a critical issue in the case and the declarant would presumably have personal knowledge of the facts. Here common sense suggests that there is a grave risk that the jurors will misuse the testimony as substantive evidence.”).</p>

Chmiel, </em><a href="/pa/612/0333-02" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="612 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="4204257,4205332" data-case-paths="/pa/612/0333-02,/pa/612/0333-01">612 Pa. 333</a>, <a href="/pa/612/0333-02" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="30 A.3d 1111" data-case-ids="4204257,4205332,7282600,7282701" data-case-paths="/pa/612/0333-02,/pa/612/0333-01,/a3d/30/1111-01,/a3d/30/1111-02">30 A.3d 1111</a>, 1147 (2011) (citation omitted), the issue is whether McCormick’s manifest “grave risk” should be ignored in this unique circumstance. I simply cannot agree the jurors will be able to disregard statements made by two judges opining on facts that are required for the very basic determination the jurors are to make. No matter the length or repetition of precise and completely understandable legal instructions, no matter the jurors’ desire to abide thereby, we cannot unring this bell. Do we really think the jurors will compartmentalize this manifestly pertinent evidence, turning a deaf ear and a blind eye to judicial statements, simply by telling them not to consider it? <em>Cf. Nipper v. Snipes, </em><a href="/f3d/7/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="7 F.3d 415" data-case-ids="10510720" data-case-paths="/f3d/7/0415-01">7 F.3d 415</a>, 418 (4th Cir.1993) (“[Jjudicial findings of fact present a rare case where, by virtue of their having been made by a judge, they would likely be given undue weight by the jury, thus creating a serious danger of unfair prejudice.” (citations and internal <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>quotation marks omitted)). This is a prospect so unlikely that we should not give it our imprimatur.</p>
    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[274,395,1152,567]]]'>The cure would not be complicated. A simple bifurcated trial on the questions of malice and falsity would eliminate the fiction that a jury could disregard the inadmissible evidence. That is, if the jury finds the articles were false, without hearing of the inadmissible judicial statements opining on falsity, that finding is fair; we are assured the prejudicial hearsay evidence was not considered. Only then would <em>ex parte </em>opinions on falsity be given to them, as evidence unique to the second question, malice. I view this as the best safeguard against unfair prejudice while providing appellants the latitude to present their case as they see fit.</p>
