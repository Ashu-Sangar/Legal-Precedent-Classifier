Pa.R.C.P. 1035.1(1), (2). The record here shows appellant Ralph Bailets was employed by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission from 1998 to 2008. Appellant achieved “outstanding” and “commendable” performance ratings while employed as the Commission’s manager of financial reporting and systems. Appellant’s Brief in Opposition to Appellees’ Motion for Summary Judgment, at 30 n. 69. During this time, appellant frequently complained that he <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>observed improprieties and wasteful practices regarding various matters, including a Commission computer systems contract with Ciber, Inc., EZPass discounts, politically motivated personnel actions, and the use of multiple, unnecessary external investment managers. Appellant’s job title and responsibilities were changed in June, 2008, he was removed from an additional position as assistant secretary-treasurer around the same time, and his employment by the Commission was ultimately terminated in November, 2008.</p>

Complaint, ¶ 12. In response to appellant’s criticism of the selection process, Maun allegedly stated, “You should not say anything about it,” and warned him not to “make any waves or your job will be in jeopardy.” <em>Id., </em>¶ 10; Deposition of Ralph M. Bailets, 5/10/18, at 41, 48, 89-91, 97. Appellant further claimed that, when Ciber was awarded a $62 million contract and began its work, he noted deficiencies in performance and initiated a series of meetings with Maun to discuss the problems, but there was no action in response to his complaints. Complaint, ¶¶ 18-16. Appellant also informed Maun about deficiencies in experience and training by Ciber’s consultants, and his concern that it appeared Ciber was angling to get another contract for supplemental <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>training, or “knowledge transfer.” Bailets Deposition, 7/24/13, at 303-04, 326; <em>id., </em>¶ 19-20.

Bailets Deposition, 5/10/13, at 147, 151; Deposition of Anthony Q. Maun, 3/14/11, at 86, 90, 91. Appellant told Maun there was a resulting potential loss of millions of dollars in toll revenue.

In addition, appellant discussed with Maun and Grieshaber his concerns about a policy by which Commissioners would “create, post and fill” staff positions in a single executive session, in derogation of competition and the regular merit selection process; appellant claims he and Grieshaber noted various political appointees who were hired at the Commission in this manner. <em>Id., </em>¶ 35; Bailets Deposition, 7/24/13, at 202-03, 208.

Specifically, the court held the allegations regarding Grieshaber did not support a Whistleblower claim because appellant did not report wrongdoing or waste to Grieshaber while he was his supervisor. <em>Id., </em>at 7-8. With regard to Maun, the court determined there was no report of “wrongdoing,” which it defined as wrongdoing by the employer or a violation of a law or code of conduct the employer is charged to enforce for the good of the public. <em>Id., </em>at 8 (citing <em>Sea v.

The court concluded there were legitimate reasons for firing appellant, and there was nothing in the record establishing the decision makers who terminated his position were even aware of appellant’s reports of alleged wrongdoing and waste; the evidence instead showed 15 positions were eliminated in November, 2008, because of “a poor economy, declining traffic, and necessary expense reductions across the Commission.” <em>Id., </em>at 11,</p>

We do not reach the first sub-issue contained in this claim, which relates to the presentment of the 33 rd Statewide Investigating Grand Jury. The investigation—during which appellant testified along with hundreds of others—resulted in corruption charges against several individuals, including Commission officials Mitchell Rubin, George Hatalowich, and Joseph Brimmeier, as well as Ciber's David Miller, and resulted in various guilty pleas. <em>See "8 </em>charged in alleged turnpike corruption,” Brad Bumsted and Tom Fontaine, http://triblive.com/news/ adminpage/3652326-74/tumpike-formerbrimmeier#axzz3cgXrDFCD (retrieved June 10, 2015); "Turnpike Prosecutions End with Convictions But No Jail Time," http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2014/ll/21/ turnpike-prosecutions-end-with-convictions-but-no-jail-time/ (retrieved June 10, 2015); <em>see also </em>"How Whistleblowers uncovered a ‘pay-to-play’ culture in the Pennsylvania Turnpike,” http://pennlive.com, 11/6/13. While the presentments may indicate at least some of appellant’s complaints were well founded, appellees herein were not indicted.</p>

On April 28, 2015, this Court granted appellees’ application for leave to file a post-submission communication indicating the Commission has changed its position on this issue, and has admitted, in its own lawsuit against Ciber, the Ciber contracts "did involve waste in violation of the Whistleblower Law.” Application for Leave to File Post-Submission Communication, 11 6.</p>

This is so even without consideration of the evidence of Commission corruption contained in the Grand Jury presentment, attached by appellant to his brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. We therefore need not decide the question of admissibility of the presentment at this juncture. Nor is it necessary to consider Hatalo-wich’s invocation of the Fifth Amendment during his deposition in the present matter in order to reach our conclusion here. According to appellant, the Commonwealth Court improperly ignored this additional support for his position, and we note appellant is correct that the evidence is relevant and admissible in this civil case. <em>See Baxter v.
