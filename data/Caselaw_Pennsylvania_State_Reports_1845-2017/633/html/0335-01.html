Appellees are relatives of the victims, and were seated in the courtroom gallery. Before testimony began, Warrick advised the court his mother had retained private counsel for him and requested a continuance. At the court’s request, his mother, escorted by court officer Richard Brandt, came forward to testify. Appellees thereupon verbally and physically assailed Ms. Warrick, and a general melee erupted in the courtroom. Warrick tried to defend his mother, which led to an expanded struggle that required deputy sheriffs and police reinforcements from outside the courtroom to restore order. The courtroom was locked down for three hours.</p>

Appellee Archie spoke up and was sworn in, but before she made a statement on the record, the court opted to delay proceedings for the appointment of counsel, given the likelihood of criminal charges and appellees’ rights against self-incrimination with respect to those charges. Thus, proceedings ended for the day without testimony from appellees or any other witnesses.

The Commonwealth stresses the conduct occurred in the courtroom gallery during the course of judicial proceedings, and the nature of the conduct—one appellee standing and holding a sign while screaming obscenities, then the two other appellees assaulting Ms. Warrick—was such that the trial court necessarily would have observed it. In addition to its inferential argument, the Commonwealth cites the trial court’s repeated notations that it saw appellees engage in the contemptuous behavior. For instance, when court reconvened after the brawl, the court began by stating, “Contempt of court is something that happens in the presence of the [jludge and delays proceedings. That’s what happened.... [L]et me just put on the record what happened that I observed.” N.T. Contempt Hearing, 4/6/11, at 5-6.

Commonwealth’s Brief, at 20-21 (quoting N.T. Sentencing, 4/13/11, at 10-11). The Commonwealth argues the Superior Court erred in dismissing these statements as if they were not part of the relevant record.

Appellees cite their post-sentence motions, which did not directly assert the trial court failed to observe their conduct, but maintained the “evidence introduced” was insufficient because it did not demonstrate appellees committed any acts, much less acts constituting contempt. Appellees contend they reiterated this argument in their Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statements and Superior Court briefs, and the Superior Court agreed the record did not establish a requisite “element of summary direct criminal contempt[,]” <em>i.e., </em>the trial court’s actual observation of the contemptuous conduct.

Appellees posit the court may have been distracted at the time and did not actually see what caused the altercation. In appellees’ view, the record demonstrates three facts in support of their position: (1) the court never put anything on the record concerning appellees and never identified what they did; (2) the court called a witness to testify as to what happened; and (8) the court asked numerous questions to elicit the facts.</p>

Because the misconduct occurred in open court, one would presume that the judge saw and heard the misconduct, and there would be no need for the court to prove its understanding of the facts. However, in <em>Falana, </em>the trial judge did not hear the threatening statement. <em><a href="/a2d/696/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="696 A.2d 126" data-case-ids="12020939,12020989,960446,960464" data-case-paths="/a2d/696/0126-01,/a2d/696/0126-02,/pa/548/0156-01,/pa/548/0155-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/696/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="696 A.2d 126" data-case-ids="12020939,12020989,960446,960464" data-case-paths="/a2d/696/0126-01,/a2d/696/0126-02,/pa/548/0156-01,/pa/548/0155-01">at 129</a>.

As the Majority Opinion notes, the brawl involving Appellees and the defendant’s mother occurred in the gallery of the courtroom within the immediate view of the bench. Moreover, the trial judge, both during the summary proceeding and again in his Rule 1925(a) opinion, affirmed that he observed the belligerent conduct. Because the misconduct at issue occurred in the view of the judge, I agree with the majority’s assessment that a summary proceeding for direct criminal contempt was proper in this instance. If, however, the brawl had occurred beyond the observation of the court such that the trial judge would have necessarily depended on the testimony of others to ascertain the essential elements of the alleged misconduct, the facts would have instead warranted a charge of indirect criminal contempt and the usual due process requirements would have applied. <em>See Crozer-Chester Med.

To the extent it could be intetpreted to hold that conduct occurring outside the presence of the judge but adjacent to where he is situated can also lead to direct criminal contempt, I believe the case should be explained and narrowed. The gravamen of the distinction between direct and indirect criminal contempt is quite simply whether the contempt occurs in the direct presence of the judge—whether he actually saw or heard the contemptuous conduct—regardless of the proximity of the conduct to the judge.

For example, at the initial summary hearing, the common pleas court foreclosed the presentation of <em>anything, </em>in the form of either statements or evidence, from Appellees based on its own concern for Appellees’ Fifth Amendment rights. <em>See </em>N.T., Apr. 6, 2011, at 13 (“[Rjather than have you say anything at this point, I think I’m going to appoint each of you attorneys,”), Having then explained that “before I make a final finding, I want you to have attorneys to be able to talk to you <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>

First, the power of the courts to impose sanctions for insult or disobedience is not meaningfully constrained.... Second, judges wielding this vast and unlimited power suffer from an obvious and ineradicable conflict of interest. Vindicating the court’s dignity and authority is the fundamental purpose of contempt, and the judge is usually actively involved in initiating contempt proceedings. Thus, the roles of victim, prosecutor, and judge are dangerously commingled. Third, the law is chaotic and confusing, both substantively and procedurally. Common-law development has afforded no stable and satisfactory definition of contumacious conduct, and no clear-cut rules govern the adjudication of contempt proceedings.</blockquote>
