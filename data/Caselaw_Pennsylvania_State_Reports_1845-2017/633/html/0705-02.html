The Township also maintains that the Commonwealth Court erred by failing to consider early decisions in which a city sales tax was held not to impermissibly duplicate a state-imposed mercantile tax, although the mercantile tax was calculated based on the taxpayer’s business volume. <em>See, e.g., Blauner’s, Inc. v.

Finally, the Township contends that the Legislature understands “the distinction between a tax on something and a <a id="p711" href="#p711" data-label="711" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*711</a>tax on privileges or uses related to that thing,” Brief for Appellant at 13, as illustrated by the LTEA’s manufacturing exception pursuant to which political subdivisions are precluded from imposing taxes on manufactured goods “or on any privilege, act or transaction related to the business of manufacturing.” 53 P.S. § 6924.301.1(f)(4). Since this same “privilege” prohibition does not appear in subsection (f)(1), the Township suggests that this Court should not read such provision as barring application of a general business privilege tax to a business whose revenue consists of rental income.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Lessors argue, moreover, that this premise is supported by <em>Lynnebrook </em>insofar as it held that a flat tax on lease <em>transactions </em>was disallowed by the pre-2008 version of the statute, which only facially precluded taxes on “leases.” <em>See supra </em>note 3. In further support of a broad reading of (f)(1), Lessors observe that subsection 301.1(f) contains numerous subsections, most of which proscribe taxation relative to certain subjects using the term “a tax” rather than “any tax.” <em>See, e.g., </em>53 P.S. § 6924.301.1(f)(7) (precluding “a tax” on memberships in nonprofit organizations). Because the phrase “any tax” is used for (f)(l)’s lease-tax prohibition, Lessors reason that the Legislature must have intended an especially broad interpretation of that constraint. Relatedly, they argue that the “any tax” phraseology refers back to the types of taxes enumerated in the general grant of powers in subsection (a)(1), including privilege taxes. Lessors conclude that the phrase “any tax,” as employed in (f)(1), must therefore be understood to subsume business privilege taxes insofar as they are levied— directly or indirectly—on lease income.</p>

The only difference is title and timing, and if taxing authorities can avoid unambiguous legislative prohibitions simply by renaming the tax and rescheduling its collection, what is the purpose of the exception in the first place? Is this really construing the statute in favor of the taxpayer, who must now reflect, “There’s a statute that says my overweening municipality can’t tax my lease income, but I’m writing them a check to pay a ‘privilege’ tax based entirely on the same exact income they can’t tax?
