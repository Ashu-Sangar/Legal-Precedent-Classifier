When Objector appealed the grant of variances to the trial court, FT responded by challenging Objector’s standing. The trial court agreed with FT that Objector lacked standing to appeal, and quashed his appeal without considering the merits. Objector further appealed, and the Commonwealth Court held that FT waived its challenge to Objector’s standing by not raising it before the Board. Thus, it concluded that the trial court should have heard the merits of Objector’s appeal. FT now appeals the Commonwealth Court’s decision to this Court. Upon consideration of the arguments, we agree with FT that the Commonwealth Court erred in finding FT’s challenge to Objector’s standing waived, and hold that FT’s challenge to Objector’s standing was properly raised for the first time in the trial court. Accordingly, we remand to the Commonwealth Court for consider<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>ation of Objector’s standing to appeal the Board’s grant of variances in favor of FT.</p>

Rather, the court examined Section 17.1 of the Home Rule Act, 58 P.S. § 13131.1 (granting standing to appeal from the Board to “any aggrieved person”), as applied in <em>Spahn, </em>which held that “a party is aggrieved if the party can show an interest that is substantial, direct, and immediate.” <em>Spahn, </em><a href="/pa/602/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="977 A.2d 1132" data-case-ids="4195040,7297499" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0083-01,/a2d/977/1132-01">977 A.2d at </a>1151 (citing <em>William Penn Parking, </em><a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">346 A.2d at 280</a>).

In contrast to the MPC, which limits participation before the zoning hearing board to “parties,” the Philadelphia Code does not limit who may participate before the Board. The import of this distinction, according to FT, is that while many individuals may lodge objections and voice concerns to the Board, only those individuals whose interest in the application is actually affected in a substantial way after the Board issues its decision have the right to file an appeal to the trial court in accord with <em>Spahn. </em>FT asserts that the Commonwealth Court’s decision in this case and in <em>South of South Street </em>improperly extended the reasoning of cases resolved under the MPC to cases arising under the distinct framework of Philadelphia, to which the MPC is not applicable.</p>

As demonstrated in this case, FT had no prior knowledge of Objector’s intentions, and had no basis to cross-examine him on standing. Second, FT asserts that requiring standing objections to be made before the Board is only workable where the objector actually testifies, which, in many cases, is not possible. For example, group concerns are usually represented by the testimony of one, a scenario encouraged by the Board’s limitations on duplicative testimony. Similarly, FT speculates that any meaningful cross-examination on standing is impossible where an attorney appears on behalf of the objector, such as occurred here. Counsel for FT would have been unable to cross-examine Objector’s counsel regarding Objector’s standing.

The City argues that the practical effect of requiring the landowner to challenge the standing of everyone who comes before the Board, even via a representative or written appearance slip, would be to add detrimental delay to every proceeding. According to the City, one of the goals of the City’s Zoning Code is promoting greater certainty and timeliness in the zoning process, which has allowed for improved economic development opportunities while achieving greater participation and input from neighbors and community groups. The City considers that the addition of doubt and time to the zoning process will undermine the achievement of this goal.</p>

We further held that the General Assembly intended the term “aggrieved person” as it is generally understood and defined in <em>William Penn. </em>Under <em>William Penn, </em>a party is aggrieved if the party can show an interest that is substantial, direct, and immediate. <em>Spahn, </em><a href="/pa/602/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="977 A.2d 1132" data-case-ids="4195040,7297499" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0083-01,/a2d/977/1132-01">977 A.2d at </a>1151 (citing <em>William Penn, </em><a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">346 A.2d at 280</a>).

Rather, to appeal from the Board to the trial court, an appellant must demonstrate in the trial court, if challenged, that he is aggrieved pursuant to <em>William Penn </em>and as applied in <em>Spahn, </em>and may not avoid this obligation by arguing that the landowner failed to challenge standing before the Board. It would be futile, and contrary to the law, to require a landowner to challenge the standing of everyone who participates before the Board, when there is no requirement that participation before the Board requires standing at that stage. Moreover, because the ability to appear and participate before the Board is distinct from standing to appeal the Board’s decision to the trial court, the first time FT could challenge Objector’s standing to appeal in this case was when Objector took the appeal to the trial court. FT’s challenge to Objector’s standing was, therefore, timely.</p>

Rather than considering <em>Spahn, </em>the Commonwealth Court herein applied its decision in <em>South of South Street, </em>which resolved a Philadelphia zoning appeal by applying precedent decided under the MPC. In <em>South of South Street, </em>a landowner submitted an application to the Philadelphia Department of Licenses and Inspections seeking a zoning/use registration permit for his industrial zoned property, which was denied. The landowner appealed the decision to the Board, seeking a variance to use the property for commercial purposes. The Board conducted a hearing on the landowner’s appeal and initially granted the requested variance. Upon a letter from an objecting neighborhood association, however, the Board agreed to reconsider its decision and held a second hearing, at which the neighborhood association participated without objection by the landowner. The Board again granted the landowner’s variance, subject to conditions. The neighborhood association appealed the Board’s decision to the trial court, which affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[167,1262,1153,900]]]'>On further appeal to the Commonwealth Court, the landowner challenged the neighborhood association’s standing to bring the appeal.

Relying on this precedent without any analysis or recognition that <em>Thompson </em>arose outside of Philadelphia, the Commonwealth Court in <em>South of South Street </em>held that because the neighborhood association participated before the Board without objection from the landowner, it had standing to appeal. In reaching this decision the Commonwealth Court did not mention <em>Spahn, William Penn, </em>or otherwise analyze whether the neighborhood association was aggrieved as required by Section 17.1 of the Home Rule Act.</p>

First, its holding that challenges to standing are waived unless presented to the Board was premised upon a <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>case <em>(Thompson) </em>that was decided under the MPC which, as noted, is not applicable in Philadelphia. There is no requirement in Philadelphia similar to that in Section 908(3) of the MPC that one must be permitted by the board to appear as a party as a prerequisite to standing. Rather, the City encourages broad public participation before the Board. Second, pursuant to <em>Spahn, </em>which <em>South of South Street </em>did not consider, only those individuals who are aggrieved by the Board’s decision may appeal that decision to the trial court. Holding that an objector who participated before the Board without objection by the landowner is necessarily aggrieved by an adverse decision circumvents the limitation of Section 17.1 on the right to appeal the Board’s decision to aggrieved persons as that term is defined in <em>William Penn. </em>Accordingly, the conclusion in <em>South of South Street </em>premised on <em>Thompson </em>that the neighborhood association had standing to appeal to the trial court because it participated before the Board without objection by the landowner, <a href="/a3d/54/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="54 A.3d 115" data-case-ids="7310742" data-case-paths="/a3d/54/0115-01">54 A.3d at 120</a>, is disapproved to the extent it is inconsistent with this decision.</p>
    <p id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[268,1288,1154,884]]]'>In deciding the appeal in Objector’s favor, the Commonwealth Court found that FT waived the issue of Objector’s standing and declined to consider whether Objector was aggrieved as required by Section 17.1 of the Home Rule Act. This was error. Moreover, as the trial court held, a determination of whether Objector was aggrieved could not be made until after the Board issued its decision. FT therefore challenged Objector’s standing to appeal the Board’s grant of variances in this case at the first available opportunity in the trial court. We therefore reverse the Commonwealth Court’s holding that FT waived its challenge to Objector’s standing. Although the trial court held that Objector was not aggrieved, the Commonwealth Court did not consider this conclusion based on its finding of waiver. Finding no waiver, we remand the matter to the Commonwealth Court for resolution of Objector’s appeal from the trial court’s determination that he was not aggrieved.</p>
