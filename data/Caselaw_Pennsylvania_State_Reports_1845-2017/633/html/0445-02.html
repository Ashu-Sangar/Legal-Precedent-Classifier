N.T. Trial, 11/15/10 (A.M.), at 113-15, 11/15/10 (P.M.), at 59. In addition to his surgical practice, Dr. Booth had been working with Zimmer since the mid-1990’s in the capacity of a professional consultant, which involved Dr. Booth developing im<a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>plantable prosthetic medical devices for sale by Zimmer. N.T. Trial, 11/15/10 (A.M.), at 110-11. One of these devices Dr. Booth had developed while working with Zimmer was the “Gender Solutions Knee” which he had designed specifically for women, due to his professional experience that, although females comprised the majority of knee replacement patients, the availability of prosthetic devices specifically tailored to female knee structure was limited. <em>Id. </em>at 80. Dr. Booth recommended to Mrs. Polett that she undergo surgery to replace her right knee using the Gender Solutions Knee and to also simultaneously replace her previously implanted prosthetic left knee which had deteriorated. <em>Id. </em>at 114. Desirous of alleviating her pain and difficulty in walking, Mrs. Polett agreed to this course of action, and, on June 27, 2006, Dr. Booth performed the double knee replacement surgery. <em>Id. </em>at 118. There were no complications from the surgery, and, thereafter, Mrs. Polett engaged in a prescribed program of physical therapy beginning in July 2006. N.T. Trial, 11/15/10 (P.M.), at 69-70.</p>

As described by Yoder in an email to a member of Dr. Booth’s staff, the completed video was to feature the women providing testimonials of how the surgery had positively improved their lives, as well as showing the <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>women participating in physical activities they had “resumed since surgery.” N.T.

Mrs. Polett was somewhat concerned about riding the bicycle as, by her recollection, she had not ridden a bicycle for over ten years previously. <em>Id. </em>She informed terHorst and Yoder during their conversation that she had not ridden a bike at any time since her surgery.

N.T. Trial, 11/16/10 (A.M.), at 65-66; 11/17/10 (A.M.), at 44-50. Based on her assumption that terHorst and Yoder had consulted with Dr. Booth, and, thus, that it was okay for her to perform both physical activities, Mrs. Polett allowed herself to be filmed while walking on the treadmill and then riding the exercise bike.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> N.T.

She felt so poorly that she went immediately to bed and began to feel that “something horrible had happened” during the filming. <em>Id. </em>When her husband arrived home later that evening, she complained to him that “[m]y knees really hurt,” and he gave her a bag of frozen peas to apply to her knees to ease the discomfort.

Regarding the issue of causation, which is central to the questions presented by this appeal, the jury heard testimony from Dr. Booth in which he opined that Mrs. Polett’s riding of the exercise bike for the video shot on August 23, 2006 was a substantial factor in beginning a chain of linked events that ultimately caused her harm. Dr. Booth opined that the bicycle ride was the “only factor” he was aware of that caused the synovitis in her transplanted knee. N.T. Trial, 11/15/10 (P.M.), at 19. He explained that this inflammation, in turn, led to Mrs. Polett having a reduced ability to extend her leg, and it was a substantial factor in causing the separation of the tendons surrounding her kneecap. This diminished range of leg motion and weakness of the supporting tendons resulted in the fracture of her kneecap and led to her falls. <em>Id. </em>at 19-21. Ultimately, according to Dr. Booth, this directly linked sequence of events, stemming from the initial synovitis, was a substantial factor in causing Mrs. Polett to be forced to undergo the four subsequent surgeries which she endured. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24.

Dr, Booth expressed the opinion that the bicycle ride was, for Mrs. Polett, a “watershed” moment in her treatment, and that, absent that event, it was likely that she would have been among the 98 percent of his patients whose knee replacement operations were successful, i.e., having only minor pain, good range of motion, and no need for the prosthetic implants to be replaced. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 35.</p>

However, Dr. Clark also expressed the view that several other causative factors also contributed to Mrs. Polett developing synovitis: the natural inflammatory response of the body to major surgery; her preexisting rheumatoid arthritis; her inability to take certain anti-inflammatory drugs due to liver toxicity; her travel to foreign and domestic destinations; her walking in sand along a beach; and her performance of leg presses with weights during physical therapy sessions before and after the date of the filming. <em>Id. </em>at 19, 45; Dr. Clark Deposition, 11/12/10, at 14-15, 20.</p>

Relevant to the current appeal, counsel argued the following points: between Mrs. Polett’s filming of the video in August 2006, and her surgery in November 2006, she kept only 8 out of her 42 prescribed physical therapy visits; allegedly threw out documents from Dr. Booth describing activities she was permitted to engage in; and did not check with Dr. Booth, prior to engaging in planned activities, as to whether such activities were allowed.

The dissent pointed out that, in his deposition, Dr. Booth identified the bike ride as the cause of the swelling and inflammation in Mrs. Polett’s knees as of the time of her September 20, 2006 office visit, and, indicated that, when he wrote his treatment note on October 23, 2006, after Mrs. Polett’s office visit that day, he was of the opinion that the bicycle ride had caused her synovitis, which, in turn, <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>started the chain of events that led to her ultimate injuries.

The dissent additionally highlighted the fact that Dr. Booth testified at trial that, while he was treating Mrs. Polett in the fall of 2006, he was concerned about the cause of her injury, as, for him, it was determinative of whether the inflammation and pain she was experiencing was caused by an infection, or, alternatively, if it was mechanical in origin.</p>

Consistent with the well-established principle that a jury charge must be considered in its entirety, and portions thereof not examined in isolation, the dissent viewed the trial court’s short supplemental instruction about speculation as providing an accurate statement of the law which, when viewed in the context of the original charge, did not shift the burden of proof to Appellees. Further, the dissent underscored the nature of Appellees’ closing argument was such that it did more than simply challenge the adequacy of the Poletts’ evidence regarding causation; rather, it propounded alternative theories of causation for Mrs. Polett’s injuries, and the trial court’s instruction properly reminded <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>the jury that such theories must be based on trial evidence and not just speculation.</p>

The Poletts first defend the trial court’s decision to exclude the tolling agreement as reasonable, and in accord with the discretionary latitude given to it by Pa.R.E. 403, which permits exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence if the probative value is outweighed by the danger of “unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Poletts’ Brief at 21 (quoting Pa.R.E. 403). The Poletts minimize the probative value of the tolling agreement, pointing out that Appellees, by stipulating that Dr. Booth bore no responsibility for Mrs. Polett’s injuries, “ratified Dr. Booth as a disinterested witness about the events in question,” because this stipulation established that he had no incentive to lie either during his deposition or at trial. Poletts’ Brief at 21. The Poletts argue that, because of the tolling agreement’s minimal probative value, the trial court reasonably exercised its discretion in precluding it, inasmuch as the countervailing reasons to deny its admission articulated by the Poletts at trial were properly given greater weight by the trial court.</p>

Further, the Poletts assert that the Superior Court gave too much weight to Appellees’ contention that the preclusion of the tolling agreement interfered with Appellees’ ability to highlight for the jury any bias Dr. Booth may have possessed. The Poletts observe that Appellees had the opportunity to ask Dr. Booth, at both his deposition and at trial, whether he was at risk of being sued by the Poletts, without making reference to the tolling agreement. Consequently, according to the Poletts, the trial court’s decision to bar the admission of the tolling agreement did not stop Appellees from challenging Dr. Booth’s credibility on the basis that he was at risk for suit by <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>the Poletts; rather, it merely prohibited them from using the term “tolling agreement” in the presentation of their ease to the jury.

The Poletts proffer that the Superior Court’s decision has the potential to damage the patient-physician relationship any time litigation is contemplated, because it deprives both the patient and his or her physician of the “safe harbor” which a tolling agreement provides. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25. Specifically, the Poletts note that patients have a vitally important interest in maintaining a treatment relationship with their physicians, “because of the crucial role [the] physicians play in [the patient’s] ongoing care, [and, in] turn, treating physicians like Dr. Booth have significant professional and personal interests in continuing to treat their patients even when potential litigation looms.” In the Poletts’ view, tolling agreements serve to preserve that relationship. <em>Id. </em>The Poletts contend that these mutual physician-patient interests in maintaining an effective treatment relationship are exactly what motivated them to enter into the tolling agreement with Dr. Booth, as they viewed him to be the physician who could best cure Mrs. Polett, and, had they sued him, it would have potentially caused him to quit treating her—thereby depriving her of the greatest chance for successful treatment of her medical condition.</p>

The Poletts develop that, because of this decision, every time physicians now sign a tolling agreement, they must worry that their integrity and competency will be attacked at trial on the basis of that agreement. The Poletts maintain that this prospect will defeat the fundamental pur<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>pose of a tolling agreement, which is to preserve the patient-physician relationship, even when the physician may have no connection with forthcoming litigation, or, at most, will be a fact witness in that litigation.</p>

The Poletts highlight the fact that tolling agreements are used by attorneys for many reasons which a jury would not easily understand without an explanation, and that such an explanation, the Poletts aver, “would involve a mini-course in claims, procedural defenses, litigation strategy, and the client’s relationship with the potential defendant.” <em>Id. </em>at 26. Absent such information being furnished to the jury, the Poletts argue that the tolling agreement would serve as a virtual “scarlet letter” hanging around a physician’s neck since it would suggest to the jury that the physician was at fault and the parties have reached a settlement, or, alternatively, that the party who executed the tolling agreement colluded with the physician with respect to the subject of his or her testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 27. The Poletts suggest that, to avoid this prospect, attorneys would simply file suit against physicians, thereby increasing the number of lawsuits against physicians—-which is against our public policy.</p>

The Poletts note that tolling agreements are even more effective in furthering this purpose since, rather than settling a lawsuit, they prevent one from ever being filed, the Poletts also point out the broad impact of the Superior Court decision on litigation in this Commonwealth since it is applicable to all tolling agreements, not just those executed in the course of medical malpractice litigation.</p>

Appellees highlight that Dr. Booth was the Poletts’ only expert on the issue of causation and the one who performed the surgeries, which were unsuccessful at resolving her knee problems. Appellees note that Dr. Booth testified at his June 26, 2009 deposition that the prospect of litigation was a “sword hanging over” him, which he found “very polarizing” and that he was “upset” at the time he wrote his June 4, 2008 treatment note, in which he mentioned being presented with the tolling agreement. Appellees Brief at 28 (quoting Dr. Booth Deposition, 6/26/09, at 102, 183-85). Ap-pellees aver that, since it was during his deposition that Dr. Booth “first reached a causation opinion, with a ‘sword hanging over’ him, the jury [was required to] hear about that litigation ‘sword’—here, the Tolling Agreement—to assess [Dr. Booth’s] credibility.” Appellees’ Brief at 28. Thus, in Appellees’ view, the Superior Court properly found that the jury was entitled to hear about the tolling agreement to <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>demonstrate Dr. Booth’s partiality in placing responsibility for causing Mrs. Polett’s injuries on them.</p>

Appellees aver that the stipulation they entered into with Dr. Booth spoke only to the issue of his culpability in causing the injury to Mrs. Polett, not whether his causation testimony was influenced by his fear of the “litigation ‘sword’ ” of the tolling event. <em>Id. </em>at 29. Appellees point out that nothing in the stipulation barred them from inquiring into the matter of Dr. Booth’s bias.</p>

Appellees contend that, without being able to raise and address the tolling agreement, they were unable to show why Dr. Booth first decided to place responsibility on them almost two years after the incident.</p>
    <p id="b530-6" data-blocks='[["BL_530.6",530,[273,1462,1154,741]]]'>Appellees also argue that the tolling agreement would not have confused or misled the jury since they would merely have explained to the jury what the agreement was—an agreement to extend the time to sue. In Appellees’ view, the degree of complexity of an elucidation of this purpose is far less than that involved with explanations of more complicated matters to which juries are routinely exposed. Appellees proffer that tolling agreements are no more complex than indemnification agreements, joint defense agreements, and expert witness fee agreements, all of which juries easily understand.

On the merits, Appellees assert that the Superior Court decision did not create a blanket rule of admissibility of all tolling agreements; rather, the admissibility of the tolling agreement depended on the unique facts of this particular case. Further, Appellees see scant prospect that a judicial decision which finds that tolling agreements are admissible into evidence will adversely affect the physician-patient relationship, inasmuch as it is unlikely that it will create any more tension in the physician-patient relationship than the existing threat to sue. Appellees note that physicians have an independent duty of care to their patients which exists regardless of the existence of a tolling agreement, and that, if a patient wants to avoid the consequences of a tolling agreement with his or her physician being admitted into evidence, i.e., termination of the physician-patient relationship, then he or she is free to use an independent medical expert.</p>

Thus, whenever a witness is being paid a fee for his or her testimony, pursuant to an agreement, our Court has held that the jury is entitled to learn of that payment and consider whether it may have affected the substance of the witness’s testimony. <em>See Grutski, </em><a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.2d%20142" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="43 A.2d 142">43 A.2d at 144</a> (doctors’ witness fees received for their testimony relevant since such fees “could have been such as to affect their credibility as witnesses”), and <em>Blue Stamp, </em><a href="/citations/?q=241%20A.2d%20116" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="241 A.2d 116">241 A.2d at 118</a> (where value of property was central issue in condemnation proceeding, monetary amount of appraisal fee paid to professional testifying on behalf of plaintiff relevant to credibility).</p>

      <em>Hatfield </em>was a negligence and products liability action brought by a plaintiff against the wholesale and retail sellers of an allegedly defective chair which collapsed when she sat on it. The sellers, in turn, joined the manufacturer as an additional defendant. Prior to trial, the sellers and their insurer entered into a “settlement and reimbursement agreement” with the plaintiff under which they agreed to pay the plaintiff two lump sum payments for her injuries, as well as a monthly annuity payment. The agreement obligated the plaintiff to continue litigating the suit against the manufacturer, required her to pay 50% of the costs of that litigation, and mandated that she reimburse the sellers and their insurer $50,000 if they prevailed in the suit at trial, or $25,000 if the plaintiff settled the matter.</p>

The Superior Court reversed, finding the agreement’s admission barred by 42 Pa.C.S. § 6141 (barring admission into evidence of any “final settlement and release”). In turn, our Court granted allowance of appeal and reversed the Superior Court, holding <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>that the agreement, by its terms, did not constitute a settlement as that word was defined by Section 6141.</p>

Accordingly, the tolling agreement did not create the same potential bias on the part of Dr. Booth in giving his trial testimony, which we stressed that the jury should be made aware of in Hatfield—i.e., a financial inducement to shift responsibility for causing plaintiffs injuries to another party, due to the prospect of obtaining reimbursement from the plaintiff for a final verdict or settlement agreement.</p>

We, therefore, regard the principles articulated in <em>Hatfield </em>as furnishing the proper framework for reviewing the trial court’s exercise of discretion in precluding admission of the tolling agreement, or allowing mention thereof, as these principles are consistent with the general requirements for admissibility of impeachment evidence under our Rules of Evidence—i.e., that the evidence be relevant, and that its probative value not be outweighed by its potential to cause prejudice, confusion, or delay.</p>

The trial court also found that Appellees’ stipulation that Dr. Booth was not negligent, Dr. Clark’s concurrence that the bike ride was a cause of Mrs. Polett’s injuries, and the fact that Dr. Booth did not place responsibility on Appellees to be additional factors minimizing its relevancy.</p>

As we emphasized in <em>Hatfield, </em>what is of critical importance is that a party seeking to impeach a witness on the basis of an agreement, to which the witness is a signatory, be permitted to convey to the factfinder <em>“at least the existence of the reason for the potential bias </em>” on the part of the witness. <em>Hatfield, </em><a href="/pa/530/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="530 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1832993" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0551-01">610 A.2d at 452</a> (emphasis added).

The tolling agreement was not self-explanatory; hence, the jury could not properly consider it in a vacuum. The jury could not reasonably be expected to automatically understand the nature and purpose of such an agreement upon seeing or hearing of it. Further, the fact that a witness has signed a tolling agreement does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>indicate that he or she may now be biased because of a fear of being sued. As the Poletts have noted, parties have myriad motivations in entering into these types of agreements, including the salutary purpose of maintaining a professional relationship <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>with the party who has requested the agreement, which we agree has particular importance in promoting the preservation of doctor-patient relationships. Additionally, as one commentator has observed, the act of signing such an agreement may actually <em>reduce </em>a potential defendant’s fear of being the target of a lawsuit. <em>See </em>Christopher R.

By agreeing to toll the statute of limitations, defendants enhance the probability that a plaintiff ultimately will decide not to bring suit against them.”). Tolling agreements, in and of themselves, are, therefore, not indicative of the nature and degree of a signatory’s potential bias, without a full explication of the particular circumstances which led that person to enter into the agreement.</p>

Further, the conduct of such a proceeding would have created the chance that the parties would have exposed Dr. Booth to intrusive questioning about the subjective reasons which motivated him to enter into this particular agreement. The pernicious danger of this inquiry is particularly acute, given the prospect of its intrusion into privileged discussions between Dr. Booth and his attorney which transpired during the formation process of the agreement. Furthermore, this inquiry could have resulted in counsel for the Poletts being called as fact witnesses regarding what they communicated to Dr. Booth which, as noted by the dissent below, could have interfered with their ability to continue to represent their clients. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. 222 <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>(“Where any attorney acting as trial counsel in the trial of an action is called as a witness on behalf of a party whom the attorney represents, the court may determine whether such attorney may thereafter continue to act as trial counsel during the remainder of the trial.”); R.P.C. 3.7(a) (generally barring a lawyer from acting as an advocate when the lawyer is likely to be called as a witness, subject to certain narrow exceptions).

As a preliminary matter, and contrary to the assertion of the Poletts and <em>amicus, </em>we do not read the Superior Court’s decision as establishing a general rule of admissibility for tolling agreements in all cases; rather, we regard the Superior Court decision to be based on the particular facts of this case. While we acknowledge the policy arguments of the parties and <em>amicus </em>for and against the adoption of a general rule, we do not consider it prudent to adopt such a bright line rule, inasmuch as the lower court decisions did not rest on general policy considerations, and the parties did not press such arguments to those tribunals. Rather, the lower courts analyzed the admissibility of the tolling agreement using the general principles governing the admissibility of all impeachment evidence, and, as we explain <em>infra, </em>our Court has utilized these same general principles in determining the admissibility of a partial settlement agreement which tended to show bias on the part of a witness for the signatory. <em>See Hatfield, <a href="/pa/530/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="530 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1832993" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0551-01">supra.</a> </em>We, therefore, conduct our review in accordance with those principles.</p>

As indicated above, in their motion <em>in limine </em>before the trial court, the Poletts challenged the admissibility of the tolling agreement on two grounds, arguing that it was irrelevant under Pa.R.E. 401, and also that, even if it had relevance, Pa.R.E. 403, nonetheless, barred its introduction; hence, we deem the trial court’s grant of the motion <em>in limine, </em>in full, to be a ruling in favor of the Poletts on both contentions. Accordingly, just as the Superior Court did, we presently consider whether the trial court was within its discretion to exclude the tolling agreement under Pa.R.E. 403. The Superior Court, after reversing the trial court’s conclusion that the agreement was irrelevant, conducted its own review of the evidentiary record and concluded that, under Pa.R.E. 403, the probative value of the agreement outweighed its prejudicial value.

Respectfully, on this issue, the dissent appears to conflate the question of what constitutes relevant evidence under Pa.R.E. 401 with the question of how the probative value of such evidence, even if relevant under Pa.R.E. 401, is to be assessed under Pa.R.E. 403. <em>See </em>Dissenting Opinion (Eakin, J.) at 510-11, 126 A.3d at 933-34. Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, for purposes of Pa.R.E. 403, the probative value of challenged evidence is determined not merely by the relevance of the evidence, but, rather, by the need for such evidence in light of other available evidence which establishes the same fact. <em>See </em>1 John W. Strong <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>647 n.62 § 185 (5th. ed.)

Relatedly, Appellees claim that Dr. Booth’s attorney conceded in his deposition that he was not testifying as an expert witness. We do not read the deposition testimony so broadly. After Dr. Booth gave his testimony regarding his opinion that the bicycle ride caused Mrs. Polett’s injuries, counsel for the other now-dismissed co-defendants— New City Productions and Franck—requested Dr. Booth watch the exercise video. Dr. Booth’s counsel instructed him not to do so because, in her view, that would require him to "act as an expert.” Dr. Booth Deposition, 6/26/09, at 194. Our reading of this testimony leads us to conclude that, while counsel was expressing her opinion as to the role Dr. Booth would be acting in if he viewed the video, this opinion was not a legal concession as to whether Dr. Booth had already rendered an expert opinion in his testimony regarding his treatment of Mrs. Polett. Indeed, co-defendants' counsel plainly regarded Dr. Booth as already having given an expert causation opinion by that point, as she argued, in response to Dr. Booth's counsel: "[Dr. Booth] has given testimony here today there is some link between the filming and her subsequent problem, so he has given expert testimony here today.” <em><a href="/nj/157/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="725 A.2d 675" data-case-ids="781231,781284" data-case-paths="/nj/157/0554-01,/nj/157/0553-01">Id.</a> </em>Regardless, these subjective opinions do not govern our present legal analysis of this question.</p>

Critically, however, the physician, who was not involved in treating the plaintiff at the time of the EKG, never reviewed the original EKG reading. Thus, the treating physician was rendering a <em>second-hand </em>opinion about causation based on an aspect of the treatment process in which he was not personally involved. This stands in stark contrast to Dr. Booth’s role in the treatment process of Mrs. Polett, since his causation opinion was formed contemporaneously with his observation and treatment of her, and it was based on his personal, first-hand evaluation of the reason for the medical conditions he was endeavoring to treat.</p>

After receiving the tolling agreement June 4, 2008, Dr. Booth wrote in his treatment note, “[I]n my opinion[,] it is the filming company who asked to ‘interview’ Mrs. Polett with whom the responsibility lies, as well as those who employed them.

The tolling agreement triggered this self-serving suggestion of responsibility, and was therefore relevant when evaluating Dr, Booth’s determination as to causation, which is the very foundation of his notion of responsibility. The agreement informed him the Poletts were considering suing him, and as the size of the verdict indicates, that was no small matter. Only after receiving the agreement did he opine that responsibility for Mrs. Polett’s injuries rested solely on others, including appellees. This tends to show that Dr. Booth’s opinion regarding causation was potentially biased, making it relevant. The degree of bias may or may not have been great, but I do not see how notice to a witness that he is the target of a potential lawsuit of this magnitude can be called irrelevant to evaluation of that witness’s subsequent opinion testimony.</p>

However, the trial court prohibited appellees from presenting additional facts by sustaining the Poletts’ objection to defense counsel’s argument Mrs. Polett attended only eight out of 42 prescribed physical-therapy sessions, that she threw out Dr. Booth’s documents detailing the activities in which she could engage, and that she did not clear her activities with Dr. Booth. <em>See </em>Majority Op., at 905.</p>

Dr. Booth’s testimony about the bicycle was not grounded on the medical; he failed to provide <em>medical </em>testimony establishing why the bicycle caused Mrs. Polett’s injury. Moreover, as the Superi- or Court correctly concluded, appellees’ other causation theories were “designed to show that Mrs. Polett could not demonstrate the causal connection required to show that her injuries were related to riding the exercise bike[,]” and appellees “properly challenged the sufficiency of [appellants’] evidence by demonstrating the lack of a causal connection between the exercise [bike] and her injuries.” <em>Polett v. Pub. Communications, Inc., </em><a href="/a3d/83/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="83 A.3d 205" data-case-ids="7256548" data-case-paths="/a3d/83/0205-01">83 A.3d 205</a>, 218 (Pa.Super.2013). Appellees’ evidence therefore “had the cumulative effect of demonstrating [Mrs. Polett’s] comparative negligence and undermining her credibility as to the cause of her injuries[,]” <em>id, </em>and should not have been eviscerated by the trial court’s inappropriate, one-sided supplemental instruction.</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.5",569,[165,1264,1153,788]]]'>Finally, regarding Dr. Booth being permitted to testify as an expert, I note Rule 4003.5 provides experts holding opinions “acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation” must be identified prior to trial. Pa.R.C.P. 4003.5(a); <em>see also id., </em>4003.5(b) (“An expert witness whose identity is not disclosed in compliance with subdivision (a)(1) of this rule shall not be permitted to testify on behalf of the defaulting party at the trial of the action.”). Rule 4003.5 is inapplicable only when opinions are not formed in anticipation of litigation. <em>See Miller v.

However, Dr. Booth did not offer causation opinions in his 2006 treatment <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>notes. Rather, he first stated his opinion as to liability m his June 4, 2008 note, after receiving the tolling agreement, by writing, “[I]t is the filming company ... with whom the responsibility lies[.]” Dr. Booth’s Treatment Note, 6/4/08 (Exhibit 6 attached to Defendants’ Motion in Limine, 10/28/10). At this point, Dr. Booth clearly anticipated the “sword” of litigation hanging over him. Dr. Booth Deposition, 6/26/09, at 102.</p>
    <p id="b570-4" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[275,746,1154,1064]]]'>Moreover, although Dr. Booth offered an opinion as to liability in his June, 2008 note, he did not provide causation opinions until he was deposed. Dr. Booth admitted he did not view the video of Mrs. Polett exercising on the bicycle until the litigation began, and he did not investigate the cause of her injuries because his only concern was treating her. <em>See id., </em>at 33-34, 42, 140-42, 158, 177. The majority ignores these admissions and refuses to disturb the trial court’s determination the treatment notes <em>“ </em>‘speak for themselves.’ ” Majority Op., at 495-96, 126 A.3d at 924-25 (quoting Trial Court Opinion, 6/10/11, at 25). All documents speak for themselves—the question is what they say. Here, as discussed above, those notes provided no <em>medical </em>evidence establishing how the bicycle caused Mrs. Polett’s injury and failed to address evidence regarding her misuse of her leg. Dr. Booth’s treatment notes were therefore not proper causation opinions developed while treating Mrs. Polett; instead, these notes established, at most, not medical connections, but “a temporal connection between Mrs. Polett riding the exercise bike and her injuries[.]” <em>Polett, </em>at 220.</p>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[275,1851,1153,473]]]'>Because Dr. Booth first offered causation opinions at his deposition in 2009, his comments were in contemplation of litigation under Rule 4003.5. The Poletts improperly shielded Dr. Booth from Rule 4003.5’s requirements by characterizing him as a treating physician, and appellees were prejudiced by this discovery violation. Appellees were unable to appropriately prepare their questioning of Dr. Booth because he was not disclosed as an expert, did not prepare an expert report, and did not answer interrogatories.</p>

The trial court excluded evidence that was at least facially relevant to alternative causes; the trial court then relied on the absence of such evidence when instructing the jury. The supplemental jury instruction told the jury the Poletts’ theory of causation (accepted as true by the instruction itself) could only be overcome by medical testimony, while the Poletts’ theory itself had no causation evidence that could be called “medical,” save that it came from a doctor who was not eligible to testify as an expert.</p>
