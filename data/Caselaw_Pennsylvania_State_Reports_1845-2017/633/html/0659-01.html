On July 13, 1993, Appellee Rose and Shawn Sadik brutally attacked Mary Mitchell in a park in the East Liberty neighborhood <em>of </em>Pittsburgh. During the attack, the men kicked the victim in the head approximately 60 times, stabbed her in the throat, and inserted a 16-inch piece of aluminum framing into her vagina, causing serious internal injuries. The victim was left naked and bleeding until she was discovered by two individuals. The attack left the victim in a vegetative state. An investigation led police to Rose and Sadik, and police recovered bloody clothing and shoes from Rose’s apartment later that day. Rose provided police with a statement in which he admitted that he and Sadik attacked the victim after drinking and doing drugs.</p>

      <em> </em>However, the court found instructive the decisions of other states that have addressed analogous issues, <em>see infra, </em>and reasoned that, “[ajlthough the crime of third degree murder was not consummated until the victim died, all of the criminal acts causing the victim’s death were completed” prior to the enactment of Section 1102(d), which increased the penalty for the acts that caused the victim’s death. <em><a href="/a3d/81/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="81 A.3d 123" data-case-ids="7301327" data-case-paths="/a3d/81/0123-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a3d/81/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="81 A.3d 123" data-case-ids="7301327" data-case-paths="/a3d/81/0123-01">at 136</a>.

Then-Judge, now-President Judge, Susan P. Gantman filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Judge Cheryl Allen. Judge Gantman opined that, because a murder is “committed only when the victim of the assault dies,” the trial court properly sentenced Rose for third-degree murder under the sentencing statute in effect at the time of the victim’s death in 2007. <em><a href="/a3d/81/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="81 A.3d 123" data-case-ids="7301327" data-case-paths="/a3d/81/0123-01">Id. at 136-37</a>. </em>The Commonwealth filed a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, which we granted in order to consider whether the Superior Court erred in holding that sentencing Rose pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. § 1102(d), which became effective after he committed the deadly assault on the victim, but before the victim died, would violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws.</p>

The defendant was convicted in 1996, and on appeal, he argued that his convictions on the four counts that were based on conduct that occurred after the victim turned 14 could not stand under the pre-1993 version of the law because the victim was not under 14 and had not made a timely outcry.</p>
