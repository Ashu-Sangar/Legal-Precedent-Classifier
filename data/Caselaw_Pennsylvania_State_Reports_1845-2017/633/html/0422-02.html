This employment arrangement is guided by the consumer model of service delivery, which designates the individual requiring care as the official employer after he or she obtains a state tax identification number and a workers’ compensation policy. As the employer, the consumer is responsible for hiring, training, disciplining, and terminating employees. The program acts as a payroll agent for any employees and ensures the employer’s needs are met.</p>

While Employer was placed at Riverside, Maria Phillips of the Three Rivers Center for Independent Living (TRCIL) informed Claimant of the availability of numerous programs that would pay her to care for Employer in her own home until Employer’s physical condition allowed him to live independently. Although Claimant had not lived with Employer since he was fifteen years old, Claimant allowed Employer to move into her home on July 7, 2008.</p>

Claimant was hired to assist Employer with transfers, dressing, bathing, wound care, taking medication, preparing meals, doing laundry, and transportation. Employer received funding to receive 64 hours of care each week, but did not qualify to receive nighttime or 24-hour care. However, given the parties’ living arrangement, Employer requested care during evening hours if Claimant was awake. Claimant would then log her nighttime hours on the next day of work. Claimant typically worked 40 hours Monday through Friday and 12 hours per day on Saturday and Sunday. Claimant recorded her hours on a time sheet or through Halo, a computerized system that allowed Claimant to use an identification number to clock in and out each day.</p>

Upon her arrival, Employer asked Claimant to prepare him something to eat. Employer and Claimant began to argue as Claimant wished to change her clothes before getting him food. Claimant changed her clothes, got Employer his food, and made up the couch as Employer’s bed. Claimant went to her first-floor bedroom and went to sleep around 11:30 p.m. Approximately two hours later, at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday, April 11, 2009, Employer burst into Claimant’s bedroom, jumped on top of her, cut her throat, and stabbed her several times with a butcher knife.

Claimant asserted that as a result of the attack, she lost functioning in her left arm, sustained soft tissue damage, and suffers from psychological injuries. On October 27, 2009, Claimant filed a Petition to Review Medical Treatment/ Compensation Benefits, in which she averred she is <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>unable to return to work as she requires medical treatment and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Claimant testified in person, explaining how the employment relationship came about and describing the attack in detail. Claimant admitted she did not understand why Employer attacked her as he did not have a history of violence. While Claimant acknowledged she and Employer had a disagreement hours before the stabbing concerning Employer’s request for food, Claimant admitted the dispute “wasn’t anything big.” N.T. Hr’g, 7/2/09, at 74. When asked if she and Employer had issues that they argued about on a consistent basis, Claimant shared that Employer always asked her for money but she refused as she felt he would purchase drugs since he has had a drug problem since age sixteen. When asked if she believed Employer was on drugs during the attack, Claimant indicated that while Employer was prescribed pain medication, she had control of the medicine and was responsible for giving it to Employer. Claimant also shared that shortly before the stabbing, she was in the process of obtaining legal guardianship of Employer’s eight-year old daughter.</p>

Volkman explained how Claimant was hired by Employer to provide state-funded care under the consumer model of service delivery. Volkman indicated she met with Employer and Claimant to discuss Claimant’s duties set forth in a service plan created by TRCIL, the agency that referred Employer to accessAbilities. Volkman affirmed that neither the service plan nor Claimant’s job description contained any requirement that Employer’s service provider sleep <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>overnight in his home. Volkman clarified that Employer did not qualify to receive overnight care, which is reserved for cases where an individual suffers a traumatic brain injury. Even if Employer qualified for 24-hour care, Volkman testified the provider would have been required to remain awake during the overnight shift. In addition, Volkman reviewed Claimant’s timesheets and indicated Claimant never recorded late night or early morning hours of care.</p>

The WCAB held Claimant was not injured in the course of her employment as she was neither furthering Employer’s business nor required by the nature of her employment to be on the premises at the time of her injury. WCAB Op., 8/9/12, at 4 (citing <em>WCAB (Slaugenhaupt) v.

The WCAB reasoned that Claimant was no longer required by the nature of her employment to remain on the premises once she completed her work duties and went to bed. The WCAB found Claimant lost her “employee status” and became a resident of her home after she “embarked on a course of ‘recreation’ separate and distinct from the duties of her employment.” WCAB Op. at 6.

The employees in <em>Malky </em>were killed in an explosion when striking workers threw a bomb into the bunkhouse in the middle of the night. The referee denied compensation, finding the employees were not required to be on the employer’s premises at the time of the explosion.

Employer moved into Claimant’s home weeks before he enrolled in accessAbilities.

The bunkhouse rule covers situations in which an employee’s living arrangement on the work premises is reasonably necessary to perform the tasks required by the employer. The employees in <em>Malky </em>were required to be on their employer’s premises 24 hours a day in order “to insure a supply of necessary labor” during the union miner strike. The employer mine in <em>Malky </em>controlled its workers’ movements, confining them in their quarters in the bunkhouse to avoid them coming into contact with the striking miners who would seek to persuade or intimidate the workers from returning to their employment.

In other words, the bunkhouse rule imposes workers’ compensation liability on an employer who requires his workers to live in employer-furnished premises, which the employer controls, maintains, and uses for his benefit. In <em>Malky, </em>the employer coal mine required its workers to live in the bunkhouse it constructed in order to continue mine operations during the union miners’ strike. The coal mine, cognizant of the threat the strike posed to its workers, took security measures and hired a watchman to prevent interference by outsiders.

For that reason, in my opinion, it was improvident to grant review. Nevertheless, having the appeal before us, but for reasons largely idiosyncratic to this case, I would affirm the decision below. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>

As a result, to show her injuries were compensable under the Workers’ Compensation Act, Claimant was required to show that she: (1) was on the premises occupied or under the control of the employer, or upon which the employer’s business or affairs are being carried on; (2) was required by the nature of her employment to be present on the premises; and (3) sustained injuries caused by the condition of the premises or by operation of the employer’s business or affairs thereon. <em><a href="/a2d/748/0660-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="748 A.2d 660" data-case-ids="11457345,93212" data-case-paths="/a2d/748/0660-01,/pa/561/0111-01">Id.</a> </em>In my view, the Commonwealth Court correctly concluded, in its 6-1 <em>en banc </em>decision, that Claimant met each of these requirements.</p>

(WCJ’s Findings of Fact Nos. 8-10, 15.) Significantly, Employer did not have another residence <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>in which to receive attendant care, and, under the circumstances of this case, the only feasible way for Claimant to provide Employer with attendant care was to do so in her home. (WCJ’s Findings of Fact No. 19, R.R. at 53a.) Finally, [Maria] Phillips from the Three Rivers Center for Independent Living approached Claimant and specifically asked Claimant to provide care for Employer in her home, and the employment arrangement was approved by the agencies knowing that Employer was going to live with Claimant. (WCJ’s Findings of Fact Nos. 6,19.)</blockquote>

      <em>O’Rourke v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Gartland), </em><a href="/a3d/83/1125-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="83 A.3d 1125" data-case-ids="7265264" data-case-paths="/a3d/83/1125-01">83 A.3d 1125</a>, 1135 (Pa.Cmwlth.2014). I agree with the Commonwealth Court that these unusual facts support the WCJ’s conclusion that Claimant was, in practice, required by the nature of her employment to live with Employer. <em><a href="/a3d/83/1125-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="83 A.3d 1125" data-case-ids="7265264" data-case-paths="/a3d/83/1125-01">Id.</a> </em>Indeed, the “work premises” was <em>her home, </em>and the WCJ found that providing care “in her home was crucial to the employment relationship.” WCJ’s Finding of Facts, 8/4/10, at ¶ 19; <em>see also </em>N.T. Hearing, 5/10/10, at 13 (Claimant testifying that Employer stated that living together was a condition of employment). In regard to this employment relationship, I find the majority’s focus on the service plan established by Employer and Three Rivers Center for Independent Living, to which Claimant was not a party, as precluding evening or late-night shifts to be misplaced. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 434-35, 125 A.3d at 1191. Here, the WCJ specifically found that “as Mr. Gartland was the employer, he could request care during evening or night time hours provided the worker was awake.” WCJ’s Finding of Facts, 8/4/10, at ¶ 9. Under these facts, given that Claimant was employed in her home, the majority’s conclusion that Claimant “was not, in any sense, required to remain on her work premises in her off-time,” MO at 436, 125 A.3d at 1191, is, in my view, unsupported. For these reasons, I find this prong to be satisfied.</p>

While Employer obviously did not “control” the premises, he most certainly occupied it, and it was where his “business”—his mother seeing to his health and personal care needs—was carried on; indeed, again, it was the only possible place this employer could have “carried on” his business affairs. Furthermore, to Employer’s suggestion that Claimant’s bedroom, where the attack occurred, was not part of Employer’s premises, I agree with the lower court’s common sense conclusion that “[i]f the employee and the employer are required to live together as a result of the employment arrangement, then the employee’s sleeping quarters should be included as part of the employer’s premises because sleeping is a necessity of life.” <em>O’Rourke, </em><a href="/a3d/83/1125-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="83 A.3d 1125" data-case-ids="7265264" data-case-paths="/a3d/83/1125-01">83 A.3d at 1137</a>.</p>
    <p id="b495-4" data-blocks='[["BL_495.5",495,[184,1204,1155,684]]]'>Finally, regarding the third prong—whether Claimant sustained injuries caused by the condition of the premises or by operation of the employer’s business or affairs thereon—there is a rebuttable presumption that, when an employee is injured by another employee at work, the injury is work-related. <em>See Kohler v. McCrory Stores, </em><a href="/pa/532/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="532 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="1835933" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0130-01">532 Pa. 130</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="532 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="1835933" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0130-01">615 A.2d 27</a>, 30 (1992). I agree with the Commonwealth Court that this presumption should apply here, even though the assault was perpetrated by Claimant’s <em>employer. See O’Rourke, </em><a href="/a3d/83/1125-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="83 A.3d 1125" data-case-ids="7265264" data-case-paths="/a3d/83/1125-01">83 A.3d at 1138</a>. Given this presumption, and given that the WCJ found Employer failed to rebut it by showing any personal reason for the attack, <em>see </em>WCJ’s Findings of Fact, 8/4/10, at ¶ 18, I conclude this final prong is met as well.</p>

Indeed, the son-employer, mother-employee relationship found here is incongruously atypical. Yet, that relationship, created by a state-funded program, was a bona fide employer-employee relationship to which the Workers’ Compensation Act applies. Further, that Act is remedial in nature, and must be liberally construed to effectuate its humanitarian objectives. <em>School District of Philadelphia v. W.C.A.B. (Hilton), </em>
