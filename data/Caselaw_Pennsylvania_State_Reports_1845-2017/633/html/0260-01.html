Agreeing to utilize a certain set of procedural rules does not name the administering body of those rules as sole arbitrator. As Judge Easterbrook observed in interpreting a similar arbitration agreement in favor of arbitration, “[i]f [the agreement] were designed to require arbitration to be conducted by [NAF] exclusively, the reference to its Code would be surplus-age; the only reason to refer to the Code is to create the possibility of arbitration outside the [NAF] ’s auspices, but using its rules of procedure.” <em>Green v.
