Funded jointly by the federal and state governments, Medicaid directs public monies toward the provision of healthcare services to qualifying individuals with low incomes and limited resources. <em>See generally </em><a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201396" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. §§ 1396">42 U.S.C. §§ 1396</a>-1396w-5; 62 P.S. §§ 441.1-449. In implementing one pillar of the delivery system in the Commonwealth—via a program called Health-Choices—DPW has negotiated and contracted with various managed care organizations (“MCOs”) to render the essential services available to enrollees. In the program’s Southeast Zone,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> five MCOs were selected.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The five MCOs serving enrollees in the Southeast Zone engaged DPW-approved dental subcontractors (“Subcontractors”) to fulfill the larger measure of the MCOs’ contractual obligations. <em>See generally Dental Benefit Providers, Inc. v.

The Department did not claim non-possession in its response to the initial open-records requests, and it was agreed by all at the hearing stage that the only issue was whether disclosure <em>exceptions </em>applied. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., May 21, 2012, at 16-17 (reflecting DPW’s advancement of the trade-secrets exception as the basis for denial of the request for records subsuming the MCO Rates); <em>id. </em>at 18, 21 (memorializing the remarks of counsel for the MCOs that the hearing involved “a very narrow issue” and “narrow questions” concerning the applicability of the trade-secrets/confidential-proprietary-information exception). Furthermore, it is undisputed that managed care organizations are required to submit subcontracts delegating their healthcare-related responsibilities to DPW for the agency’s advance written approval, per the Department’s standard written contract. <em>See, e.g., </em>Health-Choices Physical Health Agreement at 87 (version effective July 1, 2010).
