(“Mid-Atlantic”) is in the business of providing basement waterproofing services. Mid-Atlantic hired Appellee David Soeko (“Socko”) in March 2007 as a salesperson. At this time, Socko executed a two-year employment contract containing a covenant not to compete. In February 2009, Socko resigned from his employment with Mid-Atlantic, but the company rehired him four months later, in June 2009, At his time of rehire, Socko signed a new employment agreement containing another two-year covenant not to compete.</p>

Pursuant to the Agreement, which is at the heart of his appeal, Socko was not permitted to compete with Mid-Atlantic for two years after the termination of his employment in any of the following locations: Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, or any other jurisdiction in which Mid-Atlantic did business. The Agreement also expressly provided for the application of Pennsylvania law, and stated that the parties intended to be “legally bound.”</p>

Approximately one month later, Mid-Atlantic informed Socko’s new employer of the terms of Socko’s prior employment with Mid-Atlantic, attached a copy of the Agreement, and threatened litigation. Ten days later, Pennsylvania Basement Waterproofing terminated Socko’s employment.</p>

In support thereof, Socko filed a motion for partial summary judgment, asserting that the non-competition clause in the Agreement was unenforceable, as it was not supported by sufficient consideration. It was not disputed by the parties that the Agreement was signed during the course of Socko’s employment, and that Socko did not receive any benefit or any change in his existing employment status in exchange for signing the Agreement. Mid-Atlantic, however, citing the parties’ pledge in the Agreement to be “legally bound,” contended that the UWOA did not allow Socko to challenge the validity of the terms of the Agreement on the basis of a lack of consideration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Mid-Atlantic Systems of CPA, Inc., </em><a href="/a3d/99/0928-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="99 A.3d 928" data-case-ids="6922439" data-case-paths="/a3d/99/0928-01">99 A.3d 928</a> (Pa.Super.2014). After tracing the history of the treatment, and disfavor of, restrictive covenants in Pennsylvania, the court explained that, when an employee enters into an employment contract subsequent to the commencement of employment, which contains a covenant not to compete, the covenant must be supported by <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>new consideration in the form of a benefit to the employee or a beneficial change to his or her employment status.</p>
    <p id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[164,416,1156,1118]]]'>The court went on to consider the effect of the UWOA in light of the substantial common law public policy disfavoring restrictive covenants. The court acknowledged that the statute provided that a written promise shall not be invalid or unenforceable for lack of consideration if the writing also contains an express statement that the signer “intends to be legally bound,” 33 P.S. § 6, and that Pennsylvania courts have interpreted this section to mean that, in certain circumstances, a written agreement containing the express statement to be legally bound is not void for lack of consideration. Nevertheless, the Superior Court observed that, while, typically, and under the UWOA, courts will not inquire as to the adequacy of consideration, the area of restrictive covenants in employment contracts is an exception to this general rule. Importantly, the court pointed out that, while our Court has held that a contract under seal imports consideration which a party is not permitted to deny, such a seal is deemed inadequate consideration to support a covenant in restraint of trade; furthermore, the Superior Court reasoned that the seal and the UWOA had the same legal effect—to import consideration into a contract and eliminate the need for evidence of consideration.</p>
    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.6",615,[164,1570,1155,580]]]'>Thus, the court concluded that for a covenant not to compete to be enforceable, an employee must receive actual and valuable consideration for signing an employment agreement containing such a restrictive covenant, and that contract language “agreeing to be legally bound,” which satisfies the UWOA, nevertheless fails to provide the employee an actual benefit, and, therefore, is inadequate to support the enforcement of such a covenant. As Mid-Atlantic did not provide actual and valuable consideration to Socko when he executed the Agreement, the Superior Court concluded that the trial court properly found the Agreement to be unenforceable.</p>

Mid-Atlantic submits that the UWOA is not a substitute for consideration, but, rather, prohibits a party to a written agreement in which the party expresses an intention to be “legally bound” from later challenging the contract <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>based on a lack of consideration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Mid-Atlantic agrees with Socko that additional valuable consideration must be provided to an employee that signs a non-compete subsequent to the commencement of the employment relationship, but takes the position that, even if there is not additional valuable consideration, as the case here, nevertheless, under the UWOA, the “legally bound” language acts as a bar to a challenge to the validity of the agreement based upon a lack of consideration, citing <em>McGuire v.

    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.5",617,[161,1000,1155,1007]]]'>Mid-Atlantic goes on to list numerous rights which a party may contract away for a benefit, such as the right to a jury trial, forum selection, right to seek relief in court, and choice of law. Here, according to Mid-Atlantic, the agreement to be legally bound contracts away the right to later challenge the contract on the basis of a lack of consideration. For this reason, Mid-Atlantic further asserts that the Superior Court’s reliance on contract-under-seal cases is misplaced, as in Mid-Atlantic’s view, the seal (supplying consideration to support a covenant) and the UWOA (prohibiting a later challenge for lack of consideration), as described above, do not have the same effect. Mid-Atlantic rejects as <em>dicta </em>language in the cases relied upon by the Superior Court for the proposition that a seal and the UWOA share the same legal effect— namely, to import consideration into a contract and eliminate the need for proof of the existence of consideration. <em>See Morgan’s Home Equip.

Employing tools of statutory construction, Mid-Atlantic maintains that the plain and unambiguous language of the UWOA controls over any offering by Socko of the history of the Model Act, as discussed more fully below. Mid-Atlantic stresses that the Superior Court may not legislate, and, here, the clear language of the UWOA covers all agreements, including the Agreement at issue herein, which contain the operative language of the UWOA. Mid-Atlantic also urges our Court to decline Socko’s request to find an exception to the UWOA for non-compete agreements where none exists, and to hold that a non-competition restrictive covenant entered into after the commencement of employment may not be deemed to be void for lack of consideration pursuant to the UWOA when the employee agrees to be legally bound by its terms.</p>

Socko provides that restrictive covenants historically have been disfavored by the courts, as they are viewed as a restraint of trade preventing a former employee from earning a living. Socko asserts that, on one hand, Mid-Atlantic accepts that the UWOA is not a substitute for consideration, and does not disturb the requirement that valuable consideration is needed to support a restrictive covenant; but, on the other hand, Mid-Atlantic avers the UWOA nevertheless precludes a party to a non-compete agreement from challenging the covenant if valuable consideration is not provided. Socko warns that, as the boilerplate language that the parties “intend to be legally bound” appears in almost every contract in Pennsylvania, the practical effect of Mid-Atlantic’s interpretation of the UWOA would be the elimination of the consideration requirement for restrictive covenants. Contrary to Mid-Atlantic’s position, Socko develops that our Court has stated that the UWOA’s language as applied to a typical contract <em>is </em>a substitute for consideration. <em>See Morgan’s. </em>Socko further rejects <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>Mid-Atlantic’s reliance on the Superior Court’s decision in <em>McGuire </em>for the proposition that the UWOA acts as a bar to a challenge based on lack of consideration, as, according to Socko, that decision did not involve a restrictive covenant, the reference to the UWOA was <em>dicta, </em>and subsequent Superior Court decisions involving restrictive covenants have made clear that the UWOA is not a remedy for a lack of consideration for a restrictive covenant in an employment agreement.</p>
    <p id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[179,724,1154,784]]]'>Further, Socko maintains that the Superior Court’s citation to contract-under-seal cases was appropriate, as the language which satisfies the UWOA serves as a substitute for consideration in the same manner that a seal serves as a substitute for consideration. Socko offers that a “contract under seal imports consideration that a party is not permitted to deny,” Appellee’s Brief at 9 (quoting <em>Gompers v.

Indeed, Socko highlights Professor Samuel Williston’s understanding of the UWOA when he drafted the Model Act in 1925, and envisioned it to act as a moderate and reasonable substitute to the use of seals. Further, Socko emphasizes that the Model Act was promulgated in 1925, Pennsylvania enacted the statute in 1927, and while Utah, the only other state to do so, adopted the UWOA in 1929, it repealed the statute four years later, leaving Pennsylvania as the only state to retain the uniform rule. Socko emphasizes, however, that it was never suggested that the statute was enacted to circumvent Pennsylvania law regarding <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>agreements in restraint of trade, which, according to Socko, was well-established at the time the UWOA was enacted.</p>

      <em>Amicus </em>Richard Matesic, a solo practitioner from Shaler Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, who represents individuals in employment and consumer protection litigation, provides a history of the UWOA and disputes Mid-Atlantic’s interpretation of the act as being against the public policy of the Commonwealth, which prohibits the enforcement of a non-competition agreement without adequate consideration and which discourages restraints of trade. <em>Amicus </em>contends that, while there exists no legislative history regarding the passage of the UWOA, the various commissioners of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, including Professor Williston, “advanced a libertarian view, one that frankly ignored the social costs attendant in enforcement of adhesive contracts; they believed any person should be free to bind themselves irrevocably to an obligation, simply by signing a document containing the words that the promisor ‘intend[ed] to be legally bound.’ ” Amicus Brief at 8. Yet, <em>Amicus </em>maintains that, at these discussions, Williston also was of the view that the statute would not prevent a court sitting in equity from refusing to enforce a signed agreement containing the “legally bound” verbiage. According to <em>Amicus, </em>application of the UWOA would lead to an absurd and unreasonable result, as restraints on trade have been historically disfavored in the law, new and valuable consideration must be conferred on a currently employed individual for a new promise not to compete, and application of the UWOA, as interpreted by Mid-Atlantic, would deprive a court from ever determining whether adequate compensation was paid.</p>

One aspect of a contractual exception to the at-will doctrine, directly at issue in this appeal, is a restrictive covenant not to compete. In the absence of an agreement between an employer and employee to the contrary, the law does not prohibit an employee from competing with his former employer after the employee’s service has been terminated. <em>Morgan’s, </em><a href="/citations/?q=136%20A.2d%20838" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="136 A.2d 838">136 A.2d at 844</a>.

The earliest cases were decided against the economic background of a chronic shortage of skilled workers in England, the result of the virulent epidemics of the Black Death during the fourteenth century. It was not surprising, then, that all covenants to refrain from practicing a trade were held to be void as against public policy. This policy carried over into the early seventeenth century when the grants of exclusive trading privileges by the <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>Sovereign caused widespread public indignation which broadened into a dislike for all restraints upon the free exercise of trade. However, by the eighteenth century England found itself in the midst of a new commonercial [sic] era, and adjusting to changed economic conditions, the courts upheld at common law contracts in partial restraint of trade provided they were ancillary to a principal transaction, and were reasonably limited both in geographical extent and duration of time.</blockquote>

Handbook of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and Proceedings of the Thirty-Fifth Annual Meeting (Detroit, Michigan 1925) at 194-97; Amicus Brief at 9-10. This being the case, the UWOA was viewed as providing a substitute for the seal—thus providing consideration—and, consistent with the language of the statute, the lack of actual consideration would not result in an invalid or unenforceable agreement. Therefore, for these reasons, we reject Mid-Atlantic’s interpretation of this statutory provision as prohibiting a signatory to the agreement from challenging the contract on the basis of a lack of consideration.</p>

First, as detailed above, our Commonwealth has a long, and virtually uniform, history of strongly disfavoring covenants in restraint of trade. While beneficial and necessary in some ways to an employer, our courts have recognized the unique and heavy burden placed upon an employee in attempting to earn a living when subjected to a restrictive covenant. Indeed, contracts containing restrictive covenants are treated as unique in the law, and we find it significant that, even with respect to a contract under seal, an exception was recognized for contracts involving a restraint of trade. <em>Gompers, </em><a href="/pa/56/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="56 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="1009135" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0194-01">56 Pa. at 197</a> (agreement in restraint of trade “is the only exception to the rule, that a contract under seal imports consideration which a party is not permitted to deny”); <em>see also Newman v.

Moreover, and consistent with this <em>sui generis </em>approach to agreements in restraint of trade, our courts have mandated, in the post-commencement employment scenario, strict compliance with various requirements, including new and valuable consideration, beyond mere continued employment, to permit enforcement of the restric<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>tive covenant.

Moreover, our conclusion is buttressed by the narrow construction which must be given to the UWOA. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(8).
