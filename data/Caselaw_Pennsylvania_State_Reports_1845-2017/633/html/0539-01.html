Police charged appellant with harassment and simple assault. While in prison awaiting his preliminary hearing, appellant tried to call his wife multiple times; she did not answer because the calls upset her. On July 14, 2012, appellant called his father, who called appellant’s wife on a separate phone and relayed appellant’s statements to her, establishing a three-way call on the two phones. Appellant insisted his wife tell the magistrate she would not testify, that she made a mistake, and that she caused her own injuries. If she failed to do so, appellant stated he would go to jail for two years, starve, and lose everything. He also told her that she must comply for the sake of their marriage, which he repeatedly described as “priceless.” Prison Recording, Commonwealth’s Exhibit 4, at 13:39-14:45. Appellant stated that if his wife was charged with making false statements, he would pay her fines. Two days later, she told police she no longer wished to press charges. <em>See </em>N.T.

Appellant argues, under <em>Brachbill, </em>courts are treating § 4952(b)(1)(h) as a “super element” which constitutes proof of intimidation under § 4952(a). <em>Id., </em>at 10. As 18 Pa.C.S. § 4952(a) requires intimidation or an attempt to intimidate, appellant posits such an interpretation conflicts with the plain language of the statute and the rule of lenity, which provides penal statutes are to be strictly construed. <em>See </em>1 Pa,C.S. § 1928(b)(1). Appellant submits that <em>Brachbill, </em>despite referencing the rule of lenity and that statutory terms are to be given their ordinary meanings, ignored both notions, as evidenced by the statement “ ‘it is nevertheless clear that the legislature intended to proscribe ... <em>any offers </em>of benefit with the’ ” applicable <em>mens rea. </em>Appellant’s Brief, at 9-10 (omission and emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Brachbill, </em>at 86). He further notes the legislature meant to give a narrow meaning to intimidation since 18 Pa.C.S. § 4952’s predecessor, <em>id., </em>§ 4907 (repealed),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> used the broader term “induce,” <em>id. </em>

The Commonwealth posits the pecuniary benefit provision does not replace the need to prove intimidation but instead stands for the proposition § 4952(a) is not limited to overtly threatening acts, and that <em>Lynch </em>reaffirmed this notion. Observing appellant selectively quoted <em>Lynch, </em>the Commonwealth submits <em>Lynch </em>merely clarified the type of intimidation “need not be of the bodily harm type.” <em>Id., </em>at 9. As to appellant’s claim that “any offer will do[,]” Appellant’s Brief, at 11, the Commonwealth highlights <em>Lynch </em>specifically rejected such an assertion, Commonwealth’s Brief, at 9 (“ ‘[A]n offer of benefits may be so vague, incredible, or frivolous on its face that it necessarily fails to constitute the criminal act proscribed[.]’ ” (quoting <em>Lynch, </em>at 710)).</p>

The dissent underscored that neither the trial court nor the Commonwealth cited the pecuniary benefit provision, <em>id., </em>at 712-13, and criticized the majority for implying “any offer of benefit” would suffice, noting an offer must be pecuniary in nature, given the statute’s text and the rule of lenity, <em>id., </em>at 714.

Yet, as mentioned by the dissent in <em>Lynch, Brachbill </em>placed its perception of legislative purpose above the language of the criminal statute. In § 4952, the elements of the crime are complete within subsection (a); subsection (b) deals with penalty, not elements of the crime itself. However, while findings relevant to penalty do not replace elements of the crime, the former may reflect that a broader interpretation of the latter is appropriate. Thus, it is true the Court in <em>Brachbill </em>gave short shrift to the fact the legislature replaced the broader term “induce” with the narrower term “intimidate,” and based its holding primarily on purpose gleaned from grading provisions. It is also true the Court rejected the argument that overt intimidation was necessary, as inducement enumerated in (b) was recognized by the legislature as a potential component of intimidation under subsection (a). <em>See Brachbill, </em>at 85-86.</p>

Rather, it disagreed with the appellants’ argument that the statute requires “threats or attempts of coercion.” <em>Brachbill, </em>at 85. Where <em>Brachbill </em>goes awry is in suggesting a pecuniary benefit, in and of itself, comprises intimidation. Such an inducement may or may not intimidate, but the legislature replaced the element of inducement with the element of intimidation. The legislature did not state that inducements cannot suffice to constitute intimidation; it said the opposite.</p>

      <em>Brachbill </em>did not abolish the Commonwealth’s need to prove intimidation.

Insofar as <em>Brachbill </em>is read to mean pecuniary inducement alone will suffice without proof of intimidation, it is disapproved. While understandable, to the extent the Superior Court relied on <em>Brachbill </em>to find intimidation is not needed to satisfy a conviction under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4952, <em>see Doughty, </em>at 6-7, we hold the court erred.</p>
