Furthermore, the Commonwealth observes, the Assembly otherwise has sanctioned the use of juvenile adjudications in sentencing, <em>inter alia, </em>by acquiescing in sentencing guidelines that require them to be used to calculate prior record scores for adult offenders. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9721(b) (requiring sentencing courts to consider guidelines for sentencing adopted by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing); 204 Pa.Code § 303.6(a) (explicitly providing for counting of certain “[pjrior juvenile adjudications” within a defendant’s Prior Record Score in discretionary sentencing determinations).

He highlights the explicit distinction, made within Section 6105’s own terms, between juvenile adjudication and convictions; the Juvenile Act’s specific admonition that an adjudication “is not a conviction,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6354(a); and the principle of statutory construction requiring penal provisions to be construed narrowly, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1). Appellee distinguishes <em>Baker </em>as discrete to the capital sentencing arena, involving a discretionary sentencing determination as opposed to a mandatory enhancement, and pertaining to a sentencing regime which does not internally distinguish between adjudications and convictions.

The controlling point here is that Section 6105 does not proceed, along any such lines, to predicate the misdemeanor-to-felony enhancement upon adjudications of delinquency. Indeed, as emphasized by the intermediate court and Appellee, the consequence of a juvenile adjudication is otherwise addressed within the four corners of the statute. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 6105(c)(7).

Therefore, I dissent.</p>
    <p id="b796-5" data-blocks='[["BL_796.5",796,[269,590,1157,901]]]'>This Court has held that a conviction is defined as “the ascertainment of the guilt of the accused and judgment thereon by the court.” <em>Commonwealth v. Kimmel, </em><a href="/citations/?q=528%20Pa.%20107" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="528 Pa. 107">528 Pa. 107</a>, <a href="/pa/523/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="565 A.2d 426" data-case-ids="1820349" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0107-01">565 A.2d 426</a>, 428 (1989). However, in the context of the Death Penalty Statute, this Court has accorded the term a broader reach, encompassing instances in which there has been a finding of guilt, even though a judgment of sentence has not yet been imposed. <em>Commonwealth v. Beasley, </em><a href="/pa/505/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="505 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1788846" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0279-01">505 Pa. 279</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="505 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1788846" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0279-01">479 A.2d 460</a> (1984). A juvenile delinquency adjudication, which involves a finding that a juvenile committed a criminal act, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6341(a), (b), has been treated as a conviction at the sentencing phase of a death penalty case to establish an aggravating circumstance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
      <em>See Commonwealth v. Baker, </em><a href="/pa/531/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="531 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1834316" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0541-01">531 Pa. 541</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="531 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1834316" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0541-01">614 A.2d 663</a> (1992). Furthermore, this Court has found juvenile delinquency adjudications are admissible to rebut mitigating circumstances in death penalty cases. <em>See Commonwealth v. Stokes, </em><a href="/pa/532/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="532 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1835927" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0242-01">532 Pa. 242</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="532 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1835927" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0242-01">615 A.2d 704</a> (1992).</p>
