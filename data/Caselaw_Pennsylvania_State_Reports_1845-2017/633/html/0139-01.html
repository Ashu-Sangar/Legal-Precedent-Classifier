This matter concerns a 229.24 acre parcel of commercial/industrial property situated at 1425 Eden Road, Sprin-gettsbury Township, York, Pennsylvania, which is currently owned by Appellee Harley-Davidson Motor Company (“Harley-Davidson”). Approximately 110 acres of the parcel contain buildings and other improvements, and the remaining 119 acres are considered “excess” land. Previously, the United States Navy, from 1941 until 1964, and, later, a private firm, American Machinery and Foundry Company (“AMF”), with whom Harley-Davidson merged in 1969, used the parcel to operate a weapons manufacturing plant and, in the course of <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>their business, buried numerous contaminants—as well as unexploded military ordnance—in the subsurface strata. Not surprisingly, this use occasioned significant environmental damage to the property. Military contracting was phased out in the 1980s. In 1993, Harley-Davidson repurposed a portion of the site to operate a motorcycle manufacturing plant, which continues in operation today.</p>

Therefore, federal standards are satisfied if the requirements under the state program are met. As a result, and collaterally as a matter of state law, Harley-Davidson’s conduct relative to the parcel is governed by the Pennsylvania Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards Act, 35 P.S. §§ 6026.101 <em>et seq. </em>(“Act 2”), which enables land owners to avoid state environmental liability by satisfying certain conditions, including, <em>inter alia, </em>using or selling the property only for commercial/mdustrial <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>purposes, and maintaining certain engineering controls until Act 2 remediation is complete.</p>

Appellant Central York School District (“School District”) intervened, and the parties proceeded to a three-day bench trial to determine the parcel’s assessments for tax years 2004 through 2010, pursuant to the Second Class A and Third Class County Assessment Law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

At trial, both parties offered experts in support of their positions regarding valuation of the property. The experts considered the three traditional approaches to valuation, discussed below in greater detail: the cost approach, the comparable sales approach, and the income approach. As the trial court concluded, and the parties agreed, the cost approach, which considered reproduction or replacement costs of the property, less depreciation and obsolescence, was not applicable to the property. The testimony before the trial court focused on the comparison approach, which compares sales of property of similar size, type, and location of the property, and the income capitalization valuation approach, which considers fair market value by dividing the subject property’s annual net rental income by an investment rate of return. <em>Jackson v.

Regarding Harley-Davidson’s initial claim, the Court observed that, pursuant to, <em>inter alia, Air Products </em>and <em>Craftmaster, </em>an appraisal must be based on the property in its current state, considering its potential for development, but that valuation of the property may not be made as if it were already subdivided and developed. The court noted that, in <em>Craftmaster, </em>it reviewed a trial court’s acceptance of an expert’s appraisal of market value wherein the expert had “viewed the Property as three separate tax parcels and assigned separate values” to each parcel, and rejected that appraisal because, <em>inter alia, </em>it found that the method evaluated the property as if it had already been subdivided and developed. <em>In re: Harley-Davidson, </em><a href="/a3d/80/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="80 A.3d 506" data-case-ids="7302935" data-case-paths="/a3d/80/0506-01">80 A.3d at 520</a> (quoting <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>

Reasoning that these restrictions would certainly affect the parcel’s market value, the Commonwealth Court rejected Camins’ and the trial court’s conclusions to the contrary as unsupported by substantial evidence. Moreover, the Commonwealth Court agreed that Camins’ and the trial court’s application of a 5% stigma reduction was essentially arbitrary, in that there was no evidence of record detailing how Camins’ arrived at that number, and, thus, found the same was likewise unsupported by substantial evidence.

The School District points out that the lower tribunals determined, consistent with Camins’ testimony, that the highest and best use of the property is not as a single user manufacturing <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>facility, but as a warehouse and office space with excess land suitable for development. Moreover, the School District argues that the methodology that Camins used to determine fair market value of the property is consistent with a long line of Pennsylvania decisions. Specifically, the School District submits that the Commonwealth Court in <em>Air Products </em>and <em>Craftmaster </em>explained that hypothetical ways in which property could be used by potential buyers, including subdivision of the property, should be considered in determining what a willing buyer will pay for the property in its current condition, but that the property should not be valued as though it were already in that hypothetical condition. Thus, consistent with <em>Air Products </em>and <em>Craftmaster, </em>the School District maintains Camins did just that: determined the parcel’s value by considering what a developer would pay for it, which necessarily entailed a calculation of what a developer would spend and earn in developing the property, and the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that Camins had, contrary to his testimony, determined the parcel’s value as if it were already subdivided. Further, the School District contends, consistent with President Judge Pellegrini’s dissent, that, since Camins repeatedly testified that he had evaluated the property in this regard, and not as if it were already subdivided, the Commonwealth Court usurped the trial court’s role and erred in impeaching Camins’ testimony with the substance of his report. The School District asserts that Harley-Davidson’s position—that the reasonably foreseeable prospect of the property’s excess land being developed in the future is not a permissible factor in valuation—is erroneous, and contradicts <em>Air Products </em>and <em>Craftmaster, </em>as well as well-established practice among appraisers. The School District stresses that the trial court found that there was excess land on the property, and that it was reasonably foreseeable that the excess land could be developed.</p>

Specifically, the School District offers Camins’ negative response to the question of <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>whether he assumed the property was already subdivided, his statement that he looked at the property in its entirety, and his statement that that subdivision was not assumed for the highest and best use, as the property did not have to necessarily be subdivided. Finally, the School District points out that Camins provided one final value conclusion for each year in question, and did not assign separate taxable values based upon separate properties. The School District emphasizes Camins’ testimony regarding hypothetical uses, i.e., how the property <em>could </em>be subdivided, how the building <em>could </em>be sold, and how the excess land has <em>potential </em>for subdivision. Ca-mins’ testimony, according to the School District, is consistent with <em>Air Products </em>and <em>Craftmaster’s </em>holdings that hypothetical ways in which the property could be used for potential buyers should be considered in determining what a willing buyer would pay for the property. Related thereto, the School District submits that the substantial evidence of record also supports that Camins did not value the property as if it were already adapted for its highest and best use as a warehouse and office space, as deductions for demolition and renovations to the property, and other costs, including leasing of buildings and the developers’ profit, which would be required to realize the property’s highest and best use were taken into account. Thus, rather than valuing the property already in the hypothetical condition, the School District contends that Camins valued the property considering the costs a typical developer would incur to realize the highest and best use of the property.</p>

      <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>Harley-Davidson responds that the School District’s appraiser, Camins, identified portions of the property as excess land suitable for development and improperly considered a subdivision of the excess property in arriving at his assessment. Harley-Davidson argues that the Commonwealth Court’s decisions in <em>Craflmaster </em>and <em>Air Products </em>were properly relied upon by the court below as prohibiting a subdivision approach to valuation. Specifically, Harley-Davidson avers that the circumstances in this appeal are similar to that in <em>Craflmaster, </em>which relied in part upon its prior decision in <em>Air Products. </em>Harley-Davidson offers that, in <em>Craflmaster, </em>the court found an expert’s valuation based upon a hypothetical subdivided property—including valuation of residential structures in the area, valuation of former residential structures that were being used by Craftmaster in its business operations, and identifying excess land which was valued separately on the assumption it could be sold to smaller businesses—did not represent a reasonably foreseeable “prospect” for the property which existed at the time of the assessment. Harley-Davidson claims that, like Camins, the appraiser in <em>Crafl-master </em>engaged in the legally inappropriate hypothetical subdivision of the property in arriving at his opinion as to a highest and best use of the property. Moreover, Harley-Davidson submits that the Commonwealth Court’s prior decision in <em>Air Products </em>is entirely consistent with its decision in the matter <em>sub judice, </em>as, while the rationale for the <em>Air Products </em>decision involved employment of a value-in-use analysis, not whether an improper subdivision was conducted, the court was faced with a similar assessment situation in which the court noted a distinction between reasonably foreseeable prospects for the property which exist at the time of the assessment—that is, probable use, which may be considered in determining property fair market value—and impermissible valuation as though the property were already in that hypothetical condition.</p>

As emphasized by President Judge Pellegrini in his concurring and dissenting opinion, the record establishes that Camins’ purpose in referring to a hypothetical subdivision was merely to show the use to which the land was best adapted and the property’s highest and best use.

According to the School District, the trial court properly considered a number of factors with respect to environmental degradation, including a settlement agreement under which 100% of the environmental remediation costs were to be paid by the United States government or Harley-Davidson; the fact a remediation fund has been established; and the fact that, under the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s model buyer-seller agreement under Pennsylvania’s Act 2 Program—used to facilitate the purchase of property while remediation of property contamination is ongoing—a buyer may purchase contaminated property and obtain protection from potential environmental liability.

Specifically, Harley-Davidson offers that, at one extreme, local taxing authorities have argued that they should be able to ignore the effect of contamination on property value, and, on the other extreme, taxpayers who own contaminated property have argued that tax assessors should deduct cleanup costs from the market value of the property. In what it refers to as the “Oregon Rule,” based upon an approach employed by the Oregon Department of Revenue, Harley-Davidson submits that the better approach is to recognize some effect that environmental contamination has on property values—in essence, a cost-to-eure approach—as a bright-line rule that includes all costs related to the site cleanup, and a discounted present value of those costs.

See N.T., 7/24/2011, at 347, Camins' explanation did not suggest he had already subdivided the property in his assessment, but merely that the property did not <em>necessarily </em>have to be subdivided, as an investor <em>could </em>buy the entirety and just utilize and develop portions of the property in the future. <em>Id, </em>at 347-48. With respect to the excess lands, Camins was likewise clear that he did not consider the property to <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>already be in a subdivided state, explaining that it <em>could </em>be developed aside from the main section of property. <em>Id. </em>at 353. When specifically asked if he assumed the property was already subdivided, Camins again indicated that he did not, and that he looked at the land in a current as-ís situation and as an entirety. <em>Id. </em>at 354. Thus, employing deferential review, there is a solid basis on which to conclude that the trial court’s determination was supported by the substantial evidence of record.</p>

Before the Commonwealth Court, Harley-Davidson challenged another aspect of the trial court’s valuation of the property. The primary-issue before the trial court was a determination of the <em>market value </em>of the property for the relevant years. Once the court arrived at the market value of the property for these time periods, the court was required by law to apply a common level ratio (the ratio of assessed value to current market value) for each year to arrive at the <em>assessed value </em>for the property for each year in question pursuant to 72 P.S. § 5350 (now 53 Pa.C.S. § 8854). The trial court did not apply the common level ratio to the fair market value, but rather equated the market value and the assessed value of the property. The Commonwealth Court explained that, pursuant to 72 P.S. § 5350, a court determining a parcel's assessed value must demonstrate on the record that it has determined the parcel’s market value and, then, multiply that value by the applicable common level ratio to arrive at its assessed value. In the instant case, the Commonwealth Court observed that the trial court did not demonstrate its calculation on the record and, in any event, appeared to simply adopt Camins’ pre-reduction values as the parcel’s market value; thus, the Commonwealth Court agreed with Harley-Davidson that the trial court had erred in its calculation. Before us, the parties discuss and appear to be in agreement, as the <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>Commonwealth Court found, that the trial court determined fair market value but failed to apply the appropriate common level ratio for each year of the tax appeal as required. As we did not grant allocatur with respect to this issue, we leave undisturbed the Commonwealth Court’s remand to the trial court to properly apply the correct ratio.</p>

On this question, the present focus is mainly on whether the expert assumed the land had already been subdivided. The majority quotes four sentences from Mr. Camins’ 2006 appraisal report suggesting that there is a “potential” for subdivision, or that subdivision “could” occur, and concludes from such statements that the <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>expert did not value the property as if it had already been subdivided. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 158-59, 124 A.3d at 281. To my mind, these types of expressions do not speak directly to the contested issue of whether Mr. Camins ultimately valued the property by using figures reflecting a hypothetical subdivision. I believe that the calculations used by the expert are more probative of the question.</p>

Although Mr. Camins denied that he assumed the land was already subdivided for valuation purposes, <em>see </em>N.T., Jan. 24, 2011, at 354, R.R. 182a, his explanation was that he thought subdivision would be unnecessary to make the varying uses of the property as contemplated. <em>See </em>N.T., Feb. 1, 2011, at 24, R.R. 266a; <em>accord id. </em>at 26, R.R. 267a.

In a responsive footnote, the majority repeats the essential aspects of Mr. Camins’ testimony mentioned above, namely, that he: gave a single valuation for the property; stated the property "could” be subdivided or there was a "potential” for subdivision; and did not assume, contrary to <em>Air Products </em>and <em>Craftmaster, </em>that subdivision had already taken place. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 159-60 n. 7, 124 A.3d at 281-82 n. 7. Respectfully, however, the majority's response does not address the substantive points articulated above. In particular, and as noted, the single valuation consists of a mathematical sum of the values of the component parts, and Mr. Camins—a non-lawyer—supplied no basis to support his apparent assumption that the hypothetical multiple and varying uses of the property could all be realized simultaneously absent subdivision. Ascertaining whether such occurrence is reasonably possible appears, to me at least, as a logical prerequisite to any finding concerning the property's fair market value based on a simple arithmetic sum of Mr. Camins' component figures.</p>
