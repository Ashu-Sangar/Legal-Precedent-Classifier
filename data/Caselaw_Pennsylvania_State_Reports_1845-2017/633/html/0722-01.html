Several months later, Northampton County Children and Youth Services (“CYS”) filed an emergency application for protective custody over Child. The trial court adjudicated Child dependent and granted CYS legal custody on February 9, 2012. CYS subsequently removed Child from Mother’s home and placed her in the care of Appellant D.M.

In the instant case, it is undeniable that a decision regarding Appellants’ claimed right to standing to intervene in the custody proceedings will have a direct effect on Appellants’ ability to participate in the custody proceedings, and, thus, on Child, as, if Appellants are, in fact, entitled to intervene in the custody action, they could be awarded partial or full custody.</p>

More specifically, in the context of child custody proceedings, the state has a “paramount concern” in “the best interest and permanent welfare of the child,” and has deemed all other considerations “subordinate to the child’s physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual well-being.” <em>In re Davis, </em><a href="/pa/502/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="502 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1784489" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0110-01">502 Pa. 110</a>, <a href="/pa/502/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="502 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1784489" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0110-01">465 A.2d 614</a>, 618 (1983); <em>see also G.B., </em><a href="/pa-super/448/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="670 A.2d 714" data-case-ids="732367,7862903" data-case-paths="/pa-super/448/0133-01,/a2d/670/0714-01">670 A.2d at 718</a> (“Child custody orders are treated differently because they have significant, important and immediate impact upon the welfare of children.”).</p>

In this regard, as noted, Appellants rely on <em>Barnes, </em>a case which concerned the restructuring of a charitable institution. Therein, an appellant seeking to participate in the orphans’ court proceedings was denied intervention, failed to appeal from the trial court’s order denying his petition to intervene, and, instead, lodged an appeal from the final order in the case. We quashed the appellant’s appeal because he had failed to obtain intervenor status and, thus, was not a party to the underlying action. <em>See Barnes, </em><a href="/pa/582/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="871 A.2d 792" data-case-ids="650304,650365,8979914,8979949" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0370-01,/pa/582/0370-02,/a2d/871/0792-01,/a2d/871/0792-02">871 A.2d at 795</a>. In so doing, we reasoned that “a common pleas court’s order denying intervention is one type of order which <em>must be appealed within thirty days </em>of its entry under Rule of Appellate Procedure 903, <em>or not at all, </em>precisely because the failure to attain intervenor status forecloses a later appeal.” <a id="p732" href="#p732" data-label="732" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*732</a>

We explained that requiring a party who has satisfied the requirements of the collateral order doctrine to timely appeal from the denial of intervention, rather than wait to appeal that denial after final judgment, was the preferred approach in such circumstances, as it would avoid the “risk [of] interference with trial court proceedings taken after the denial of intervention, a prospect far costlier than insisting that the applicant appeal the denial without waiting to see whether the outcome of the proceedings leaves intervention still desirable.” <em><a href="/pa/582/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="871 A.2d 792" data-case-ids="650304,650365,8979914,8979949" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0370-01,/pa/582/0370-02,/a2d/871/0792-01,/a2d/871/0792-02">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/582/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="871 A.2d 792" data-case-ids="650304,650365,8979914,8979949" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0370-01,/pa/582/0370-02,/a2d/871/0792-01,/a2d/871/0792-02">at 795</a> (quoting Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

Moreover, the rationale behind requiring the immediate appeal of a denial of intervention in Barnes—namely, the risk of interference with subsequent trial proceedings—is even more pronounced in the context of a child custody action, given the significant interests at stake. We, therefore, find that <em>Barnes </em>applies to the trial court’s order in the instant case. Accordingly, because <em>Barnes </em>unequivocally requires any party who was denied intervention and who satisfies the requirements of Rule 313<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> to appeal from the order denying intervention within 30 days of its entry or lose the right to appeal the order entirely, Appellants’ right to appeal from the order denying intervention in the instant case will be manifestly lost if they are not permitted to appeal the order.</p>

Moreover, our courts are firmly committed to the prompt and efficient resolution of matters involving children, including child custody actions, as exhibited by our appellate rules and Internal Operating Procedures (“IOPs”), which have responded to the unique issues associated with appeals involving children—deemed “children’s fast track appeals”—by expediting such actions, “shortening] the time frames for all aspects of the appellate process.” G.
