Clancy, whose backyard was approximately seventy-five yards from Appellant’s residence, observed Appellant driving his speeding pickup truck on an alley in front of Mr. Clancy’s home. After Appellant parked his pickup truck alongside his backyard, which abutted the <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>alley, Mr. Clancy yelled, “Slow the fuck down, asshole.” N.T. 5/14/12, jury trial, at 77. Mr. Clancy and Appellant began arguing, and after Appellant “pulled his pants down and mooned” Mr. Clancy, he went inside his residence and called 911. <em>Id. </em>at 79. Mr. Clancy went back outside and observed Appellant holding a two-by-four piece of lumber. With Mr. Clancy still communicating with the 911 operator, Mr. Clancy and Appellant continued to argue and Appellant again “mooned” Mr. Clancy. As Appellant angrily stalked back to his residence, he passed Robert Henninger and Todd Schae-del, who were standing in the alley.</p>

Officer Lasso asked Mr. Clancy for Appellant’s whereabouts, and Mr. Clancy pointed up the alley in the direction of Appellant’s residence. Officer Lasso drove his police vehicle to the rear of Appellant’s residence, and when he disembarked, he asked Mr. Henninger for Appellant’s location. Mr. Henninger responded Appellant was in his backyard, and as Officer Lasso walked toward the gate to Appellant’s backyard, Mr. Henninger heard Officer Lasso call out to Appellant, “George, please talk to me, come out to talk to me.” <em>Id. </em>at 167. Mr. Henninger and Mr. Schaedel both heard Appellant’s dogs barking, and Mr. Schaedel heard Officer Lasso instruct Appellant, “[C]ontrol your dogs.” <em>Id. </em>at 125, 132.

Bruneio, who was one quarter of a mile away at the police station, responded to the request. Chief Bruneio arrived at Mr. Clancy’s residence within two or three minutes after receiving Officer Lasso’s request for backup, and he observed Officer Lasso’s police vehicle parked near Appellant’s backyard. Chief Bruneio parked his police vehicle behind Officer Lasso’s police vehicle, disembarked, and as he <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>asked Mr. Henninger and Mr. Schaedel, who were still at the scene, where Officer Lasso was located, he heard a “commotion” in Appellant’s backyard. Accordingly, Chief Bruneio went over to the backyard gate.</p>
    <p id="b117-5" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[181,513,1155,456]]]'>Upon approaching the gate, Chief Bruneio noticed Officer Lasso positioned by Appellant’s patio, approximately five feet from the rear door of the residence and with his back to the door. Chief Bruneio saw Officer Lasso attempting to fend off two large snarling dogs who were threatening Officer Lasso. Specifically, Chief Bruneio observed Officer Lasso, who had a taser<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> in his left hand pointed toward the sky, kicking at the dogs. Officer Lasso’s sidearm, a .40 caliber Glock, was in his holster.</p>
    <p id="b117-6" data-blocks='[["BL_117.6",117,[180,1001,1155,878]]]'>Chief Bruneio drew his own sidearm, which was also a .40 caliber Glock, and entered the backyard. Intending for Officer Lasso to use his drawn taser on one of the dogs, while he was going to shoot the other dog, Chief Bruneio yelled out to Officer Lasso, “[S]hoot ’em.” <em>Id. </em>at 208. Immediately, before either officer took any action towards the dogs, and with Officer Lasso still pointing his taser towards the sky, “a loud shot rang out,” and Officer Lasso fell facedown to the ground, lying motionless by the patio. <em>Id. </em>at 210, 242. The dogs became startled and ran past Chief Bruneio, who went down on one knee and searched for the direction from which the gunshot originated. From his vantage point, Chief Bruneio was unable to see inside the house and, thus, he was unaware that Appellant was standing at the residence’s rear door. Approximately twenty to thirty seconds elapsed from the time Chief Bruneio first observed Officer Lasso until the moment when Officer Lasso was shot.</p>

Appellant had his left hand on the pump of the shotgun and his other hand on the trigger. With his sidearm trained on Appellant, Chief Bruneio ordered Appellant to drop the shotgun, and Appellant replied, “[H]e’s trying to get in my house.” <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>
      <em>Id. </em>at 214. Chief Bruneio again ordered Appellant to drop the shotgun, and Appellant replied, “[H]e tried to break in my house.” <em>Id. </em>Chief Bruneio became “very stern,” and ordered Appellant to “drop it now.” <em>Id. </em>As Chief Bruneio made these commandments, he realized Appellant’s shotgun had jammed after Appellant shot Officer Lasso, thus rendering the shotgun temporarily inoperable.</p>
    <p id="b118-5" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[286,667,1151,363]]]'>After the third commandment, Appellant complied and placed the shotgun on nearby steps. Chief Bruneio handcuffed Appellant and placed him in his police vehicle. Chief Bruneio then ran back to where Officer Lasso was lying motionless surrounded by a pool of blood emanating from a large shotgun wound to the base of his skull. Chief Bruneio could not detect a pulse.</p>
    <p id="b118-6" data-blocks='[["BL_118.6",118,[286,1053,1150,463]]]'>Meanwhile, uniformed Bethlehem Township Police Sergeant Gregory Gotschall and Officer Robert Stametz, who had heard Officer Lasso’s initial request for back-up, arrived at the scene, and Chief Bruneio told them, “It’s too late. He shot Robert. Robert’s dead.” <em>Id. </em>at 260. Sergeant Gotschall observed Officer Lasso’s body on the ground, unsuccessfully attempted to find a pulse, and then asked Chief Bruneio where the shooter was located. Chief Bruneio informed the officers the shooter was in custody in the rear of his police vehicle.</p>

Because he did not have gloves with him, Officer Stametz asked another responding officer, Lower Sau-con Township Police Officer Robert Winters, to pat-down Appellant, and Officer Stametz left to assist Sergeant Gotsc-hall with securing Appellant’s residence. As Officer Winters patted down Appellant, Bethlehem Police Officer Richard Hoffman held Appellant. The pat-down did not reveal any contraband; however, after it was completed, and as Officer Hoffman was placing Appellant into the police vehicle, Appellant spontaneously stated, “I’m tired of that son of a bitch always coming on my property and trespassing. I know my rights. I was defending my property. He was trying to come <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>in my back door.” <em>Id. </em>at 298-99.

Realizing no one was guarding Appellant, Officer Hoffman sprinted to the vehicle and when he looked through the window, Appellant gave him “a thousand yard stare” indicative of someone who is very agitated. <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.6",119,[183,859,1153,691]]]'>Subsequently, at approximately 5:27 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police troopers, including Troopers Seth J. Kelly and Dennis Sims, Jr. arrived on the scene. At approximately 6:32 p.m., the troopers removed Appellant from Chief Bruneio’s police vehicle and placed him in the rear seat of a Pennsylvania State Police cruiser for purposes of transporting him to the police station. As Trooper Kelly sat beside Appellant in the rear seat, Trooper Sims advised Appellant he was being subjected to audio and video recording, and he turned the camera so that it would face Appellant. Appellant spontaneously stated, “Hey, I’m on candid camera.” <em>Id. </em>at 314; N.T. 5/15/12, jury trial, at 125. The troopers then transported Appellant to the police barracks.</p>

Appellant filed pre-trial motions, including motions for a change of venue and/or venire, to suppress evidence seized by the police, and to suppress statements Appellant made to the police. On January 27, 2012, the trial court held a hearing, at which the Commonwealth presented the testimony of seven police officers, and in an opinion <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>and order filed on April 20, 2012, the trial court substantially denied Appellant’s motions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Moreover, Appellant filed several motions <em>in limine </em>challenging Pennsylvania’s capital sentencing scheme, seeking to exclude evidence of the firearms legally seized by police from Appellant’s residence, and seeking to exclude the autopsy photographs.

At trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence from a number of civilian and police witnesses, who testified about the time line and investigation of the shooting as described <em>supra. </em>Additionally, Dr. Barbara Bollinger, a forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy on Officer Lasso’s body, testified, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Officer Lasso died from a shotgun wound to the back of his head and neck and the manner of death was homicide. N.T. 5/14/12, jury trial, at 69. Dr. Bollinger testified the head and neck areas are vital parts of the human body, the wound inflicted upon Officer Lasso was not survivable, and Officer Lasso died within seconds of being shot. <em>Id. </em>at 70-71. Dr. Bollinger noted a 12-gauge shotgun, such as was used to shoot Officer Lasso, has the ability to create and inflict more damage to a greater surface area than other types of firearms, such as a .38 caliber handgun or rifles. <em>Id. </em>at 70. Moreover, Trooper Kurt J. Tempinski, a forensic firearm expert, confirmed the 12-gauge shotgun seized after Officer Lasso’s death was operable. N.T. 5/15/12, jury trial, at 79.</p>

More specifically, Appellant argued he shot Officer Lasso in the “heat of passion,” under an unreasonable belief that deadly force was required to save his life (“imperfect self-defense”), or under a diminished capacity due to cognitive impairments.</p>

Appellant testified the banging sounded like someone was “kicking in” his back door and, when he approached the door area, he saw <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>someone pointing what he believed to be a gun at him saying harshly “open the door or I’m going to shoot you and kill your dogs.” <em>Id. </em>at 121.

Appellant indicated the person then turned and, standing with his back approximately two feet from the back door, pointed the object at Appellant’s dogs, resulting in Appellant fearing for his dogs’ lives. <em>Id. </em>at 124-25. Appellant reiterated he believed the object to be a gun, and in fact, it looked like his gun, which had recently been stolen from his home. <em>Id. </em>at 125.

Specifically, it is undisputed that, following Appellant’s late afternoon verbal altercation with a neighbor, Officer Lasso arrived on the scene in response to a 911 call. As Officer Lasso, who was in full uniform with his gun holstered, stood with his back towards Appellant’s residence’s closed door, and attempted to fend off two snarling dogs, Appellant used a shotgun to shoot him in the back of the head, which forensic testimony established is a vital part of the human body. Forensic testimony further established Officer Lasso’s wound was not survivable and he died within seconds of being shot. The record evidence suggests a presence of <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>mind belying Appellant’s contentions he lacked specific intent.

However, Ms. Boger never testified that Appellant shot her son, and instead, she testified Appellant made threats towards her son. As indicated, such testimony rebutted Appellant’s portrayal of himself as a charitable, wonderful, “kid-loving” neighbor. Moreover, inasmuch as Appellant attempted to demonstrate his demeanor did not change until sometime around 2010, Ms. Boger’s testimony refuted this version by highlighting the incident between Appellant and her son occurred in 2008. Lastly, the fact Officer Lasso was the same officer who responded to the scene in 2008 to investigate a neighborhood dispute, and then was subsequently shot by Appellant in 2011 as he investigated an unrelated neighborhood dispute, was relevant to rebut Appellant’s claim of mitigation as it related to the circumstances of the offense. This portion of Ms. Boger’s testimony shed light on the fact Officer Lasso had previously investigated complaints made against Appellant and, thus, the incident in 2011 was not Appellant’s first contact with the officer. Therefore, in weighing the relevance and probative value of Ms. Boger’s rebuttal testimony against its prejudicial effects, we find the trial court’s permissive allowance of her testimony to rebut the character evidence presented by Appellant at the penalty phase did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>

Moreover, the evidence supported the jury’s finding of an aggravating circumstance under Section 9711(d)(1) (the victim was a peace officer or local law enforcement official who was killed in the performance of his duties).

From my point of view, however, the Commonwealth presented a compelling case for first-degree murder without the need to develop these sorts of collateral theories to bolster it. The evidence of specific intent to kill was enhanced by a favorable permissible presumption, since Appellant shot Officer Lasso in the back of the head from a distance of five feet with a shotgun. In light of the strength of the Commonwealth’s other proofs, I simply do not see the necessity for the presentation of evidence that other firearms were located in Appellant’s house in the first instance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
