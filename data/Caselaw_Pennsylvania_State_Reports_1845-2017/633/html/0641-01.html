During its passage through the General Assembly, it was amended several times. In its final form, the bill contained multiple substantive sections, all amending Title 42 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, that is, the Judicial Code. In addition to its original provision, the bill encompassed sections which: repealed the Post Conviction Hearing Act (“PCHA”) and enacted the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”) in its place; conferred on this Court exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals in capital cases; mandated minimum sentences for offenses committed while impersonating a law enforcement officer; precluded the dismissal of felony charges at a preliminary hearing solely due to the prosecutor’s or victim’s failure to appear; limited defenses against claims for injuries sustained while <em>in útero; </em>and precluded causes of action for wrongful birth and wrongful life. The bill was approved by both Houses and signed into law by Governor Casey on April 13,1988. The section barring wrongful birth claims, which is at the center of this litigation, was codified at Section 8305 of the Judicial Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Therefore, as part of her prenatal care Mrs. Serno-vitz underwent genetic testing, which showed she was a carrier of the gene mutation for F.D. Her treating physicians, however, negligently misinformed her about the test results, telling her she was not a carrier. Thereafter, Mrs. Sernovitz gave birth to a son, Samuel, who suffers from F.D. and will suffer from the disorder for the rest of his life. Mrs. Semovitz later learned that both she and her husband are carriers of the mutation. If she had been correctly informed of the results of her test in a timely manner, further testing would have ensued, which would eventually have revealed Samuel’s condition while he was still <em>in útero. </em>Had that occurred, Mrs. Sernovitz would have obtained an abortion.</p>

The question of severance in the context of an Article III, Section 3 challenge was recently addressed in <em>Neiman. </em>That matter involved a challenge to Act 152 of 2004, which, like Act 47, effectuated multiple revisions to the Judicial Code. These included changes to Megan’s Law and the imposition of new duties on certain governmental entities with regard to sexual offenders.

The General Assembly also asks this Court to adopt a bright-line rule relating to procedural constitutional claims. Under the proposed rule, such a challenge may only be asserted if the complainant either (a) raises it before the end of the next full regular legislative session after the enactment’s effective date, or (b) demonstrates that: (i) there was no aggrieved person who could have asserted it within that time, (ii) the complainant is the first person aggrieved or in the first class of persons aggrieved, and (iii) the complainant has raised the challenge before the end of the next full regular legislative session after becoming aggrieved. <em>See </em>Brief for General Assembly at 27-28.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The Assembly submits that limiting challenges in this <a id="p652" href="#p652" data-label="652" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*652</a>way would provide an aggrieved party with a two-to-four-year window to file a complaint, and would also give the Legislature an opportunity to pass timely remedial legislation if the law is invalidated.</p>

Plaintiffs posit that such has never been part of the laches defense and the Assembly has not supplied supporting authority for its proposed broader view of the diligence inquiry. Similarly, Plaintiffs argue that Appellants have not shown that the 22-year delay caused them to change their position or otherwise suffer prejudice. Plaintiffs contend, in this respect, that Appellants are forced to rely on either the harm that would befall Pennsylvania citizens generally who benefit from stability in the laws of the Commonwealth, or the impact on the finality of hundreds of settled criminal matters (unrelated to the present case) that would allegedly arise from the invalidation of Act 47.
