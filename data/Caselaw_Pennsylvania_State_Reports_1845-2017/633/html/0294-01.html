On October 7, 2010, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, District Council 89 (the Union), filed a charge of unfair labor practices with the Board, alleging the County violated Sections 1201(a)(1) and (3) of PERA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The matter was assigned to a hearing examiner, who conducted an evidentiary hearing on December 21, 2010, at which the parties presented testimony and documentary evidence. Thereafter, the hearing examiner issued a proposed decision and order in which he set forth his findings of fact and ultimate conclusion that the <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>County had committed unfair labor practices under Sections 1201(a)(1) and (3). Specifically, the hearing examiner made the following relevant findings of fact based on the record.</p>
    <p id="b353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[179,457,1156,571]]]'>The County operates a Youth Intervention Center (the Center), which has a detention side for housing juveniles who have been adjudicated delinquent and a shelter side for housing other juveniles. The juveniles on the detention side have been placed there by the court for committing a variety of offenses, including theft. In the spring of 2010, the Union conducted an organizing drive among the employees on the detention side of the Center, including Adam Medina and Tommy Epps, in an effort to accrete the detention officers into its existing prison guard unit. On June 10, 2010, the Union filed a petition for representation with the Board.</p>
    <p id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.6",353,[181,1052,1155,463]]]'>Mr. Medina worked on the detention side of the Center, on the third shift, from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. During the Union’s 2010 organizing effort, Mr. Medina attended meetings held by the Union, reported back to the third shift staff members, and successfully encouraged other employees to attend meetings, as well as vote in favor of the Union. Moreover, in May of 2010, Mr. Medina informed his supervisor, Fred Arnold, that he supported the Union and told him about his activities with respect to the Union’s efforts.</p>
    <p id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.7",353,[182,1540,1151,350]]]'>Mr. Epps also worked on the detention side of the Center, on the second shift, from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Mr. Epps supported the Union’s efforts and talked to other staff members about how the Union could benefit them. Mr. Epps told his supervisor, William Delgado, that “the Union [was] coming” and that he had “talked to the Union representatives].” N.T. 12/21/10 at 104.</p>
    <p id="b353-7" data-blocks='[["BL_353.8",353,[184,1918,1153,410]]]'>Evette Sepulveda worked on the shelter side of the Center on the third shift. At the beginning of her shift on Sunday, June 20, 2010, Ms. Sepulveda complained to her supervisor, Christina Delgado, who is William Delgado’s wife, that someone was removing snacks from her open workplace mailbox. Ms. Sepulveda told Ms. Delgado items had been removed from her mailbox over the previous month with the most recent time being on Thursday, June 17, or Friday, June 18.</p>

      <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>Regarding the mailboxes, the Center installed employee mailboxes along a wall outside of the residential secured area, assigning an open mailbox to each employee with his or her name under it. The mailboxes are intended for mail, and the Center has a policy of prohibiting employees from storing personal items, including snacks, in the mailboxes. However, the Center’s Director, Drew Fredericks, testified the Center did not discipline those who violated the policy. N.T. 12/21/10 at 38-39.</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[271,783,1151,626]]]'>Regarding Ms. Sepulveda’s complaint, Ms. Delgado initiated an investigation and requested Mr. Arnold assist her in reviewing surveillance videotape of the mailbox area. The videotape from Wednesday, June 16, and Thursday, June 17, revealed three employees removing items from Ms. Sepulve-da’s mailbox on three separate occasions. Two of the employees were Mr. Medina and Mr. Epps, and the third employee was Latoya Boddy, who was a part-time employee. The videotape specifically showed Mr. Medina taking a snack-size bag of potato chips, approximately six inches in size. The videotape also showed Mr. Epps taking a similar sized bag of cookies.</p>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.6",354,[271,1443,1151,367]]]'>Ms. Delgado reported her observations from the videotape to Mr. Fredericks. Specifically, in an email dated June 21, 2010, Ms. Delgado informed Mr. Fredericks that Ms. Sepulve-da reported to her that someone removed snacks from her open employee mailbox and an examination of the surveillance videotape showed Mr. Medina and Mr. Epps had removed the snacks. Ms. Delgado concluded the email by stating:</p>

Ms. Sepulveda indicated she had previously given permission to Lavon Jackson and Damaris Veley. Mr. Fredericks directed Ms. Sepulveda to write an incident report. In the ensuing report, Ms. Sepulveda stated she had been missing snacks “for a couple of weeks” and she had given permission to only Mr. Jackson and Mr. Veley to remove snacks from her open mailbox.

After Mr. Fredericks showed the employees the videotape, Mr. Medina admitted he had taken snacks from Ms. Sepulve-da’s mailbox. Mr. Epps admitted he, too, had removed the snacks out of a mailbox; however, he indicated he believed the mailbox belonged to another employee, Leroy Kirkland, who he believed had given him permission. On that same day, June 21, 2010, Mr. Fredericks asked Mr. Medina, Mr. Epps, and Ms. Sepulveda to write reports about the incidents occurring on June 16 and June 17.</p>
    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.6",355,[191,1329,1154,683]]]'>Accordingly, Mr. Medina wrote and provided to Mr. Freder-icks an incident report in which he admitted he had removed a snack size bag of potato chips from Ms. Sepulveda’s mailbox on June 16. He explained that Ms. Sepulveda had previously given him permission to take food items from her mailbox. Additionally, Mr. Epps wrote and provided to Mr. Fredericks an incident report. In his report, Mr. Epps admitted he had removed a snack size bag of cookies from what he believed was Mr. Kirkland’s mailbox, and he did so with the belief Mr. Kirkland had given him permission to take snacks from his mailbox. Moreover, after being contacted by Mr. Medina, Ms. Sepulveda filed a second incident report, which stated, in relevant part, the following:</p>

    <p id="b356-6" data-blocks='[["BL_356.7",356,[256,971,1154,788]]]'>Believing termination was warranted, Mr. Fredericks consulted with the County Human Resources Director, Andrea McCue, to discuss the incident and the appropriate discipline. The County has a written progressive discipline policy, which is designed “to allow sufficient opportunity to correct a problem situation.” Union Exhibit 8 at 1. The first step of the policy is corrective counseling; the second step is a verbal warning; the third step is a written warning; the fourth step is a one-day suspension; the fifth step is a three-day suspension; the sixth step is a five-day suspension; and the seventh, and final step, is termination of employment. The policy further provides: “There are, however, violations of the rules or laws so severe as to render warning or progressive discipline futile. Immediate suspension or discharge is appropriate in these cases.” Union Exhibit 8 at 2.</p>

The guidelines provide “[a]n employee is subject to possible disciplinary action (as outlined in the County’s Progressive Discipline Procedure on correct discipline) for failure to comply.” County Exhibit 22 at 1. The guidelines provide a list of unacceptable behaviors. Ms. McCue concluded the second listed unacceptable behavior, “[tjheft or damage/destruction of County or <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>co-worker property^]” applied to Mr. Medina and Mr. Epps.

The notices stated: “[T]he shear <em>[sic </em>] theft of another employe’s personal property demonstrated this individual’s total failure to achieve the basic expectations of a Youth Intervention Center and County employe.” Union Exhibits 1 and 2 at 1. Mr. Fredericks testified he believed the taking of the snacks from the mailbox, standing alone, was serious enough to justify immediate termination rather than progressive discipline because of the need for a youth care worker to be a “positive role model” for the juvenile residents of the Center.

Mr. Fredericks testified he did not review Mr. Epps’ disciplinary record prior to issuing the notice of termination, although he indicated he was “kind” of aware of it to “some extent,” though it had no bearing on his decision. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Fredericks confirmed neither Mr. Medina nor Mr. Epps had been disciplined for theft prior to the subject incident. Further, he confirmed that, aside from the employees involved in the instant case, he had never fired an employee for removing personal items from another employee’s mailbox. <em>Id. </em>at 35.

Ms. Boddy did not appeal her termination since, as a part-time employee, the County’s grievance and appeal procedures did not apply to her. Ultimately, Mr. Medina’s and Mr. Epps’ appeals were denied, and they were terminated from their employment with the County.</p>

In this regard, the hearing examiner noted that, just thirteen days after the Union filed a representation petition, the County terminated Mr. Medina and Mr. Epps, who were supporters of the Union, for taking small snack items from a fellow employee’s open mailbox. The hearing examiner further noted the County’s failure to follow the progressive discipline policy would lead a reasonable employee to conclude the County’s approach to the incidents at issue was more likely a reaction to the employees’ exercise of protected activity as opposed to an application of work rules to correct employee behavior.</p>

The Board argues the court erroneously held, as a matter of law, that Section 1201(a)(3)’s knowledge element requires a showing the management official, who ultimately terminated the employees, had knowledge of their protected activity. The Board suggests that, for decades, it has interpreted Section 1201(a)(3)’s knowledge requirement as being satisfied when the complainant shows any supervisor had knowledge of an employee’s protected activity. Thus, the Board continues, the court’s holding “brings into serious question decades of binding precedent on the manner of establishing the element of knowledge of protected activities for purposes of a charge of discrimination under Section 1201(a)(3) of PERA.” Board’s Brief at 28.</p>

The Board posits, contrary to the court’s conclusion, it did not “mechanically” or “automatically” impute knowledge to the employer; but rather, it found notice to a supervisor is notice to the employing entity. Here, the Board made relevant findings of fact that supervisors Arnold and Delgado had knowledge of Mr. Medina’s and Mr. Epps’ protected activities, which as a matter of law, meets the knowledge element under Section 1201(a)(3).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

In this vein, the Board notes that, although the County proffered it terminated Mr. Medina and Mr. Epps for the theft of a small bag of snacks from Ms. Sepulveda’s open mailbox, the Board did not find the employer’s proffered reason to be credible. The Board notes its consideration of the totality of the circumstances supports the logical conclusion there was some other motive for the termination of Mr. Medina and Mr. Epps, and in light of various factors, which are supported by substantial evidence, the reason was based on an anti-union animus. In this regard, the Board points to various factual findings, which demonstrate disparate treatment as it relates to the instant investigation, the County’s failure to follow its progressive discipline policy without adequate explanation, and the timing of the investigation as it relates to the employees’ union activities.</p>

The Union contends the court improperly substituted its interpretation of PERA for the reasonable interpretation advanced by the Board and created an entirely new standard for proving an employer’s knowledge of protected activity. The Union develops that, for years, the Board has held proof of a supervisor’s knowledge of an employee’s protected activity meets the knowledge requirement, and notwithstanding the Board’s consistent application of this rule and the deference due to the Board, the Commonwealth Court adopted an entirely new legal standard regarding the knowledge element.

The Union points to various findings of fact, which pertain to the timing of the discharges, the disparate treatment of the employees by the County in its investigation, the County’s dismissive consideration of mitigating evidence, and the County’s failure to follow its own progressive discipline policy.

As the Board correctly concluded, in determining whether an employer had an anti-union motive in taking adverse action against an employee, the totality of the circumstances, and the inferences drawn therefrom, may be examined in determining the employer’s motivation, particularly since an employer will seldom inform an employee that he or she was discharged because of union activity. <em>See Sand’s Restaurant Corp., supra </em>(where the employer did not tell the employee he was fired because of union activity, the Board must examine the circumstances to infer whether the discharge was designed to curtail union activity).</p>

The Board found the County did not dispute it failed to follow the progressive discipline policy; however, the County offered an explanation for failing to do so.

In this vein, the Board noted one of the supervisor’s involved in the investigation, Ms. Delgado, opined in an email that, while the taking of snacks was “unprofessional,” she did not know if there was anything the employer could do about it. Also, the Board noted other infractions, including Mr. Medina’s own prior offense, which occurred before his union activity, of leaving a juvenile unattended, were more serious for which the County issued a written reprimand only. The Board concluded the employees’ behavior at issue here was of the type that should have been subject to the employer’s standard progressive discipline policy, and thus, the County’s failure to follow the policy was a further indicator of the County’s anti-union animus.

PLRB, </em><a href="/pa/473/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="473 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1730312" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0101-01">473 Pa. 101</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="473 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1730312" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0101-01">373 A.2d 1069</a> (1977). In this regard, the majority appears to largely bifurcate the elements of knowledge of protected union activity and of motive. <em>See, e.g., </em>Majority Opinion, at 324, 124 A.3d at 1287-88. For example, the majority accepts as sufficient to establish the knowledge-of-protected-activity criterion information known to supervisors <em>(i.e., </em>Mr. Arnold and Ms. Delgado) other than the one who made the decision to terminate Messrs. Epps and Medina <em>(i.e., </em>Mr. Fredericks). <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>
      <em>See id. </em>at 324-25, 124 A.3d at 1287-88. <em>St. Joseph’s Hospital </em>itself, however, confirms that the knowledge and motive elements are materially interrelated. <em>See, e.g., St. Joseph’s Hosp., </em><a href="/pa/473/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="473 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1730312" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0101-01">473 Pa. at 107</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="473 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1730312" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0101-01">373 A.2d at 1072</a> (discussing the PLRB’s salient findings that a supervisor knew of the union activities of discharged employees and “that her anti-union attitude <em>combined with this knowledge </em>to motivate the discharges” (emphasis added)). Furthermore, the decision in <em>PLRB v. Cadman, </em><a href="/pa/370/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="370 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1234545" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0001-01">370 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20643" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="87 A.2d 643">87 A.2d 643</a> (1952), also cited by the majority, stands for the proposition that a supervisor’s anti-union expressions could be attributed to the employer, <em>see id. </em>at 3-4, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20643" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="87 A.2d 643">87 A.2d at 644</a>, not that knowledge of union activities can be imputed loosely among supervisors.</p>

This is not to say that the supervisor who takes action <em>must </em>have knowledge, for example, in a scenario in which other employer representatives with knowledge act in a way which materially affects the supervisor’s conduct. Neither the majority nor the PLRB, however, has made a meaningful demonstration that this sort of subversion occurred in the present case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Thus, as I read the proposed decision of the hearing examiner, as adopted by the Board, knowledge and anti-union animus on the part of the supervisor who made the decision to terminate was inferred. <em>Accord </em>Majority Opinion, at 326-28, 124 A.3d at 1289-90 (observing that the hearing examiner and the Board rejected as incredi<a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>ble that supervisor’s explanations for the discharge decision). In this regard, and applying the required deference, I find the evidence sufficient to support the Board’s findings.</p>

I acknowledge that the hearing examiner, the Board, and the majority have discussed the conclusion that the investigation into missing property, in which Mr. Arnold and Ms. Delgado were involved, was not performed in a neutral manner. <em>See, </em>e.g., Majority Opinion, at 327-29, 124 A.3d at 1289-90. Nevertheless, there is little explanation how this fact would have caused Mr. Fredericks to disregard conventional disciplinary procedures, engage in disparate disciplinary treatment, and formulate pretextual reasons for discharge, unless he himself was motivated by anti-union animus. Indeed, to the degree that this case would turn on the motivations of Arnold and Delgado alone, I would find the evidence insufficient to support the finding of an unfair labor practice relative to the terminations.</p>
