The issue is:\nWhether this Court should accept jurisdiction to determine if it should overrule the rigid application of the irrebutable \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule, particularly in cases where a disinterested scrivener, an officer of the [cjourt, testifies credibly concerning the contents of the [w]ill and where[,] based on the overwhelming evidence in the case as determined by the trier of fact[,] application of the rule would create the very injustice that it was intended to avoid[,]\nPetitioner\u2019s Application for Leave to File a Reply to Answer to address her standing in this matter is DENIED, as respondent waived the issue of petitioner\u2019s standing by failing to raise it in the Superior Court.
