        "text": "Justice EAKIN,\ndissenting.\nRespondent was convicted of aggravated indecent assault of a child, a violation of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3125(b). Such a conviction triggers a mandatory minimum sentence under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9718(a)(3), but unlike many statutes, application thereof does not depend on proof of any additional facts. All elements pertinent to the mandatory sentence conviction are proven beyond a reasonable doubt by virtue of the conviction. See id. Therefore, the Superior Court\u2019s decision affirming the unconstitutionality of \u00a7 9718(a)(3) cannot be based on Commonwealth v. Hopkins, 632 Pa. 36, 117 A.3d 247 (2015), which deals with statutes requiring proof of additional facts. Summary affirmance of that finding is, in my judgment, improper.\nThe result of our denying review is to approve stamping the statute unconstitutional\u2014such becomes the law of the case and the statute. Yet, if it is not unconstitutional, how does this particular statute\u2019s constitutionality ever reach us again? And, what is the trial court to do in this case?\nI would therefore not deny review, but would hold disposition pending resolution of Commonwealth v. Wolfe, 68 MAP 2015, a case that, unlike Hopkins, at least deals with a similar statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9718(a)(1). I recognize the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court was amalgamated with Hopkins-related cases, and thus, was not distinguished from Hopkins\u2014however, to allow an incorrect finding of unconstitutionality to stand is inappropriate. I therefore dissent.\nJustice STEVENS joins dissent.",
