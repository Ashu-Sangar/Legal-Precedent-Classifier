        "text": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nIn this case, the trial court suspended as unconstitutional a recently enacted statute allowing expert testimony regarding victims\u2019 responses to sexual violence, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5920, The trial court concluded that Section 5920 violated this Court\u2019s exclusive control over judicial procedures pursuant to Article V, Section 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(7) (providing the Pennsylvania Supreme Court with exclusive jurisdiction over \u201c[mjatters where the court of common pleas has held [a statute] invalid as repugnant to the Constitution....\u201d). After review, we conclude that Section 5920 does not infringe on our constitutional authority to govern the procedures of the courts. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court and remand for further proceedings.\nThe facts in this case are limited as it comes to us on preliminary motions. Appellee-Defendant Jose Luis Olivo was arrested on September 17, 2012, and charged with two counts of rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and one count each of indecent assault, indecent exposure, endangering the welfare of children, and corruption of minors. The charges arose from allegations that he sexually abused his paramour\u2019s daughter, starting in January 2009 when the victim was four and continuing until February 2012, when she was seven.\nOn July 26, 2013, four days prior to the scheduled start of trial, Olivo presented a motion in limine to prevent the Commonwealth from presenting expert testimony pursuant to Section 5920 regarding child victim responses to sexual violence. Section 5920 applied to Olivo\u2019s September 2012 criminal complaint in the case at bar because the Legislature made it effective for prosecutions filed on or after August 28, 2012. The court continued the trial to allow the presentation of argument regarding the motion in limine.\nAs will be discussed in detail in the summary of his arguments to this Court, Olivo contended that the statute unconstitutionally infringed this Court\u2019s authority over procedural rules pursuant to Article V, Section 10(c). Assuming arguen-do that the Legislature could enact evidentiary rules generally, Olivo asserted that Section 5920 was improper because it conflicted with this Court\u2019s prior decision in Commonwealth v. Dunkle, 529 Pa. 168, 602 A.2d 830 (1992).\nA detailed review of our decision in Dunkle is necessary to understand the arguments presented by Olivo. In Dunkle, this Court held inadmissible \u201cexpert testimony concerning typical behavior patterns exhibited by sexually abused children,\u201d where that testimony did not relate to the specific child at issue. Id. at 831. Our holding was supported by our consideration of the \u201cChild Sexual Abuse Syndrome,\u201d which the Court judged not to be a generally accepted diagnostic tool for purposes of Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C.1923). We additionally concluded, based on the then-current research in the field, that the evidence regarding the syndrome was inadmissible as it was not specifically probative of childhood sexual assault as opposed to other types of trauma and merely invited speculation. Next, we deemed inadmissible expert testimony concerning delays and omissions in reporting by child victims of sexual assault because we concluded that the delays and omissions were \u201ceasily understood by lay people and did not require expert analysis.\u201d Dunkle, 602 A.2d at 836.\nWhile the bulk of our analysis focused upon basic evidentia-ry determinations, we further opined:\n[W]e do not think it befits this Court to simply disregard longstanding principles concerning the presumption of innocence and the proper admission of evidence in order to gain a great number of convictions. A conviction must be obtained through the proper and lawful admission of evidence in order to maintain the integrity and fairness that is the bedrock of our jurisprudence.\nId. at 838.\nWhile arguably dicta, Olivo relied upon this Court\u2019s brief reference to the presumption of innocence quoted above to argue that Dunkle constituted an exercise of our constitutional authority over judicial procedure, despite any reference to Article V, Section 10(c) in the text of the opinion.\nThe Commonwealth opposed Olivo\u2019s motion in limine. As detailed below, the Commonwealth asserted that Section 5920 is consistent rather than in conflict with our rulemaking authority under Article V, Section 10(c) and the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, especially Rule 101(b), which recognizes that rules of evidence may be \u201cgoverned by statute.\u201d Pa.R.E. 101 cmt. The Commonwealth additionally refuted Olivo\u2019s argument that this Court\u2019s decision in Dunkle was based on constitutional concerns, instead arguing that the case primarily addressed the admissibility of specific evidence under our evidentiary rules.\nThe trial court granted Olivo\u2019s motion in limine to bar the expert testimony regarding child victim responses and behaviors offered by the Commonwealth pursuant to Section 5920. Before coming to its conclusion, the court recognized that \u201c[t]he expert would carefully avoid testifying regarding the credibility of this particular victim/witness and only testify as to the general attributes of child sexual assault victims as to delay in reporting, piecemeal reporting and the dynamics of victim\u2019s abuse at the hands of older trusted family members.\u201d Tr. Ct. Op. at 3.\nThe trial court interpreted Dunkle as holding that the admission of expert testimony on child victim response and behaviors \u201cwould violate the presumption of innocence offered a defendant in every jury trial and notions of fundamental fairness inherent in due process.\u201d Id. at 4. The trial court opined that the \u201cproper admission of evidence\u201d was \u201csolely in the province of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court under Article V, [Section] 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\u201d Id. The trial court recognized that this Court has suspended statutes that impinge upon our rulemaking authority, citing Commonwealth v. McMullen, 599 Pa. 435, 961 A.2d 842, 848 (2008) (striking as unconstitutional a statute granting the right to a jury trial in indirect criminal contempt cases), and Payne v. Commonwealth Department of Corrections, 582 Pa. 375, 871 A.2d 795 (2005) (finding unconstitutional aspects of the Prison Litigation Reform Act as violative of Supreme Court\u2019s rule-making authority).\nWhile the court believed that the introduction of the expert witness testimony would be helpful to juries, it felt constrained to suspend Section 5920 because \u201cthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has spoken in this specific area in Dunkle and has indicated their ruling implicated Constitutional precepts.\u201d Tr. Ct. Op. at 5. The trial court, nonetheless, signaled that it found the dissenting arguments in Dunkle persuasive in light of the research since Dunkle.\nThe Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal in September 2013. As stated above, this Court has direct review of a trial court\u2019s decision to suspend a statute as unconstitutional pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(7).\nThe Commonwealth asserts that the trial court erred in suspending Section 5920 as unconstitutional. First, the Commonwealth addresses this Court\u2019s authority under Article V, Section 10(c). It then proceeds to refute the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Dunkle. The Commonwealth recognizes this Court\u2019s exclusive constitutional authority over rules of procedure. It observes that, while the legislature is tasked with defining substantive crimes, this Court has authority to determine the procedure underlying the adjudication of criminal actions. Commonwealth Brief (Com. Brief) at 12 (quoting McMullen, 961 A.2d at 847 (concluding that \u201csubstantive law creates, defines, and regulates rights; procedural law addresses the method by which those rights are enforced\u201d))- The Commonwealth further concedes that \u201cthe enactment of a procedural statute is unconstitutional.\u201d Id. at 13 (citing McMullen, 961 A.2d at 848).\nThe Commonwealth maintains, however, that evidentiary rules are exceptions, which this Court has recognized in the comments to the Rules of Evidence and in Commonwealth v. Newman, 534 Pa. 424, 633 A.2d 1069, 1071 (1993). The Commonwealth observes that the comment to Pa.R.E. 101, quoted above, demonstrates this Court\u2019s acknowledgement that some rules of evidence are governed by statute. It further highlights our statement in Newman, discussed further herein, that \u201c[sjubject only to constitutional limitations, the legislature is free to change the rules governing competency of witnesses and admissibility of evidence.\u201d Com. Brief at 10 (quoting Newman, 633 A.2d at 1071). The Commonwealth asserts that the legislature may enact rules of evidence so long as they are not inconsistent with constitutional limitations. Moreover, it emphasizes that Section 5920 tracks Pa.R.E. 702, addressing the requirements for expert testimony, which further supports the conclusion that the evidence does not offend constitutional principles. Accordingly, it maintains that Section 5920 is a constitutional legislative enactment.\nThe Commonwealth also asserts that the question presented in this case, regarding the constitutionality of the legislative enactment of Section 5920, is distinguishable from the eviden-tiary decision set forth by this Court in Dunkle. Initially, it emphasizes that the testimony in this case did not involve the \u201cChild Sexual Abuse Syndrome\u201d criticized in Dunkle as unreliable under Frye. Likewise, the Commonwealth contends that, in Dunkle, the Court concluded that expert testimony regarding delayed responses of child victims was inadmissible because the information was within the knowledge of lay jurors, based upon the research available at that time.\nThe Commonwealth emphasizes that our decision in Dunkle does not speak to constitutional concerns regarding this Court\u2019s Article V, Section 10(c) authority over procedural rules. It rejects the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Dunkle as implicating our constitutional jurisprudence, noting that the phrase \u201clong-standing principles concerning the presumption of innocence\u201d to be the decision\u2019s sole reference to constitutional principles. Com. Brief at 17 (quoting Dunkle, 602 A.2d at 838). Absent from our analysis in Dunkle, the Commonwealth observes, is any particularized discussion of why this genre of evidence would have offended the presumption of innocence so pervasively as to doom Section 5920. Indeed, the Commonwealth maintains that expert testimony under Section 5920 does not offend the presumption of innocence because the expert is not permitted to opine upon the credibility of the specific victim in the case.\nThe Commonwealth is supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association and the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape (PCAR). In addition to the arguments discussed above, the District Attorneys Association further asserts that Section 5920 \u201ccreates a substantive right to introduce a particular type of expert witness\u201d and does not address a procedure for a court to follow. District Attorneys Association Brief at 29-30 (citing as support Commonwealth v. Carter, 111 A.3d 1221 (Pa.Super.2015) (holding, as discussed below, that Section 5920 does not infringe on this Court\u2019s exclusive constitutional authority over procedural rulemaking)).\nPCAR additionally observes that court-made rules of evidence have long coexisted with legislative actions addressing evidence, such that to prohibit the legislature from enacting laws implicating evidence would \u201cupend centuries of jurisprudence.\u201d PCAR Brief at 30. The District Attorneys Association and PCAR provide a list of Pennsylvania statutes addressing evidentiary matters including the competency of witnesses and the admissibility of testimony.\nOlivo responds in support of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Section 5920 violates the separation of powers by infringing upon this Court\u2019s constitutional authority over courtroom practice and procedure. Olivo reiterates that Article V, Section 10(c) entrusts to this Court authority over judicial procedure except where the Constitution provides otherwise. He observes that we have stated that \u201cthe judiciary alone\u201d has \u201cpower over rulemaking.\u201d Olivo Brief at 7 (quoting, indirectly, In re 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1703, 482 Pa. 522, 394 A.2d 444, 451 (1978)). Olivo further relies upon In re 12 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1703, discussed below, where this Court, based upon our Article V, Section 10(c) authority, refused to comply with provisions of the Public Agency Open Meeting Law, which made the law applicable to the rule-making functions of the Supreme Court. Olivo additionally observes that an amendment to Article V, Section 10, was necessary to provide the legislature with specific authority to enact a procedural statute allowing child victims to testify via close-circuit television. He argues that a similar constitutional amendment would be required to provide authority for the legislature to address the admissibility of expert testimony pertaining to victim responses to sexual violence. As no constitutional provision addresses this subject, he contends that Section 5920 \u201cclearly, palpably, and plainly violates the Constitution as an unlawful exercise of judicial power.\u201d Olivo Brief at 8.\nHe rejects the suggestion that Section 5920 is not a procedural rule. Olivo observes that in Payne we addressed both proper substantive statutes and unconstitutional procedural sections. As noted below, we found provisions governing the dismissal of prison reform petitions to be substantive, but a provision addressing automatic dissolution of a temporary restraining order procedural. Olivo additionally observes that in Commonwealth v. Sorrell, 500 Pa. 355, 456 A.2d 1326 (1982), and McMullen, 961 A.2d 842, we held that the right to a jury trial is a procedural right. In contrast, Olivo notes that the authority to issue a stay of execution was deemed substantive in Commonwealth v. Morris, 565 Pa. 1, 771 A.2d 721 (2001). He argues that Section 5920 is not substantive because it does not define the relief to which a litigant is entitled nor does it define, enlarge, or restrict any elements of an offense.\nHe contends instead that Section 5920 is a procedural rule intended to supplant this Court\u2019s holding in Dunkle, which has been reaffirmed by this Court. Olivo Response Brief at 5-6 (citing Commonwealth v. Alicia, 625 Pa. 429, 92 A.3d 753, 761-63 (2014) (citing Dunkle); Commonwealth v. Gallagher, 519 Pa. 291, 547 A.2d 355 (1988) (finding expert testimony regarding \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d inadmissible); and Commonwealth v. Seese, 512 Pa. 439, 517 A.2d 920 (1986) (holding inadmissible expert testimony regarding child sexual assault victims)). He argues that only this Court has the authority to overrule Dunkle and to promulgate procedural rules of evidence. Olivo emphasizes that we held in McMullen that if \u201cthe legislature enacts a procedural statute, that statute is unconstitutional,\u201d regardless of whether the statute conflicts with court-made rules. McMullen, 961 A.2d at 848. Olivo faults the Superior Court\u2019s reasoning in Carter, relied upon by amici and discussed below, because that court did not address the separation of powers issue but merely cited a prior Superior Court decision stating that the legislature can enact evidentiary rules without fully considering the distinctions between substantive and procedural rules. He further argues that citation to the quotation in Newman suggesting that \u201cthe legislature is always free to change the rules governing competency of witnesses and admissibility of evidence\u201d is flawed because the parties in that case did not raise a separation of powers issue. Olivo Response Brief at 17 (quoting Newman, 633 A.2d at 1071). Instead, Olivo points to a distinction between what he views as substantive provisions regarding \u201cprivileges provided to spouses\u201d in Newman and procedural provisions relating to \u201cthe method [of] introducing evidence to prove a criminal offense\u201d in the case at bar. Olivo Response Brief at 18.\nAdditionally, Olivo claims that Section 5920 conflicts with this Court\u2019s decision in Dunkle, holding inadmissible expert testimony regarding victim responses to sexual assaults. He argues that the evidence the Commonwealth sought to introduce under Section 5920 is indistinguishable from the expert testimony deemed inadmissible in Dunkle, where the Court found error in permitting \u201can expert to explain why sexually abused children may not recall certain details of an assault, why they may not give complete details, and why they may delay reporting the incident.\u201d Olivo Brief at 9 (quoting Dunkle, 602 A.2d at 831). He observes that the Court continued, \u201c[W]e hold that the expert should not have been permitted to testify about behavior patterns generally exhibited by abused children and that the error requires reversal.\u201d Olivo Brief at 10 (quoting Dunkle, 602 A.2d at 836). He contends that the legislature cannot overrule Dunkle through the enactment of Section 5920.\nMoreover, Olivo argues that allowing the expert\u2019s testimony would devolve into a battle of the experts that would interfere with the jury\u2019s interpretation of the victim\u2019s nonverbal conduct and any inconsistencies in the testimony. Olivo Brief at 10. He reiterates the trial court\u2019s conclusion that testimony admissible under Section 5920 \u201cwould violate the presumption of innocence offered a defendant in every jury trial and notions of fundamental fairness inherent in due process.\u201d Id. (quoting Tr. Ct. Op. at 4). Accordingly, he seeks our affirmance of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Section 5920 is an unconstitutional encroachment of this Court\u2019s authority over judicial procedure, that it violates our holding in Dunkle, and that it violates the presumption of innocence.\nThe Commonwealth presents a pure issue of law, which we review de novo. Commonwealth v. Ludwig, 583 Pa. 6, 874 A.2d 623, 628 n. 5 (2005). As we have repeatedly observed, \u201ca legislative enactment enjoys the presumption of constitutionality.\u201d Payne, 871 A.2d at 800. A party challenging a legislative action bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that the statute \u201cclearly, palpably, and plainly violates the constitution.\u201d Id.\nAs noted, this ease requires our consideration of whether Section 5920\u215b provision allowing for expert testimony regarding victim responses to sexual assaults violates our exclusive constitutional \u201cpower to prescribe general rules governing practice, procedure and the conduct of all courts\u201d under Article V, Section 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. See, e.g., Payne, 871 A.2d at 801 (recognizing this Court\u2019s exclusive power over judicial procedure). For the following reasons, we conclude that Section 5920 does not constitute an impermissible procedural rule but rather is a proper exercise of legislative authority to enact a rule of evidence.\nDuring the early years of our Commonwealth, our authority over procedural rulemaking initially was \u201cinherent in the constitutional scheme,\u201d but later became explicit through a legislative grant of authority in 1937, as codified at 17 P.S. \u00a7 61, which provided that any inconsistent statute would be suspended. In re 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1703, 394 A.2d at 447. In 1968, however, this Court\u2019s authority gained constitutional imprimatur through the adoption of Article V of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Article V \u201cvests in the Supreme Court \u2018general supervisory and administrative authority over all the courts,\u2019 Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 10(a).\u201d Payne, 871 A.2d at 800. The section further provides that \u201c[a]ll laws shall be suspended to the extent that they are inconsistent with rules prescribed under these provisions.\u201d Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 10(c); see also In re 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1703, 394 A.2d at 447.\nIn considering similar challenges to legislative acts, we have opined that \u201cthe threshold inquiry in determining whether a particular statute violates Article V, Section 10(c), is whether the statute is procedural or substantive in nature.\u201d Payne, 871 A.2d at 801. We have often recognized that the distinction between procedural and substantive actions engenders little consensus. Id. Nonetheless, we have opined that, \u201c[a]s a general rule, substantive law is that part of the law which creates, defines and regulates rights, while procedural laws are those that address methods by which rights are enforced.\u201d Id. (citations omitted); see also McMullen, 961 A.2d at 847.\nOur relatively recent decision in Payne v. Commonwealth Department of Corrections, 582 Pa. 375, 871 A.2d 795 (2005), provides an excellent starting point as that case presented several provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which arguably straddled the line between substantive and procedural. We deliberated on the constitutionality of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6602(e), providing for a court to dismiss prison condition litigation if an allegation of indigency was untrue or if the litigation was frivolous or malicious. We held that the statute did not violate our Article V, Section 10 authority because the statute was substantive rather than procedural in nature:\nA cursory review of this section may lead one to believe that the Legislature is creating a procedure by which the court shall dismiss prison conditions litigation. Upon closer scrutiny, however, we conclude that Section 6602(e) defines the rights of prisoners by setting forth the circumstances under which the right to file prison condition litigation shall be summarily denied. Rather than establishing a method or procedure to enforce a substantive right, Section 6602(e) regulates the substantive right to file prison conditions litigation due to the Legislature\u2019s belief that such claims are particularly prone to being frivolous and therefore subject to summary dismissal.\nPayne, 871 A.2d at 802 (citing Morris, 771 A.2d at 738 (holding that a statute regarding a stay of execution was a substantive act because it \u201cdefine[d] the appropriate circumstances for securing the substantive right\u201d to a stay rather than setting forth a process for enforcing the stay)) (emphasis omitted).\nThis Court next grappled in Payne with the constitutionality of the three-strikes provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6602(f), under which a court may dismiss prison condition litigation \u201c[i]f the prisoner has previously filed prison conditions litigation and ... three or more of these prior civil actions have been dismissed\u201d as frivolous or an action was determined to have been filed in bad faith, absent a credible allegation of imminent danger of serious bodily injury. Payne, 871 A.2d at 803-04. The prisoner in Payne claimed that the statute was procedural and thus violative of our constitutional authority over judicial procedure under Article V, Section 10. Again, the Court concluded that while the statute appeared to be a procedural mechanism for the dismissal of prison litigation, at heart it was a \u201csubstantive provision because it defines the parameters under which the right to relief will be denied in a prison conditions action.\u201d Id. at 804.\nNext, the Court considered Section 6605(a) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, authorizing a court to enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction and for such injunction to expire automatically after ninety days. Unlike the sections addressed above, we concluded that this section did not \u201ccreate, define or regulate prisoner\u2019s rights\u201d but instead \u201csets forth a procedure which the court must follow when preliminary injunctions are entered in a prison conditions case.\u201d Id. at 804. As the section only spoke to procedure, we deemed this section unconstitutional as violative of our exclusive authority under Article V, Section 10(c). Id. We observed that the section also was inconsistent with Pa.R.C.P. 1531, which did not provide for automatic dissolution of a preliminary injunction. We additionally \u201cemphasize[d] that it is not the significance of the procedure contained in the statutory provision that is constitutionally problematic, but rather the fact the statute contains a court procedure.\u201d Id. at 805.\nFinally, we considered Section 6602(a)-(c) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which addressed the payment of filing fees and the method to seek in forma pauperis status. We held the statute unconstitutional as an attempt to enact a procedural statute in violation of our exclusive authority where the section \u201csets forth the method by which inmates enforce their rights to file prison conditions litigation, ie., by the payment of a filing fee.\u201d Id. at 806. We further noted that the section conflicted with this Court\u2019s in forma pauperis procedure.\nWe again considered the procedural-substantive dichotomy in Commonwealth v. McMullen, 599 Pa. 435, 961 A.2d 842 (2008), where we held unconstitutional a statute that provided a right to a jury trial in indirect criminal contempt proceedings involving a restraining order or injunction and limiting the relevant sentence to fifteen days. We recognized that we had previously held that the right to a jury trial was \u201cnot a \u2018substantive right,\u2019 but a right of procedure through which rights conferred by substantive law are enforced.\u201d Id. at 847-48 (quoting Sorrell, 456 A.2d at 1329). We notably altered our prior analysis applied in Payne, where we weighed whether a procedural statute conflicted with any Court promulgated rules. Instead, in McMullen, we opined that if a statute is procedural it is unconstitutional per se as \u201c[o]therwise, a clearly unconstitutional procedural statute would be constitutional unless this Court promulgated a rule inconsistent with it.\u201d Id. at 848.\nIn the cases set forth above, this Court determined whether various statutes encroached upon our constitutional authority over judicial procedure. However, these provisions did not address evidentiary statutes, as in the case at bar. In contrast, in Commonwealth v. Newman, 534 Pa. 424, 633 A.2d 1069 (1993), we considered an evidentiary statute involving the privilege not to testify against one\u2019s spouse. While Newman addressed constitutional challenges based on the ex post facto clause, we broadly opined, \u201cSubject only to constitutional limitations, the legislature is always free to change the rules governing competency of witnesses and admissibility of evidence.\u201d Id. at 1071.\nThe Superior Court recently addressed a similar separation of powers challenge to Section 5920 in Commonwealth v. Carter, 111 A.3d 1221 (Pa.Super.2015). The court identified its own precedent holding evidentiary statutes constitutional based upon this Court\u2019s decision in Rich Hill Coal Co. v. Bashore, 334 Pa. 449, 7 A.2d 302 (1939), where \u201c[wje recognize[d] the right of the legislature to create or alter rules of evidence.\u201d Carter, 111 A.3d at 1223 (quoting Rich Hill Coal Co., 7 A.2d at 319). The Superior Court opined that this Court reaffirmed Rich Hill Coal Co. in Newman, where, as noted above, we held that that \u201cthe legislature is always free to change the rules governing the competency of witnesses and the admissibility of evidence.\u201d Carter, 111 A.3d at 1223-24 (quoting Newman, 633 A.2d at 1071).\nApplying this precedent, the Superior Court concluded that \u201cSection 5920 is really a rule regarding the admissibility of evidence, not a procedural rule.\u201d Id. at 1224, Furthermore, the Superior Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that Section 5920 conflicted with Dunkle, which it distinguished by observing that \u201cDunkle predates Section 5920 and was not based on constitutional grounds but on existing case law and rules of evidence.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the Superior Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that Section 5920 violated our constitutional authority over procedural rules.\nWe agree with the analysis of the Commonwealth and the Superior Court in Carter. Section 5920 is clearly a rule of evidence, which we have acknowledged can be \u201cgoverned by statute.\u201d Pa.R.E. 101 cmt.; see also Newman, 633 A.2d at 1071. Moreover, we conclude that Section 5920 is substantive rather than procedural as it permits both parties to present experts to \u201ctestify to facts and opinions regarding specific types of victim responses and victim behaviors.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5920. It does not dictate how the evidence is presented, and thus it is distinguishable from the provision amended to Article V, Section 10(c) in 2003 providing the General Assembly with the authority to enact statutes to address purely procedural issues involved in \u201cthe manner of testimony of child victims\u201d and specifically allowing for statutes providing for testimony by videotaped deposition or close-circuit television. Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 10(c). Section 5920 by contrast does not provide for the manner of the presentation of expert testimony but merely provides the substantive authorization to present that testimony. Accordingly, we find Section 5920 to be a substantive rule of evidence that does not violate our Article V, Section 10(c) authority over procedural rules.\nFinally, we reject the trial court and Olivo\u2019s reliance on our prior decision in Dwnkle. As stated above, Dunkle provided a thorough review of arguments regarding the admissibility of expert testimony concerning victim responses to sexual violence. Our conclusion hinged on the Court\u2019s consideration of the research supporting the admission of the evidence. The decision was rooted in a factual assessment of the evidence as a part of a Frye analysis, as well as other admissibility considerations such as our conclusion that the expert testimony would invite speculation by the jury and that the information was within the knowledge of a lay juror, based upon the then-current research. We were not faced with questions regarding the constitutional authority of the General Assembly to pass a statute providing for the admissibility of this type of expert testimony. While it is accurate that we mentioned the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence in a brief phrase supporting our holding of inadmissibility, the statement is dicta and was never intended to control our assessment of the constitutionality of legislative enactments such as Section 5920.\nWe conclude that Section 5920 does not violate our authority under Article V, Section 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution nor our decision in Dunkle. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the trial court suspending 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5920 and remand for further proceedings.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice TODD and Justice STEVENS join the opinion.\nChief Justice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a dissenting opinion.\n. In full, Section 5920 provides:\n\u00a7 5920. Expert testimony in certain criminal proceedings\n(a) Scope.\u2014This section applies to all of the following:\n(1) A criminal proceeding for an offense for which registration is required under Subchapter H of Chapter 97 (relating to registration of sexual offenders).\n(2) A criminal proceeding for an offense under 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 31 (relating to sexual offenses).\n(b) Qualifications and use of experts.\u2014\n(1) In a criminal proceeding subject to this section, a witness may be qualified by the court as an expert if the witness has specialized knowledge beyond that possessed by the average layperson based on the witness\u2019s experience with, or specialized training or education in, criminal justice, behavioral sciences or victim services issues, related to sexual violence, that will assist the trier of fact in understanding the dynamics of sexual violence, victim responses to sexual violence and the impact of sexual violence on victims during and after being assaulted.\n(2) If qualified as an expert, the witness may testify to facts and opinions regarding specific types of victim responses and victim behaviors.\n(3) The witness\u2019s opinion regarding the credibility of any other witness, including the victim, shall not be admissible.\n(4) A witness qualified by the court as an expert under this section may be called by the attorney for the Commonwealth or the defendant to provide the expert testimony.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5920 (footnote omitted).\n. Article V, Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides as follows:\n(c) The Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe general rules governing practice, procedure and the conduct of all courts, justices of the peace and all officers serving process or enforcing orders, judgments or decrees of any court or justice of the peace, including the power to provide for assignment and reassignment of classes of actions or classes of appeals among the several courts as the needs of justice shall require, and for admission to the bar and to practice law, and the administration of all courts and supervision of all officers of the Judicial Branch, if such rules are consistent with this Constitution and neither abridge, enlarge nor modify the substantive rights of any litigant, nor affect the right of the General Assembly to determine the jurisdiction of any court or justice of the peace, nor suspend nor alter any statute of limitation or repose. All laws shall be suspended to the extent that they are inconsistent with rules prescribed under these provisions. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the General Assembly may by statute provide for the manner of testimony of child victims or child material witnesses in criminal proceedings, including the use of videotaped depositions or testimony by closed-circuit television.\nPa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 10(c).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3121, 3123, 3126, 3127, 4304, and 6301, respectively.\n. Three justices in Dunkle dissented, arguing in favor of the admissibility of the expert testimony.\n. Olivo additionally presented a challenge pursuant to Frye, which was rejected by the tried court and has not been pursued on appeal to this Court.\n. Rule 101 entitled \"Scope; Adoption and Citation\u201d provides in full as follows, with emphasis added to highlight the language relied upon by the Commonwealth:\n(a) Scope. These rules of evidence govern proceedings in all courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\u2019s unified judicial system, except as otherwise provided by law.\n(b) Adoption and Citation. These rules of evidence are adopted by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania under the authority of Article V \u00a7 10(c) of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, adopted April 23, 1968. They shall be known as the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence and shall be cited as \"Pa.R,E.\u201d\nComment: A principal goal of these rules is to construct a comprehensive code of evidence governing court proceedings in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. However, these rules cannot be all-inclusive. Some of our law of evidence is governed by the Constitutions of the United States and of Pennsylvania. Some is governed by statute. Some evidentiary rules are contained in the Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure and the rules governing proceedings before courts of limited jurisdiction. Traditionally, our courts have not applied the law of evidence in its full rigor in proceedings such as preliminary hearings, bail hearings, grand jury proceedings, sentencing hearings, parole and probation hearings, extradition or rendition hearings, and others. Traditional rules of evidence have also been relaxed to some extent in custody matters, see, e.g., Pa.R.C.P. No. 1915.11(b) (court interrogation of a child), and other domestic relations matters, see, e.g., Pa.R.C.P. No. 1930.3 (testimony by electronic means).\nDecisional law is applicable to some evidentiary issues not covered by these rules. This would include for example, the corpus delicti rule, see Commonwealth v. Fears, 575 Pa. 281, 836 A.2d 52 (2003); the collateral source rule, see Boudwin v. Yellow Cab Co., 410 Pa. 31, 188 A.2d 259 (1963); and the parol evidence rule, see Yocca v. Pittsburgh Steelers Sports, Inc., 578 Pa. 479, 854 A.2d 425 (2004).

The notice of appeal, inter alia, certified that the trial court\u2019s \"ruling substantially handicaps the prosecution of this case,\" Notice of Appeal of Sept, 26, 2013, and, thus, asserted an interlocutory appeal as of right under Pa.R.A.P. 311(d).

Testimony by Expert Witnesses\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n(a) the expert\u2019s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge is beyond that possessed by the average layperson;\n(b) the expert\u2019s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; and\n(c) the expert\u2019s methodology is generally accepted in the relevant field.\n.

Specifically, the 2003 amendment provided for the following language to be added to Section 10(c): \"Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the General Assembly may by statute provide for the manner of testimony of child victims or child material witnesses in criminal proceedings, including the use of videotaped depositions or testimony by closed-circuit television.\u201d See also Bergdoll v.

In McMullen, we additionally rejected as unconstitutional the legislative attempt to set the limit of punishment for indirect contempt, which we concluded was within the power of the courts. We explained that, \"[wjhile the legislature generally may determine the appropriate punishment for criminal conduct, indirect criminal contempt is an offense against the court's inherent authority, not necessarily against the public.\u201d Id. at 850. Accordingly, we struck the statute as an unconstitutional invasion of our exclusive authority to punish for indirect criminal contempt. Id.\n. It should be noted that while this Court approved generally of the legislative ability to enact rules of evidence, we nonetheless found various sections of the Workers' Compensation Act invalid. We further opined that the legislative power to enact evidentiary statutes was limited as follows:\n(1) It is at least doubtful if the legislature can, under the guise of creating a \u2018rule of evidence,' make something evidence which is in fact not evidence, (2) If in fact the legislature is attempting to regulate a rule of evidence, \u2018its regulation must be impartial and uniform\u2019.\nRich Hill Coal Co., 7 A.2d at 319 (quoting Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, 8th ed., Vol. 2, p. 768.) (emphasis in original).\n. We acknowledge that the Superior Court in Carter relied in part on its observation that Section 5920 did not conflict with any rule of procedure. Id. at 1224. We reject and deem unnecessary this aspect of the Carter rationale based upon our contrary holding in McMullen, As discussed supra at 633-34, 127 A.3d at 778-79, we opined in McMullen that a procedural statute is unconstitutional per se because \u2018\u2018[ojtherwise, a clearly unconstitutional procedural statute would be constitutional unless this Court promulgated a rule inconsistent with it.\" McMullen, 961 A.2d at 848.",

        "text": "Chief Justice SAYLOR,\nconcurring.\nThe majority appears to reaffirm the broadly-stated proposition that the Legislature is free to change the rules of evidence. See Majority Opinion, at 635-37, 127 A.3d at 779-81 (quoting, indirectly, Commonwealth v. Newman, 534 Pa. 424, 429, 633 A.2d 1069, 1071 (1993)). As such, it is unclear whether the majority\u2019s ensuing conclusion that Section 5920 is substantive in nature is material to its disposition of the case. See id. at 636-37, 127 A.3d at 780-81. In any event, I am not persuaded by this latter proposition, since, as I read the statute, Section 5920 merely authorizes the admission of a form of evidence in a manner very similar to other varieties of evidential rules. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5920.\nThis Court promulgated the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence under what it has deemed to be its \u201cexclusive\u201d rulemak-ing authority under Article V, Section 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, but, to my knowledge, it has never provided a satisfying reconciliation of such exclusivity with the acknowl-edgement that the General Assembly retains the ability to create evidential rules. For my own part, I maintain that the Court simply should recognize the appropriateness of some reasonable power sharing in the rulemaking arena. Accord Freed v. Geisinger Med. Center, 607 Pa. 225, 251, 5 A.3d 212, 228 (2010) (Saylor, J., dissenting) (\u201c[A]s I have previously expressed, both in gray areas between substance and procedure, and in matters that have not yet been occupied by this Court via its own procedural rules, I would allow some latitude to the Legislature to make rules touching on procedure, so long as such rules are reasonable and do not unduly impinge on this Court\u2019s constitutionally prescribed powers and prerogatives.\u201d (quoting Commonwealth v. McMullen, 599 Pa. 435, 458, 961 A.2d 842, 856 (2008) (Saylor, J., concurring and dissenting))); cf. Watkins, 818 N.W.2d at 309 (applying the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s approach that a rule of evidence violates the Michigan analogue to Article V, Section 10(c) only when \u201cno clear legislative policy reflecting considerations other than judicial dispatch of litigation can be identified\u201d (quoting, indirectly, Kirby v. Larson, 400 Mich. 585, 256 N.W.2d 400, 406 (1977))).\nPrimarily in light of the above differences, I respectfully concur in the result.\n. Upon my reading, the statute merely authorizes the presentation of expert testimony but apparently does not supplant other salient considerations, such as the application of the requirement of Rule of Evidence 702(c) that the expert\u2019s methodology must be generally accepted in the relevant field. Accord Commonwealth v. George, No. 504 WDA 2014, slip op. at 6, 2015 WL 5970739 (Pa.Super. Sept. 25, 2015); cf. People v. Watkins, 491 Mich. 450, 818 N.W.2d 296, 313-15 (2012) (determining that a statute indicating that certain evidence \"is admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant\u201d did not supplant the application of the Michigan analogue to Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 403). Rather, the intention seems to be merely to remove the appearance of a per se prohibition erected by some of the language used in Commonwealth v. Dunkle, 529 Pa. 168, 602 A.2d 830 (1992). Indeed, had the General Assembly manifested an intention to nullify the application of other evidentiaiy rules designed to maintain fundamental fairness in the courtroom, I would have much greater difficulty with the majority disposition of the present case.",

        "text": "Justice EAKIN,\ndissenting.\nI agree with the majority\u2019s analysis finding 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5920 constitutionally sound. However, application of this statute permits expert witnesses to influence a jury\u2019s determination of a victim\u2019s credibility under the guise of educating jurors on the varying reactions to sexual violence; because I do not believe this is an appropriate methodology, I respectfully dissent.\nThe presentation of an expert\u2019s opinion on credibility invites a jury to abandon its role as the arbiter of veracity, instead demanding de facto deference to the expert\u2019s \u201cunwarranted appearance of authority in the subject of credibility.\u201d Commonwealth v. Alicia, 625 Pa. 429, 92 A.3d 753, 760 (2014); Commonwealth v. Davis, 518 Pa. 77, 541 A.2d 315, 317 (1988). Here, \u00a7 5920 facially precludes specific comments on credibility by the expert, limiting testimony to \u201copinions regarding specific types of victim responses and ... behaviors[,]\u201d and expressly prohibiting direct observations about a victim\u2019s credibility. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5920(b)(2), (3). Nevertheless, when offered at trial, such expert testimony will in fact weigh directly on a victim\u2019s credibility, fundamentally altering the exclusive function of the jury. See Alicia, at 761 (\u201c[T]he question of a witness\u2019s credibility is reserved exclusively for the jury.\u201d). Indeed, if the opinion is about \u201cnormal\u201d responsive behavior, expert testimony is unnecessary and irrelevant. It is only in the \u201cabnormal\u201d response situation that it is arguably relevant, and there the expert can clearly be talking about one thing only\u2014factors pertinent to the people in this specific case. Thus, the witness must be opining on those precise facts, despite the statute\u2019s prohibition; a jury needs no expert to see through the fiction that the opinion testimony is not about the credibility of witnesses before it.\nSpecifically, an expert may opine there are no \u201ctypical\u201d reactions to sexual violence and testify to the range of reactions a victim may experience after an assault. See Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 15, 19. While this testimony is certainly helpful to a jury\u2019s understanding of a victim\u2019s atypical reaction, it has no bearing on the underlying facts of an assault, nor does it establish whether an accused actually committed a crime. Rather, it is only relevant because a victim\u2019s response or reaction bears directly on his or her credibility. Thus, by purporting to explain the reaction, an expert directly, and in my judgment, improperly, either bolsters or attacks a victim\u2019s credibility. There simply is no other purpose for such evidence.\nThe Commonwealth contends expert opinion pursuant to \u00a7 5920 is necessary because victim reactions to sexual violence are not within a jury\u2019s ken, and without such testimony, stereotypes concerning sexual assault victims may cloud a jury\u2019s judgment. Id., at 16. While I understand these concerns, the Commonwealth should be careful what it wishes for\u2014what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and if expert opinions are admissible and helpful to the prosecution here, there will be experts with admissible opinions to the contrary, in rebuttal and in each ensuing case.\nAs almost by definition, expert opinion on how a witness might or might not react influences a jury\u2019s credibility determination. I do not believe this is an appropriate method for edifying jurors. A better process for addressing this issue would be to enhance jury instructions on credibility determinations in cases involving sexual assault or other distinctive crimes. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Walker, 625 Pa. 450, 92 A.3d 766, 806-07 (2014) (Eakin, J., dissenting). By implementing modified jury instructions stressing the individuality of victim reactions, jurors can make an informed credibility assessment without the risk of relinquishing their independent decision-making to battling experts. This approach avoids the inevitable \u201cwar of hired doyens attacking each other\u2019s opinion\u201d that accompanies \u00a7 5920. Id., at 806; 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5920(b)(4) (permitting either party to present expert testimony on victim responses to sexual violence). Indeed, modified jury instructions would avoid the pitfalls of \u00a7 5920 while addressing the notable and legitimate concerns of the Commonwealth and the General Assembly. As I believe \u00a7 5920 is an overly broad approach to addressing these concerns, I must dissent.",
