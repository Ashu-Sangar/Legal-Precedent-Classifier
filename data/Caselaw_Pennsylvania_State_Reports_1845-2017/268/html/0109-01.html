Pursuant to the complaint a warrant was issued by the alderman of the city directed to defendant, commanding him to arrest plaintiff and bring him before the magistrate who issued the precept. Defendant, under the warrant, arrested plaintiff but, instead of taking him to the alderman’s office, as directed, took him to the city police station, from which place the alderman subsequently issued a commitment to the county jail where plaintiff was placed by defendant and there detained by the proper officers until released on bail the following day. Plaintiff was later indicted, tried and acquitted of the charge preferred against him by defendant, and, following his acquittal, began this action to recover damages, alleging a malicious prosecution and also false imprisonment. The trial judge instructed <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>the jury that if they believed the testimony of the wit-, nesses called by defendant, relating to the manner in which the proceedings were instituted, plaintiff would be without right to recover and their verdict must be for defendant. However, at the close of the charge this instruction was nullified by the affirmance of defendant’s point that under all the evidence the verdict must be for defendant.</p>
    <p id="b146-4" data-blocks='[["BL_146.4",146,[268,792,1161,1572]]]'>To prove malice and want of probable cause plaintiff offered the record of his acquittal in the quarter sessions of the offense charged, followed by testimony to the effect that defendant, after obtaining the Avarrant, called at plaintiff’s place of employment and informed him the district attorney desired his presence at the latter’s office for the purpose of having plaintiff make a statement, failing, however, to advise him at the time that he held a warrant for his arrest and instead of taking plaintiff to either the office of the district attorney, or the office of the alderman issuing the precept, he was taken to the police station and, after several hours’ detention there, aAvaiting the arrival of the alderman’s commitment, was placed, by defendant, in the county prison, where he remained until the following morning. There was also evidence that plaintiff was denied opportunity to obtain bail before being committed to prison and that defendant, previous to the beginning of the proceedings, stated to plaintiff’s wife he would put plaintiff in jail “if it is for five minutes, half a day or a whole night.” The foregoing facts made out a prima facie case for plaintiff, especially as proof that the proceedings against plaintiff terminated by a verdict of not guilty, was, in itself, evidence of want of probable cause, from which the existence of malice could be inferred: Smith v.
