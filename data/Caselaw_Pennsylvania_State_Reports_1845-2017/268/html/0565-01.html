The machinery used for this purpose was an infringement of certain patent rights owned by the American Window Glass Company and the Window Glass Machine Company, appellants. A bill was filed by the two last named companies in the United States District Court and a decree was entered July 14, 1919, restraining the Bethlehem company from making, selling or using the apparatus and methods embodying or containing the inventions described in that bill. Charles E. Andrews, Jr., the appellee, on August 30, 1919, by agreement purchased the real estate and equipment of the Bethlehem Company for $17,500. August 23, 1919, appellants presented a motion to the district court for a preliminary injunction against the Bethlehem company, praying that it be enjoined from dissipating or impairing its assets by winding up its affairs and disposing of its assets. This motion denied, it was renewed October 16th, by supplemental bill. The reason then given was that the company was selling its real estate and plant, and thus dissipating and impairing its assets. This motion was also refused. Appellee, Andrews, then filed the present bill in the Common Pleas of Clarion County, December 13, 1919, asking for specific performance of the contract of sale of August 30,1919. Appellants (the American Co. and the Machine Co.), learning of this application, pre<a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>sented a petition to that court for leave to intervene for the reason that the contract was collusive, fraudulent and not made in good faith to them as creditors. Before this matter was heard in Clarion County, appellants again appeared in the United States court and secured a preliminary injunction restraining the Bethlehem company and Andrews from proceeding with the hearing. The federal court again dismissed the application, under section 265 of the Judicial Code, which provides that “A writ of injunction shall not he granted by any court of the United States to stay the proceedings in any court of a state, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy.” The ease then proceeded to final hearing in Clarion County, a decree directing specific performance was made, from which the intervening defendants have appealed.</p>
    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[298,1278,1160,1134]],["BL_603.1",603,[191,331,1159,974]]]'>Our attention should first be directed to the right of these two defendants to intervene. There should be some property right or interest prejudicially affected before one may intermeddle in the lawsuit of others. The Bethlehem company was solvent. There was no debt due defendants or others, no obligation against it, no lien of any character. True, they had a decree restraining infringement of patents and were entitled to an accounting, but no such decree can be found in the record, though it seems the time has been sufficient to have one entered. This company was as much the master of its property as if it were a private individual. The bill for injunction aimed at the infringing device in use by the New Bethlehem company. All other property was absolutely free. It was not under the court’s order and the company had the right to-operate its plant as it saw fit, and, while the right to an accounting might exist, yet as said by Judge Thompson, in dismissing one of the applications for an injunction, and speaking of an accounting, “It would be idle to speculate as to the result on final hearing, or the probabilities as to plaintiffs’ claim when <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>a final adjudication is liad.” While it is admitted the Bethlehem company made a profit in the last year of their business, the estimate of damages from profits that may accrue from infringement of patents is subject to limitation. “Defendant is not responsible for all profits of the business but only such as are due to the patented improvement, and the burden is on the complainant to separate and apportion the profits by reliable and tangible proofs. The profits which resulted from the infringement consists of the saving or advantage in the use of the patented improvement as compared with other old substitutes”: 30 Cyc. 1028. This record is barren of any evidence to indicate damage suffered by appellants, and the court below was entirely correct in its conclusion that there was no evidence before the court showing the amount of the claim of the intervening defendants, or that they had any beneficial interest in the subject in controversy.</p>
    <p id="b603-3" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[198,1317,1152,862]]]'>When the restraining order against infringement was issued, the Bethlehem company was without adequate machinery to conduct its business. The supply of gas necessary to run the plant had been shut off and it had been determined to no longer continue its operation. This it had a perfect right to do, as it was a solvent corporation ; and, moreover, it was the natural result of the intervening defendants’ acts. No company could operate as a going concern except the intervening defendants. Either the plant was to be junked or else sold for the best price obtainable. Appellants offered $25,000 for a plant with the infringing machinery in place, which its own experts admit was worth $120,000 as a going concern, as it would then be. Appellees agreed to pay $17,-500 for the property without the infringing devices, to be run along other lines.</p>

With the corporate assets as here shown, Judge Thompson wisely observes: <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>“Tbe court bas no power to compel tbe defendant to continue in business, or to expend large sums of money for tbe equipment of its plant suitable to tbe demands necessary in installing a different fuel for its furnaces.
