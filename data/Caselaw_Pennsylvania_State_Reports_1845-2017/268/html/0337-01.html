After stating the law, in strict accord with a case therewith cited, the opinion proceeds: “The business of the defendant is that of selling electricity......; a business so fraught with peril to the public that the highest degree of care which skill and foresight can obtain, consistent with the practical conduct of its affairs under the known methods and present state of its particular art, is demanded......The plaintiff, while attempting to do that which every patron of the company must do to make use of electric light, received into his body a current of electricity......permanently injuring him. Such injuries are not, under ordinary circumstances, received by persons who turn on an incandescent lamp, if the company supplying the current has not been negligent. The defendant, when it contracted......to sell electricity for light, contracted to keep its plant and appliances in such condition that no greater volume of electricity would be carried into the house than was necessary for its proper lighting. The quantity of electricity required for lighting purposes in residences is not sufficient, if it passed through the body, to cause the injuries described by plaintiff......; it follows, therefore, that plaintiff must have received a very much greater quantity of electricity than the company contracted to supply.” We further <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>said that, while a company selling electricity was not an insurer, yet it was required, in the operation of its plant, to “protect its patrons from the perilous current, which is the basis of its business, by doing all that human care, skill and vigilance can suggest,” adding, “When the foregoing rule is observed by an electric light company, the presumption is that no such injury will befall its patrons as was sustained by the present appellant; but, on the other hand, when such injury does occur the presumption is that the rule has been disregarded.”</p>

In view of these instructions, and the verdict rendered, we must take it that the jury found there were no defects in the appliances, or none which contributed to the injuries suffered by plaintiff’s husband; with this element out of the case, the law as laid down in Alexander v.
