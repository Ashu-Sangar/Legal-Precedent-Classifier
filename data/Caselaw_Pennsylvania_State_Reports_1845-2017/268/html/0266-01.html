On August 7,1918, the present settlement was made against it by the accounting officers of the Commonwealth in which it was charged with a tax of $337.78 on an indebtedness of $200,000, represented by promissory notes, payable six months after date, and owed to Drexel &amp; Company, a copartnership doing a banking business. The money thus borrowed was used by the company in the purchase of material and in the payment of employees. An appeal was taken by the defendant from the settlement on the objections that the indebtedness, haying been incurred for current expenses, was not subject to the loan tax, and that the officers of the Commonwealth erred in making the settlement for it against the defendant.</p>

This would be so if the taxability of the indebtedness was, as it was in that case, the only question presented for decision, but here the objection to the settlement, although very indefinitely expressed, may be construed to dispute the liability of the defendant for the tax and to challenge the power of the Commonwealth’s officers to settle the tax against it.

We are of the opinion that they do not. The term “certifi<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>cates of indebtedness” evidently refers to instruments of like kind with scrip and bonds in connection with which it is used — instruments representing indebtedness of a higher and more permanent character than that represented by notes discounted or negotiated by a bank or banking institution. Such notes do not fall within the class embraced by scrip and bonds. They are not ordinarily spoken of as being issued, as in the case of a permanent or time loan made by a corporation; nor does the tax on them readily admit of collection in the manner prescribed for collecting the fax on the corporate obligations enumerated in section 17. In many instances the interest on bankable promissory notes is deducted when the loan is made or the note discounted, and never comes into the hands of the borrower or debtor. We think rather that they fall within the class designated by the general language found in section 1, “loans secured by any other form of certificate or evidence of indebtedness,” if they do not come under the express words “moneys owing by promissory notes.” It will be observed that both sections use the term certificate of indebtedness. If taken literally the language of both might cover bankable promissory notes, but we find no intention in the ad to impose a tax for county and state purposes on the same indebtedness. We must therefore determine which one was intended to cover corporate indebtedness evidence by promissory notes discounted or negotiated by a bank. For the considerations stated we are of the opinion that it was the legislative intention to tax such instruments or evidences of indebtedness not for state purposes but, by the first section of the act, for county purposes, except, of course, notes discounted or negotiated by an incorporated bank (Com. v. McKean County, <a href="/pa/200/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="200 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="924305" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0383-01">200 Pa. 383</a>), which are exempted from the tax by the proviso thereof. Moreover, the implication from the proviso to section 1, excepting bank notes from its provisions is that promissory notes were intended to be covered by that section.</p>
