    <p id="b103-7" data-blocks='[["BL_103.8",103,[169,840,1152,865]]]'>Sarah M. Billings died in 1912, leaving a will in which she gave all her residuary estate “unto my nieces and nephews named to wit [naming them],.......share and share alike to be paid to them respectively” in the manner stated, with further provision, should any die before receiving his or her share, and without leaving children, the share of such deceased should become part of the residuary fund and go to the survivors. In a codicil testatrix revoked the residuary bequests made to a nephew and niece and directed the persons named should not share in the residuary estate and, in lieu of such modification, gave each of the two a stated sum of money. No reference being made to the disposition of the revoked shares of the residue, the court below decided such shares passed to the remaining residuary legatees and no intestacy resulted as to any part of the estate.</p>

The application of these principles to the present will would prima facie sustain the view that the gift of the remainder, instead of being to ten beneficiaries named, was to eight. This construction would permit both the will and codicil to stand as a whole without conflict in any part and avoid an intestacy as to the revoked shares. Appellant relies for a <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>contrary interpretation upon the common law rule <em>stated </em>in Williams y.

    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[308,843,1156,426]]]'>Appellee answers this argument with the contention that the gift of the residuary estate was not a gift to individuals but a gift to the nephews and nieces as a class, consequently the revocation of the gifts of two of the members of the group merely had the effect of excluding from the class without taking from the others the right to participate in the whole as a class: McGovran’s Est., <a href="/pa/190/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="190 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="905077" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0375-01">190 Pa. 375</a>.</p>

The members who are to constitute the class are to be determined at the time of distribution: Haskins v.

When testatrix executed the codicil she made no attempt to change the provisions of her will except to the extent specifically stated, which directed that a nephew and a niece should not share in the estate. Testatrix in so doing clearly indicated an intention to divide the residue among the remaining eight nephews and nieces and the survivor or survivors of them, if any died without issue. In our opinion these provisions are sufficient to overcome the effect of designating the beneficiaries by name and that testatrix intended them to take as a class. It follows that the exclusion of the persons named from the class had (he effect of increasing the value of the shares of the remaining members of the class.</p>
