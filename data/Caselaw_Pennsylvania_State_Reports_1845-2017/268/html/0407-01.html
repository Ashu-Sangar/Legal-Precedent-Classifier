Among his assets were 21,167 shares of a gold mining company, on which there had accrued after his death the sum of $4,422.50 in dividends. The widow died leaving a will by which she gave her estate to her children. It was agreed by the parties in interest that moneys coming to her from her husband’s estate should be distributed to her legatees without the formality of filing an account in her estate. The court accordingly made this distribution and awarded the accrued dividends as part of the widow’s estate.</p>
