An act of assembly is void only when it “clearly, palpably and plainly” violates the Constitution : Sharpless et al. v. Mayor of Phila., <a href="/pa/21/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="21 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="411603" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0147-01">21 Pa. 147</a>; Com. v.

Wolfe v. Butler, <a href="/pa/99/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="99 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="446128" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0535-01">99 Pa. 535</a>; Com. v. Grossman, <a href="/pa/248/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="248 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1011451" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0011-01">248 Pa. 11</a>. Applying these touchstones to the statute under consideration, and remembering that at the time our present Constitution was adopted, the telephone, though perhaps appearing in the dreams of inventive genius, was utterly unknown, not only to the public, but to the intelligent framers of the Constitution as well, not even a doubt can arise as to the constitutionality of the Act of 1919. That of which nothing was known forty-seven years ago could not then have been in the minds of the members of the constitutional convention when they submitted their work to the people for approval; and what is not there forbidden the legislature may do. This is all that need be said in support of the validity of the legislation under consideration, and the order of the Superior Court is affirmed, upon condition that the Cochranton Telephone Company proceed forthwith to surrender all of its charter rights as a telegraph company. Upon the filing of a proper certificate with the prothono<a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>tary of the eastern district, showing such surrender, this appeal will be marked dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>
