There is nothing to indicate the language depended upon was meant to annul or defeat the general devise of real estate previously placed in the will; on the contrary, testator’s gifts, inter vivos, of the securities accumulated for Rodman, fully and satisfactorily explain the “ample provision” which the will says he is making for his son.</p>
