Broad powers were given to the officers therein named to the end that the country might be put upon a satisfactory war basis, and, in conferring these powers, it is evident Congress had in mind the different branches of government as such — or the administrative boards they created — should be in a position to effectively carry out the objects and purposes proposed. They were immune from civil process, and free from any hampering impediments, such as lack of congressional action. That body had determined nothing should stand in the way of success, barring, of course, any incapacity of those who filled the several offices. But because of certain limitary rules of the department <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>on the efficiency and effectiveness of the officers and agents of the government in the capacities as indicated, in making and executing contracts and producing results quickly desired, and in order to have' an elastic quick moving piece of machinery, appealing to the public’s sense of business credit, and for other reasons, Congress authorized the shipping board, if in their judgment they deemed it necessary, to create a corporation which functioned as a great industrial business plant, having its disabilities as well as its desirabilities, save only as the shipping act limited them. To guarantee the integrity of its investment as well as the success of the plan, the United States was to be a stockholder in this company to the extent of not less than 51 per cent of its stock, with the privilege to our citizens of acquiring the other 49 per cent. The United States took it all. While Congress deemed it expedient to thus authorize the formation of such corporation, the expenditure of money of the United States in the capital stock thereof, and subsequent advancement of large sums of money to continue ship construction, there is no provision in any act of Congress which in any way repealed, modified or changed the laws governing this company, inherent in all corporations so created by force of the fact that it is chartered under the laws of the District of Columbia. To all intents and purposes, it operated and existed as any corporation operates and exists, — could sue and be sued, as any corporation might sue and be sued. To what extent has this attribute been destroyed or suspended because of the Shipping Act and sundry other acts of Congress? It must be remembered there is here attached a sum of money, — admittedly, for the purpose of this motion, in the hands of the Fleet Corporation, — due defendant ; that is, a proceeding in rem directed against moneys due the defendant owed by the Fleet Corporation. The writ does not attach money uncontracted for, or unspent; that was, by the Emergency Shipping Fund provision of the. act, advanced to the garnishee and par-marked until <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>expended as funds of the United States government. True, its stock is all owned by the United States government. That is not material.

Nor does the fact that the President designated this corporation as the instrumentality through which could be effectively worked out those objects and purposes entrusted to him by various acts of Congress, of itself clothe the corporation as a government representative with immunity from suit, and place the funds due to this defaulting defendant beyond the reach of civil process. The Shipping Act provided for the formation of a corporation, with other minor provisions relative thereto, to carry out the purposes of the act. There is not a single line . :.'‘"ve v‘ which has a tendency to show that the board :: ■ .rerred on the Fleet Corporation any of its many administrative or governmental duties, but when we turn to the articles of association of this company we find the limit of this “carrying out the purposes of the act” to be the “purchase, construction, equipment, lease, charter, maintenance, and operation of merchant vessels in the commerce of the United States, and in general to do and to perform every lawful act and thing necessary or expedient to be done or performed for the efficient and profitable conducting of said <em>business”; </em>that the President, under the Emergency Fund provision of the Urgent Deficiencies Act, designated this corporation to per<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>form certain duties similar to those embodied in its certificate of incorporation, does not alter the real status of this concern, to wit: that it was an arm of the shipping board, functioning as a great industrial business corporation, with power to enact by-laws, vote its stock, deposit its money and securities, and declare dividends from the surplus and profits. The things to be done delegated to it by the President — and we have none other before us — were to construct, requisition and purchase ships, and these powers were clearly in line with the original thought under which this company was incorporated and the purposes expressed by Congress when the Shipping Act was passed and incorporated in the company’s charter. It was the work of a business corporation, pure and simple. Nor can we agree that the same immunity that surrounded the President was retained by the corporation when he delegated to it the several duties enumerated. As stated by Judge Hand, in reviewing the Lake Monroe, <a href="/us/250/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="250 U.S. 246" data-case-ids="3683727" data-case-paths="/us/250/0246-01">250 U. S. 246</a>, “by a precise parity of the reasoning, which the Supreme Court adopted in ‘The Lake Monroe,’ supra, it must follow that in choosing the Fleet Corporation he [the President] chose it with all its limitations upon its head. In other words, Congress contemplated that possibility, and excepted that, in so delegating his powers, he must subject their exercise to the scrutiny and determination of the customary tribunals, precisely as the Fleet Corporation’s other activities were subject......Moreover, it is in general highly desirable that in entering upon industrial and commercial ventures, the governmental agencies used should, whenever it can fairly be drawn from the statutes, be subject to the same liabilities and to the same tribunals as other persons or corporations similarly employed”: Gould Coupler Co. v. United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, <a href="/f/261/0716-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="261 F. 716" data-case-ids="3537814" data-case-paths="/f/261/0716-01">261 Fed. 716</a>. True, it may be called an agent of the government and a highly important agent. But it was like many other industrial agents that carry on a great <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>work without having attached any immunity from the delegating or employing power. With the paramount purpose in view — to wit, the acquisition of vessels for the prosecution of the war — it is difficult to understand in the Lake Monroe ease why the vessel there arrested for a tort should not have been immediately released notwithstanding the fact that she was engaged during the war in private coastwise trading at the time the accident occurred; but the Supreme Court of the United States held it liable notwithstanding the paramount purpose and the claim of immunity on the ground that the delegated authority came from an act of the President.</p>

Woodward, <em><a href="/us/17/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="4 Wheat. 518" data-case-ids="4697" data-case-paths="/us/17/0518-01">4 </a></em><a href="/us/17/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="4 Wheat. 518" data-case-ids="4697" data-case-paths="/us/17/0518-01">Wheaton 518</a>. They possess no legislative power, no executive control, so far as the body politic is concerned, nor do they exercise judicial functions as to acts between citizens. It is a business corporation, to be treated as such, unless Congress expressly provides otherwise, which has not been done in the present instance. It would seem that the Congress, by its several acts, intended the general course of the law, with respect to the litigation with which this company might be connected, should be applicable. To evidence this purpose it provided an exception to the general rule by requiring that suits brought to recover compensation for property requisitioned <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>should be instituted as prescribed by the judicial code; section 24, paragraph 20, and section 145 are mentioned as covering the cases. It is a fair inference that its other legal difficulties were to be litigated in the usual tribunals.</p>
    <p id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[309,613,1158,1238]]]'>If it was the intent of the Congress that the Fleet Corporation should be immune from civil process, it would have been very easy to have written it into the act; but nowhere is such language found, nor can it be reasonably inferred therefrom. If the Fleet Corporation was to be immune from civil process of any nature whatever, why the necessity of a Fleet Corporation at all? The United States government, acting through the shipping board as such, was immune from such process. It possessed the power and authority to do all the corporation could do. What was the intent of the Congress when it authorized the creation of the Fleet Corporation if it was not for the purpose of conducting a business corporation and assuring to those with whom it dealt that they would have a speedy adjustment of all claims. If not so adjusted, they had a debtor responsible in a court of law for the contracts and obligations undertaken, and when its contractors incurred debts a way was at hand, as in this case, to compel payment. Where would this immunity cease, considering the language of the delegation and the sundry subsequent delegation of the same subject-matter as the corporation was empowered to and did make?</p>

Courts will not close their doors to the relief of honest claimants (who have dealt with concerns such as herein discussed) for the reason that at one time they were engaged in and had for their immediate purpose the preparation of the United States government <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>for its successful entry into and conclusion of the war with Germany.</p>
    <p id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[189,453,1153,1688]]]'>We might then safely rest the case on the general rule that it, as a corporation doing business in Pennsylvania, is amenable to the processes of this court. As a corporation, chartered in the District of Columbia, there is no doubt the federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the state courts, it being a creature of the United States government. It has been held that corporations organized under the laws of the District of Columbia may be sued in the state courts: Sheffer v. Natl. Insurance Co., <a href="/minn/25/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="25 Minn. 534" data-case-ids="765673" data-case-paths="/minn/25/0534-01">25 Minn. 534</a>. Generally speaking, whenever the legal right arises and the state court is competent to administer justice, the right may be asserted in such court although the federal court may have concurrent jurisdiction, unless the jurisdiction is limited by law to the federal courts. State courts have, therefore, been held to have jurisdiction of the suit against a federal officer or an officer of the general government, except where exclusive jurisdiction is given to the federal courts: Scranton v. Wheeler, <a href="/us/179/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="179 U.S. 141" data-case-ids="5708537" data-case-paths="/us/179/0141-01">179 U. S. 141</a>, affirming Scranton v.

We conclude, therefore, that the attachment was proper and a valid process against the garnishee.</p>
