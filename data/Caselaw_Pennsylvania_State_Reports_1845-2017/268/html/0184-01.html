The word “any” means “one indifferently out of a number” (Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary), and testator evidently used it in that sense. Stuart Groninger had but two children; and the will, according to a fair interpretation of its language, says his estate is to be “divided equally between” them, if either one is living at the actual distribution thereof, which he directs shall not take place till the expiration of a prior life estate. Since the property in question could not be “divided equally between” one child, should only one survive the life tenant (which has eventuated), what, as a matter of fact, the father must have had in mind and intended to provide for was an equal division of his estate between the <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>two children and also postponement of actual distribution, in order to let in the life interest given their mother.</p>

This is significant, in connection with our instant consideration, because the substitutionary provision in favor of testator’s heirs occurs “in the same sentence, and in the same distribution of his property,” as the one for children, and since, by the former provision, he clearly intends heirs living at his death, so also must a similar meaning be ascribed to the latter, so far as children are concerned: Redding v.

The rules and principles applicable to this class of cases have been so often, and so lately, discussed by us that it is not necessary to reiterate them here — it is enough to refer to Hood v. Maires, <a href="/pa/255/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="255 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="1027703" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0128-01">255 Pa. 128</a>; Bair’s Est., <a href="/pa/255/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="255 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="1027703" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0128-01">Id. 169</a>, also authorities already cited, and others to be mentioned; but, before taking up the next subject for consideration, it may be well to note that this court early decided “the presumption that a legacy is intended to be vested” applies with far greater force where a testator is making provision for his children than where the gift is to strangers or collateral relatives (Wengerd’s Est., <a href="/pa/143/0615-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="143 Pa. 615" data-case-ids="978531" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0615-01">143 Pa. 615</a>, 621; also see Minnig v.

Of course, where a will sheds no light upon the subject of the testator’s intent — as to the vesting of remainders — other than that shown by a direction to pay or divide the principal at a designated future time, and the gifts in remainder are implied solely from the “direction to pay,” such gifts are “necessarily inseparable” from the direction, and “partake of its quality, insomuch that, if the one is future and contingent, so must the other be”: Moore v. Smith, <a href="/watts/9/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="9 Watts 403" data-case-ids="1849953" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0403-01">9 Watts 403</a>, 407. However, in Man’s Est., <a href="/pa/160/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="160 Pa. 609" data-case-ids="852192" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0609-01">160 Pa. 609</a>, 612, 613 (cited in Rosengarten v. Ashton), where the bequest was to “divide” the principal at the death of the life tenant, we held remainders thus created to be vested, saying: “where there is a bequest in the form of a direction to pay, or pay and divide, ‘from and after’ the happening of any event,” without more, the remainder is usually accounted contingent: “but if, upon, the whole will, it appears that the future gift is only postponed to let in some other interest, or, as the court has commonly expressed it, for the greater convenience of the estate ■......, the interest is vested notwithstanding, although the enjoyment is postponed.” Again, in a most recent case upon the subject, Jenning’s Est., <a href="/pa/266/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="266 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1056047" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0060-01">266 Pa. 60</a>, where (as here) the remainders rest upon a direction to “divide” testator’s estate between his children upon the death of their mother, we held the interests of the children to be vested remainders, citing Marshall’s Est., <a href="/pa/262/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="262 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1044445" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0145-01">262 Pa. 145</a>, 149.</p>

Ashton, that all should now appreciate it is not invariably applicable whenever a direction for distribution happens <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>to be associated with the creation of a remainder; but, since a number of recent appeals indicate misapprehension upon this point, we deem it wise to repeat the following relevant matter from the opinion of Chief Justice Brown in Marshall’s Est. (p. 149) : “Though there be no other gift than in the direction to pay or distribute in futuro, yet if such gift or distribution appears to be postponed for the convenience of the fund or property, or where the gift is only postponed to let in some other interest, the vesting will not be deferred till the period in question. Thus where stock is bequeathed to A. for life, and after his decease to trustees, upon trust to sell and......divide the proceeds.......between C. and D.; as the payment or distribution is evidently deferred until the decease of A., for the purpose of giving precedence to his life interest, the ulterior legatees take a vested interest at the decease of the testator: 1 Jarm. on Wills, 764. Where the enjoyment of the gift over is postponed to accommodate the estate, or for the payment of debts, or to meet any other burden first imposed, and not chiefly on account of the character of the donee, it is regarded as a decisive circumstance in favor of immediate vesting: 2 Redf. on Wills, 236, section 37......The mode or form of the bequest seems to be regarded by Vice-Chancellor Wigram as immaterial......The question is one of substance and not of form, and in all cases it is whether the testator intended it [as] a condition precedent that the legatees should survive the time appointed by him for the payment of their legacies; the answer to this question must be sought for out of the whole will, and not in the particular expression only in which the gift is made: Leeming v. Sherratt, 2 Hare 14; McClure’s App., <a href="/pa/72/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="72 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="434740" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0414-01">72 Pa. 414</a>.” See also Milligan’s Est., <a href="/pa/244/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="244 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1003496" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0161-01">244 Pa. 161</a>; Reeder’s Est., <a href="/pa/254/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="254 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1025462" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0085-01">254 Pa. 85</a>; Rau’s Est., <a href="/pa/254/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="254 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="1025421" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0464-01">254 Pa. 464</a>; Strocker’s Est., <a href="/pa/260/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="260 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1040327" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0385-01">260 Pa. 385</a>; and Packer’s Est.
