The Suburban Water Company, appellant, as a public service corporation, had furnished water to the borough for fire protection since 1893. It filed its schedule with the Public Service Commission March 1, 1918, which, after due advertising, was to become effective April 1, 1918. Appellee filed a complaint to the rates there set forth, but continued to receive and use appellant’s commodity, and, when sued for the price thereof, refused to pay, setting up as a defense (1) that no contract with the municipality for this service had been approved by the Public Service Commission; and (2) that no contract had been secured as required by the borough code.

By section 1, clause D, of article II, P. L. 1378, and section 54, of article VI, P.

Notice to the commission and the public must be given by posting or publishing the proposed change, “which shall plainly state the exact changes proposed to be made in the tariffs or schedules then in force, and whether an increase or decrease, and the time <em>when the proposed changes will go into </em>effectThe schedule must be filed with the commission, posted and published, as indicated, for a period of thirty days, “in the manner, form, and places required with respect to the original tariffs or schedules”: Article II, section 1, clause P. If the commission, or the public affected by the change of rates, is dissatisfied with the facilities, rules, regulations, practices, classifications, rates, fares, tolls, or charges, therein inaugurated, complaints may be filed against such changes and the matter will be determined as provided in sections 2, 3, 4 and 5, of article Vi, P. L. 1403-6. When complaint is made before the rate goes into effect, which is prior to the thirty-day period of filing and publication, the commission shall make due investigation in the manner particularly set forth in the act. It shall determine “as to the propriety of such proposed change and of the new rate, practice, or classification. After such hearing <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>and investigation, <em>whether completed before or after such </em>change goes into effect, the commission may make such order in reference to the new rate......as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after the same had become effective.” On such hearing, where the proceedings have been instituted before the rate has become effective, the public service company must show the rates are reasonable, but when complaints are filed after the thirty-day period, the rates are prima facie reasonable and the burden of proof is on the complainants to prove them unreasonable. As said by Judge Head in B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. v. P. S. C., <a href="/pa-super/66/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="66 Pa.

He is not required to produce any evidence until the plaintiff has, prima facie, at least, offered proof which, if unanswered, would warrant a judgment in his favor.” But whether the complaint is filed before or after the thirty-day period, if the utility has complied with the provisions of the statute, the rates become effective «at the time [fixed by the schedule in its notice of publication] when the proposed change will go into effect”; the effective date is the date made by the company when the proposed change of rates shall apply to its service, after being duly promulgated according to the statute. A rate becomes, on the effective date, an effective rate, and, as such, it is a collectible rate, or one that may be sued for. There can be no legal rate except the last tariff rate published as provided by law: Section 7, article III; section 1 (E and F), article II; section 41, article YI; and the effective rate thus published supersedes all prior rates covering the service therein called for.</p>

The utility, with the possible exception of three classes constituting special rates thus far very rarely in use in Pennsylvania, may not of its own motion have an affirmative order approving its rates; for nowhere in the act is such authority given. The act was intended to prevent ex parte approvals having the effect of contested approvals, and the only method to test the reasonableness of a rate is by complaint filed, as was done in this case, or by proceedings on the part of the commission of its own motion.

The Borough Code specifically excepts provisions of the Public Service Act: “Nothing in this act shall be construed to repeal any of the provisions of the Public Service Law”; if it did not, what we later say on this subject in discussing section 11, article III, would apply. This section reads as follows: “No contract or agreement between any public service company and any municipal corporation shall be valid unless approved by the commission: Provided, that, upon notice to the local authorities concerned, any public service company may apply to the commission, before the consent of the local authorities has been obtained, for a declaration by the commission of the terms and conditions upon which it will grant its approval of such contract or agreement, if at all.” This section does not control, for the following reasons: (1) The contract therein contemplated does not embody a charge for service fixed under an effective <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>rate; (2) by the terms of the Public Service Law, such rates have a legislative approval until, by the procedure therein determined, a different standard of charge shall be established. It will scarcely be contended a rate fixed for a given quantity of water, or service, is a contract, or that, when a consumer uses it, there is nothing more than a mere bargain and sale at a price fixed according to law. While the language of the first part of section 11 is quite broad, and ordinarily would include implied contracts, of which a bargain and sale may be said to be one, when it is read with the proviso that follows, it is clear it had no relation to such transaction or sale. How can a legislatively fixed rate be the subject of “terms and conditions,” to receive the consent of the local authorities? When you read the first part of this section with the latter part (they must both have reference to the same character of contract), the use of the words “terms and conditions” shows that contract does not relate to a purchase of water, or the like, at a price fixed in the method prescribed by the act; but pertains to contracts involving more than rate fixing, contemplating such which require, in the exercise of a deliberate, discretionary power, the consent of the municipality, as, for illustration, contracts guaranteeing quantity, quality, time pressure, minimum requirement, to be paid for Avhether used or not, and many other matters where the rate may be the consideration. Rate making by a public service company involves no element of consent by a municipality when made; like any other consumer, it may file a complaint if aggrieved. The contracts mentioned in section 11 are such which must meet an investigation in the special manner pointed out by the act, and, if approved, receive from the commission a certificate of public convenience, as provided by sections 18 and 19 of article V, P. L. 1414 and 1415 of this act. “When application shall be made to the commission by any public service company for any approval under any of the provisions, of this act......such approval...... shall be given_______when the commission shall find or <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>determine that the granting or approval of such application is necessary or proper for the service, accommodation, convenience or safety of the public.” It is scarcely necessary to say that the approval of a rate is not necessary to any matter there mentioned.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[297,613,1156,751]]]'>Moreover, when a rate becomes effective, it is a rate established by law. It cannot be varied by the parties, and the company departs therefrom at its peril. Having satisfied every requirement of the act, it has become a collectible, suable rate until it is set aside in the method provided in the act. It is, therefore, for the time being, a legislative rate. It clearly was not the intention to include the “furnishing of all such service at prices, charges or rates” effective and collectible on all patrons alike, under the term “contract” as mentioned in section 11, article III, or to subject such legislative rate to a further revisory control in municipalities in that it must consent, thus tending to destroy the scheme of the act on this subject.</p>

It is entitled to the benefit of the presumption that all things were done as directed by law, and it would be fair to assume this furnishing was by a contract in existence when the change of rates was made in 1918; and, while we have held that the acts of public service companies, under the Public Service Law, supersede the acts of these companies with their patrons when they are in conflict, it is not exactly correct to say the entire contract is annulled. It may still be a contract between the parties, modified or enlarged by the acts of either the company or the commission, under the Public Service Law, and, if the consumer sees fit to recognize a change, it is still a contract.

But, it has been said, if we permit public service companies to collect rates which may thereafter be determined unreasonable, the interests of the municipality may be jeopardized, as may its other patrons, in that they may never be able, because of the company’s insolvency, to be recouped of excess payments thus made.

Under the very broad powers given to the commission by section 27, of article Y, the commission may enforce, execute and carry out, by its order, all the provisions of the act relating to the duties and limitations of public service companies, including the obligation to make reparation, and no court would think of declaring an act of the commission unjust and unreasonable which would require from a public service company, subject to the commission’s approval, a bond to indemnify its patrons against loss where there is danger of the company’s insolvency.
