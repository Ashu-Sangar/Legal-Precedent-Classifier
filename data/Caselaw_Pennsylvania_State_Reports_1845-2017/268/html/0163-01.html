Prior to the amendment, the findings of the referee and the board as to matters of fact were generally conclusive, as no provision had been made to bring up the testimony as part of the record. The appeal was in the nature of a certiorari, adopted to prevent appeals to the courts except for errors of law, and so hasten final determination of claims <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>under the act; the judicial review was limited to an inspection of the record to ascertain whether the judgment was in conformity to law, and the opinion of the court was considered part of the record; and the findings as contained in the record of the referee and board could be examined in deciding the question of law before the court: McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., <a href="/pa/261/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="261 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1042265" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0312-01">261 Pa. 312</a>, 321, 322. The amending Act of 1919, by section 427, in addition to the other changes therein mentioned, requires the board to “certify to such court its entire record in the matter in which the appeal has been taken, including the notes of testimony......,” when an appeal is taken to the common pleas, or to this court, and it is upon this record the appeal is determined.</p>
    <p id="b199-4" data-blocks='[["BL_199.4",199,[171,1124,1153,972]]]'>It was not intended by the legislature that this court should be an appellate administrative tribunal to weigh the evidence submitted to the referee or the board. Our revisory powers are limited to such consideration of the record as will enable us to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the findings of the board and if, upon such findings, the law has been properly applied. Though we may be of opinion, from the apparent weight of the evidence, that a finding should be made adverse to that of the board, we are not at liberty to enter or direct such different finding, where the one adopted by the board is supported by proof. The legislature has confided to the compensation board and referees the exclusive function of determining what facts are established. Our investigation is, therefore, limited to the questions of law raised by the record, and is somewhat analogous to our review in an appeal from confirmation of an auditor’s report, or decree in equity.</p>

L. 642. In furtherance of its humane purpose, the act gives claimant every opportunity to produce evidence to <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>sustain her claim, and, in directing that the report be returned to the compensation board for further hearing, opportunity is presented to produce such additional evidence. It was not intended that such hearings should continue indefinitely, and, if the new evidence is merely cumulative, it is the duty of the board to disallow the claim. It is contended the amending Act of 1919 does not apply to an action already instituted. We cannot agree to this. The section in question affects the procedure ; it does not disturb vested rights, or impair contract obligations. Procedure is a matter of statutory regulation, and, unless prevented by the Constitution, the legislature may alter it at will, provided the obligations of contracts are not impaired; but where the remedy is not entirely taken away, and the scope of the powers or duties of the hearing tribunals are merely enlarged, no contract is impaired. Legislation which affects rights will not be construed to be retroactive unless it is declared so in the act. But where it concerns merely the mode of procedure, it is applied, as of course, to litigation existing at the time of its passage: Kille v.
