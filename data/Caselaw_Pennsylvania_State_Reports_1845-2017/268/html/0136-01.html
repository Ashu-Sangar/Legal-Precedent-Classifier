Defendant conveyed the electricity to a pole, 200 feet from plaintiffs’ mill, on primary wires carrying a voltage of 2,200, and there passed the current through a transformer, by which it was reduced to 220 volts, and thence conveyed by defendant on secondary wires to within 18 inches of the mill, where it was transferred to plaintiffs’ wires which passed through the wall in porcelain tubes and were connected up with the motors. On August 1, 1913, after the mill had been in operation about six months, it burned, with a total loss of building and contents, and plaintiffs brought this suit alleging that the fire was caused by defendant’s negligence, which the latter denied. Each side submitted evidence and the jury failed to agree; whereupon defendant, whose request for binding instructions at the trial had not been granted, moved the court below for judgment in its favor on the whole record, pursuant to the Act of April 20, 1911, P. L. 70, 6 Purdon’s Digest (13th ed.) p. 7140. After argument and upon due con<a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>sideration judgment was so entered; from winch plaintiffs brought this appeal.</p>

Plaintiffs’ contention is that the transformer at the pole had broken down, permitting the high voltage current to enter the mill on the secondary wires and set it on fire. The evidence tending to support this contention is circumstantial. Two men had been working in the mill that day and closed it at 5 o’clock p. m.; the fire was discovered 10 minutes later at or near the switch board where the wires entered the building, and plaintiffs’ evidence is that at the same time, for a distance of some 10 feet from the mill, the insulation was burning on the wires, which were spluttering and sparking. At five o’clock the man who turned off the main switch saw an unusual flash and felt an unusual shock. The switch board was damp, because of recent rain, which would tend to the forming of a short circuit. There had been no fire in the mill that day, and, so far as appears, nothing to cause one, aside from the electric wires, unless it might be spontaneous combustion.</p>
