It is clear this states a good cause of action, and since the evidence produced at the trial tended to prove the facts averred, we cannot sustain the complaint that the allegata and probata did not agree.</p>

The evidence showed this sometimes happened as often as once a day and sometimes as infrequently as once a week, either of course being sufficient to affect defendant with constructive notice of the danger as it had continued for months. Indeed the defense was built around the fact that the operation was <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>dangerous in the respect stated, if the rear cars were not so braked as to cause them to drag and not press close up to those immediately in front, or “if the motorman would stop the-motor a little too soon,” thereby jarring the bumpers so they would pass each other; defendant’s foreman admitting there was danger “if there was a slight error in braking and a slight error in the driving of the motor.” To avoid this defendant said it was necessary to set the brakes on the last eight or ten cars, and that plaintiff had been warned of this necessity, in compliance with its duty to him (Zeskie v. Penna. Coal Co., <a href="/pa/241/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="241 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="976088" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0183-01">241 Pa. 183</a>), and as an additional precaution he was told to ride only on the rear car. These allegations he denied, and said also he did not know of the dangers; and the jury by their verdict have conclusively determined all these matters in his favor. It is difficult to understand why defendant — which was in duty bound to supply plaintiff with a safe place to work and with suitable tools and appliances to work with (Lillie v. American Car &amp; Foundry Co., <a href="/pa/209/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="209 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="936144" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0161-01">209 Pa. 161</a>; Reilly v.

Apparently it preferred to rely on its alleged warnings to escape liability, though this did not relieve its employees from the risks, easily avoided, of the “slight errors” which resulted in the frequent derailings of the cars. Under these circumstances the question of defendant’s negligence was one for the jury.</p>
