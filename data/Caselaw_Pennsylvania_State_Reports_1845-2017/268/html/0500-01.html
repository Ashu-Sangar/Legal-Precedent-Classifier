From time to time testator made excuses for not at once paying the amount due and died without having done so, whereupon, upon the audit of the account of his executor, appellant presented a claim therefor, which the auditing judge allowed; but, upon exceptions filed, the court in banc disallowed it; whereupon the present appeal was taken.</p>

The court below finds that “The testimony of counsel for the parties when the contract was signed......clearly shows that Gill [the decedent] was to pay his indebtedness; but upon motion of appellee ordered the evidence in regard thereto to be stricken out because ‘to admit it would violate the rule which prevents the alteration of a contract by parol testimony in the absence of fraud, accident or mistake’ ”; and this order is assigned as error.</p>

And the fact of such an undertaking may be implied from circumstances attending and connected with the conveyance.” No authority contradicts or qualifies this conclusion; on the contrary it is borne out by the others hereinbefore cited. It is true most of the cases arose on sales of realty, but no principle has been called to our attention, and we know of none, why it does not include sales of personalty also, and it was so applied, and a suit successfully maintained by the holder of the encumbrance, in Dingeldein v.
