Weld is a case where, in 1815, before we had an established common school system, a piece of real estate was deeded, for a nominal consideration, to trustees, “on behalf [of] and in trust for the Utica SchoolHouse,” “in trust as aforesaid forever.” A schoolhouse was forthwith erected on the lot, through privately subscribed funds. In 1839 a new building was put up, and this was used by a school established under the common school system; although the report of the case indicates that the original structure was not so used. In 1852 the trustees of the Utica schoolhouse conveyed the premises in dispute to the “School Directors of Sugargrove, to hold for the same purposes for which the grantors held.” Part of the property was subsequently sold by the school directors, and plaintiffs, claiming as heirs of the original grantors, commenced an action of ejection. On appeal, we decided, affirming the court below, that plaintiffs had no right to maintain ejectment; and that the only remedy for those entitled was an action to enforce the trust. Then we specifically said that the 14th section of the Act of 1836, P. L. 531, authorized the conveyance from the original trustees to the school directors. This act provides that “in all cases where real estate is held by trustees for the general use of the neighborhood, as a schoolhouse, it shall be lawful for said trustees......to convey the same to the school directors aforesaid, and from thenceforth the said [school] board shall hold the said property for the same uses for which it was granted to said trustees.” The report indicates that appellants stood upon this statute both in the court below and on appeal. After discussing the Act of 1836, and its effect, the opinion takes up the sale by the school directors to third parties, of part of the land originally conveyed to the former by the trustees; then, <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>in a new sentence, it is said that the directors are not misapplying the money thus obtained to purposes other than those of the trust. The opinion writer then uses the expression “but, be that as it may,” followed by the words, “the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.” Appellant urges that this indicates the Supreme Court really stood on the first part of the opinion as ruling the case, and that the latter part, dealing with the Act of 1836, had no governing effect. We do not so understand the report; we understand the opinion as meaning that plaintiff is not entitled to recover, first, because the trust was originally created without any express right to reenter for a breach thereof, and, next, because the trust had not been broken by the conveyance from the trustees, and this last ground is rested upon the Act of 1836. Hence, we think the chancellor, in the case now before us, made no mistake in citing Barr v. Weld as being, in principle, a ruling authority.</p>

Statutes, such as the Acts of 1861 or 1862, do not, when properly applicable, undertake, in and of themselves, to effect a transfer — from trustees of an academy to school directors — of title to the property theretofore held by trustees, but only purport to authorize the trustees to do that, if they consent to do so. Without such consent by the trustees being subsequently manifested by the actual making of the authorized transfer, no transfer is effected simply by the statutes alone. The title to the property remains in the hands of the trustees as theretofore, and the control continues to remain there, unless, and until, the trustees conclude to voluntarily relinquish, for an adequate reason, their then existing rights to the newly suggested and authorized administrators of the unaltered trust. The statutes simply mean that, if the trustees desire and consent to a transfer to the designated transferees, the visitorial authority of the State would not regard such act as one constituting a diversion of trust property from the beneficiaries of the trust, but only as being a proper means to secure the operation of the trust for the use of the beneficiaries. Although such argument has been made in this ease, yet it is plain to the contrary thereof, that the Commonwealth cannot, by statute, arbitrarily and without adequate cause, take the private property of a private corporation, any more than it could do so with the private property of a natural person, and bestow it on another individual. Something of that kind of arbitrary transfer was unsuccessfully attempted to be done with respect to the corporate property vested in the trustees of the Lebanon Female Seminary. See Lebanon School District v. Lebanon Female Seminary, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20W.N.C.%2065" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="22 W.N.C. 65">22 W. N. C. 65</a>, <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>wherein, it was decided that such an act, attempting to arbitrarily transfer title, was unconstitutional and void. But situations may arise, wherein the State, exercising its visitorial powers with respect to eleemosynary trusts, and devising means for enforcing the internal rules thereof, may properly act, to the end that the trusts may be given continued efficacy, for the benefit of intended beneficiaries. Such situations may, and frequently do, arise, wherein it is proper for the State to declare, by such statutes as the Acts of 1861 and 1862, that such changes in the mode of administering a trust may be lawfully made — the trust itself in all respects being thereby unimpaired. In this case, the academy building had been burned down, prior to the conveyance, and, apparently, the trustees were then unable to replace it with a new one. In consequence of this, for ten or twelve years prior to the passage of these acts, the execution of the purpose of the trust by the trustees had become dormant. It presented a proper occasion for the State — the trustees consenting — to devise the proper application of external means of restoring the then dormant efficacy of the still existing trust, by authorizing a change of the administrators thereof — with the consent of the trustees; the Acts of 1861 and 1862 were originated by the legislature at the promptings of such a purpose, and for the effecting of such a result.”</p>
