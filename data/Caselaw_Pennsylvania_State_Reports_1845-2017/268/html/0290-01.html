    <p class="summary" id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[196,932,1152,1132]]]'>Section 1, of the Act of June 17, 1913, P. L. 507, imposes a tax for county purposes generally on indebtedness howsoever it may be evidenced, but excepts out of its provisions such loans as are made taxable by section 17 of the act. Section 17 imposes a tax upon corporate “scrip, bonds and certificates of indebtedness” for state purposes and section 18, directs that such tax shall he collected as theretofore, that is, by the corporation, as provided by section 4, of the Act of June 30, 1885, P. L. 193. It is quite manifest that the indebtedness upon which the Commonwealth claims the tax, does not fall within the description of the subjects found in section 17, “scrip, bonds or certificates of indebtedness.” It is not evidenced by any such instruments or obligations. If not taxable under section 17, there was no dirty resting upon the defendant company to collect the tax thereon. Its liability for the tax could only arise out of its failure or neglect to assess and collect it. The indebtedness is covered rather by the general language of section 1, and is not taken therefrom by the exception of the subjects made taxable by section 17.</p>
