Jackson, but no descendants ; and he, by reason thereof, became life tenant of her real estate, and her collateral heirs, some of whom are appellants in this case, became remaindermen. Her husband was appointed administrator of her estate, and, upon his petition, without notice to appellants, the orphans’ court authorized Mm to create a mortgage of f2,250 upon a farm owned by her, in order to raise money with which to help pay certain of her alleged debts, her funeral expenses, her tombstone and the cost of settling her estate. Under this authority the mortgage was executed and. delivered to David O. Jackson, and was approved by the orphans’ court. It was admitted at bar that the administrator thereafter filed his account, <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>charging himself, inter alia, with the amount of the mortgage, and the balance appearing by the account was distributed under the order of the orphans’ court. Appellants were not actually notified of its filing, but it was duly advertised, thus giving to them effective legal notice: Priestley’s App., <a href="/pa/127/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="127 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="565760" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0420-01">127 Pa. 420</a>; Ferguson v.

Subsequently the administrator took an assignment of the mortgage, and continued to be the owner thereof, and of a life estate in the property, until he died January 17, 1919.</p>

Appellants filed an affidavit of defense, a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit was made absolute against them, as terre-tenants only; later a judgment for want of an affidavit of defense was entered against the other terre-tenants and the mortgagor, and the present appeal followed.</p>

This, however, was a matter for the orphans’ court, and is conclusively determined against appellants by its decree of distribution, finding those debts, as specified in the petition, to have been due by decedent’s estate, and awarding payment thereof to the creditors named. Entirely aside from this, however, a like effect resulted from the decree on the petition for and the later confirmation of the mortgage; for the <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>court thereby determined, it should be made, because the stipulated debts ought to be paid by decedent’s estate, and the mortgagee and his assignee were not required to investigate the matter further: Brock v.

    <p id="b161-4" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[189,1102,1152,1138]]]'>It is also alleged that the judgment was improper because none of the record defendants actually represented the estate of Amanda Jackson. This was not necessary, however, since that estate was not a party to the mortgage. Judgment was entered against the actual mortgagor, but it is not now quoted and assigned as error. Moreover, as the court below points out, the estate is not concerned in this proceeding. The personal property left by decedent has been distributed, and the lien of her debts has long since expired. If she had been a party to the mortgage, it would have been necessary to make her a defendant; but even then by section 14 of the Act of July 9,1901, P. L. 614, “the return of mortuus est” could not have been made to the writ. What this act sought to accomplish, namely, to give notice to all persons actually interested, has been accomplished; and defendants, who are interested, were given ample opportunity to interpose any defense they had. They were entitled to this, but to no more; and cannot be heard to complain even if the court below erred in holding everybody else interested had. received due notice.</p>
