    <p class="summary" id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[179,835,1155,1182]]]'>Since 1868 it has been the legislative policy to relieve from the personal property tax the shares of stock of corporations liable for a tax on their capital stock. This appears from the Act of January 3,1868, P. L. 1318, and from sections 1, of the Acts of June 1, 1889, P. L. 420; June 8, 1891, P. L. 229, and June 17, 1913, P. L. 507. The policy arose out of the recognized identity of the capital stock and the shares composing it as one and the same subject, so that the taxation of the one is the taxation of the other and that to tax both would amount to double taxation. Quoting from the last act, that of 1913, which imposes a tax upon the shares of stock in corporations, domestic and foreign, held or owned by individual residents or corporations of this State, the language, which is substantially the same as that in the previous acts of assembly referred to, is: “except shares of stock in any......corporation......that may be liable to a tax on its shares or its capital stock for State purposes under the laws of this Commonwealth or relieved from the payment of the tax on its shares or capital stock for State purposes by the laws of the Commonwealth.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b319-7" data-blocks='[["BL_319.6",319,[180,2039,1150,366]],["BL_320.1",320,[301,343,1158,1629]]]'>The fundamental inquiry here is whether the shares of stock in the transportation company owned by the defendant company and representing parts of the latter’s capital stock are taxable under the facts in this case? It is quite clear that if the transportation company’s capital stock composed of these shares has been taxed, the shares themselves cannot also be taxed and the de<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>fendant’s capital stock represented by them would not be liable for tbe tax here claimed. But the fact is that $725,000 of the capital stock of the transportation company has not been taxed. It Avas not liable to taxation because it was represented by property permanently located outside of the State. Not having been taxed the shares are not relieved from taxation. The statute only grants relief to the shares to the extent to which the capital stock is subjected to taxation. Here lies the difficulty with the defendant’s contention. The transportation company has paid the tax on only a part of its capital stock. The defendant company owns all the shares. The tax on the remainder of the capital stock not having been paid, the shares in the hands of the defendant must answer for it. Unless taxed through its capital stock they would escape taxation altogether. We do not understand the statute to mean that when the tax has been paid on the part of the capital stock the shares into which it has been divided are wholly relieved of taxation. By a literal construction of the statutory provision, such a position might be sustained, but we are bound to construe it with due regard to the reason underlying its enactment and the purpose intended to be accomplished. As we have seen, the purpose was to avoid double taxation and the reason was the identity of the capital stock and the shares. To hold that the shares of the capital stock of a corporation, part of whose capital stock is not liable to taxation, are proportionately taxable is not to fall short of carrying out the full intention of the statutory provision.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[301,1984,1156,426]],["BL_321.1",321,[171,343,1153,863]]]'>It is also suggested that, as capital stock and the shares composing it are to be treated as one and the same taxable subject, the taxation of the shares in the present case amounts to the taxation of property outside of the taxing jurisdiction of the State as much so as would be the taxation of the capital stock representing such property. The identity of the two, however, was not intended to be effective except for the purpose <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>of taxation only. Even for that purpose they were formerly held to be separate and distinct subjects: Com. v. Standard Oil Co., <a href="/pa/101/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="101 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="500862" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0119-01">101 Pa. 119</a>. At that time tbe holders of shares of the capital stock were liable to taxation on their shares and the corporation also was liable to a tax on its capital stock in its corporate capacity: Lycoming County v. Gamble, <em><a href="/pa/47/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="47 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="485595" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0106-01">47 </a></em><a href="/pa/47/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="47 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="485595" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0106-01">Pa. 106</a>; McKean v. Northampton County, <a href="/pa/49/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="49 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="998432" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0519-01">49 Pa. 519</a>; Whitesell v.

If we were to extend the identity beyond what we have indicated and to the point suggested by the defendant, the result would be that the resident holders of shares of stock in corporations, whose capital stock is not in this State and not liable to taxation here, would be relieved from the payment of a tax on the shares held by them. Surely no such result was intended by the legislation to which we have referred.</p>

Westinghouse Air Brake Co., <a href="/pa/251/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="251 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="1019531" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0012-01">251 Pa. 12</a>, affirming 18 Dauphin Co.

G. I. Co., <a href="/pa/162/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="162 Pa. 602" data-case-ids="856754" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0602-01">162 Pa. 602</a>, it was said that there was no distinction to be made between capital stock and shares of capital stock, and that the taxation of the one was the taxation of the other. That, however, was only one of the reasons on which the decisions in those cases rested. They were placed also upon the provision of the taxing statutes which expressly excepted from taxation the shares of stock of corporations liable to the capital stock tax or exempted therefrom. Act of June 1, 1889; Act of June 8, 1891, P. L. 229. It was clear from the provisions in the statutes that there was no intention to impose a tax on both the capital stock and the shares of which it was composed, but the exact contrary appeared. We would be carrying the conclusion there reached far <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>beyond what we think the court ever intended it should be carried, if we were to hold the shares of capital stock owned by a Pennsylvania corporation in other corporations not doing business in the State, and whose capital stock is not taxable in this State, to be exempt from taxation. In speaking of the scheme under the statute for the taxation of stocks, Williams, J., in Com. v. Pall Brook Coal Co., supra, said: ‘This scheme includes every share of the stock in corporations created by, or doing business in this State, wherever it may be owned, by imposing the tax on the corporation. It includes every share of stock in corporations which the State cannot reach that may be held by any taxpayer by requiring him to disclose his ownership and then assessing the shares he holds directly to him.’ Thus the shares of stock are only relieved from taxation when the capital stock itself is taxed. The double taxation referred to in the Pall Brook and other cases was that which would have resulted from the taxation twice by the same taxing power of what was regarded as the same subject. The case presented by this appeal is quite different. The subject of the tax here is the capital stock of the defendant company. Its capital stock is represented by the shares of stock which it holds in other corporations outside of this State. Those shares are taxable in this State, but the capital stock which they compose is not in this State and not subject to the taxing jurisdiction of this State. The statutory exception, therefore, does not apply. We are of opinion that the capital stock which is represented by shares of stock in the corporations which were not doing business in this State, and whose capital stock was not liable to taxation here, is taxable.”</p>
