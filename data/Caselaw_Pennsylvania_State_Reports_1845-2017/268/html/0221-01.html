Thereupon the orphans’ court appointed W. J. Zacharias, Esq., as trustee under the will, and he acted as such until 1910, when he was succeeded by the present appellee. The widow died in January, 1919, and, thereafter, J. R. Ruthrauff and George H. Bartle, two trustees of the college, were granted letters of administration d. b. n. c. t. a. on the estate of John Lortz. The college has not yet commenced the erection of the building, although its legacies under the will are valued at about $50,000. After the death of the widow the plaintiff trustee made a contract with defendant to sell him certain land of the estate at Chambersburg and tendered him a deed therefor, which he declined to accept on the contention that the trustee was without power of sale. After argument, and upon due consideration, the court below filed an exhaustive opinion, holding that the trustee’s deed conveyed a good title, and entered judgment for the plaintiff on the case-stated; from which defendant brought this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[270,1668,1157,808]],["BL_259.1",259,[185,315,1153,1465]]]'>The decision was right. To carry out the testamentary intent of securing to his widow the net income for life, while preserving .the estate intact for the college as ultimate beneficiary, testator created an express trust and appointed a trustee, in whom the legal title vested for the purposes of the trust. The same person was named and referred to in the dual capacity of executor and trustee, but the duties appertaining to each were not blended thereby. As executor he settled the estate and then turned over the property to the trustee, who has since had charge thereof in the performance of his duties. The trustee appointed by the court took the place of the one named in the will and holds the legal title which vested in the original trustee, with the rights and duties thereunto belonging. True, it was devised to Judge <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>Stewart as executor and trustee, but the title under the trust vested in Mm in the latter capacity; if not, then in whom was the title during the fourteen years when there was no executor or administrator? It would be strange that the title to land devised in trust should vest in the executor and not in the trustee, merely because the same person was named as both; and, if the title vested in the trustee, as it undoubtedly did, it would be equally strange that the administrator c. t. a. and not the trustee should be the one to execute the power of sale of the real estate so held in trust. The will not only creates an express trust, but provides for the performance of trust duties, making investments, management of real estate, collection of rents, paying over net income, etc. As the will directs a sale of the real estate at the death of the widow, there remains the implied trust duty of investing the proceeds until they can be transferred to the college under the terms of the will; and the manner of such transfer is one permitting the exercise of a reasonable discretion. Should the administrators c. t. a. sell the real estate they could properly do naught with the proceeds but turn them over to the trustee, who holds the balance of the estate, or invest the same until ripe for distribution, and the latter Avould be the duty of a trustee. The trust was created, inter alia, to hold, manage and finally sell the real estate and the duty of so doing devolves upon the trustee.</p>
