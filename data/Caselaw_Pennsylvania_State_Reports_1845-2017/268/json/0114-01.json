        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nIn this action, to recover damages for libel, a nonsuit was entered, which the court below refused to remove; plaintiff has appealed.\nWilliam O. Pritchard, appellant, was the president and manager of the National Store Specialty Company, a corporation located at Bareville, Pa.; D. M. Wenger, defendant, was the secretary and treasurer; both were directors.\nIn February, 1918, plaintiff drew up a contract, the effect of which was to give hixn additional compensation as manager, above his regular salary. On March 25, 1918, this writing was submitted for adoption to a meeting of the board of directors; but, since the by-laws of the corporation provide that such matters must be approved by a majority of the members present, it was necessary, in order to secure approval, for plaintiff himself to vote in favor of the contract, which he did.\nDifferences of opinion, as to the propriety of the action of the board, arose among the stockholders, culminating in a meeting of the latter, on November 16, 1918, when the contract was unanimously rejected by those present. Plaintiff was removed from his office of manager, and, November 27, 1918, resigned as president of the company. Up to the time of his dismissal as manager, he drew, under the rejected contract, $1,190.48 in excess of the amount to which he was entitled according to the terms of his previous agreement.\nAn attempt was made by plaintiff and other stockholders to remove defendant as secretary and treasurer; but this failed. The disagreement among the shareholders continued, and, in December,-1918, at a meeting of certain of them, defendant not being present, some reference was made to a letter on the situation, alleged to be possessed by a Mr. Still; one of those in attendance was authorized to see defendant and have him, if possible, obtain the desired epistle. Defendant, later, being unable to get the document, wrote two of the stockholders, who had attended the meeting, the communication plaintiff now alleges as libellous, which is fully printed in the reporter\u2019s notes.\nIt is plain the word \u201cabstracted,\u201d used in the alleged libel, when read with its context, simply means obtained through the contract, the adoption of which defendant attacked \u2014 and nothing more. The letter charges neither theft nor embezzlement; it is not libellous per se, and no special damages were pleaded or proved, nor was malice shown.\nFinally, the ground stated by the court below in refusing to remove the nonsuit \u2014 that the writing is a privileged communication \u2014 is well taken. The gathering of stockholders, which (in the words of one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses) \u201cgave rise to the letter,\u201d had met to consider the \u201cdifficulty between Mr. Pritchard [plaintiff] and Mr. Wenger [defendant]\u201d that was injuriously affecting their company, and, incidentally, to discuss pending efforts, connected therewith, to \u201cget Mr. Wenger out as secretary.\u201d Certainly, under these circumstances, the communication now complained of \u2014 being written, with an apparent full belief in the truth of the very general statements contained therein, by one immediately concerned with the subject-matter in hand, to others wdth a community of interest, for purposes of their common protection \u2014 was properly classed by the court below as privileged, which of itself is sufficient to support the nonsuit.\nWe have considered all matters raised by the assignments of error and referred to in the statement of questions involved, material to a determination of the present appeal, and find no reversible error.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

In an action for libel where the writing on which the suit is based, is not libellous per se, and no special damages are pleaded or proved, and no malice shown, a nonsuit is properly entered.\n2. Where the president of a corporation casts the deciding vote at a directors\u2019 meeting in favor of a contract increasing his salary as manager, and thereafter draws the increase until he is dismissed as manager, a letter written by the secretary of the company to two directors in which he comments on the tenacity with which the president holds on to \u201cthe amount abstracted from the company,\u201d but without making any charge of theft or embezzlement, is not libellous per se. The use of the word \u201cabstract,\u201d when read with its context, simply means obtained through the contract, the adoption of which the secretary attacked.\n3. Such a letter is a privileged communication, where it appears that it was written after the president had been ousted, and an attempt was being made to oust the secretary himself; and where it was written with an apparent full belief in the truth of the very general statements contained therein, by one immediately concerned with the subject-matter in hand, to others with a community of interest, for purposes of their common protection.\nArgued May 17, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 297, Jan. T., 1920, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Lancaster Co., Feb. T., 19.19, No. IS, refusing to take off nonsuit in case of William O. Pritchard v. D. M. Wenger.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschziskkr, Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for libel. Before Landis, P. J.\nThe writing upon which the suit was based, is a letter addressed by defendant to two of the directors of the National Store Specialty Company and is as follows:\n\u201cAddress all communications to the firm and not to individuals. The National Store Specialty Company M\u2019fVs of the Pennsylvania Line of Computing Scales Oil and Gasoline Storage Systems and Store Specialties. [The preceding lines constitute the printed letterhead.]\n\u201cBareville, Pa., Dec. 20, 1918,\n\u201cLancaster, Pa.\n\u201cMessrs. Martin Sheaffer and Hershey Groff, Bare-ville, Pa.:\n\u201cGentlemen:\n\u201c1 am addressing both of you on this matter because you seem to he the leading figures among your associates who are yet undecided as to the veracity of certain claims against the crafty artist, designer and intriguer.\n\u201cI understand that at your meeting yesterday you concluded that if you could see a certain letter claimed to be held by Mr. Still, you would be able to make a definite and positive decision.\n\u201cIn this connection I wish to state that I asked Mr. Still for the letter during November and he claims he is unable to locate same after hunting for it for some time. He censured me that my petition compelled him to look through his old letter files in a cold place and that he contracted a cold while doing this for me. Now, I feel a little timid to ask him again but will write him to-day as I want you, gentlemen, as we are, satisfied that we are dealing with a stiff proposition and all must pull together.\n\u201cIt appears to me that the maimer in which the contract came into existence, its provisions and the tenacity with which the beneficiary holds to the amount abstracted from this Company, together with one affidavit we already have and such others we can get from myself, Messrs. Nation, Bowman and Finch, should be sufficient evidence to corroborate our claims.\n\u201cGentlemen, it is quite evident that we reach a positive decision soon. As the matter now stands we are divided. Unity is of utmost importance right now. We, who are temporarily directing the affairs of this company, are becoming discouraged. We do not know where we stand as the support is divided by giving credence to some of the intriguer\u2019s contentions. We must be out and out for one or the other. No half-way attitude will do. Our efficiency in this work cannot be of a high grade as long as we are compelled to work under the mental strain that we may after all perform our work in vain and only suffer defeat in the end for intervening in your behalf.\n\u201cIf you yet feel to suggest that I resign, please let me know definitely before Xmas. If I will not hear from you, I will then resign as secretary, treasurer and director to take up a position to which the door is open at any time and where, I am quite sure, the associates will be of greater unity and the atmosphere more congenial.\n\u201cPlease let me know and oblige,\n\u201cYours very truly,\n\u201c[Signed] D. M. Wenger.\u201d\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the further facts.\nThe trial judge entered a compulsory nonsuit, which the court in banc refused to take off. Plaintiff appealed.\nErrors assigned were: (1) ruling that alleged libellous letter is privileged communication, (2) refusal to strike off nonsuit, (3) rulings on evidence (none of the latter being referred to in appellant\u2019s statement of questions involved, they are treated by the Supreme Court as abandoned).\nJune 26, 1920:\nB. F. Davis, for appellant.\nIf a libel is so worded that it may naturally or probably be taken to refer to the plaintiff, it is actionable by him though lie is not named, or even is called by a different name: Clark v. North American Co., 203 Pa. 346; Price v. Conway, 134 Pa. 340.\nThe language in this ease is libellous per se because it attacked the character of the man who was president and manager of the company: Wood v. Boyle, 177 Pa. 620; Wallace v. Jameson, 179 Pa. 98.\nWritten or printed matter may lie libellous without charging a crime: Beck v. Stitzel, 21 Pa. 522; Meas v. Johnson, 185 Pa. 12.\nThe letter was not privileged: Briggs v. Garrett, 111 Pa. 404; Barr v. Moore, 87 Pa. 385.\nJohn E. Malone, with him S. Z. Moore, for appellee.\nWhen a publication is not directly defamatory of any person, the pleadings must indicate its meaning and to whom it refers: Com. v. Swallow, 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 539; Pittsburgh, Allegheny & Manchester Pass. Ry. v. McCurdy, 114 Pa. 554.\nAs the letter was not libellous per se, before there could be a recovery, appellant would have had to set forth in Ms statement a claim for special damages: Weaver v. Phillips, 231 Pa. 325."
