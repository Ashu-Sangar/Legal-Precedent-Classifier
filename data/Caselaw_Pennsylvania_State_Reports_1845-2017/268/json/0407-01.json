Where a testator gives all of his personal property to his \u2022widow after payment of debts and funeral expenses, dividends which have accrued after the death of testator on stock included in his personal estate, are the property of the widow, and pass under her will.\n2. If all parties agree that the widow\u2019s interest in the personal estate of her husband shall be distributed without the filing of an account of her estate, such dividends may be distributed to the legatees under her will.\nExecutors and administrators \u2014 Commissions \u2014\u2022 Evidence \u25a0 \u2014 Review on appeal.\n3. The reduction of an executor\u2019s commissions from the amount claimed, is a question to be determined by the orphans\u2019 court on all the testimony submitted, and it will not be reversed by the appellate court, if the sum allowed appears, from all the circumstances, to be an ample (Compensation.\nArgued September 30, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 75, Oct. T., 1920, by George and Jacob Whitehead, executors, from decree of O. O. Westmoreland Co., Aug. T., 1919, No. 31, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in estate of Peter Whitehead, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication. Before Copeland, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that testator bequeathed all of his personal property to his widow after payment of debts and funeral expenses. Among his assets were 21,167 shares of a gold mining company, on which there had accrued after his death the sum of $4,422.50 in dividends. The widow died leaving a will by which she gave her estate to her children. It was agreed by the parties in interest that moneys coming to her from her husband\u2019s estate should be distributed to her legatees without the formality of filing an account in her estate. The court accordingly made this distribution and awarded the accrued dividends as part of the widow\u2019s estate.\nDecember 31, 1920 :\nThe accountants claimed $12,000 as commissions based largely upon services rendered in the sale of certain coal lands. The court cut down the allowance to $7,000, on the ground that the large price obtained for the coal was due to the general rise in values, rather than to any special services of the accountants.\nExceptions to the adjudication were dismissed by the court. The accountants appealed.\nError assigned was decree dismissing the exceptions to the adjudication, quoting it.\nCurtis H. Gregg, with him Sidney J. Potts, for appellants.\nJames S. Moorhead, with him Robert W. Smith, for appellees."
