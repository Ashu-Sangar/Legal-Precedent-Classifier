We now decide nothing more. The case is clearly within the rule that, on an appeal from a decree granting or refusing a preliminary injunction, we look only to see if there were apparently reasonable grounds for the court\u2019s action. On an appeal taken from a final decree all questions involved are open for consideration: Gemmell et ah v. Fox et al., 241 Pa. 146; Hoffman v. Howell, 242 Pa. 112; Deal v. Erie Coal & Coke Company, 246 Pa. 552; Holden v. Llewellyn, 262 Pa. 400.\nAppeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.",

The decree will be sustained if such grounds appear. On appeal from the final decree all questions involved will be open for consideration.\nArgued May 18, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 49, Jan.
