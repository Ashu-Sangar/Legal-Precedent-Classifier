His testamentary disposition of his entire estate was clearly contingent upon her dying in his lifetime, and, as that contingency did not occur, the correct conclusion of the learned president judge of the court below was that the disposition fell and intestacy followed as to two-thirds of his estate. The plaintiffs having acquired two-thirds of the property involved in this proceeding by descent from their father, and the other third as heirs of their mother, who died intestate, the title which they tendered to the appellant is good, and the judgment is affirmed.",

Where a testator gives, devises and bequeaths to his wife \u201cher one-third interest\u201d in his estate \u201cif she survives me if not the estate to be equally divided\u201d among his children, without any disposition of the remaining two-thirds, the survival of the widow vests in her one-third of the estate absolutely and creates an intestacy as to the other two-thirds.\n2. In such ease, after the death of the widow intestate, the children take one-third of the estate as heirs of their mother, and, with the other two-thirds vested in them by descent from the father, theymay make a good title to all of the real estate of which their father died seized.\nArgued May 12, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 45, Jan.
