The Borough of Mount Carmel et al.\nMunicipalities \u2014 Ordinances\u2014Police powers \u2014 Street railways\u2014 Stopping points \u2014 Blocking traffic \u2014 Reasonableness\u2014Public Service Commission Act.\n1. A borough ordinance providing that the passenger street cars of an interurban railway operated on a much traveled Street shall proceed to certain other streets for the stopping and return point of the cars, to avoid blocking the street and impeding vehicular traffic, is not an unreasonable exercise of the police power of the borough.-\n2. The power of a borough to enact such an ordinance was not taken away by the statute creating the Public Service Commission.\n3. Such an ordinance is not an unreasonable or oppressive exercise of the police power merely because it may cause some readjustment of the street car company\u2019s schedule and some additional expense in the operation of the cars, and the relocation of tracks or the building of turnouts on another street.\nCity of Easton vj Miller, 265 Pa. 25, followed.\nArgued May 25, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 63, January T., 1920, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. Northumberland Co., No. 445, in equity, dismissing plaintiff\u2019s bill for injunction in case of Shamokin & Mount Carmel Transit Co. v. Mount Carmel Borough, Thomas Evans et al., Councilmen, and Joseph S. Nowakoski, Chief Burgess, defendants.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for an injunction. Before Cummings, P. J.\nPlaintiff, by its bill, sought to enjoin the borough officers from interfering with the operation of plaintiff\u2019s street cars and from arresting plaintiff\u2019s employees for the violation of an ordinance of the borough regulating traffic upon its streets.\nThe portion of the ordinance as to which complaint was made, provided that \u201cAll street passenger cars entering the borough on Third street shall operate to Market street via Fifth street before making the return trip.\u201d\nThe plaintiff is an interurban railway. Third street is a much traveled street, and the purpose of the ordinance was to prevent the blocking of the street at a point on Third street near Oak street, where there was heavy travel.\nThe court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s bill: see opinion in 4 Northumberland L. J. 252, 11 Municipal L. R. 260. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was above decree, quoting it.\nYoris Auten, for appellant.\nL. 8. Walterfor appellee.\nJune 26, 1920:"
