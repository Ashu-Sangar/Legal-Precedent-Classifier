T., 1921, by Henry J. Trainer and John E. McLean, Jr., et al., from order of Q. S. Phila. Co., June T., 1920, quashing proceedings in the matter of the nomination of Harry C. Eansley.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling and Simpson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition to contest the nomination, at a primary election, of a candidate for Congress.\nThe petition on behalf of Charles Delaney alleged fraud at a primary election for the nomination of a candidate for Congress in the Third Congressional District of Pennsylvania, held on May 18, 1920. The petition prayed that certain ballot boxes be opened, the ballots counted according to law, and a true return be made thereof. Harry C. Eansley, the candidate returned as nominated, moved that the proceedings he quashed, on the ground that the quarter sessions had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition. The court, in opinions by Patterson, J., and Shoemaker, J., in which opinions Bregy, P. J,, concurred, held there was nothing in the Acts of May 19,1874, P. L. 208; July 12,1913, P. L. 719, or July 9, 1919, P. L. 839, which gave the quarter sessions jurisdiction over such a contest, and they accordingly entered an order quashing the proceedings. See 29 Pa. Dist. R. 626.\nDecember 31, 1920:\nThe petitioners appealed.\nError assigned was the order of the court.\nAllen S. Morgan, for appellants.\nThe right to contest in the present case is secured by the primary election laws under which nominees seek to secure a place upon the ballot at general elections, under a party name.\nThe primary election laws giving the right to contest are complete in themselves and reference is made to the Act of 1874, only for a method of procedure: James Smith Woolen M. Co. v. Browne, 206 Pa. 543.\nWilliam A. Carr, with him Leopold C. Class and J. Lee Patton, for appellee.\nThe quarter sessions was without jurisdiction to entertain a contest relating to the nomination or election of a representative in Congress : Wilson v. Blaine, 262 Pa. 367; Coopersdale Election, 157 Pa. 637; Com. ex rel. v. Emminger, 74 Pa. 479; Hulseman v. Rems, 41 Pa. 396."
