Similarly, here, appellant’s escape prior to sentencing acted as a knowing and understanding waiver of his appellate rights. Consequently, I would hold that appellant forever forfeited his right to appellate review. <em>See Commonwealth v. Jones </em><a href="/pa/530/0536-02" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="530 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="1833003,1833023" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0536-02,/pa/530/0536-01">530 Pa. 536</a>, <a href="/pa/530/0536-02" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="610 A.2d 439" data-case-ids="1833003" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0536-02">610 A.2d 439</a> (1992) (defendant’s voluntary, escape acts as <em>per se </em>forfeiture of his right of appeal). To hold otherwise will only give encouragement to those individuals who may be contemplating flight to avoid punishment. Knowing that there are severe consequences that result when one attempts to disrupt the orderly process of the court, an individual so inclined to flee will be given an incentive to stay and face the process of the court. Therefore, I believe the Superior Court properly held that appellant waived his appellate rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
