Morrissey, was involved in a head-on auto accident in West Virginia. Mr. Morrissey suffered numerous injuries and accrued substantial medical bills in addition to missing over two months of work. He collected <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>$20,466.07 in workmen’s compensation benefits from Trans America, his employer’s workmen’s compensation carrier, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

That driver was primarily insured by Nationwide Insurance Company (Nationwide) for a maximum of $25,000. His employer’s insurance was issued by State Farm Insurance Company (State Farm) which contacted Mr. Morrissey concerning a settlement for the injuries sustained as a result of the accident. In April, 1987, Trans America notified the parties that it possibly possessed a subrogation lien against any settlement made with State Farm on account of the workmen’s compensation payments made to Mr. Morrissey.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.6",297,[222,1132,1152,648]]]'>On August 19, 1987, Mr. Morrissey and Appellant signed a release with State Farm in the amount of $90,000, minus the $25,000 paid by the Nationwide policy. The couple received two bank drafts on that date. The first was issued in the amount of $44,533.93 and named John M. Morrissey and Sue Helen Morrissey as payees. Pursuant to the notice received from Trans America, State Farm mistakenly believed that Trans America had a valid subrogation lien. As a result, the second draft, in the amount of $20,466.07, was made payable to John Morrissey, Sue Helen Morrissey and Trans America and is the document which serves as the basis for the criminal charges against Appellant.</p>

For fear that the draft would become outdated, Appellant contacted Robin Williams, a supervisor at Trans America in late September or early October 1987. Appellant was informed by Ms. Williams that she was not authorized to make a decision concerning the validity of Trans America’s subrogation lien but that she would discuss the case <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>with her own supervisor and Trans America’s attorneys to determine their rights to subrogation.</p>

Ms. Williams allegedly told Appellant to send the check to her at Trans America via Federal Express and that she would endorse it. Records indicate that the check was sent at 11:33 a.m. on November 12, 1987. Subsequently, Appellant phoned Ms. Williams at 3:53 p.m. on November 12, 1987, to inform her that the draft had been forwarded to her. On November 16, 1987, the draft was returned to Appellant and Mr. Morrissey, with the signature of Robin Williams on the reverse, and was then deposited into their checking account at Union National Bank.</p>
