Passaro was convicted by a jury of burglary and criminal conspiracy. Post-verdict motions were denied, and he was sentenced to prison. A timely notice of appeal was filed in Superior Court. Passa-ro escaped from prison after a brief had been filed on his behalf with the court, but before oral argument was scheduled. Six months later, the Commonwealth filed a motion to quash the appeal. The motion was granted on April 29, 1983. Passaro was arrested in Ohio on August 24, 1.983. He waived extradition and was returned to Pennsylvania.

The appellant argued that the appeal of a juvenile should not be dismissed under any circumstances because the law adopts a protective posture with respect to <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>juveniles, dealing with them as parens patriae. In the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, it was stated that juveniles have a right of appeal under Article 5, § 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and that such appeals are governed by the Rules of Appellate Procedure, rather than The Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq. The opinion went on to state that this Court’s holding in <em>Jones </em>“extends to juvenile defendants, making a juvenile defendant’s voluntary escape a per se, irrevocable forfeiture of his right of appeal, where the juvenile defendant is a fugitive at any time after post-trial proceedings commence.” <em>Thomas, </em><a href="/pa/533/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="533 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="1837517" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0572-01">533 Pa. at 578</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="533 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="1837517" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0572-01">626 A.2d at 153</a>.</p>

However, our rules of criminal procedure do not apply to juveniles. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 1 (“[Tjhese rules do not apply to juvenile or domestic relations proceedings”). Thus, juveniles are not required to be advised by the court of their appellate rights. In fact, the Appellant in the instant case was not notified of his appellate rights.
