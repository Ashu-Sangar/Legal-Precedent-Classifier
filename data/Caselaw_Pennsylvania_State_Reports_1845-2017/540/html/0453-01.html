But the additional facts here do not by themselves “point to guilt.” We find that mere police observation of an exchange of an unidentified item or items on a public street corner for cash (which alone does not establish probable cause to arrest) cannot be added to, or melded with the fact of flight (which alone does not establish probable cause to arrest) to constitute probable cause to arrest. Such facts, even when considered together, fall narrowly short of establishing probable cause.</p>

In <em>DeWitt, </em>the defendant was seen sitting in a car with three other people. The car was parked in a church parking lot at 11:50 p.m. The exterior lights were off, and the interior lights were on. Because he had received notice from the church of previous criminal behavior in the parking lot, a police officer pulled alongside the car to investigate. The interior lights went out and the four occupants made movements as if trying to hide something. The car pulled away as the officer approached. When the officer stopped the car, drugs were recovered. We found no evidence to support the officer’s conclusion that criminal activity was afoot. There was no information that the particular car in <em>DeWitt </em>or its occupants were engaged in criminal activity, and nothing in their behavior could lead to that conclusion, let alone probable cause to <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>arrest. Moreover, we observed that we would be hard pressed to conclude that flight, by itself, constitutes reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. <a href="/pa/530/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="530 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="1832985" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0299-01">530 Pa. at 307-08</a>, <a href="/pa/530/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="530 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="1832985" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0299-01">608 A.2d at 1034</a>. In short, movement of an unknown item, or the mere exchange of an unknown item or items, plus flight, with nothing more, does not establish probable cause to arrest under the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court which held to the contrary must be reversed.</p>

Here, the police officer, who made his observations from about two car lengths away in broad daylight at 12:50 p.m., saw appellant stand on a public street corner, reach into his pocket and hand a small unknown and concealed object to another individual who then gave appellant an unknown amount of cash. Based upon the officer’s experience, he found this behavior to be consistent with the illicit sale of drugs. Acting on a reasonable suspicion that a drug transaction had just been completed, the uniformed police officer exited his marked vehicle to investigate, at which time appellant inexplicably ran away after looking in the officer’s direction. The officer then chased appellant, as was his lawful right, and seized him. <em>See Commonwealth v.

A suspicious transaction, which includes the exchange of money for unknown items (such items being consistent and similar in size and configuration to items used in the illicit sale of drugs and exchanged in a manner not consistent with a normal commercial transaction), can give rise to reasonable suspicion as to allow an officer to inquire and investigate. Under a totality of those circumstances, this type of suspicious transaction combined with the seller’s flight upon the sight of a uniformed officer in broad daylight, clearly gives rise to probable cause to seize the individual.</p>

An officer's mere pursuit of a fleeing suspect does not give rise to a Constitutional violation under the Fourth Amendment. <em>California v. Hodari D., </em><a href="/us/499/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="499 U.S. 621" data-case-ids="11320254" data-case-paths="/us/499/0621-01">499 U.S. 621</a>, <a href="/us/499/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="499 U.S. 621" data-case-ids="11320254" data-case-paths="/us/499/0621-01">111 S.Ct. 1547</a>, <a href="/us/499/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="499 U.S. 621" data-case-ids="11320254" data-case-paths="/us/499/0621-01">113 L.Ed.2d 690</a> (1991). In the instant matter, the majority, in footnote 2, erroneously characterizes the United States Supreme Court’s holding in <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em><a href="/us/499/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="499 U.S. 621" data-case-ids="11320254" data-case-paths="/us/499/0621-01">499 U.S. 621</a>, <a href="/us/499/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="499 U.S. 621" data-case-ids="11320254" data-case-paths="/us/499/0621-01">111 S.Ct. 1547</a>, <a href="/us/499/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="499 U.S. 621" data-case-ids="11320254" data-case-paths="/us/499/0621-01">113 L.Ed.2d 690</a> (1991), as being that "contraband disposed of or abandoned in the course of an <em>unjustified </em>pursuit by police is not the fruit of illegal police conduct and is not a ‘seizure’ under the Fourth Amendment requiring suppression of evidence obtained.” (Emphasis added). This characterization, set forth in dicta, improperly suggests that the Court in <em>Hodari D. </em>found that the pursuit by the police was unlawful. However, at no time did the majority address or characterize the pursuit by the police. Rather, the sole issue addressed by the <em>Hodari D. </em>Court was the limited issue of whether a fleeing juvenile was seized under the Fourth Amendment where, despite a police officer’s show of authority attempting to make the juvenile stop, the juvenile failed to halt. The Court held that unless a person is physically seized or actually submits to a show of police authority, there is no seizure. In the case below, the majority’s characterization of the pursuit in <em>Hodari D. </em>as "unjustified” is actually drawn from the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Stevens, <a href="/us/499/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="499 U.S. 621" data-case-ids="11320254" data-case-paths="/us/499/0621-01">499 U.S. at 630</a>, <a href="/us/499/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="499 U.S. 621" data-case-ids="11320254" data-case-paths="/us/499/0621-01">111 S.Ct. at 1552</a>, and is irrelevant to this case.</p>
