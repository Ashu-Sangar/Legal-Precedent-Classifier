[to] construct ... one or more additional lines of pipe approximately parallel with the first pipe.” Thus, the Appellees do not dispute the right of Transco to build a third pipeline or maintain a 100 foot wide right-of-way across their property. Appellees do argue that the additional 30 feet of land cleared by Transco beyond the 100 foot wide right-of-way in 1991 is a <em>defacto </em>taking of their property.

The unambiguous terms of the agreement contemplated that Transco might clear additional land in the construction of additional pipelines as it provides a remedy for “any physical damage to growing crops, timber, fences, or other structural [sic] improvements caused by construction----” In fact, the express terms of the agreement gave Transco “all other rights and benefits necessary or convenient for the full enjoyment or use of the rights of the herein granted including ... the right from time to time to cut and remove all trees, undergrowth, and other obstructions that may injure, endanger, or interfere with the construction ... of said pipe lines.” We find that the clear language of the agreement is evidence of the original intent of the parties to allow Transco to clear additional land where such clearing is reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose of the agreement.</p>

Twelve years later, the company wished to re-enter the property and install lightning arresters on the tower which required wires that would expand beyond the previously maintained right of way. The Superior Court found that the controlling rule was that “[w]here a right of way is expressly granted and its precise location and limits are not fixed by the deed, it is competent for the parties to define the location and determine the limits of the right of way by subsequent agreement, use and acquiescence.” <em>Id. </em>at 604, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.%20311" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="193 A. 311">193 A. at 313</a> (citations omitted).
