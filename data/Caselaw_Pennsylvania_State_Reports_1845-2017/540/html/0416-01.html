    <p id="b710-8" data-blocks='[["BL_710.7",710,[242,766,1152,420]]]'>Appellant, Clark Katze, appeals from the Order of the Superior Court which reversed the trial court’s grant of a new trial and remanded for sentencing. Appellant was charged with criminal solicitation to commit murder, and he was convicted in a non-jury trial. After post-verdict motions, the court ordered a new trial. Upon appeal by the Commonwealth, the Superior Court reversed the lower court’s grant of a new trial. This Court granted review.</p>
    <p id="b710-9" data-blocks='[["BL_710.8",710,[240,1214,1151,639]]]'>In August of 1990, Appellant approached Rodney Middleton and offered him money to kill Appellant’s wife. Appellant gave Middleton $300.00 and promised an additional $1,500.00 after the murder was carried out. Appellant provided Middleton with a photograph of his wife and the route she took to work. Middleton approached Appellant’s wife and told her of her husband’s intentions, but she did not believe him. He informed police in Upper Darby, Delaware County, and in Philadelphia of what had transpired between him and Appellant; however, none of the officers acted on the information because they did not believe Middleton. Middleton then began taping his conversations with Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b710-10" data-blocks='[["BL_710.9",710,[239,1880,1148,474]],["BL_711.1",711,[242,259,1154,365]]]'>After illegally taping several conversations with Appellant, Middleton approached a Philadelphia police officer and played him the tape; however, the tape was unintelligible. The officer put Middleton in contact with homicide detectives. Middleton turned over the money Appellant had given him, and detectives took a statement without listening to the tape. Middleton then agreed to wear a wire in accordance with the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa. C.S. §§ 5701-5781 (“the Wiretap Act”), to record his next <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>conversation with Appellant. Wanting to warn Mrs. Katze of the situation but unable to locate her, detectives met with her family in Ocean City, New Jersey, to warn them that her life was in danger and to obtain their help in locating her. The family did not believe the detectives so they played one of the tapes which had been made by Middleton. The family assisted the police in locating Appellant’s wife.</p>
    <p id="b711-4" data-blocks='[["BL_711.5",711,[244,646,1148,577]]]'>Detectives and local police went to Appellant’s home to inform his wife of the situation, and she left her home with the detectives. Although Appellant was present when this happened, he was not arrested until six days later. After being arrested and advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Appellant gave a statement to police in which he admitted asking Middleton and another individual, John Reid, to kill his wife. Appellant also explained that he intended that his wife only be frightened. At the suppression hearing Appellant testified that his brother-in-law had told him his conversations with Middleton were on tape.</p>
    <p id="b711-5" data-blocks='[["BL_711.6",711,[244,1245,1150,633]]]'>Appellant was charged with criminal solicitation to commit murder. He moved to have the illegal recording made by Middleton suppressed as well as the statement he made to police. The suppression court found that the tape made by Middleton violated the Wiretap Act and that Appellant provided police with a statement because he knew of the existence of that tape. (R.R. 285A-86A). Nonetheless, the suppression court went on to hold that introduction of this evidence was not prohibited because the original illegality was committed by an individual without encouragement by the police or an agency of the state. (R.R. 286A). Therefore, the court denied Appellant’s motion to suppress.</p>

The trial court was unable to understand what was being said on the admitted tape. The statement Appellant had made to the police was also admitted at trial. Middleton testified regarding his meetings with Appellant. Appellant also testified and maintained that he only wanted Middleton to scare his wife rather than kill her. <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>Appellant was convicted of criminal conspiracy. He filed post-verdict motions regarding the admission of his statement to police. The Court of Common Pleas granted a new trial, holding that the record supported the suppression court’s finding that the statement Appellant made to the police was the product of an illegal tape. (R.R. 699A-702A). In an opinion addressing the Commonwealth’s objection to the grant of a new trial, the trial court held that the suppression court was incorrect in concluding that the statement was not prohibited because the illegality was committed by a private person rather than a state actor. <em>Commonwealth v. Katze, </em>No. 0169 Nov. Term 1990, slip op. at 4 (C.P. Philadelphia County Sept. 21, 1992). The court affirmed its decision to grant a new trial and declined to address the issues of whether Appellant waived his claim by testifying or whether admission of the statement was harmless because neither issue was asserted by the Commonwealth. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>

The Superior Court did not address the issue of whether Appellant’s statement was derived from the illegal tape because it found that its admission was harmless error if it was error at all. <em>Id. </em>at 4. In holding that a new trial should not have been granted, the Superior Court noted that Appellant testified at the trial, that his testimony was virtually identical to his statement to police, and that Middleton also testified. <em>Id. </em>at 5.

In <em>Hashem, </em>police investigators were authorized to monitor telephone communications for a given period on specified telephone numbers. One of the intercepted calls involved a crime which was unrelated to the crime for which the intercept order had been granted. Following the expiration of the intercept order, investigators filed a report as required by the Wiretap Act; however, the report failed to include Hashem’s name and the criminal activity involved. Hashem was arrested and charged based on information obtained through the original intercept. At Hashem’s preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth presented transcripts of the intercepted telephone calls. Prior to the hearing, the Commonwealth had not obtained authorization to disclose the contents of the wiretap as required by the Wiretap Act. More than two years after the final report had been filed, the Commonwealth moved to amend that report and requested authorization to use the evidence obtained through the intercept at Hashem’s trial.</p>
