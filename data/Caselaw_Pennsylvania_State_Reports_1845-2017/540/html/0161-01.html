For the reasons set forth below, we find that the Superior Court properly reversed the trial court’s grant of appellant’s motion for a new trial because the statements made by appellant’s co-conspirator were properly admitted at trial and, therefore, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to their admission.</p>

The victim had been shot once in the head with a .32 caliber Smith and Wesson firearm. A neighbor who lived in the rowhouse next door to 248 North Wanamaker Street testified that on Saturday, September 10, 1988, at approximately 8:00 a.m., she heard sounds of a scuffle and an argument coming from 248 North Wanamaker Street. The neighbor also heard the shouts and screams of male voices and one female voice come from both the first and second floors of the house. The neighbor heard the female voice scream, “Help me, help me, please,” shortly after which the shouts and screams abruptly stopped. Both appellant and his co-defendant were identified as the residents of the 248 North Wanamaker Street row-house. Several other witnesses testified that co-defendant Smith sold crack cocaine from the rowhouse, while appellant Cull often acted as a lookout for police activity.</p>

The two conspirators immediately drove to a nearby destination in the 100 block of Wanamaker Street, where they spoke to Faye Cherry, co-defendant Smith’s former girlfriend. Witness Cherry testified that Smith instructed her not to tell anyone <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>that she knew him if she was questioned, and also said he was leaving town.</p>
    <p id="b459-5" data-blocks='[["BL_459.5",459,[198,409,1152,683]]]'>Witness Cherry further testified at trial that, in appellant’s presence, co-defendant Smith told her that “we just shot this fiend in the head and left her in the basement.” Smith told Cherry that they murdered their victim simply “because we wouldn’t give her no drugs and she threatened to call the cops.” Appellant Cull then interjected “I shot the bitch because she scratched me in my face.” Ms. Cherry testified that consistent with appellant Cull’s inculpatory statement, she observed scratches on his face. Before departing, Smith made certain that Cherry possessed no photographs of him from which he might be identified and requested her telephone number so that he could keep himself informed as to “what’s going on down here.”</p>

Apparently Smith had come to the realization that the aforementioned murderous deed would adversely affect their ongoing drug operation. Mr. Lewis testified that in explanation for their sudden move, Smith stated that he and appellant had just killed Sharon Smith because “she was giving some problem.” Smith described to Mr. Lewis how he and appellant Cull had dragged her down to the basement and beaten her, that appellant Cull had shot her at Smith’s direction, and that, after cleaning up the blood, the two men packed their belongings and left the house for the purpose of permanent relocation. Smith then asked Lewis to recommend a hotel where he and appellant could stay until nightfall, after which they could then travel to New York under the cloak of darkness. Smith telephoned Lewis several days later to say that he was in New York, but would soon be heading south.</p>

Lewis also testified that the night before <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>the murder, he observed appellant Cull test-firing a handgun into the air outside 248 North Wanamaker Street.

After four months of searching for appellant Cull, the police eventually captured him hiding in the closet of a house in Columbia, South Carolina.</p>

    <p id="b460-8" data-blocks='[["BL_460.8",460,[231,1700,1153,635]]]'>The first issue raised for this Court’s consideration is whether co-defendant Smith’s statements to Faye Cherry and Fitzroy Lewis incriminating appellant Cull were admissible against Cull.

Appellant argues that <em>Bruton </em>prohibits the introduction of any of his co-defendant’s statements because his co-defendant chose not to take the stand at their joint trial.</p>
    <p id="b461-4" data-blocks='[["BL_461.3",461,[212,302,1152,846]]]'>
      <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>In <em>Bruton, </em>the issue was whether statements of a co-defendant made outside the presence of the appellant to a postal inspector while the co-defendant was in jail were admissible in the appellant’s and co-defendant’s joint trial. The trial court admitted the third party’s testimony regarding the co-defendant’s statements and instructed the jury that the co-defendant’s statements had to be disregarded in determining appellant’s guilt. The Supreme Court of the United States, however, held that the co-defendant’s out-of-court statements, secured in a police setting and outside the presence of appellant, were not admissible since admission thereof would violate the appellant’s right to cross-examination under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Court emphasized that such statements were inherently unreliable and were not such that a jury could ignore them in its deliberations despite the trial court’s limiting instruction.</p>
    <p id="b461-5" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[209,1171,1152,956]]]'>However, two years after <em>Bruton </em>was decided, the Supreme Court held in <em>Dutton v.

In <em>Dutton, </em>the trial court permitted a prosecution witness to testify (pursuant to a Georgia statute allowing the admission of statements made in concealment of conspiracy), that an alleged accomplice, who was not tried with the appellee, stated to him while they were both in prison that had it not been for appellee, “we wouldn’t be in here now.” The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court finding that admission of the statement violated appellee’s right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.

N.T. 320-330. We also note from our review of the record that defense counsel read the statement into evidence not to assert the purported truth of the statement, but to impeach Ms. Cherry’s credibility and consistency regarding Smith’s statements to her. <em><a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20254" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="299 A.2d 254">Id.</a> As </em>such, the truth-determining mission of the confrontation clause is not implicated and no <em>Bruton </em>violation occurred. <em>See Dutton, <a href="/us/400/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="400 U.S. 74" data-case-ids="12046557" data-case-paths="/us/400/0074-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/us/400/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="400 U.S. 74" data-case-ids="12046557" data-case-paths="/us/400/0074-01">400 U.S. at 81-82</a>, <a href="/us/400/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="400 U.S. 74" data-case-ids="12046557" data-case-paths="/us/400/0074-01">91 S.Ct. at 215-16</a> (the mission of the confrontation clause is to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials). <em>See also Tennessee v. Street, </em><a href="/us/471/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="471 U.S. 409" data-case-ids="6203741" data-case-paths="/us/471/0409-01">471 U.S. 409</a>, 413-414, <a href="/us/471/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="471 U.S. 409" data-case-ids="6203741" data-case-paths="/us/471/0409-01">105 S.Ct. 2078</a>, 2081-82, <a href="/us/471/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="471 U.S. 409" data-case-ids="6203741" data-case-paths="/us/471/0409-01">85 L.Ed.2d 425</a> (1985) (defendant's rights under the confrontation clause not violated by the introduction of an accomplice’s confession for nonhearsay purposes). Further, we believe no claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness may lie on this point on the basis of our finding herein that trial counsel's failure to object to the admission of any of Smith’s statements was not prejudicial to appellant’s case in light of appellant’s own explicit admission of guilt and the <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>other meaningful evidence of guilt. <em>See Peterkin, supra, </em><a href="/pa/538/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="538 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="475558" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0455-01">538 Pa. 455</a>, <a href="/pa/538/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="649 A.2d 121" data-case-ids="475558,7863060" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0455-01,/a2d/649/0121-01">649 A.2d 121</a>.</p>
