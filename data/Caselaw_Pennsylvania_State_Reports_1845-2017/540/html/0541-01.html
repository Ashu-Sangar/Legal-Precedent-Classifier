It is clear that Aldridge’s consistent statements to the police and testimony at Appellant’s preliminary hearing and trial foreclosed the possibility that defense counsel could have persuaded Aldridge to change his statement concerning the identity of the perpetrator prior to the close of trial. Moreover, Aldridge’s recantation is not merely cumulative or corroborative given the tenuous nature of the circumstantial evidence connecting Appellant to the crime and the inability of any other witness to make a positive identification of the perpetrator. In this case, where the only Commonwealth witness who identified the perpetrator has recanted his testimony, such evidence can not be considered cumulative or corroborative <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>because the defendant claimed that he did not commit the crime in question.

There is no dispute that Michael Aldridge was subjected to threats against himself and his family because he was a witness for the Commonwealth in this case. The record contains two specific incidents where Aldridge was confronted by Appellant’s brother and verbally threatened in September 1983. (R.R. 29a, 31a). One month later, a written threat appeared on the school locker of Aldridge’s sister. (R.R. 33a-35a). On May 4, 1984, Aldridge was assaulted by people who kicked and punched him and said, “This one’s for Terry.” (R.R. 35a). Some twelve days later, Appellant’s brother confronted Aldridge and his father at their home which resulted in a physical altercation between Appellant’s brother and Aldridge. (R.R. 36a-37a). All of these incidents were precipitated by Aldridge’s cooperation with law enforcement authorities or his testimony against Appellant.</p>

In November of 1989, Aldridge’s involvement as a witness in appellant’s case was reported on the television news program <em>Inside Edition </em>and in the local newspapers. (R.R. at 40a). At the recantation hearing, Al-dridge stated in regard to the television program, “You can’t be a snitch in jail and survive.” (R.R. at 40a). In another incident in November, Aldridge was beaten by his cellmate for being a “snitch,” after his cellmate found a letter from a private investigator which connected Aldridge with the appellant’s case. (R.R. at 38a-39a). As a result, Aldridge wrote two letters to prison officials in late November of 1989 asking to be placed in protective custody or relocated to another prison stating, “... I was warned that there are members of [appellant’s] family and or friends of his here at Bordertown <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>and Midstate prison.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> I was warned if I came here I would be hurt” and that “my life is in serious jeopardy.” (R.R. at 40a-45a). These letters were written within less than a year of the recantation hearing which was held in August of 1990. Also, the trial judge noted that an employee of the Internal Affairs Department of Corrections for the State of New Jersey testified that he had investigated the claims and that Aldridge’s fears appeared to be genuine. <em>Commonwealth v.

Aldridge did, however, maintain that the individual that he could not now identify was wearing the same clothing that appellant was wearing when he was apprehended within approximately one hour after the robbery and shooting.

All eight of the witnesses who observed the sole perpetrator at the time of the <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>robbery and shooting gave substantially the same description as Aldridge concerning the man’s clothing. <em>McCracken, supra, </em>at 4; (R.R. at 32-109, Notes of Testimony of Trial from October 18,1983). This description included a red sweatshirt, dungarees and a dark knit cap. Although appellant was not wearing a dark knit cap at the time he was apprehended, which all of the witnesses had described the perpetrator as wearing, a dark knit cap was later found by the police in appellant’s home. <em>McCracken, supra. </em>Furthermore, appellant agreed to submit to a gunshot residue test which tested positive on appellant’s left hand. <em>Id. </em>Thus, because Aldridge’s newest testimony simply fails to exculpate appellant, and the Commonwealth’s case would include: (1) overwhelming circumstantial evidence of appellant’s guilt which includes the eyewitness testimony of over eight persons, (2) Aldridge’s prior inconsistent statements identifying appellant, (3) compelling evidence that Ms incentive to recant was to avoid imminent physical barm and (4) his admission of perjury; a new trial would most likely result in the same verdict.

The trial court would also have to, in part, disregard the facts upon which appellant’s conviction was affirmed by this Court subsequent to the first “after discovered evidence” hearing. In doing so, the trial court exceeded its role by relying on its own perception of the facts rather than on the established record. As the trial <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>court readily admits, “[i]f the recantation hearing was the only proceeding in this case heard by the writer of this Opinion, a decision would probably have been made from the Bench at the end of the hearing. The decision would have been to dismiss the Motion.” <em>McCracken, supra. </em>Essentially, what the trial court is undertaking is a reweighing of all the evidence elicited in the various hearings in this case and is not affording the proper weight to the evidence at the present stage of the matter which it concedes is highly speculative. While a trial judge must necessarily look at newly discovered evidence or recantation against the backdrop of the entire testimony, the trial judge should view the evidence in the light most favorable to verdict winner. The trial court cannot substitute its perception of the facts for that of the jury in order to reach a conclusion that the highly unreliable recantation testimony offered here would result in a different verdict.</p>
