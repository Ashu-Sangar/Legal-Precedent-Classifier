The asbestos bar was notified that an omnibus motion to transfer venue on cases filed during 1986 and 1987 would be heard. Prior to this motion hearing, the trial court ordered Appellants to submit information sheets summarizing the residence and location of asbestos exposure for each plaintiff.</p>

The <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>trial court considered the information contained in the summaries provided by Appellants as well as the arguments put forth by the respective parties. Several months thereafter, the court issued several orders transferring the cases at issue to other counties based upon the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>The court issued an opinion which set forth the basis upon which the decision to transfer each case was made. <em>Caldwell v. Raymark, </em>No. 8710-4324 (C.P. Philadelphia County Oct. 6, 1992).</p>
    <p id="b658-4" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[212,782,1163,573]]]'>Appellants filed timely appeals in the Superior Court which affirmed the trial court’s transfer of the instant cases based on <em>forum non conveniens. </em>The Superior Court issued two separate opinions, each addressing the claims of a specific appellant. <em>McGarvey v. Raymark Industries, Inc., </em>No. 314 Philadelphia 1992 (Pa.Super. Dec. 29,1993); <em>Fitzgerald v. AC &amp; S, Inc., </em>No. 602 Philadelphia 1992 (Pa.Super. Dec. 16, 1993). Although the merits of the remaining cases were not addressed, the court affirmed the orders transferring these eases, indicating only that the transfers were proper. <em>McGarvey </em>at 8; <em>Fitzgerald </em>at 12.</p>
    <p id="b658-5" data-blocks='[["BL_658.6",658,[211,1378,1158,570]]]'>On appeal before this Court, Appellants raise several allegations of error concerning the procedures used by the trial court in transferring their cases. Appellants first claim that the omnibus motion utilized by the court had the effect of placing on them the burden of justifying Philadelphia as their choice of forum based on residence or location of asbestos exposure. They further argue that there was no showing that trial in Philadelphia would be oppressive or vexatious to Appellees, or that there were insufficient contacts with Philadelphia to justify a transfer under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
    <p id="b658-6" data-blocks='[["BL_658.7",658,[210,1980,1158,258]],["BL_659.1",659,[279,314,1159,373]]]'>A change of venue based on <em>forum non conveniens </em>is addressed in Rule 1006(d)(1) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure: “For the convenience of-parties and witnesses the court upon petition of any party may transfer an action to the appropriate court of any other county where the <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>action could originally have been brought.” Appellants contend that the trial court’s omnibus motion procedure limited the relevant factors to be considered in transferring a case based on <em>forum non conveniens. </em>They further claim that Appellees failed to present evidence concerning the location of witnesses or documentary evidence which would demonstrate that Philadelphia was an inconvenient forum.</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.5",659,[280,721,1155,316]]]'>While we are not persuaded by Appellants’ assertion that they were prejudiced by the oral petitioning process at the omnibus motion hearing, we do find merit to the claim that the trial court failed to accord sufficient deference to Appellants’ choice of forum.

In addition to the large backlog of asbestos cases, it appears that the only factors consid<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>ered by the trial court were the Appellees’ residences and locations of asbestos exposure when it ordered the cases transferred to other counties. Although these factors are relevant to a change of venue determination, <em>Okkerse </em>clearly requires a showing by a defendant that he or she would be unduly burdened if the trial were to take place in the plaintiffs original choice of forum. The record is devoid of any evidence that Appellants would suffer such a hardship.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[197,797,1166,1229]]]'>While a court must consider the public interest of avoiding court congestion in its decision to transfer a case, it must also give due deference to the plaintiffs choice of forum. We recognize the substantial progress that the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County has made in clearing the backlog of asbestos cases from the docket. However, we are constrained to conclude in this instance that the court has abused its discretion in ordering transfers where there has been no showing on the record by Appellees as to how trial in Philadelphia County would prove oppressive or vexatious. In its opinion accompanying the transfer orders, the trial court stated: “We thoroughly reviewed each plaintiffs’ [sic] residency, employment and exposure. These factors weighed heavily in our reasoning and addressed the parties’ interests, convenience, witness location and sources of proof.” <em>Caldwell v. Raymark, </em>No. 8710-4324, slip op. at 9 (C.P. Philadelphia County Oct. 6, 1992) (footnote omitted). This analysis fails to articulate a specific basis upon which we may conclude that Appellees have demonstrated that trial in another county would provide easier access to witnesses or other sources of proof. Additionally, we are unable to find any evidence in the record that would allow us to independently reach this conclusion.</p>
