Fisher, </em>at the time Fisher was tried for the killing of Ms. Rowden, he had previously been convicted in federal court for conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of one Nigel Anderson, a government informant scheduled to testify at a then-imminent heroin trial. Anderson had been murdered and his death was an integral issue regarding the motivation for the killing of Ms. Rowden. During voir dire, the prosecution asked whether a venireman had read anything about Fisher’s earlier federal conviction. The venireman responded affirmatively and was later selected to sit as a member of the jury. Following his conviction for Rowden’s murder, Fisher’s federal conviction was reversed and he was discharged. The late Justice McDermott, writing for a unanimous Court, stated, “Given that subsequent event, the question [asked of the venireman] loses pertinency and becomes prejudicial. With such a fact lodged in the jury box, its effect inestimable, a new trial is required.” <em><a href="/pa/527/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="591 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="1827716,1827738" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0344-01,/pa/527/0345-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/citations/?q=527%20Pa.%20346" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="527 Pa. 346">527 Pa. 346</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="591 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="1827716,1827738" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0344-01,/pa/527/0345-01">591 A.2d at 711</a>.</p>

Maryland, </em>the United States Supreme Court vacated a death sentence because of the possibility that the trial court’s instruction coupled with the verdict slip could have been understood by the jury to mean that the jury was required to find mitigating circumstances unanimously in order for them to be weighed against aggravating circumstances. This is clearly not the case here.</p>

    <blockquote id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[259,397,1111,362]]]'>The Sentencing Code provides that the verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances, or if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.

In fact, the jury instructions tracked the language in the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(1), which never mentions or infers that any given mitigating circumstance must be unanimously recognized before it can be weighed against aggravating circumstances in reaching a verdict. Additionally, the portion of the verdict slip where the jury is to list mitigating circumstances is set apart from sections A and B of the verdict slip which do require a finding of unanimity. For this reason, the trial court’s jury instructions and verdict slip were proper under <em>Mills</em>

Two years passed from Steven Brown’s murder before investigators were able to uncover enough evidence to bring appellant to trial for the Gambrell killing. On November 9, 1983, the police interviewed Dennis Cook about Raymond Gambrell's murder. Cook inculpated appellant. Cook subsequently testified at a preliminary hearing in which he again implicated appellant. Nevertheless, when trial began on May 24, 1984, defense counsel produced a signed affidavit from Cook in which he recanted his prior testimony. The Commonwealth then petitioned the court to allow Cook's preliminary hearing testimony to be used as substantive evidence. The trial court denied the Commonwealth's motion but certified the issue for interlocutory appeal to this Court and stayed the trial. On October 5, 1987, we reversed the trial court’s order and allowed Cook's preliminary hearing testimony to be used as substantive evidence. No. 63 E.D. Miscellaneous Docket 1985, filed October 5, 1987.</p>

Appellant asserts for the first time that the Commonwealth did not provide the defense with any reports, expert opinions, or any indication that the .357 caliber Smith and Wesson or the .357 Magnum Colt revolver wquld be used against appellant at trial, notwithstanding the fact that he filed an Omnibus Discovery Motion. When he was arrested, however, appellant had in his possession the aforementioned weapons and therefore knew that these weapons could be introduced at trial. Consequently, the Commonwealth’s alleged failure to disclose this information would not have prevented appellant from obtaining independent expert testimony and did not, as appellant claims, prejudice him in this regard. Furthermore, appellant’s failure to so advise the trial court thwarted any possible measures the court could have fashioned to remedy the situation. See .Pa.R.Crim.P. 305E.</p>

Contrary to appellant’s claim, the admission of the prior death sentence was proper because we have interpreted 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9) as allowing consideration of essential and necessary facts pertaining to the prior convictions, including the circumstances of the crimes and the sentences imposed. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant's contention that the trial court charged the jury as to all of the possible aggravating circumstances is not borne out by the record. Another claim of error that is meritless is that the trial court erred in refusing to repeat the charge as to reasonable doubt during the penalty phase. There is no obligation to repeat the definition of reasonable doubt because it was correctly defined in the guilt phase. <em>Commonwealth v.
