    <p id="b728-12" data-blocks='[["BL_728.12",728,[223,1487,1149,422]]]'>On May 4, 1988, Robert and Lillian Baylor filed a quiet title action with respect to a parcel of land upon which a garden, hedges and a garage were located. The Baylors claim title to this parcel of land by adverse possession. Mrs. Soska, appellant herein, asserts that the adverse possession claim is defective and that the land in question belongs to her. She requests, by way of counterclaim, that the Baylors’ garage be removed from this parcel of land.</p>
    <p id="b728-13" data-blocks='[["BL_728.13",728,[220,1936,1149,422]],["BL_729.1",729,[226,284,1149,148]]]'>The evidence indicates that Mary Hanecak, Baylors’ predecessor in title, purchased the land in 1942. When Mrs. Hanecak purchased the property, it included a house and a garage. Approximately ten years later, Mrs. Hanecak’s husband built an addition to the garage. This addition is located on the disputed parcel of land. Mrs. Hanecak claims that from the time she and her husband moved onto the property, they maintained the disputed parcel and planted hedges and a <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>garden on it. In 1973, the Baylors purchased the property from Mrs. Hanecak and tore down the addition to the garage, replacing it with a framed enclosure.</p>
    <p id="b729-4" data-blocks='[["BL_729.5",729,[226,454,1149,407]]]'>The trial court initially denied the Baylors’ quiet title action on the grounds that they had not themselves possessed title for the required twenty-one years; that their claim could prevail only by tacking Mrs. Hanecak’s period of adverse possession onto their own; and that tacking was not available because Mrs. Hanecak did not purport to convey the disputed property to the Baylors. The trial court ordered the Baylors to remove their structure from Mrs. Soska’s land.</p>
    <p id="b729-5" data-blocks='[["BL_729.6",729,[225,890,1152,360]]]'>Upon the filing of exceptions, the trial court reversed itself and awarded title to a strip of land 165 feet long and 22 feet wide to the Baylors on an adverse possession theory. This award did not encompass the entire parcel claimed by the Baylors, but it did include the land on which the garage was located and an additional strip of land which would allow access to the garage.</p>
    <p id="b729-6" data-blocks='[["BL_729.7",729,[227,1273,1152,626]],["BL_730.1",730,[242,263,1150,96]]]'>The court based its decision on 21 P.S. § 3, which requires that any conveyance of real property necessarily includes the conveyance of appurtenances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The court found that the addition to the garage was attached and became appurtenant to the original garage at least twenty-one years prior to the initiation of the lawsuit. The court also found that Mrs. Hanecak intended to convey the appurtenances. Accordingly, the court awarded the land on which the garage was situated plus a five foot extension to the Baylors. In sum, the court determined that the Baylors were entitled to the tacking of Mrs. Hanecak’s period of adverse possession to that of their own by virtue of the fact that Mrs. Hanecak’s possession was <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>adverse and the garage was an appurtenance which was intended to be conveyed.'</p>
    <p id="b730-5" data-blocks='[["BL_730.5",730,[240,385,1151,956]]]'>On appeal, a majority Superior Court affirmed. The court agreed with the trial court that 21 P.S. § 3 required that the deed be interpreted to include all appurtenances, including the garage. Judge Wieand, dissenting, argued that 21 P.S. § 3 did not operate in the fashion claimed by the majority and the trial court. According to Judge Wieand, all of the appurtenances “belonging to the land conveyed” are conveyed under 21 P.S. § 3, but this statute was not intended to include in a deed of conveyance a greater area than that described in the grantor’s deed. Judge Wieand also noted that the majority’s decision is in conflict with a series of prior Superior Court decisions. See <em>Wolfe v.

In the present case, the Baylors purchased the land in question in 1973 and brought this action in 1988. That is an insufficient period of time to acquire the land by adverse possession. However, under certain circumstances, the periods of possession of prior owners may be added on to the period of possession of the present owners. Superior Court in <em>Castronuovo v.

    <p id="b732-6" data-blocks='[["BL_732.5",732,[230,1098,1151,201]]]'>(Emphasis added.) Superior Court, in sum, has held that whenever a grantor seeks to convey an inchoate claim of adverse possession, what is required is a reference to the disputed tract or to the grantor’s inchoate right.</p>
    <p id="b732-7" data-blocks='[["BL_732.6",732,[226,1319,1152,895]]]'>There is good reason for this requirement. Interested parties have a right to discern from the record the state of the title of any parcel of land. If tacking were to be permitted because of vague, undefined “circumstances,” there could and most likely would be no way for one not a party to the conveyance to know this. But the law mandates that a person asserting a claim of adverse possession make this assertion openly and notoriously to all the world. There must be no secret that the adverse possessor is asserting a claim to the land in question. <em>Tioga Coal Co. v. Supermarkets Gen.

If the adverse possessor’s claim is to be passed on to a successor in title, therefore, there must be some objective indicia of record by which it can be discerned with some degree of certainty that a claim of title by adverse possession is being made and that the duration of this claim has been passed on to a successor in title.</p>

First, nothing of record need appear concerning the successor’s adverse possession claim. It is only the predecessor’s claim which the successor seeks to tack that is at issue. Second, public policy requires that when an interest in land is conveyed to another, the interest of the successor in title be described as nearly as possible, withholding nothing which could and should at that time be made visible.
