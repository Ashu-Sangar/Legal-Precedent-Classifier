If we determine that appellant was not a “person responsible for the child’s welfare,” we must reinstate the trial court’s order dismissing the criminal charges. We hold that appellant can in fact be described as a “person responsible for the child’s welfare” within the context of 42 Pa.C.S. § 5554(3). The events at issue occurred on or about May 1,1984, through December of 1987. During this period, appellant provided baby-sitting services for the two minor children (the victim and her sister) of a friend, whom he had met through their <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>mutual participation in an Alcoholics Anonymous program. Appellant baby-sat for the children in his own home “sometimes once a week, sometimes less, sometimes more.” When appellant cared for the children, neither their mother nor any other adult was present. Occasionally, the children would remain overnight with appellant; sometimes, the mother stayed at appellant’s home with her children after appellant had watched them. However, on most of these occasions the children were alone with appellant. The children looked upon appellant as a Mend of the family, and he was not paid for watching them.</p>
    <p id="b411-5" data-blocks='[["BL_411.4",411,[226,898,1155,694]]]'>On September 21, 1992, appellant was charged with one count of Indecent Assault<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and one count of Corruption of Minors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The prosecution filed a Notification of Commonwealth’s Intention to Proceed Pursuant to the Tolling of Statute of Limitations Provisions under 42 Pa.C.S. § 5554(3). In its Notification, the Commonwealth acknowledged that the criminal complaint, dated on June 4, 1992, was filed after the statute of limitations had run. However, the Commonwealth contended that because the victim was under the age of 18,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and appellant was the paramour of the victim’s parent and/or the person responsible for the victim’s welfare when he watched her, the tolling provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 5554 would apply.</p>

On February 22, 1993, the trial court concluded that because appellant fulfilled none of the statutory criteria, the tolling provisions of Section 5554(3) did not apply and granted Appellant’s Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Statute of Limitations. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed and remanded for trial, reasoning that because Appellant was in fact a person responsible for the child’s welfare, Section 5554(3) tolled the statute of limitations. <em>Commonwealth v.

The mother of the victim testified that there was no romantic relationship between her and the defendant. She met him in 1983 and they became very good friends. She occasionally used other baby-sitters but during the time they were friends he would baby-sit the children once or twice a week without pay at his home.

The applicable cases stress that the [Appellant] exercises control over the victim and has the advantage of an authority figure that somehow deters the child from reporting the abuse. However, from the testimony of the mother, there wasn’t any kind of emotional pressure on the child not to report the incident in a timely fashion.

First, the legislative history surrounding the enactment of Section 5554(3) is silent. Thus, we are unable to conclude that the legislature’s motivation in adopting Section 5554(3) was to refrain from applying the statute of limitations only in those cases in which the perpetrator occupies a position such as would deter reportage of the abuse. On the contrary, in light of our legislature’s recent enactment of 42 Pa.C.S. § 5552(c)(3), which tolls the statute of limitations for any sexual offense committed against a minor under 18 years of age, regardless of the relationship between the victim and the vietimizer, we find it far more likely that Section 5554(3) was adopted with the intention of restricting application of the statute of limitations in any instance where the victim is too young or too innocent to realize the wrongful nature of the acts performed. We are <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>reluctant to deprive these victims of the protection Section 5554(3) provides.</p>

The majority, in essence, dismisses the emphasized language as dictum, but chooses to retain and follow the rest of the language, “persons under whose permanent or temporary control the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) have placed a child.” The rest of the ’ language, however, is also, strictly speaking, dictum, in that it was not absolutely necessary to the decision in <em>Bethlehem. </em>The defendant in <em>Bethlehem </em>was the uncle of the victim, visiting in the victim’s home with the victim’s parents. Not only was he not “in loco parentis” to the child, but the parents had not even “placed the child under his permanent or temporary control.”</p>

The majority neglects to note the citation, following the critical language in <em>Bethlehem, </em>to 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(b)., The rule of statutory construction found there states that, "[gjeneral words shall be construed to take their meanings <em>and be restricted by </em>preceding particular words.” (Emphasis added.) The court in <em>Bethlehem </em>thereby "explained” its use of the “in loco parentis” comparison by reference to the fact that "person responsible for the child's welfare” followed the particular word "parents.” It should be noted that not only does the word "parents” immediately precede the words "person responsible for the child's welfare,” the entire phrase appears as one clause which is then set off from the other types of persons identified, i.e., "any individual residing in the same home as the child” and "a paramour of the child’s parent.”</p>
