We reasoned that while the procedures within Section 4 are specifically applicable to <em>interest </em>arbitration, there is no such specific direction that they should apply to <em>grievance </em>arbitration. Furthermore, we noted that grievance arbitration procedures could deviate from Section 4 on such particulars as the number of arbitrators to be on the panel as “there is nothing unique about a tripartite arbitration panel [which is mandated by Section 4] that would make it more suitable for grievance arbitration than other forms of binding arbitration____” <em>Township of Moon, </em><a href="/pa/508/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="508 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="1794016" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0495-01">508 Pa. at 509</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="508 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="1794016" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0495-01">498 A.2d at 1312</a>.

        <em>Appeal of Upper Providence, </em><a href="/pa/514/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="514 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1804548" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0501-01">514 Pa. at 511</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="514 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1804548" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0501-01">526 A.2d at 320</a>. Thus, as the essence test is inconsistent with the appropriate scope of review, the UAA’s provisions dictate that it cannot apply. 42 Pa.C.S. § 7302(b).</p>
