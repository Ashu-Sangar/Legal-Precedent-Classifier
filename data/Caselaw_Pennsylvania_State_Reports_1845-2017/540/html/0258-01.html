On January 24, 1992, CYS informed the Cunninghams by letter that the agency would not approve them as adoptive parents due to their age and other factors. Mr. Cunningham was then 63 and Mrs. Cunningham 50. Another factor was the care needed by the Cunninghams’ adopted children Joshua and Tatiana, both nine years old at the time, biracial children who had been in the Cunninghams’ foster care prior to their CYS-approved adoption in July, 1991. The agency concluded that the age discrepancy between the Cunninghams and A.L.O. and N.A.W., coupled with the demands placed on the family by the recently adopted nine-year-olds, created a situation where the best interest of the children, A.L.O. and N.A.W., would be <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>better served if they were adopted by one of the many younger couples available and willing to adopt them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">1</a>

The trial court overruled CYS’s preliminary objections, certifying that an immediate appeal of the interlocutory order might materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter. The Superior Court accepted jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b) and reversed, sustaining the preliminary objections of CYS and dismissing the reports of intention to adopt.

Appellants cite several Superior Court cases in which parties other than parents were awarded custody, establishing that parties other than parents may have standing in custody and adoption matters. Appellants claim that the agency decision was based on impermissible age discrimination and was not in the best interest of the children. Appellants argue that the Superior Court erred in holding that they had no standing to initiate adoption proceedings without the consent of CYS inasmuch as the Supreme Court, in <em>Hess, <a href="/pa/530/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="530 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1833057" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0218-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/530/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="530 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1833057" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0218-01">530 Pa. 218</a>, <a href="/pa/530/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="530 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1833057" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0218-01">608 A.2d 10</a>, held that such consent is not essential and may be dispensed with if unreasonably withheld.

According to appellants, the polestar in adoption proceedings — the best interest of the children — cannot be pursued unless the court permits the participation of foster parents such as the Cunninghams who have demonstrated love and commitment in providing long-term care for the children.</p>

The Court repeatedly emphasized this fact. The entire analysis by the Supreme Court revolved around the relationship of the appellees to the children. Indeed, the Court relied upon specific statutory provisions exclusive to grandparents. For example, the Court noted that 23 Pa.C.S. § 2531(c) specifically envisions that grandparents might choose to adopt their grandchildren. The Court stated, “[T]he Act contemplates that a grandparent might choose to adopt his or her grandchild, and allows the grandparent to benefit from the relationship to the child by relieving the grandparent of the obligation to file a Report of Intention to Adopt.” <em>In re Adoption of Hess, <a href="/pa/530/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="530 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1833057" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0218-01">id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/530/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="530 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1833057" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0218-01">530 Pa. at 224</a>, <a href="/pa/530/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="530 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1833057" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0218-01">608 A.2d at 13</a>.

Thus it is that a child welfare agency may consent to adoption by foster parents in one instance but not in another. Foster parents are merely one example of the many categories of potential adopting parents, people who have established positive relationships and played beneficial roles in the lives of foster children. Such categories include: foster parents, school teachers, distant relatives, clergy, music instructors, babysitters, doctors, nurses, parents of playmates, therapists, athletic coaches, counselors, and Scout leaders, to name a few. Every person who plays a beneficial role in a foster child’s life, however, does not have standing in an adoption, under the legislative plan. Adoption proceedings involve many people, agencies, officers, and officials who implement the many safeguards provided to insure the welfare of the children. Trying to predict what is in a child’s best interest seems well-nigh impossible in some cases, but the schema to be employed is in the hands of the legislature. The statutory mandate requires agency consent, and, without it, foster parents do not have standing. The Superior Court was correct in so holding.</p>

The children involved here possess special needs. Both were born cocaine addicted, with the myriad problems attendant upon that condition, and with respiratory diseases which, in the case of one child have required emergency hospital care, and for the first year of his life, almost constant attention. If these children are, as the agency suggests, no different than any other normal foster children, that normalcy is in large measure due to the nurturance they have received from appellants during the last few years. Appellants should not be foreclosed from the opportunity to demonstrate to the court their continued worthiness and suitability to care for these children.

According to these provisions, “[a]ny individual may become an adopting parent.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 2312. Under Section 2531, a potential adoptive parent must file a “Report of Intent to Adopt” to the court in which the petition for adoption will be filed. This Section provides that, “[ejvery person ... receiving or retaining custody or physical care of any child for the purpose or with the intention of adopting a child” shall file a “Report of Intent to Adopt.” The synthesis of these two Sections is that “any person” who has “received or retained ... physical care ... with the intention of adopting a child under the age of 18” may file a Report of Intent to Adopt before the court.

Here, because approval was not forthcoming, the issue became whether foster parents have standing to adopt their foster children when the agency withholds its consent.

Usually, standing is a requirement that parties have sufficient interest or injury in a lawsuit to ensure that there is a legitimate controversy before the court. <em>See </em>59 Am.Jur.2d § 30 <em>Parties </em>(1987). Here the Opinion in Support of Affir-mance is not using the concept of standing in its generally accepted sense. Rather, it is being used as a policy tool to prevent foster parents from adopting their children absent the consent of the agency on a <em>per se </em>basis. In effect, foster parents’ legal status, and thus their ability to appear before the court, is being determined not by the nature of their relationship to the controversy, but by another party <em>to </em>the controversy.

The rule established by the Opinion in Support of Affirmance violates these well established principles, as courts will be unable to review a whole class of potential adoptions. Instead, these potential adoptions will be placed entirely within the discretion of family service agencies. For example, foster parents who obtain the consent of the agency can file a “Report of Intent to Adopt” and gain review of the court to complete the adoption. However, those who fail to obtain the consent of the agency can go no further as they have no “standing.” This scheme is contrary to both the letter and spirit of the Act. Our law clearly places the responsibility with the court to make the final determination of what is in the best interests of the child. Nowhere does it grant family service agencies an unreviewable power to determine who can and cannot adopt a child in this Commonwealth. The Opinion in Support of Affirmance erroneously gives these agencies absolute and unreviewable discretion in situations such as the one presented here. However, foster parents should be able to appeal the agency’s decision to the court for a determination of whether adoption would be in the best interests of the child. It can be anticipated that in most cases, the court would defer to the considerable expertise of the agency and affirm its decision to withhold consent. However, such a scheme would insure that the courts, not social service agencies, make the final decision as to whether adoption is in the best interests of the child in any given case. This is mandated by the plain language of the Act.</p>

Instead it is a case of extending limited procedural protections to foster parents in order to <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>prevent abuses of discretion by family service agencies. Our law has recognized limited procedural protections for foster parents in other contexts. For example, the Pennsylvania Code of Regulations allows foster parents to call for a hearing before a foster child is removed from their home. <em>See </em>55 Pa.Code 3700.3. Foster parents should also be given the limited procedural protection of filing a “Report of Intent to Adopt” in order to prevent arbitrary actions by family service agencies.</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[240,839,1152,320]]]'>This conclusion comports with the ohly disinterested voice to be heard in the present controversy. The guardian ad litem, who is concerned only with protecting the interests of the children, strongly urges that the foster parents be given the opportunity to present their case. As the Superior Court dissent notes,</p>
    <blockquote id="b565-5" data-blocks='[["BL_565.6",565,[281,1196,1110,315]]]'>[T]he grant of standing does nothing more than allow an interested party to be heard in court; it surely does not amount to an award of custody nor does it change at all the standards by which the court decides the issue. Indeed, the “best interests” of the child remain the paramount concern in these matters.</blockquote>

There is no intention to cast aspersions on the very valuable work of such agencies; however, they too may err. It is thus for the court to decide where the best interests of the child lie. By refusing parents any forum in which to demonstrate their position, error goes uncorrected, sometimes with devastating results.</p>
