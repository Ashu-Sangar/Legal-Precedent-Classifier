More specifically, may an employee recover both workers’ compensation benefits from her employer as well as damages at common law from her co-employee under the MVFRL, when injured in an automobile accident during the course and scope of his employment? For the reasons that follow, we hold that passage of the MVFRL did not express such a legislative intent, and that an employee may not recover damages at common law from her co-employee.</p>

(MVFRL). That exercise is not required in this case. The cases involving the interaction between § 481 of the Act and §§ 1719, 1720 and 1735 of the MVFRL are not analogous to the facts of this case.</p>
    <p id="b406-9" data-blocks='[["BL_406.9",406,[211,1916,1149,314]],["BL_407.1",407,[226,287,1150,152]]]'>It must first be noted that §§ 1719, 1720 and 1735 of the MVFRL do not determine <em>liability; </em>rather, they pertain to subrogation, coverage, and the coordination of benefits among the liable parties. Thus; whether one party is liable to another must first be determined by looking to other relevant law. In this case, it is § 72 of the Act, which provides a type <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>of “immunity” for co-employees. Since that law provides that Appellee cannot be held liable in this case, §§ 1719, 1720 and 1735 of the MVFRL are not implicated.</p>
    <p id="b407-5" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[227,468,1151,374]]]'>This conclusion is further borne out by scrutinizing the cases cited by the Majority which have examined the interplay between § 481 of the Act and the MVFRL. These cases involve a fundamentally different issue than that in question here. Section 481 of the Act refers to the exclusivity of the <em>employer’s </em>liability, and recognizes that the employer has in fact already assumed liability:</p>
    <blockquote id="b407-6" data-blocks='[["BL_407.5",407,[270,861,1107,153]]]'>The liability of an employer under this Act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employees ...</blockquote>

Thus, the employer has already assumed liability and the purpose of § 481 is to limit the amount of damages the employee can receive. In the cases discussed by the Majority, the respective plaintiffs obtained Workers’ Compensation benefits from their employer (who therefore has conceded liability), but were also trying to obtain insurance benefits under their <em>employer’s </em>policy of motor vehicle insurance. Clearly, the exclusivity of remedies provision, § 481, is implicated in those scenarios, since the employer has conceded liability, and thus the question remains: to what damages is the employee entitled?</p>
    <p id="b407-8" data-blocks='[["BL_407.7",407,[226,1650,1151,690]],["BL_408.1",408,[228,280,1152,207]]]'>That is quite different from the instant case. Although Appellant has received Workers’ Compensation benefits from her employer, she is also trying to hold her co-employee liable&gt; and receive benefits under her co-employee’s personal policy of insurance. I believe this is a significant difference, and as noted above find that the Act answers the question without regard to what the MVFRL provides. In this case, there is simply no liability on the part of the co-employee in the first instance; the question of what <em>damages </em>Appellant may be entitled to under the MVFRL from the co-employee is therefore irrelevant. The legislature has made it clear that co-employees are not liable to one another, 77 P.S. § 72, and I do not believe that because the employee is covered by motor <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>vehicle insurance the analysis is altered.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Simply put, the JVTVFRL does not alter the Workers’ Compensation Act’s scheme for determining liability.
