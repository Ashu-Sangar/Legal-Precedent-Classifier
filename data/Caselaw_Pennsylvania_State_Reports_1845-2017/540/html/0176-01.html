I agree with the majority that a public employer may establish criteria for employment for particular positions that exceed the minimum certification requirements that might be otherwise established by law, and that these criteria would be the “requisite qualifications” under which the Veteran’s Preference Act, 51 Pa.C.S. § 7104(a), is to be applied. To be meaningful, however, it is necessary that such criteria be clearly spelled out in advance of the selection process, and not merely be subjective conclusions, formed ad hoc dining or after the selection process, based on the relative credentials of the actual applicants.

The sole issue in this case is whether the Veterans’ Preference Act at 51 Pa.C.S. § 7104(a) (the “Act”) mandates that a veteran seeking a teaching position with a school district meet the skill and expertise requirements established by that individual school district or, in the alternative, whether such veteran must merely meet the more general skill and expertise requirements established by statute. In holding that the veteran-applicant must satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth by an individual school district, the majority infuses the Act with standards not contemplated by the General Assembly, thereby leaving Pennsylvania veterans with an illusory preference benefit.</p>

However, the majority ignores the statutory provision directly following Section 7104 which provides that “the lack of academic or scholastic training or experience ... shall not be deemed to disqualify [any veteran from the benefits of the Act], provided he possesses the other requisite qualifica-tions____” 51 Pa.C.S. § 7105. This succeeding provision <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>makes it clear that a veteran’s qualifications are not to be considered relative to any <em>ad hoc </em>standards established by a potential public employer, but only relative to that which makes him qualified to perform the duties of the position in question. In short, by supplementing Section 7104 with Section 7105, it is evident that the General Assembly sought to ensure a veteran’s hiring preference even when that veteran possesses only the minimum criteria required by statute for the job.</p>

This Court held that a veterans’ preference statute is constitutional since there exists a rational relationship between the basis of the preference (status as a veteran) and the object to be obtained (preferring veterans for public-duty employment). <em><a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20701" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="3 A.2d 701">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/333/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="333 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1187944" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0568-01">333 Pa. at 573-574</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20701" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="3 A.2d 701">3 A.2d at 704</a>.

The General Assembly did not, within this statutory provision, define what qualifications are “requisite.” But in the Public School Code of 1949 at 24 P.S. §§ 11-1109,12-1201, the General Assembly defined the qualifications: a person is qualified to teach in the public schools of the Commonwealth if that person holds a valid teaching certificate accepted by the Commonwealth, is over 18 years of age, is a U.S. citizen, and is morally fit for the position. Pursuant to the majority’s analysis, each potential public employer is now granted the discretionary authority to define the level of “requisite qualifications” a veteran must possess to trigger the preference. Vested with this discretionary authority, public employers may define “requisite qualifications” by reference to the minimum statutory qualifications or by reference to its own skill and expertise requirements. In so doing, public employers are thereby empowered to redefine one of the basic premises on which the Act rests in that individual employers may now decide for themselves, without reference to the legislature’s mandate, the essential scope and application of the Act. In short, the majority opinion vests public employers with the power to make a basic policy choice in violation of the general prohibition against such delegation of authority.

My research also indicates a potential due process problem with the majority’s analysis of the Act.

Here, as stated, the majority’s analysis of the Act now confers on each public employer the discretionary authority to define the level of “requisite qualifications” a veteran must possess to trigger the preference. To the extent the statutory phrase "requisite qualifications” then takes on hundreds or even thousands of different meanings (in accordance with the number of public employers), the statute may be rendered unconstitutionally vague in that veterans seeking to capitalize on the statutorily-granted preference must necessarily guess at the meaning of the phrase "requisite qualifications." Under the majority’s analysis, the grant or denial of the preference, a constitutionally protected property right, is made without regard to the protections against the arbitrary exercise of governmental power afforded by our basic concepts of due process.</p>
