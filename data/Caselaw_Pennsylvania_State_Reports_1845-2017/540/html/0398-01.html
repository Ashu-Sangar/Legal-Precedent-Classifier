    <p id="b692-9" data-blocks='[["BL_692.10",692,[213,928,1157,1340]]]'>This case concerns whether private citizens may obtain an order under the Pennsylvania Storage Tank and Spill Prevention Act (STSPA)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> directing storage tank owners to make payments to them for anticipated oil contamination cleanup costs and diminution in the value of property, and whether private citizens are entitled to use the statutory presumptions provided in the STSPA. Because we find that a private citizen may avail himself of the remedies conferred on the Department of Environmental Resources, payments for anticipated costs and property value diminution are available. Additionally, private citizens may take advantage of the statutory presumptions set out in the STSPA. Accordingly, we affirm the holding of the Superior Court. The facts of this appeal are uncomplicated. Appellees, the Centolanzas, own an automotive repair center located on one and one-half acres in Whitehall Township, Lehigh County. Appellant, Lehigh Valley Dairies, Inc. (LVD), owns and operates a dairy processing plant directly upgradient from the Centolanzas’ property. Appellant, Atlantic Processing, Inc. (API), was the former owner of this plant. In April, 1984, API sold a portion of its facility to Beatrice Cheese, Inc. (BCI). Later, API sold the remainder to LVD. An 8,000 gallon underground storage tank containing No. 6 fuel oil is located on the BCI property and four 10,000 gallon underground storage tanks containing No. 6 fuel oil are located on the LVD property.</p>

(Plaintiffs’ Second Amendment to Complaint, filed Nov. 22, 1989.) Both the claim under the Hazardous Sites Clean-up Act and the strict liability claim were withdrawn. Moreover, the trial court correctly noted that the claims for inconvenience, loss of use and enjoyment, and diminution of value of their property are claims for damages and not causes of action. LVD and API moved for summary judgment as to the Centolanzas’ claim under the Storage Tank and Spill Prevention Act. On September 28, 1992, the Honorable Thomas A. Wallitsch of the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County granted Appellants’ motion.</p>
