The disturbance, a loud voice shouting, seemed to emanate from the rear of a home. Upon investigating, the officer observed Biagini stagger out of the alley between the houses, look up and down the street, and stagger back into the alley. The officer drove down the alley and encountered <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>Biagini in the rear yard of his house with an unidentified female. The officer inquired of Biagini as to the disturbance. Biagini initially responded, in a loud voice, that there was no problem and then pointed at two other individuals across the alley. The officer told Biagini to remain where he was and went to investigate the other individuals. Biagini, however, left the yard and went into his home. The other individuals told Officer Snyder that Biagini had been screaming at them from his back yard and threw an object at them which they thought, from the sounds of the impact, to be a glass bottle.

Biagini refused and in vulgar terms ordered the officer off his porch. The officer then told Biagini he was under arrest for public intoxication and disorderly conduct.

The officer observed two black males standing under a ledge. It was a dark night and it was raining hard. As Officer Ashby exited the vehicle, the two men began to run. The officer yelled “stop police” and gave chase. Officer Ashby testified that Barry W. threw an object to the other male that the Officer believed to be drugs. The officer was unable to describe the object, none of the other officers observed anything being thrown, and although both males were immediately apprehended, no drugs or other contraband were discovered.</p>

This syllogism, although facially appealing, is fatally flawed.

Upon review of the well-reasoned opinions of the Superior Court in both cases, we accept the legal conclusion that no probable cause existed for either arrest.

The determination that a police officer placed an individual under arrest without probable cause is a legal determination; it is an issue to be resolved in a courtroom, not on a street corner. Within a civilized society rules exist to resolve disputes in an orderly and peaceful manner. Physical resistance to a police officer is not only counter-productive to the orderly resolution of controversy, but it is also specifically prohibited by statute. 18 Pa.C.S. § 505(b)(l)(i). (The use of force is not justifiable to resist an arrest which the actor knows is being made by a peace officer, although the arrest is unlawful). Therefore, defendants’ secondary premise, that an unlawful arrest justifies physical resistance, is invalid.</p>

He is justified in the use of any force which he believes to be necessary to defend himself or another from bodily harm while making the arrest. However, he is justified in using deadly force only when he believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury to himself or such other person, or when he believes both that:</p>

The facts are not in dispute that the defendant was preventing a public servant (the police officer) from discharging a duty — the investigation of a public disturbance. The definition of resisting arrest is clear and unambiguous. Under the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5104, resisting arrest is defined as:</p>

    <p id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[233,420,1153,477]]]'>The majority ignores the element of preventing the discharge of any other duty (i.e., the investigation of a public disturbance) and concentrates on the element of lawful arrest. That is not the issue in this case. The issue is whether the defendants were resisting arrest by interfering in the police officer’s investigation of the public disturbance and not resisting a <em>lawful </em>arrest. If so, they are guilty of violating Section 5104. That’s how the statute is written and that’s how we should apply it.</p>
