Even if Appellant had established that the murder weapon had come into Kelly’s possession three to four weeks after the murders, the Commonwealth presented overwhelming evidence that the murder weapon had been in Appellant’s hands at the time of the killings. At trial, Appellant admitted that he had used the murder weapon in the robbery of the Good Scents Shop just two days prior to the killings. On the afternoon of the killings, the murder weapon was again employed in a robbery at the home of Richard Kirkpatrick. Later that evening, Appellant sold jewelry which was identified as having been taken from the Kirkpatrick home. On the afternoon of the killings, Appellant with a gun in his waistband arrived at the office of Commonwealth witness Joseph LaMotte and stated that he had just killed three people. In the days following the killings, Appellant told <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>witness Anthony Miller that he had killed people with a PPK. In addition, Appellant threatened to “blow Miller away” with the same gun. In light of this evidence, Dwyer’s statement was not material because it would not have created a reasonable doubt as to Appellant’s guilt. Thus, the prosecution’s failure to reveal the statement does not constitute a violation of due process, and does not provide a basis for relief.</p>

The source of this alleged bias was pending criminal charges against Dwyer and Kelly, and the preferential treatment Dwyer allegedly received while incarcerated. This claim does not satisfy the strict requirements of the PCRA. Thus, it fails to provide a basis for relief.</p>

In the instant case, Dwyer and Kelly testified that prior to the murders at the Gross estate, the gun used to commit them was already in Appellant’s hands. This fact, however, had been established by the Commonwealth through evidence indicating that the bullets and shell casings found at the Gross estate matched the bullets and shell casings from the gun used in the robbery of the Good Scents Shop two days before the murders. Consequently, the prosecution’s case would not have been affected even if Dwyer and Kelly were totally discredited. As a result, the prosecution’s failure to reveal information that may have established the bias of these witnesses cannot be said to have “so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place”. <em><a href="/pa/529/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="529 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1831155" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0218-01">Id.</a> </em>This claim, therefore, fails.</p>

Dwyer signed an affidavit on April 4, 1992, in which he stated that he had testified falsely at Appellant’s trial in return for benefits promised by the Commonwealth. At the PCRA hearing on June 2, 1992, however, Dwyer refused to confirm any of the information contained in the affidavit and instead invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Appellant then requested that the Commonwealth grant Dwyer immunity. The Commonwealth refused. Appellant requested that the trial court order that immunity be granted. This request was also refused. Appellant now asserts that Dwyer’s affidavit alone entitles him to relief or, in the alternative, that the trial court erred by permitting Dwyer to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege and by failing to order that Dwyer be granted immunity.</p>

As previously noted, Dwyer was not a key witness in the Commonwealth’s case. Rather, the sole purpose of his testimony was to corroborate the overwhelming circumstantial evidence presented which established Appellant’s guilt.

Like the defendant in <em>Yarris, </em>Appellant suffers from a borderline personality disorder, an extremely complex condition which substantially inhibits his ability to conform his behavior to the law. (N.T., 6/24-25/92 at 60-61). An examination of Appellant’s psychiatric records reveals damaging comments such as, “... gives no evidence of truly wishing to rid himself of drug abuse ... psychopathic (sociopathic) personality ... severe obnoxious narcissistic personality ...” and “serious potential for increasingly dangerous acting out on his part.” In light of these comments, we find it unlikely that but for the admission of this evidence the outcome of Appellant’s sentencing hearing would have been different.

If an accused person does not receive effective assistance of counsel, that is not a technicality, it is a violation of a fundamental constitutional right; insuring that a conviction is not a product of ineffective assistance is more than an exercise in determining whether there is a “technical” violation, it is an exercise in determining whether there has been a constitutional violation.</p>

The Majority does not explain <em>why </em>the <em>adjudication </em>of guilt is reliable if the outcome would have been different. Does not the conclusion that the defendant could have been found “not guilty” render the adjudication of guilt unreliable? The Majority appears to equate the “no reliable adjudication of guilt” standard of the PCRA to either a sufficiency of the evidence analysis or a harmless error analysis. The Majority’s application of either analysis is, to my mind, incorrect.</p>

It is <em>not </em>used to determine whether an error in the trial harmed the defendant such that a new trial is warranted. Similarly, the PCRA “no reliable adjudication of guilt” standard cannot be the same as a “harmless error” standard. An error is determined to be harmless when (1) the error did not prejudice the defendant or the prejudice was de minimis; or (2) the erroneously admitted evidence was merely cumulative of other, untainted evidence which was substantially similar to the erroneously admitted evidence; or (3) the properly admitted and uncontradicted evidence of guilt was so overwhelming and the prejudicial effect of the error was so insignificant by comparison that the error could not have contributed to the verdict. <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/524/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="524 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1822770" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0404-01">524 Pa. 404</a>, <a href="/pa/524/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="573 A.2d 536" data-case-ids="1822770,1822814" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0404-01,/pa/524/0403-01">573 A.2d 536</a> (1990).

However, our system of justice requires that there be articula-ble standards for determining guilt and for determining when a trial comports with due process and other constitutional guarantees. Guilt is determined by the Commonwealth proving beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of the crime charged, in a trial that is deemed to comply with the requisite constitutional guarantees, not by the defendant proving his innocence. Due process, and the Sixth Amendment, mandate that a defendant must be afforded effective counsel. Accordingly, if the conviction passes a sufficiency of the evidence test, but the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel <em>became </em>he was prejudiced by counsel’s stewardship, how can we then say that Appellant has no recourse because we believe he was not innocent? What is the articulable standard for determining when someone is not innocent after applying a sufficiency of the evidence test <em>and </em>the <em>Pierce/Strickland </em>test?</p>

The effective result of the Majority’s holding is that if you have <em>very </em>bad counsel, <em>ie., </em>counsel that neglects to raise a meritorious issue at trial or in post-trial <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>motions or on direct appeal, you have no recourse. Thus, the defendant is being “punished” for the very error that left him with only the PCRA as an avenue of relief. That conclusion appears to me to unjust and arguably violative of due process. Once a system of appeal is instituted, that system must operate fairly for everyone. To conclude that a defendant, making what is essentially a <em>collateral attack </em>on direct appeal,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> can obtain relief but another defendant who has the unfortunate luck of having ineffective counsel at trial and on direct appeal has no recourse, creates a bizarre system.</p>

Contrary to my colleagues, I would hold that the verbiage set forth in § 9543(a)(2)(h) is by constitutional mandate and logical application, nothing more than a recitation of the <em>Pierce </em>standard of prejudice. To do otherwise leads to the absurd result, as evidenced by the case <em>sub judice </em>where the defendant suffered a conviction while receiving the services of ineffective counsel, whose ineffectiveness admittedly prejudiced the defendant to a point where the “outcome of the trial (the verdict) would have been different,” yet the defendant is offered no recourse because he has failed to show that the prejudice relates to the “truth-determining process,” whatever that may be. To me, the truth-determining process is obliterated in an instance where an accused suffered ineffectiveness of counsel which so prejudiced him so as to lead to a conclusion that the verdict would have been different.
