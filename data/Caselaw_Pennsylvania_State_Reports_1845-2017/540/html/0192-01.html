Thus, the evidence tended to negate the prosecutor’s claim that Ake was a danger to society at large.

During closing arguments at the penalty phase, the prosecution argued that in fixing Simmons’ punishment, the jury should consider his future dangerousness. Simmons’ counsel sought to rebut the prosecution’s future dangerousness contention by presenting evidence that, due to Simmons’ particular psychological problems, he was dangerous only to elderly women who would not be found in a prison setting. Counsel asked the court to instruct the jury that, under South Carolina law, a sentence of life imprisonment did not carry any possibility of parole. The trial court refused to grant the requested instruction and Simmons was sentenced to death.</p>

With regard to <em>Potts, </em>one must keep in mind that an element of counsel’s decision to present any evidence is its probable impact on the jury.

The prosecution emphasized these points in its closing argument during the penalty phase in which it asked the jury to impose a sentence of death. The majority conceded that trial counsel should have objected, but declined to find counsel ineffective because it concluded that Appellant was not prejudiced by counsel’s failure. <em>Commonwealth v.
