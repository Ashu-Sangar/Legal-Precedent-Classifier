The perpetrator entered the apartment by kicking in the basement door and breaking open the door leading from the basement to inside the apartment. Approximately $4,000.00 worth of items were taken from the Fry’s apartment including assorted Christmas gifts and Ms. Fry’s engagement and wedding rings. Appellant’s fingerprints matched the prints lifted from the scene. The Frys testified that they did not know appellant and never consented to his entry into their home.</p>

The perpetrator entered the apartment by breaking a window and forcibly entering a locked door. This time, approximately $3,000 worth of items were taken from the apartment. Fingerprints were again lifted, this time from the window, and again matched those of appellant. Ms. Fry testified that the windows were cleaned every month and that, <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>therefore, the fingerprints could not have existed from the break-in on December 20, 1989.</p>

While Mrs. Wall was home, her alarm sounded in her basement. After briefly investigating the alarm, she returned upstairs and saw appellant, a stranger to her, walking down her outside steps. Mrs. Wall called the police and reported appellant’s description and the direction in which he was walking. Approximately fifteen to twenty minutes later, police apprehended appellant. Mrs. Wall positively identified him as the intruder in her home. Appellant had not stolen anything owned by Mrs. Wall; however, he was found in possession of a knapsack that had been reported as stolen from yet another residence approximately four blocks away.</p>

When he returned, he discovered that his residence had been broken into and that items valued at approximately $1,175.00 had been stolen. Yet another fingerprint lifted from the point of entry matched appellant’s. Appellant was a stranger to Mr. Morris and had not been given permission at any time to enter Mr. Morris’ residence.</p>

The trial court further advised appellant that he could file a motion to withdraw his plea within ten days. Appellant additionally completed an extensive written nolo contendere plea colloquy. Finding that appellant understood the nature of the charges, the maximum sentences to which he was subject, and his post-plea rights, the trial court accepted appellant’s nolo contendere plea and deferred sentencing pending a pre-sentence report. Appellant’s trial counsel did not file a motion to withdraw his plea within ten days after the plea was entered.</p>

The trial court denied both motions.</p>

    <p id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[240,412,1153,1130]]]'>In this instant case, appellant completed (with the assistance of trial counsel) an extensive written nolo contende - re plea in which he acknowledged that he understood the “permissible range of sentences and/or fines that could be imposed for the offenses charged.” He further testified during the nolo contendere plea colloquy that he had discussed with counsel his written nolo contendere plea, that he read and understood each question, and that he was satisfied with trial counsel’s representation. (N.T., 10/29/91, p. 11). The record also reflects that during the nolo contendere plea colloquy that the trial court expressly informed appellant of the maximum sentences he could receive on each separate crime, including a sentence of 20 years maximum on a single count of burglary which is graded as a felony of the first degree. Appellant responded by stating that he understood the charges against him and the maximum sentences and fines for each crime, and that he was pleading guilty because the weight of the evidence was against him. (Id. at pp. 4-6, 10-11). These circumstances make it clear that appellant was fully aware of the possible sentences he risked on each offense to which he pleaded nolo contendere.</p>
    <p id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[241,1566,1149,476]]]'>Appellant admits that he was aware of the maximum sentence of each crime to which he could be subjected, however, he argues that such information was insufficient for his plea to be valid. Rather, he contends that for the colloquy to be valid, he must have been informed that each of the separate sentences could be imposed consecutively. In support of his position, appellant cites to <em>Commonwealth v. Persinger, </em><a href="/pa/532/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="532 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1835940" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0317-01">532 Pa. 317</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="532 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1835940" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0317-01">615 A.2d 1305</a> (1992).

Thus, while the defendant had been informed of the maximum sentence for each crime, he had not been informed of the total maximum sentence he risked if sentenced for all of the crimes together or consecutively. After accepting the defendant’s guilty plea, the trial court sentenced him to the maximum permissible amount on each count with the sentences to run consecutively, for a total term of imprisonment of seven and one-half to fifteen years. Thus, the defendant’s total sentence resulted in being far greater than the maximum he could obtain on the highest graded offense.</p>
    <p id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[232,934,1154,620]]]'>The issue before this Court was whether under such circumstances, the defendant demonstrated “prejudice on the order of manifest injustice” so as to justify a withdrawal of his guilty plea post-sentencing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Because defendant in <em>Persinger </em>had not been advised of the maximum total he could be sentenced to consecutively and, indeed, had been sentenced to the maximum total, this Court held that the defendant had demonstrated “prejudice on the order of manifest injustice,” and that, accordingly, he was entitled to withdraw his guilty plea. This Court further held that trial counsel’s failure to file a motion to withdraw the plea amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b434-6" data-blocks='[["BL_434.5",434,[230,1587,1152,415]]]'>Here, unlike <em>Persinger, </em>appellant was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment that exceeded his expectations of imprisonment so as to make his plea involuntary or unknowing. To the contrary, appellant was advised that on each count of burglary he risked a term of imprisonment of up to twenty years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> However, appellant’s <em>total </em>prison sentence failed to meet even the maximum permissible sentence for a <em>single </em>count of burglary.</p>

Unquestionably, under these circumstances where the aggregate sentence falls within the minimum and maximum sentence that can be imposed on a single count of the crimes charged, appellant was not prejudiced for not being informed of the maximum total sentence he risked by pleading <em>nolo contendere. </em>He was advised that he risked being sentenced up to twenty years on each of his burglary counts. Instead, he received only a <em>total </em>of six to twelve years incarceration. Accordingly, his trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to object to the plea colloquy.</p>
