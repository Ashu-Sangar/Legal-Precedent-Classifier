The trial court then polled the remaining jurors, asking each of them whether their sentence of death was based on the same criteria. It appears to be Appellant’s contention that since the jurors were not specifically polled on each mitigating circumstance presented but not checked on the verdict slip, an inference may be drawn that the jurors were impermissibly prohibited from considering all relevant mitigating factors.

This Court there held that although a proper jury instruction had been given by the trial judge, the incorrect verdict sheet together with the jury foreman’s response demanded that the matter be remanded for resentencing since it could not be determined whether the jury disregarded the proper instructions as a result of the improper verdict sheet.

Instead, he seems to simply be arguing that because the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee believed these issues to be worthy of concern, then <em>any </em>death penalty sentence imposed prior to the amendments in 1989 is not constitutionally sound. This argument is ludicrous. Section 9543(a)(2) of the PCRA clearly provides that in order to obtain post-conviction relief, a defendant is required to plead and prove that his conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the errors or defects enumerated in the Act. Clearly, Appellant has not met this burden. Moreover, as noted in footnote 6, <em>supra, </em>this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Tilley </em>noted that the adoption of . Rule 358A of the Rules of Criminal Procedure does not suggest the procedure employed prior thereto was constitutionally deficient. Finally, the fact that the Rules Committee may have determined that supplemental rules needed to be implemented, does not, alone, establish that the prior rules and procedures were unconstitutional. Accordingly, Appellant was properly denied post-conviction relief on this issue.</p>
