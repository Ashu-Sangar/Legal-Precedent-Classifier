While there, she asked appellant whether he knew who killed Sama. Appellant became upset, discontinued the sexual encounter, and stated that he killed Sama and that he would do the same to anyone else who tried to hurt him or “rip him off.” Before leaving the apartment he gave Worrell, as payment for her services, a quantity of cocaine.</p>
    <p id="b737-7" data-blocks='[["BL_737.7",737,[223,1091,1153,1017]]]'>Worrell testified that, at the time of this encounter with appellant, she had been a user of cocaine for approximately seven years. She was familiar with certain methods for determining whether cocaine was of good quality. Before using the cocaine provided by appellant, she tasted it and found that it had a strange taste unlike that of any cocaine she had ever used, causing her to conclude that “It was bad. It wasn’t cocaine.” After noticing the suspicious taste, she cooked the cocaine with a mixture of baking soda and water, a procedure intended to turn the cocaine into a hard substance. While cooking it, she noticed a reaction unlike any cocaine she had ever seen, namely, it “fizzed like an Alka-Seltzer” and emitted a very strong and bad odor, a medicinal smell that was “totally different” from cocaine. She stated that she never used this cocaine because she believed it was not real cocaine, or was tainted, and that it would cause her harm. She also testified that she encountered appellant a couple of days later and that, upon seeing her, he “look[ed] dead at me like he seen a ghost.”</p>

The facts of this case fall short, however, of establishing that appellant attempted to harm or kill Worrell. No scientific analysis of the cocaine was ever performed. The opinion given by Worrell that the cocaine would have harmed her was highly speculative in nature, inasmuch as Worrell had no expertise in scientific analysis and relied merely on her lay impressions as a cocaine user. Similarly, her perception that appellant looked at her like a “ghost” could be subject to many interpretations. It is purely speculative, too, that appellant knew that the cocaine was defective. Thus, whether appellant intended to harm Worrell is a matter of mere conjecture and not proper for admission as evidence of an actual attempt to eliminate Worrell as a witness.</p>

The evidence against appellant included the following.</p>
    <p id="b739-4" data-blocks='[["BL_739.5",739,[218,468,1152,648]]]'>Worrell testified that approximately two months before Sama’s murder she overheard an argument in which appellant told Sama, “I’m tired of your s — . I’m going to kill your ('----------a — .” Further, she testified that Sama was in debt to appellant for drugs, and that, after 1:30 a.m. on the night of the murder, approximately six hours before Sama’s body was discovered, she saw Sama enter a car that was being driven by appellant. This was in addition to the testimony, heretofore described, that during her prostitution session with appellant, appellant became upset at the mention of Sama and unequivocally stated that he killed Sama and that he would do the same to anyone else who tried to hurt him or “rip him off.”</p>
    <p id="b739-7" data-blocks='[["BL_739.6",739,[216,1158,1149,263]]]'>Sama’s mother testified that approximately five weeks before the murder, a man she believed to be appellant came to her home one night angrily inquiring whether Sama was there, and saying, “He owes me some money, and if I don’t get my money, he knows what will happen.”</p>
    <p id="b739-8" data-blocks='[["BL_739.7",739,[211,1462,1152,862]]]'>One of appellant’s close friends, A1 Tyczkowski, testified that appellant regarded him as a role model and mentor. Appellant admired Tyczkowski’s extensive criminal record. Around March of 1988, appellant asked for assistance in obtaining a gun. Tyczkowski declined the request. On several occasions thereafter, appellant told Tyczkowski that he “was having a problem with somebody” and asked, “What would be the best way to get rid of somebody?” In May, appellant showed Tyczkowski a .38 caliber revolver that he said had been purchased by his father at a certain gun store. Discussions of murder ensued, extending into July, and Tyczkowski advised that murder should be committed in an isolated location on a rainy night, so that physical evidence such as tire tracks and footprints would be washed away. Tyczkowski also recommended that murder not be committed in Millcreek Township.</p>
    <p id="b740-4" data-blocks='[["BL_740.4",740,[250,289,1150,257]]]'>
      <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>Tyczkowski testified that Sama had been in debt to appellant over many months for a sum of fifty dollars, and that appellant repeatedly mentioned the debt and was angry that it had not been paid. Tyczkowski described appellant as having a quick temper.</p>
    <p id="b740-5" data-blocks='[["BL_740.5",740,[249,569,1148,523]]]'>At 7:10 a.m. on August 28, 1988,- after a rainy night, appellant arrived unexpectedly at Tyczkowski’s house. Appearing tense, anxious, and nervous, he said, “Where can I get rid of this gun?” Tyczkowski replied, “How hot is it?” Appellant showed him the gun and said, “Remember Puggy [Sama]? Remember Puggy, Puggy is history ... Puggy ain’t no more.” Tyczkowski observed that the gun appeared to be the same one appellant had shown him in May. Tyczkowski disassembled the gun, and noticed that two of its five cartridges were spent.</p>
    <p id="b740-6" data-blocks='[["BL_740.6",740,[246,1114,1150,624]]]'>While Tyczkowski was dismantling the gun, appellant told him that Sama “became history” near a certain restaurant, a banquet hall in Erie. Appellant said that he drove Sama to a parking lot at the restaurant and demanded his fifty dollars. Sama replied that he didn’t have the money. Appellant insisted, “I want my f------money.” He ordered Sama to get out of the car and then shot him twice in or about the head. After relating this information to Tyczkowski, appellant left Tyczkowski’s house and took with him all of the pieces of the gun.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Tyczkowski had told appellant to throw the pieces into a lake. Four or five weeks later, appellant took Tyczkowski to view the crime scene.</p>
    <p id="b740-9" data-blocks='[["BL_740.7",740,[247,1770,1147,417]]]'>Anita Reason testified that she was appellant’s girlfriend in the spring of 1989, and that on April 2, 1989 appellant told her that he had killed Sama. She asked why he did it. He replied that Sama “beat him,” which she understood to mean not a physical beating but rather something related to a drug transaction. After reiterating that Sama “was history” and stating, “sometimes a man have to do what a man have to do,” appellant declined-to discuss the matter further.</p>
    <p id="b741-4" data-blocks='[["BL_741.4",741,[225,279,1148,319]]]'>
      <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>Beason also testified that, just before trial commenced, appellant called her from prison and asked her to perjure herself by denying that he had admitted committing the murder. Phone company records confirmed that a call originating in appellant’s prison cell block was made to Beason’s telephone on the day in question.</p>
    <p id="b741-5" data-blocks='[["BL_741.5",741,[225,628,1149,585]]]'>The manager of the store that sold appellant’s father a gun in May of 1988 testified that the gun was a .38 caliber revolver, and that the sale included a box of .38 caliber Smith and Wesson ammunition. A ballistics expert testified that the bullets removed from Sama’s body were .38 caliber Smith and Wessons that could well have been fired from that gun. Appellant’s father testified that appellant accompanied him when he purchased the gun, and that, shortly after he took the gun home and put it in a dresser drawer, the gun disappeared and was never seen again. Appellant had access to the room where the gun was kept.</p>
    <p id="b741-6" data-blocks='[["BL_741.6",741,[226,1243,1148,262]]]'>The evidence of appellant’s guilt was clearly overwhelming. Particularly in view of appellant’s confessions to Worrell, Tyczkowski, and Beason, it is inconceivable that the jury’s finding of guilt was affected by Worrell’s opinion that she had been supplied with tainted cocaine.</p>
    <p id="b741-7" data-blocks='[["BL_741.7",741,[227,1551,1148,575]]]'>Further, evidence of appellant’s involvement in the drug business permeated the trial, thus making Worrell’s reference to appellant’s possession of cocaine a matter of no consequence. For example, during cross-examination of Tyczkowski, defense counsel intentionally elicited the fact that, in 1989, appellant became a cocaine dealer. Beason’s testimony likewise mentioned appellant’s involvement with drugs, and, on cross-examination, defense counsel deliberately elicited the fact that drugs had been found in appellant’s house. The error in admitting evidence of the tainted cocaine was plainly harmless.</p>

The lieutenant provided a comprehensive review of all the rumors and leads that police pursued, and chronologically related the progress of the investigation to information received from various individuals, including Tyczkowski. Defense counsel’s opening statement had attacked the adequacy of the investigation, alleging that the police ignored facts and evidence and failed to adequately interview potential witnesses. In view of this challenge to the competency of the investigation, it was necessary for the prosecution to provide extensive testimony explaining the course of the investigation.</p>

Appellant's.brief specifically challenges admission of the lieutenant’s testimony, but only insofar as the statements of Tyczkowski are concerned. The brief contains, however, a cursory comment that the lieutenant also should not have testified to statements made to police by "other people.” Yet, appellant does not specify the other people to whom he refers. The record does not provide focus to this issue, since objections by the defense were lacking. Appellant asserts that when it became apparent that the trial court, despite objections by the defense, was going to allow the lieutenant to recount the statements of Tyczkow-ski, it was deemed pointless to make any further objections to this type of testimony.</p>

The record reveals, for example, that the lieutenant testified that Anita Beason told police that appellant was responsible for the murder. Beason had already testified at trial, however, that appellant admitted committing the crime. The lieutenant’s testimony pertained to the course of the investigation, and appellant was not prejudiced since there had been an opportunity to cross-examine Beason.</p>
