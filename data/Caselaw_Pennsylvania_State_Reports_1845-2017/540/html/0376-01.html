Antolik was appointed to the position of Chief Juvenile Probation Officer by order of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas. Erie County officials appealed from the order to the Commonwealth Court, asserting that the appointment violated an anti-nepotism provision of the Erie County Personnel Code. The Personnel Code prohibited any employee from supervising an immediate family member. The Director of Personnel of Erie County refused to reclassify Antolik to the appointed position based on the anti-nepotism policy because Antolik’s brother had been hired three months earlier to fill a position as a Juvenile Probation Officer. Although the brother’s immediate supervisor was not a member of the Antolik family, he did report in turn to the Chief Juvenile Probation Officer. Therefore, the appointment of Thomas Antolik to that position conflicted with the anti-nepotism policy.</p>

The separation of powers doctrine formed the basis for this holding. The origin of the separation of powers doctrine was not extensively addressed, but the independence of the judiciary was of foremost concern. Article V of the Pennsylvania Constitution bestows upon the judiciary certain inherent rights and powers to do what is reasonably necessary for the administration of justice. The judiciary’s authority to hire, fire, and supervise its personnel is derived from that constitutional source. It is a power that “may not ... be policed, encroached upon or diminished by another branch of government.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=501%20A.2d%20697" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="501 A.2d 697">Id.,</a> </em>93 Pa.Cmwlth. at 265, <a href="/citations/?q=501%20A.2d%20697" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="501 A.2d 697">501 A.2d at 701</a>, citing <em>Eshelman v.

This argument was emphatically rejected. The Commonwealth Court stated, “No such limiting test is warranted or applicable where the hiring, firing and supervision of court-appointed personnel is concerned, and any law which encroaches upon or affects this power must be struck down unless there exists constitutional authorization.” <em><a href="/pa/502/0430-02" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="466 A.2d 1029" data-case-ids="1784479,1784482,1784485" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0430-02,/pa/502/0430-01,/pa/502/0431-01">Id.,</a> </em>93 Pa.Cmwlth. at 262-63, <a href="/citations/?q=501%20A.2d%20697" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="501 A.2d 697">501 A.2d at 700</a>.

Erie County appealed from that order to the Commonwealth Court. Erie County asserted that the common pleas court’s entry of an ex parte order requiring payment of counsel fees without the filing of a pleading, discovery proceedings, and a hearing before an impartial tribunal was a violation of due process of law. The Commonwealth Court held that the central requirements of procedural due process, notice and fair opportunity to be heard, had been disregarded by the common pleas court’s order.
