The informant pointed out or “fingered” Appellant and then went to Appellant and spoke to him. On returning to the trooper’s vehicle, the informant told the trooper that they could make a drug purchase from Appellant (T.T., p. 9). Appellant and the woman drove off to another location, followed by the police vehicle. A back-up police vehicle apparently followed but was not further involved in the ensuing drug purchase (T.T., pp. 21-22). After dropping off the Appellant, the woman departed in her car. The trooper and the informant followed the Appellant on foot between two buildings where the trooper in the informant’s presence paid the Appellant for 7.4 grams of cocaine. The so-called informant was now clearly a witness to the crime as well. This transaction took place on May 11, 1990, but the Appellant was not arrested until December 10 of that year. Neither the officer nor any other police had any contact with the Appellant in the interim, although the officer said he saw Appellant in the area on several later occasions.</p>

Although the Appellant admitted that his mother lived in the vicinity of the crime, he could not recall whether he visited her on the particular evening of the crime or where he was at that time (T.T., pp. 51-52). He testified that he had never met the arresting officer but believed that he had been “set ... up in terms of giving a false name to the police---- I feel he made a mistake” (T.T., pp. 49-53, 78-82). In short, he denied participation in the crime.</p>

The witness then would either confirm or dispute the identification (T.T., pp. 94-96).

      <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>In non-warrant “informer as a material witness” cases, our leading decision is <em>Commonwealth v. Carter, </em><a href="/pa/427/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="427 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1910370" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0053-01">427 Pa. 53</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20284" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="233 A.2d 284">233 A.2d 284</a> (1967), where the defense of mistaken identity was directly at issue. In <em>Carter, </em>we accepted the government’s privilege of non-disclosure but ruled that the privilege must give way where disclosure of an eyewitness’s identity is relevant and helpful to the defense or is necessary to a fair determination of a cause. In reaching this conclusion, we relied on <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em><a href="/us/353/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="353 U.S. 53" data-case-ids="6159521" data-case-paths="/us/353/0053-01">353 U.S. 53</a>, <a href="/us/353/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="353 U.S. 53" data-case-ids="6159521" data-case-paths="/us/353/0053-01">77 S.Ct. 623</a>,<a href="/us/353/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="353 U.S. 53" data-case-ids="6159521" data-case-paths="/us/353/0053-01">1 L.Ed.2d 639</a> (1957). We further held that the proper balance between the prosecution and defense necessarily must tip in favor of disclosure where guilt is based solely on a single observation by the police but testimony from a <em>“more disinterested source is available.” </em><a href="/pa/427/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="427 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1910370" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0053-01">427 Pa. at 61</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20284" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="233 A.2d 284">233 A.2d at 288</a>. (Emphasis in original). Where other corroboration of the officer’s testimony exists, disclosure of the informant’s identity is, of course, not necessarily required. <em>Carter </em>also rejected the Commonwealth’s contention that secrecy is necessary to fight the drug trade or possible retribution against the informant. <a href="/pa/427/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="427 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1910370" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0053-01">427 Pa. at 63-64</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20284" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="233 A.2d 284">233 A.2d at 289</a>.

This is precisely the kind of showing which we indicated in <em>Carter </em>would suffice to require disclosure. Where the defense is one of mistaken identity, the defendant can do no more than deny his involvement and suggest that another eyewitness might offer evidence that would support his claim. Here, that suggestion is bolstered by the fact that the arrest was not made until seven months after the incident, which was the only direct contact the officer had with the buyer.
