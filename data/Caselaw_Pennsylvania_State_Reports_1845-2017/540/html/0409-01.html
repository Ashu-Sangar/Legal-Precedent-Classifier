    <p class="author" id="b703-4" data-blocks='[["BL_703.5",703,[287,353,409,40]]]'>FLAHERTY, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b703-5" data-blocks='[["BL_703.6",703,[243,418,1150,369]]]'>The issue is whether a trial court may dismiss a plaintiffs amended complaint against a party defendant joined after the commencement of the action without leave of court in violation of Pa.R.Civ.P. 1033, even when the improper joinder works no prejudice against the improperly joined defendant or the other parties to the action. We hold that the court may penalize the violation by dismissing the complaint.</p>
    <p id="b703-6" data-blocks='[["BL_703.7",703,[244,810,1148,419]]]'>Appellee John C. Paden, a construction worker, was injured on the job when he fell through a hole in the second floor of a construction site on May 1, 1991. Paden sued the general contractor and its parent corporation. Pleadings proceeded until April 30, 1993, one day before the statute of limitations expired, when Paden filed an amended complaint adding as a defendant the alleged flooring sub-contractor, Baker Concrete Construction Company, appellant.</p>
    <p id="b703-7" data-blocks='[["BL_703.8",703,[240,1252,1153,962]]]'>The amended complaint was filed without leave of court or the consent of the other parties. Baker filed preliminary objections challenging the joinder as improper, seeking to be stricken as a party defendant. The trial court sustained the preliminary objections and struck the joinder of Baker as a defendant. Paden appealed, and the Superior Court reversed, holding that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to penalize the improper procedure utilized to add Baker as a defendant because the court should have implemented Pa. R.Civ.P. 126, which permits a court to “disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.” Baker sought allowance of appeal which we granted to review the sole question: May a trial court dismiss a plaintiffs complaint against a party defendant joined after commencement of the action without leave of court in violation of Pa.R.Civ.P. 1033, even where the improper joinder works no prejudice against the improperly joined defendant or the other parties to the suit?</p>
