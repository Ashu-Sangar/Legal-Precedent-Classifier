In addition to <em>Hibbs, </em>this Court has affirmed this professional skill exemption principle on more than one occasion. For example, in <em>Stratton v.

During the preconstruction phase, the construction manager’s service is to include: (1) coordinating the schedules of the architect, owner and manager; (2) advising the owner of the separation of the project into various categories of work; and (3) developing schedules and providing the owner advice on when to purchase material and equipment. Reproduced Record at 14. The construction phase duties include: (1) the provision of administrative and management services to coordinate the work of the contractor; (2) the scheduling and conducting of meetings on administrative matters; (3) the recommendation of changes to the architect and owner; (4) the provision of advice on discrepancies in the drawings and specifications; and (5) assistance to the architect in evaluating the completion of the work of the contractors. Reproduced Record at 14. As such, we believe, <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>as did the trial court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> that the construction manager’s duties require specialized business and technical judgment and professional skills and experiences. Moreover, much like the construction inspector in <em>Hibbs, supra, </em><a href="/pa/276/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="276 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1077542" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0024-01">276 Pa. 24</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.2d%20727" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="119 A.2d 727">119 A.2d 727</a>, the instant construction manager’s work goes directly to the overall success of the project to see that the contract is fully complied with as to quantity and quality of material and workmanship. As such, the quality of the service the construction manager is to provide, rather than the cost of such service, is of paramount concern.</p>

The Commonwealth Court also held <em>Belcastro </em>inapposite to the instant case on the basis that the Public School Code “is simply another statute which the General Assembly has constructed in a fashion entirely different from the County Code.” <a href="/pa-commw/158/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="158 Pa.

We also note that the language of the statute itself suggests that the competitive bidding requirement is limited to contracts for physical construction labor only, not construction management advisory services because the “work of any nature” phrase upon which the Commonwealth Court's reasoning hinged is immediately modified only by examples of physical labor: "including the introduction of plumbing, heating and ventilating or lighting systems.” 24 P.S. § 7-751(a). This view of the statute supports the result we today reach. <em>See also Hibbs, </em><a href="/pa/276/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="276 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1077542" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0024-01">276 Pa. at 30</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.%20727" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="119 A. 727">119 A. at 729</a> (although the statute required that contracts for actual, physical construction work must be subjected to the competitive bidding process, the statute did not require that a contract for a construction inspector’s work be competitively bid).</p>
