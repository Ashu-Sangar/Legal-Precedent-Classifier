After a separate penalty hearing was held, the jury found one aggravating circumstance and one mitigating circumstance, and further found that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstance. Therefore, the penalty was fixed at death. This is an automatic direct appeal from that sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> For the reasons discussed below we affirm the conviction of first degree murder but vacate the sentence of death and remand the case to the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County, Criminal Division, for a new sentencing hearing.</p>

In 1988, human skeletal remains were discovered by a man cutting wood in a remote wooded location in Lebanon County. The remains were buried under logs, brush and leaves. Through an examination of the remains by a forensic pathologist, Dr. Neil A. Hoffman, police determined that the remains were those of Kathy Lynn Fair, who was last seen alive on September 4, 1982, and who had been reported as missing after failing to appear for a date with her sister. Dr. Hoffman also determined from marks on the bones that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds inflicted by a short, stout, single-edged weapon appearing to be a knife. N.T. at 645-646.</p>

N.T. at 731. In the December 1982 incident, two girls who had accepted a ride from Appellant were stabbed with a short, stiff, folding single-edged knife and <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>left for dead not far from the place where Kathy Fair’s remains were discovered.

In the instant case, there is no dispute that Kathy Fair was unlawfully killed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Additionally, there was testimony that Appellant confessed to at least three people, Stanley May, Denise DeHaven and Charles Neidig, to killing a girl and hiding her in the woods, circumstances substantially similar to the manner in which Kathy Fair was killed and later discovered. Further, there was testimony from the victims of the 1982 rape-assaults, an incident which occurred proximate in time to the disappearance of Kathy Fair and proximate in location to the later discovery of her remains. Moreover, an acquaintance of Appellant testified that Appellant had once taken him to the location where Kathy Fair’s remains were found. Finally, there was testimony that Appellant always carried a type of knife consistent with the type of weapon used to kill Kathy Fair, and that Appellant had used a similar type of knife in his attacks on G.S. and S.S. This evidence, and all reasonable inferences therefrom, when viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient to prove that Appellant killed Kathy Fair. Finally, there is sufficient evidence to prove that the killing was done in an intentional, <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>deliberate and premeditated manner. Dr. Hoffman testified that Kathy Fair suffered at least five stab wounds to the upper body. N.T. at 641. Specific intent to kill can be proven by the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body. <em>Commonwealth v. Bricker, </em><a href="/pa/458/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="458 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="479712" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0367-01">458 Pa. 367</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20279" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="326 A.2d 279">326 A.2d 279</a> (1974). The upper body is clearly a vital part of the body.

Additionally, two police officers testified at trial that no other crimes had been reported in the general location of the 1982 rape-assaults either before or after the incident in December of 1982.

In <em>Billa, </em>the trial court allowed the Commonwealth to demonstrate that the killing was committed during the perpetration of a rape. However, despite the prosecutions suggestion to do so, the trial court simply <em>refused </em>to instruct the jury as to the elements of rape. This Court held that it was erroneous to allow the jury to “speculate” on the elements of that crime and that the trial court must define the elements of the felony that the prosecution seeks to use for sentencing. <em><a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">Id.</a> </em><a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">521 Pa. at 187</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">555 A.2d at 845</a>. Applying this holding to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the majority concludes that the sentence of death should be reversed because the jury was not instructed as to <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>the elements of rape. This simply was not the case. The crime of attempted rape is a lesser included offense of the crime of rape. As the preceding charge demonstrates, the trial court necessarily had to charge the jury with the elements of rape when it instructed them as to the elements of attempted rape. Thus, unlike <em>Billa, </em>this Court is not confronted with a situation where we are forced to speculate as to the jury’s intention. The jury was charged with the elements of the felony in question and based upon the evidence presented by the Commonwealth the jury determined that appellant committed a killing while in the perpetration of that felony, attempted rape. The layperson’s unintended mistake in omitting “attempted” before “rape” from the verdict slip should be read for what it is worth, harmless error. Accordingly, I would affirm the sentence of death.</p>
