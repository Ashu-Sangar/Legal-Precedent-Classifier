The jury convicted appellant of murder in the first degree, aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person, criminal trespass, possession of an instrument of crime, and carrying firearms on a public street. Following the sentencing hearing, the jury found that the two aggravating circumstances<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> outweighed the mitigating circumstance<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and sentenced appellant to death. After trial counsel was permitted to withdraw, supplementary post-sentence motions were filed and evidentiary hearings were held on April 12, 1993 and June 8, 1993. On June 8, 1993, the post-sentence motions were denied and the trial court re-imposed the jury’s sentence of death, as well as other terms of imprisonment on the other convictions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Using this standard, the record below establishes the following facts:</p>
    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[241,1093,1155,899]]]'>Appellant and Lisa Johnson lived together for a period of two years before she returned with their two sons to live with her parents, Gladys and Leon McKnight, in order to escape appellant’s abuse. Thereafter, appellant repeatedly harassed Lisa by going over to the McKnight residence, after her parents had gone to work. According to the testimony of Lisa Johnson’s sister, Tracey McKnight, appellant would come over to the McKnight residence almost every day and often threaten Lisa that if she did not get rid of her new boyfriend, he was going to kill her and her family. These acts eventually compelled Lisa to obtain a protection from abuse order. However, in spite of the order, appellant continued to harass and threaten her and her family. On one occasion, after Gladys McKnight told appellant that she would have to call the police if he did not leave the house, he told her to go ahead and that if she did, “I will blow your fucking brains out.” (N.T. 2/27/92, at 94).</p>

Later in the day, appellant repeatedly called the McKnight residence demanding to speak to Lisa and inquiring as to whether her new boyfriend, <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>Denzell Brown was present. The deceased, Ricardo Thomas, who was the godfather of one of appellant’s children, took one of these phone calls and ordered appellant to stop harassing Ms. Johnson. At approximately midnight, appellant once again telephoned Lisa and told her that he was coming over. He also threatened her by stating, “If I can’t have you, ain’t nobody going to have you.” (N.T. 2/28/92, at 48).</p>
    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[212,667,1151,477]]]'>By the time Denzell Brown and his friend and co-worker, Harry Smith, left the residence (around 2:00 a.m.), appellant still had not arrived. Although as they were leaving the neighborhood, they noticed a gray car parked around the block which was later identified as appellant’s vehicle. Due to the McKnight’s obvious concerns, Ricardo Thomas offered to sleep on the downstairs couch in order to protect Lisa in the event that appellant followed through on his threats. Lisa slept on another sofa in the same room.</p>
    <p id="b381-6" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[210,1169,1152,578]]]'>Sometime between 3:00 a.m. and 3:30 a.m., appellant, who had been waiting in his car, broke through the front door, walked over to Ricardo Thomas, who was still sleeping on the couch, and shot him in the forehead and in the chest. Evidence was offered which indicated that the gun was fired from six to ten inches from the victim’s head. Appellant then turned to Lisa who had awakened and said, “Lisa this is what you get for playing.” (N.T. 2/28/92, at 53). Appellant then shot her two times in the head. The McKnights heard a gunshot but thought that it came from outside so they went back to bed.</p>

Appellant voluntarily agreed and was taken to the homicide division of the Philadelphia police department. Thereafter, appellant was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After informing the police that he wanted to waive his rights, and that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, appellant gave the following statement:</p>

Then I turned my head and I heard Lisa calling me all kind of bitches. She started asking me why I did that and she started saying that she hated me she hated me. Then I pointed the gun at her and I shot her two times. So then I drove off and sat in the car for a while.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

As discussed above, the jury may find as an aggravating circumstance that the killing was committed while in the perpetration of a “felony.” Felonies are expressly defined in the Crimes Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Appellant argues, however, that the legislature did not intend to include criminal trespass among those felonies that may be considered for purposes of determining aggravating circumstances. He fails to cite to any legislative history in support of his claim. Because 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d) expressly permits the use of “felonies” as an aggravating circumstance, of which criminal trespass is one, we find no merit to appellant’s claim. Thus, criminal trespass may be considered as an aggravating circumstance and appellant’s final claim must fail. •</p>
