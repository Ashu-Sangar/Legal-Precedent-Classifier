Appellants contend that because these prosecutions arise from conduct which forms part of the same criminal episode on which previous prosecutions were based, 18 Pa.C.S. § 110 requires their dismissal. The Commonwealth argues that the instant prosecutions are not based on conduct constituting the same criminal episode as the previous prosecutions and therefore do not violate 18 Pa.C.S. § 110. Because the inquiry as to whether a series of criminal acts constitutes a single criminal episode is fact dependent, we first review the factual history of each case.</p>

Bracalielly. </em>As the majority notes, the principal case defining what constitutes a single criminal episode is <em>Commonwealth v. Hude. </em>In <em>Hude, </em>we applied Section 110 in determining that eleven charges of possession and delivery arising out of a series of transactions were so logically and temporally related as to require that all the charges be tried together. We relied on the fact that the offenses occurred in the same place over a four month period, were arranged by the same person with the same buyer of similar amounts of drugs, and no additional or corroborative testimony would have been required in a second trial.</p>

      <em>Hude </em>requires examination of two factors to determine whether various acts constitute one criminal episode: (1) the logical relationship between the acts and (2) the temporal relationship between the acts. In the instant case, the four transactions occurred within a thirteen day period, and the same confidential informant, Michael Deardon, arranged each transaction by calling Bracalielly at his home in Allegheny County. Also, Bracalielly testified that during each transaction, a future transaction was discussed (R. 48a). Thus, the facts are analogous to those in <em>Hude </em>where a temporal and logical relationship was found.</p>

I question the importance the majority assigns to this factor and whether the record supports the finding that the investigations were independent.</p>

I disagree. As noted, the proper analysis is whether the acts are temporally and logically related. The fact that two different police departments investigated a single defendant does not, in itself, establish either requirement. The evidence presented in this case clearly establishes one criminal episode notwithstanding the fact that two police departments were involved.</p>

The question to be answered is not necessarily whether Butler County had jurisdiction over all the offenses, but whether the four transactions were within the jurisdiction of a single court. The Crimes Code provides that if a person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship. 18 Pa.C.S. § 903(c). The multiple drug transactions in the present case were the object of the same ongoing conspiracy between Bracalielly and the informant. The agreement underlying this conspiracy was entered into in Allegheny <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>County, since the informant arranged the transactions by continuously calling Bracalielly at his home.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> One conspiracy was therefore established, with Allegheny County the proper venue.</p>
