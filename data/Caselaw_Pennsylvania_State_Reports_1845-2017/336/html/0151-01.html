      <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>The Department of Public Assistance, on behalf of the Commonwealth, filed a claim against the estate of William N. Waits, deceased, for $756.00 representing the aggregate amount of monthly assistance payments made to the decedent from December, 1934, to May, 1937. The balance of the estate for distribution exceeded the claim of the Commonwealth by more than $600.00. The court below allowed the claim of the Commonwealth for refund of the assistance furnished from June 1, 1936, to the date of the death of the beneficiary, which occurred upon May 9, 1937, but rejected the claim for all payments made prior to June 1, 1936. Exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed, and from the final decree accordingly entered, the Department of Public Assistance of the Commonwealth has taken this appeal.</p>

The Act of 1934 contained no express provision for reimbursement. The court decided that, in view of Section 24 of the Act of 1936, which reads: “The provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon final enactment and shall be retroactive to the first day of June, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six,” there could be no recovery by the Commonwealth of payments made <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>prior to June 1, 1936, as that was the date to which the act was expressly made retroactive.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[265,460,1152,1231]]]'>It seems to us that since Section 15 of the Act of 1936 specifically provides for the refund of all old age assistance, including that supplied under the provisions of the previous act, it must prevail over .the general terms which are used in Section 24 of the act. It is a familiar rule that where there is a conflict between two provisions of a statute, one of which is specific and the other merely general, the specific provision will control unless it is clear that the legislature intended otherwise, or some other canon of statutory construction compels a contrary conclusion. For example, in <em>Com. v. Kline, </em><a href="/pa/294/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="294 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1113428" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0562-01">294 Pa. 562</a>, we said (p. 567) : “This is, indeed, the invariable rule whenever a conflict exists between specific and general provisions appearing in the same constitution, statute or agreement,” that the specific provision will control the construction, so far as concerns the opposing matters dealt within it.

This is clearly stated in Section 22.

Claimant contends that the Old Age Assistance Law of 1934 bestowed upon the persons benefited irrevocable gifts, with no obligation of repayment. Such an assumption ignores the true intention of the legislature, which may be drawn from the Act of 1934 as a whole, and from many of its sections separately. The legislature did not intend to grant bounties to those who reached the <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>required age of seventy years; its purpose was to provide assistance to “indigent persons” of that age who had no other adequate means of support.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The legislature did not propose to enrich the legatees, heirs and creditors of the beneficiaries, but merely to enable the latter to sustain themselves. This is a form of public charity. Assistance payments would, of course, cease if the beneficiary acquired sufficient personal means to support himself. From the general tenor and purpose of this legislation, it is clear that there was an implied obligation on the part of the beneficiary to repay the state for its assistance, if, and when, he was in a position to do so, and that this obligation should constitute a claim upon the estate of a deceased beneficiary. There was no need to incorporate this condition in the statute, for at common law there is an implied duty on the part of a recipient of public assistance, or his estate, to make reimbursement. Thus in <em>Arnold’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/253/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="253 Pa. 517" data-case-ids="1024017" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0517-01">253 Pa. 517</a>, we held that the estate of an indigent lunatic was liable to pay the claim of the Commonwealth for his support. We said (p. 520) : “It is said that such repayment is in conflict with the policy of our poor laws and our idea of charity. But it seems to us there is something radically wrong with the theory that a patient may leave an institution with a large estate of his own in his pocket without any legal obligation resting upon him to pay for the food he consumed . . . Nor does the demand for reimbursement under such circumstances detract from the charity. If the pauper receives the maintenance <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>upon the condition that he shall pay when able, it answers his needs just as much as if there were no obligation to pay under any conditions.”</p>

    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[201,1124,1156,976]]]'>Therefore it seems to us that although the Act of 1934 made no express provision for reimbursement, there was an implied condition attached to every payment of assistance funds, that the recipient would repay the Commonwealth when able to do so, and that his estate should be subject to the same liability. Whether the obligation be regarded as contractual or quasi-contractual, it was nevertheless inherent in the acceptance of state aid. It is apparent that the provision of Section 15 of the Act of 1936 is merely declaratory of the existing law, creating no new obligation and conferring no additional right or remedy upon the Commonwealth which it did not already possess. A retrospective statute which does not vary existing obligations is not in violation of the due process clause of the Constitution; it does not effect an unconstitutional impairment of contracts.
