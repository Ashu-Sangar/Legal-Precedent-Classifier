They all grow out of determinations by the court below upon questions raised in the adjudication of the Estate of <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>Andrew C. Edelman. Because of the interrelation of these questions, the appeals will be disposed of in one opinion.</p>
    <p id="b56-5" data-blocks='[["BL_56.5",56,[263,520,1155,1288]]]'>Andrew C. Edelman died March 10, 1921. He had no children. He left a will disposing of his estate as follows: To his wife Anna all his property for life “in lieu of her dower, if she should so elect.” On the death of his wife, two farms, one known as the Pond farm, sold by testator in his lifetime, and the other as the Kocher farm, were given to his sister, Sarah Koch, together with all personalty found thereon; to her son, Frank Odenwelder, a property known as the Mansion House; to Lizzie Miller, sister of his wife, three farms, and a fourth one or $25,000 in lieu thereof in the event he sold it in his lifetime, which he did; he also gave her certain lots and the personalty on the properties; to his niece, Pearl Miller, daughter of Lizzie, his dwelling house with one acre of ground and all personalty thereon, and a tin box with its contents. At testator’s death this box was found to contain liberty bonds and old money valued at almost $10,000. He gave the residue of his estate to his relatives, other than two nieces (whom he expressly disinherited), as the intestate laws provided. The effect of this disposition was to give it to his sister, Sarah Koch. He left a considerable estate, about $135,000 in personalty and $140,000 in realty. He named his wife and Lizzie Miller executrices.</p>
    <p id="b56-6" data-blocks='[["BL_56.6",56,[265,1829,1152,316]]]'>The wife elected to take against the will. Her election, and what subsequently occurred, give rise to the problems we are called upon to solve, the main one being, whether there was a valid family settlement. If the conclusion be that there was, all other controversies are thereby ended.</p>

    <p id="b57-5" data-blocks='[["BL_57.5",57,[177,1019,1153,481]]]'>On the 3d or 4th of May, 1921, after the widow’s election, a meeting was held at Mrs. Edelman’s residence. Its purpose, we are convinced, was to arrive at some solution and settlement of the difficulties created by the widow’s election. The meeting was attended by Mrs. Edelman, Mrs. Miller, Pearl Miller, Mrs. Koch and Preston Koch, her husband, and Asher Seip, attorney for the estate, who died in 1935, while these proceedings were going on.</p>
    <p id="b57-6" data-blocks='[["BL_57.6",57,[176,1511,1156,920]],["BL_58.1",58,[275,362,1155,153]]]'>Mrs. Edelman, very likely guided by Mr. Seip, proposed a settlement to those present by which she would give up her one-half interest in the lands devised to the specific devisees, giving them immediate possession thereof in severalty, the specific devisees to surrender to her all their interest in the personalty. Mrs. Koch knew of the real estate, but inquired about the value of the personalty, and Mr. Seip informed her that the mortgages and the bonds amounted to in the neighborhood of $100,000. Pearl Miller testified he told Mrs. Koch the personal estate ran considerably over $100,000. At that time no inventory had been filed. It was explained to Mrs. Koch she would get the Kocher farm released from Mrs. Edelman’s one-half interest. Mrs. Koch did not then agree to the settlement as proposed but asked for further time to consider it. A few days later Mrs. Koch, through her husband, notified Mr. Seip <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>that she would accept the terms suggested and she and her husband executed a full release of all demands against the estate.</p>
    <p id="b58-5" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[275,525,1156,1895]],["BL_59.1",59,[199,352,1156,483]]]'>In this paper, Mrs. Koch recited that she “has this day had and received of and from Anna B. Edelman and Lizzie Lenora Miller, executrices of the last will and testament of the said Andrew C. Edelman, deceased, full satisfaction and payment of all such sums or sums of money, legacies and bequests, as are given and bequeathed to her, the said Sarah J. Koch, by the said last will and testament of the said Andrew C. Edelman, deceased, and all interest accrued thereon; and therefore, the said Sarah J. Koch and Preston C. Koch, her husband, for themselves, their heirs, <em>assigns, </em>executors and administrators, do, by these presents, remise, release, quitclaim and forever discharge the said Anna Edelman and Lizzie Lenora Miller, executrices as aforesaid, and their heirs, executors, administrators and successors, of and from the said moneys, legacies and bequests, and of and from all actions, suits, payments, accounts, reckonings, claims and demands whatsoever for or by reason thereof, or of any other act, matter, cause or thing whatsoever.” This release is dated May 5, 1921, and acknowledged the same day. The court and the auditor were of the opinion this release was not binding upon Sarah Koch to its full extent, because the only interest she received, as consideration for it, was the one-half interest in the farm devised to her, to which Mrs. Edelman was entitled by reason of her election, which interest was valued at $3,500, and that she gave up one-half of the personalty valued, so the court thought, at $67,000, and that full disclosure was not made by Mr. Seip at the meeting of the amount of the personalty and that Mrs. Koch was in ignorance of its true value. Prom a reading of the testimony we cannot draw the same inference as the court and the auditor did, because they failed to take into account how greatly Mrs. Koch’s share of the personalty would be dimin<a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>islied by ber having to make good to the specific legatees and devisees out of the personalty their disappointment due to the reduction of their specific gifts one-half, by Mrs. Edelman’s election. When the value of the real estate is taken into account and the $25,000 due to Mrs. Miller, in lieu of the farm, which had been sold by the testator in his lifetime, and the expense of settling the estate, it is obvious that Mrs. Koch’s share would have been small, if anything.</p>
    <p id="b59-5" data-blocks='[["BL_59.5",59,[199,846,1158,911]]]'>Following the meeting, Mrs. Edelman carried out her undertaking, so far as all of the specific devisees were concerned, making deeds to them for her one-half interest in the property devised to each. It is difficult to understand why she should have done this, unless that was the arrangement in which everyone in interest acquiesced. She made a deed to Mrs. Koch’s nominee for the one-half interest in the Kocher farm, to Mrs. Miller for the one-half interest in the properties devised to her, appraised at $109,000, and Mrs. Miller paid her $10,000. She made a deed to Pearl Miller (Kunkel by reason of her marriage) for the real estate given to her and also to Mrs. Koch’s son, Frank Odenwelder, for the one-half interest in the property devised to him. These deeds were made without money consideration except that paid by Mrs. Miller. Pearl Miller gave up her interest in the contents of the box.</p>

She lived until December 29, 1929, almost nine years after the settlement and after she signed the release. Not alone does her inertia stand out, but her husband asserted no claim until February 21, 1933, more than three years after her death and almost twelve years after the settlement, when he joined <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>in the petition of Warren Odenwelder, a son of his wife by a former marriage, for a citation on the executrices to file an account.
