Its provisions became effective upon the approval of the act by the Governor on June 29, 1937, but the granting of a preliminary injunction in the court below has resulted in postponing the date of enforcement: The defendants are the Secretary of Revenue, the Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Motor Police, and the.

It has been found that these physical features increase the danger of operation of..such equipment upon the highways of the Commonwealth: These vehicles in making sharp curves, particularly on the steep grades in the mountainous regions, which must be traveled to reach the eastern seaboard, completely block the highway. Their length and their height make it necessary to swing them to the center of the highway, with attendant dangers to oncoming- traffic.
