Certificates for preferred and common shares of stock were issued to the four partners. Since the total par value of the preferred stock was $400,000, (4,000 shares of $100 par value) and the total capital of the partnership was, as we have seen, $544,040.89, the difference of $144,040.89 was entered upon the books by the company’s auditor as a surplus, thus allocating to the 100 shares of common stock a book value in the amount of the excess.</p>

Although plaintiff was aware that corrections were made in the books in January or February, 1931, she did not file this bill until over four year's later, and then not until differences had arisen between her and other shareholders with respect to the affairs of the company.

    <p id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.7",184,[272,1880,1153,535]],["BL_185.1",185,[209,356,1152,636]]]'>It is conceded in plaintiff’s brief that due to the manner in which the books were opened, Max Markovitz received an interest in the corporation which included <em>“an excess of some $14,000 over Ms interest in the </em>partnershipThe evidence in the case conclusively establishes the fact that Max Markovitz was not entitled to this greater interest in the corporation; that it was not intended by the four partners that their interests therein should be different proportionately from their shares in the partnership. The inequality in favor of <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>Max Markoyitz resulted entirely from a mistake, — an erroneous bookkeeping entry. This is shown by the fact that upon the incorporation of the company, the return made under oath to the Auditor General of the Commonwealth, placed a valuation of $100 per share upon the 100 shares of common stock, a total valuation of $10,000, and the bonus due the state was paid upon that sum. Nevertheless the accountant, when setting up the books, gave to these shares a book value of $144,040.89, which made necessary the correction of the books to accord with the true stated value of these shares.</p>
    <p id="b185-3" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[208,1014,1155,1137]]]'>We have examined the incorporation agreement between the partners, dated December 23, 1924, and in our opinion there is no provision therein which stipulates that the rights or shares of Max Markovitz in the corporation should be greater than he possessed in the partnership. In fact, no method whatsoever is set forth therein for distributing or disposing of the excess of the capital of the partnership, above the $400,000 par value of preferred stock. There is nothing in the record upon which a finding could be based that the Max Markovitz share in the capital of the partnership, which, on December 31, 1924, was $93,957.22, should rightfully be increased on the same day to $108,411.25 in the capital stock of the corporation, as reflected by its books, and that this enrichment should be made at the expense of his other partners. Accordingly the finding of the court below that the entries originally made upon the books of the company were due to a mistake as to their effect, and conferred upon Max Markovitz. a greater interest than he had the right to receive, should not be disturbed by this Court.</p>

The testimony of the company’s auditor and attorney, who participated in the discussion of the matter at the meeting held in June, 1928, is clearly to the effect that <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>lie did so agree. His conduct shows that he had no desire, as the court finds, “to enrich himself at the expense of his brothers because of an error that was made at the time the books of the corporation were set up.” Again we see no reason to disturb the findings made by the court below, which are so completely supported by the evidence.</p>
