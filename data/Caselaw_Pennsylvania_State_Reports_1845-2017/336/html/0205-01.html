The court imposed a sentence of ten to forty years, but the maximum sentence for the offense is twenty years, and the maximum part of the <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>sentence is therefore illegal. However, this does not entitle relator to be discharged. In June, 1936, he was placed on parole, for violation of which he was sentenced on December 31, 1936, to serve the unexpired portion of the forty-year sentence, amounting to 34 years, 9 months and 5 days. This sentence should be amended to conform with the maximum provided by statute: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Flory v. </em>Ashe, <a href="/pa-super/132/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="132 Pa. Super. 405" data-case-ids="1010301" data-case-paths="/pa-super/132/0405-01">132 Pa.
