On the day after her death, Frederick L.

George Phillips Orlady — hereafter called the contestant — on February 10, 1938, appealed from the probate. On his petition, an issue was granted to determine “1. Whether or not at the time of the execution of the said writings the decedent was a person of sound mind; 2. Whether or not the said writings were procured by undue influence, duress and constraint practiced upon the said Edith T. Orlady by Frederick L. Orlady and others. 3.

In disposing of them, the learned trial judge referred to the fact that at the trial the contestant presented a point for a directed verdict in his favor and concluded that such an instruction should have been given on the ground (in the words of his opinion) that “the will and codicil in question, of Edith T. Orlady, were not properly executed in accordance with the requirements of the Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 403, Section 3.” Accordingly, he made an order in the orphans’ court proceeding sustaining the appeal from the decree of the register.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Section 3 provides — “If the testator be unable to sign his name, for any reason other than the extremity of his last sickness, a will to which his name is subscribed in his presence, by his direction and authority, and to which he makes his mark or cross, <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>unless unable so to do, — in which case the mark or cross shall not be required, — shall be as valid as though he had signed his name thereto: Provided, That such will shall be proved by the oaths or affirmations of two or more competent witnesses.” The significant words requiring that the testator’s name be “subscribed in his presence” were not in the earlier act.</p>

Whether these papers were executed in conformity with the Wills Act must be tested by their testimony. Taking the codicil first, we all agree that their evidence leaves no doubt whatever that decedent’s name was not subscribed to it in her presence; her name appears on the paper in typewriting only and the evidence is that there was no typewriting machine in the room; her typewritten name was therefore not subscribed in her presence; it must have been placed on the paper before it was brought into her room.</p>

In the last named case the two subscribing witnesses testified they saw the testatrix make her mark, but did not see her name subscribed to the will nor hear her request anyone to write it for her. The proponent thereupon offered to prove by the scrivener that, having read the will to the testatrix, he wrote her name thereon at her express direction, and then, in the presence of the two subscribing witnesses, she affixed her mark. It was held, nevertheless, that the validity of the will was not established, because there were not two witnesses to prove that the name of testatrix had been subscribed in her presence and by her direction and authority.”</p>

I put her <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>hand on the pen and made the x mark for her. Then I asked her, Do you want Dr. Mainzer and I to sign this will as witnesses. She said yes. We then signed as witnesses.” In passing, it may be said, that his evidence is not clear whether he meant by “I wrote her signature” that he wrote it after he “got a magazine and laid it on the bed in front of her,” or whether it had been written on the paper by him before he brought it into the room to receive the testatrix’s mark; but we treat the case as if he meant to say he wrote her name in her presence.</p>

Dr. Mainzer and I signed as witnesses.” Of this evidence it will be noted, that the phraseology “The codicil was signed” if intended to refer to her name, as distinguished from placing her mark on it, described an act done in typewriting before the codicil was produced, because there was no typewriting machine in the room.</p>

She said she would so he proceeded to put the pen in her hand. He got a magazine off the stand and put the paper on it and with the aid of his hand she made an x before her name. Q.

When we consider how conclusive the proof is, based on the evidence of this witness, that her name to the codicil, being in typewriting, could not have been .subscribed in her presence because there was no typewriting machine in the room, we are impressed with the apparent care with which this witness was narrating the facts of the transaction. Directly asked in cross-examination (a question not put to him during the examination in chief) whether he had seen the scrivener “write the name of Miss Orlady on both the will and codicil” he replied “I did not”. When asked whether he could separate the signing of <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>the will from the signing of the codicil, he could not do so.

In his opinion refusing proponent’s motion for a new trial, the learned judge said: “In conclusion, under all the facts and circumstances in this case, we feel that the jury passed upon the questions involved after due deliberation and arrived at a just verdict. The proponent is amply provided with the income of one-half of the estate for life under the will of his sister, dated October 15, 1930, which will was made at a time there is no question as to her mental capacity or her freedom from duress, and of which there can be no question as to her desire in disposing of her estate and providing for her two brothers, who in each instance under that will get a life estate. To allow the will and codicil in question to stand (which scrivener describes as complex and dealing in multitudinous things) would be in effect to turn over this estate of considerable size to the almost exclusive control in one in whom testatrix expressed herself as lacking confidence and trust up to the very time she suffered the severe stroke, which seriously impaired her physically and it is contended mentally as well.”</p>
