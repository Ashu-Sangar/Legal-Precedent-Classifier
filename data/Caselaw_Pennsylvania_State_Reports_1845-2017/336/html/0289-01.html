Fifteen honorably discharged soldiers, defendants in the present proceedings, all received more than the passing grade of 70, and therefore qualified, as far as the examinations were concerned, without the aid of the fifteen per cent credit given by the statute. If that credit had not been allowed, however, instead of the veterans obtaining, as they did, the first eleven, the thirteenth, the fifteenth, the twenty-third and the forty-fifth places on the eligible list, plaintiffs, who were non-veteran applicants taking the examination, <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>would have gained the first fifteen places, since they all received higher grades in the examination than any of the veterans would have had without the advantage of the statutory credit. The ages of the veterans ranged from thirty-seven to forty-four, — all above the thirty-five-year limit, while plaintiffs were all between twenty-one and thirty-five years of age.</p>
    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[295,739,1148,525]]]'>Plaintiffs brought a bill in equity against the civil service board, the mayor and members of council, the district attorney, and the fifteen veterans. The court decreed that the eligible list must be revised so as to exclude all persons over thirty-five years of age and all who failed to pass the examination without the aid of the preferential credit, and restrained the mayor and members of council from making any permanent appointments until the list should have been so corrected.</p>
    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.6",342,[292,1284,1151,1020]],["BL_343.1",343,[182,353,1150,699]]]'>The principle underlying the issue here involved was fully discussed in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Graham v. Schmid, </em><a href="/pa/333/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="333 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1187944" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0568-01">333 Pa. 568</a>, and it would be but repetitious to enter upon an analysis of the conclusion there reached and its supporting reasons. After an exhaustive study of the authorities it was held in that case that “so long as the statute requires passage <em>of </em>the examination, a veteran may constitutionally be preferred over non-veterans whether the statute be mandatory or directory,” and therefore, assuming section 4407 to be limited by the qualification that the appointing power need not select a veteran morally or physically unfit, the preference made permissible by that section was constitutional. But it was further held that a statute was unconstitutional which exempted veterans from taking the examination for a civil service position,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> or granted them a lower passing grade than other candidates, or, “what is an equivalent provision, a credit to veterans of a specific number of points aiding them in passing <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>an examination,” and therefore section 4405 was unconstitutional in so far as it granted a fifteen per cent credit not merely as a preference to those passing the examination hut as an aid in establishing eligibility. In short, the Schmid case ruled that under Article III, section 7, of the Constitution, which forbids the granting of any special or exclusive privilege or immunity, a statute was constitutional if it granted to war vetterans a preferential right to appointment provided they had qualified for the position under uniform eligibility rules, but was unconstitutional if it permitted veterans to qualify under less rigorous standards than those prescribed for other applicants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

To permit war veterans to be appointed even though above such maximum is not the mere granting to them of a preference if otherwise eligible but the setting up for them of a standard of eligibility different from that established for other applicants. Therefore it is clear that the permitted waiver of the age limit provided by section 4407 is unconstitutional.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> If it is consistent with the public welfare that the police department be manned by persons <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>beginning service at an age of more than 35 years, the maximum limitation should be changed accordingly by legislation or by resolution of the civil service board; if, however, such an age is undesirable from the standpoint of the public good, it is nonetheless so in the case of war veterans than of other persons.</p>
