The water in defendant’s plant reached a height of eleven feet, filling the basement and the first floor and covering the machinery with mud and dirt. When the waters had receded defendant employed a corps of workmen to clear up the debris, and directed the regular employes, including decedent, to clean their machines. Decedent started on this task about a week after the flood had occurred, but the floors were still damp and muddy. After working for eight days he became ill, and a day or two later called in a doctor, who made a diagnosis of pneumonia, which he attributed to the conditions under which decedent had been working. Decedent’s death, as a result of the pneumonia, occurred shortly thereafter.</p>

For example, a workman was suddenly called upon to attempt a rescue of his father who had been buried by the slide of a culm bank; the effort lasted about 2% hours; a large quantity of water was used in the rescue work and the employe was drenched from his knees down; the result of this exposure was a cold which later took the form of pneumonia. The act thus performed by the employe was voluntary and under conditions from which a resulting pneumonia might readily have been anticipated, but compensation was allowed because of the extraordinary circumstances which demanded prompt action on the part of the employe under unusual and exceptionally unfavorable conditions <em>(Jones v.

So, where the janitor of a building was called upon to turn off steam which was escaping because of the breaking of a pipe, and in doing so he had first to walk on the street in extremely cold weather, and then for a short distance through the hot steam in the basement, whereby his clothing became wet, and a day or two later he developed bronchial pneumonia, compensation was allowed on the ground that this was a situation well out of the ordinary and not reasonably to be foreseen in the course of the employe’s usual work <em>(Heisler v. Lincoln Realty Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/121/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="121 Pa. Super. 516" data-case-ids="988319" data-case-paths="/pa-super/121/0516-01">121 Pa.

Where a surgeon was one night summoned professionally to a hospital on an emergency call, the weather being cold and windy with snow and rain falling intermittently, and the operation, requiring about <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>an hour, had to he performed in the dispensary where the temperature was abnormally low, and as a result the surgeon contracted influenza-pneumonia, compensation was granted on the theory that, while his act in responding to the call was a voluntary one, there was such an exigency that the case was distinguishable from one where pneumonia results from intentional and deliberate exposure to the elements <em>(Roth v.

Similarly, where a boiler repairman, who ordinarily was not required to work in the boilers until at least sixteen hours had elapsed after the fires had been drawn, was called upon on one occasion to make repairs before the lapse of such an interval, and thereby was subjected for a few hours to extreme heat, which contributed to his death from acute nephritis, compensation was allowed because of this extraordinary exposure, notwithstanding the fact that it was the employe’s regular duty to repair the boilers <em>(Evans v.

Hence, in these cases compensation was properly refused. As has been frequently pointed out, an employer is not, under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, an insurer of the life and health of his employes. Thus where emphysema, a disease of the lungs, is contracted by continued contact of the employe with smoke and fumes thrown off by electric generators, there is no accident within the meaning <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>of the Act, but rather an occupational disease <em>(Mauchline v.

Where a carpenter, in the course of his work, makes measurements in a refrigerating room, the temperature of which is exceedingly low, so that he suffers a chill and develops pneumonia, there is no accident, the chill being, not the consequence of a fortuitous and unexpected event, but a natural and foreseeable result of the deliberate act which preceded and caused it <em>(Lacey v.

It is true that the flood in the City of Pittsburgh, occurring two weeks before decedent’s illness, was an “accident,” and if it had caused an emergency situation which impelled decedent, suddenly and unexpectedly, and outside of the ordinary course of his work, to expose himself to abnormal conditions which brought on an attack of pneumonia, he might have been justified in claiming compensation. But an accident preceding the one upon which the claim is based is of significance only if it causes an exigent situation, which, by a chain of succeeding circumstances, culminates in injury, as in the Jones, Heisler, Both, and Evans cases hereinbefore discussed. Thus the San Francisco earthquake of some years ago was an “accident,” but an employe engaged in the task of salvage and restoration during the sev<a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>eral months or years which followed would not, by reason of the earthquake, have become entitled to Avorkmen’s compensation if, in the course of his work, he contracted pneumonia through exposure to weather conditions. While, in the present ease, it was the flood which made necessary the cleaning of the machinery, this operation was a protracted labor, and those who engaged in it voluntarily and deliberately exposed themselves to the dampness which they knew existed. Decedent worked for eight days before he became ill, returning to the job each day in the usual fashion. Nor can the surrounding conditions during that time be fairly characterized as extraordinary. There Avas no sudden, intense exposure to water or to cold. The most that can be said is that there was dampness in the plant and mud on the floors as lingering effects of the flood. That decedent was by trade a machinist does not affect the situation from a legal standpoint. Even assuming —what is far from certain — that in cleaning his machine he was doing something foreign to his ordinary work, he engaged in that occupation for the eight-day period, nor did the fact that he was occupied in cleaning instead of operating the machine in any way expose him to greater risk of disease. We cannot escape the conclusion that there is no “accident” within the meaning of the Workmen’s Compensation Act when an employe contracts pneumonia as the result of working for several days in a factory, the floors and Avails of which are damp, even though the dampness happens to have been caused by a flood which had occurred a week before he started the work.</p>
