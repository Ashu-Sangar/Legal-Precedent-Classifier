In article Y “Township covenants that it will maintain a schedule of rates for annual sewer rentals or charges such that the amounts which may reasonably be collected therefrom shall be sufficient to provide funds for (a) the amount expended annually by the Township in the operation, maintenance, repair, alteration, inspection, depreciation or other expenses in relation to the sewer system, including the sewers and the sewerage treatment works; (b) such annual amount as may be necessary to provide for the principal,' interest and taxes, if any, on the bonds issued hereunder and secured hereby; and (c) sufficient to establish a margin of safety of ten per centum (10%) of (a) and (b).

Article X deals with defaults and remedy and, inter alia, provides that in specified contingencies the “Trustee shall be entitled to take actual possession of the sewer system as for condition broken, and, in its discretion may, with or without force and with or without process of law, and before or after declaring the principal of said bonds immediately due, and without any action on the part of any bondholders, by its agents or attorneys enter upon, take and maintain possession of all or any part of said sewer system, together with all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts of the Township relating thereto, and may, as the attorney-in-fact or agent of the Township, or in its own name as Trustee, hold, manage and operate said sewer system and collect the sewer rentals or charges, and shall, after paying out of the revenue from said sewer system all expenses for management and operation of said sewer system, and the costs of such repairs, replacements, alterations, and useful additions as may seem to it proper and judicious, and all taxes, assessments or charges, or liens upon said sewer system or any part thereof, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees, and after retaining reasonable compensation for all amounts collected as Trustee for its services in that behalf, and such further sums as may be <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>sufficient to reimburse and indemnify the Trustee against any liability, loss or damage on account of any matter or thing done in good faith in pursuance of the duties of the Trustee hereunder, and to pay any moneys advanced or paid out pursuant to this Indenture together with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent.

The municipal improvement or property which plaintiffs aver to be involved is the sewerage system now owned by the township and that now proposed to be added to it. As the legislature itself, with its great powers over municipalities, is prohibited from making such a delegation to a private corporation, the question is, may it authorize a municipality to do what the legislature itself is prohibited from doing. In <em>Commonwealth v. Moir, </em><a href="/pa/199/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="199 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="922814" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0534-01">199 Pa. 534</a>, at p. 541, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.%20351" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="49 A. 351">49 A. 351</a>, Mitchell, J., said: “Municipal corporations are agents of the state, invested with certain subordinate governmental functions for reasons of convenience and public policy. They are created, governed, and the extent of their powers determined by the legislature, and subject to change, repeal, or total abolition at its will. They have no vested rights in their offices, their charters, their corporate powers, or even their corporate existence. This is the universal rule of constitutional law, and in no state has it been <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>more clearly expressed and more uniformly applied than in Pennsylvania.” See also <em>Shirk v.

Counsel for defendants contend that the challenged statute “does not delegate to a private corporation any power” but that “It does authorize a municipality voluntarily to enter into an agreement with a private corporation, such as a bank or trust company, representing, as a trustee, the bondholders.” As the constitution specifically deprives the state of power to delegate the management of the municipal property to a private corporation, certainly the agent, the township, cannot make such a delegation; the effect of the limitation on the principal would be destroyed if the agent could do what was prohibited.

In the Tranter case, for example, the county made no agreement with a private corporation; the Commonwealth dealt with its own property, the custody and management of which it had delegated to the county. It could at any time withdraw it from the county or it could add to the county’s burdens in respect to it. The State authorized the creation of a public corporation, the Allegheny County Authority, and required its agent, the county, upon the creation of the Authority, to transfer to the Authority certain property for purposes which were within the jurisdiction of the state. On the same theory the incorporation of Municipal Authorities <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>lias been supported. They are public corporations, being corporate agencies engaged in the administration of civil government.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The state may modify the part performed by its agencies in government by creating other agencies, subject always to constitutional limitations. If there is any resemblance between (1) the exercise of the power of the state to modify township government by taking part of it from the township and vesting it in a-public corporation and (2) by statute, authorizing the municipality to make a contract with a private corporation to take over and operate public property, the fact remains that the state may do the first but is expressly prohibited from doing the second.</p>

We think there is a great difference; in the Authority cases, the title to the property is in the Authority which makes the contract with the trustee; in case of default the trustee enters under the Authority; but if the defendant township defaults the private corporation is authorized to take over a part of the municipal property and operate it, which is clearly in violation of the constitutional provision.</p>

It has been suggested that, while the conclusion reached would be correct if the operation of the sewerage system were a governmental instead of a proprietary activity, Article III, section 20, does not apply because a proprietary function is under consideration. But the constitution makes no such distinction; the words are plain and must be given their common or popular meaning, for in that sense, the <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>voters are assumed to have understood them when they adopted the constitution: <em>Busser v.

The section prohibits delegating to any private corporation “any power to make, supervise or interfere with any municipal improvement, money, property or effects whether held in trust or otherwise or to levy taxes or perform any municipal function whatever.” There are no words, on the one hand, restricting the prohibition to property etc., used for purely governmental purposes and, on the other, allowing the delegation for property etc., employed in proprietary capacities. Both classes of municipal activity were familiar when the constitution was adopted. The sewerage system is a municipal improvement; it is property belonging to the municipality; in whatever capacity used, whether governmental or proprietary, the words of section 20 expressly include it; we must give them effect.</p>

If the operation of a sewer system was a <em>governmental </em>function, its ownership arid operation could not, under any circumstances, be intrusted to a private corporation, but the ownership and operation of a sewer system is <em>not </em>a governmental function; it is a proprietary function. “Sewers are owned by municipalities in their proprietary capacity, not governmentally”: <em>Gemmill v. </em>Calder, <a href="/pa/332/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="332 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="1186572" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0281-01">332 Pa. 281</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%207" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="3 A.2d 7">3 A. 2d 7</a>. The construction, operation, or maintenance of sewer systems, water systems and gas systems by a municipal corporation is in the nature of a private enterprise. A municipality is not required to construct, own, or operate such public utilities. It may contract with private corporations or individuals to furnish such service, or it may, if it so elects, own and operate such utilities for the benefit and convenience of its inhabitants and property owners. See 46 A. L. R. p. 677. The difference between proprietary and governmental functions of a municipality is clearly set forth in <em>Western Saving Fund Society v. </em>Phila., <a href="/pa/31/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="31 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="985018" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0175-01">31 Pa. 175</a>, 183, as follows: “The contracts which a municipal corporation may make for the purpose of supplying the inhabitants with gas-light in their streets and houses, relate to the ‘things of commerce/ as distinguished in the civil law from the ‘things public/ which are regulated by the sovereign. Such contracts are not made by the municipal corporation, by virtue of its powers of local sovereignty, but in its capacity of a private corporation. The supply of gas-light is no more a duty of sovereignty than the supply of water. Both these objects may be accomplished through the agency of individuals or private corporations, and in very many instances they are accomplished by those means. If this power is granted to a borough or a city, it is a special private franchise, made as well for the private emolument and advantage of the city as for the public good. <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>The whole investment is the private property of the city, as much so as the lands and houses belonging to it. . . .

For example, the First Class Township Law of June 24, 1931, P. L. 1206, sec. 2420 (which applies to Abington Township), provides that a township can contract for a sewer system with an individual or corporation and that the latter shall “exercise all the powers of the township in the construction and maintenance and operation of such system of sewage,” including the right to collect “charges.” It also provides (sec. 2440) for the acquisition of such a system from private owners and for entering into agreements with other townships for the building of sewers. The Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 519, provides (sec. 2131) that sewer lines may be extended beyond municipal limits. This is cited to show that when a municipality acts in a proprietary capacity, it may act beyond its official boundaries. In its governmental capacity, it cannot, of course, do so.</p>

The separation of the power to incur debts from the duty of providing for their payment by taxation, produced the principal mischief complained of and which it was sought to prevent. Notorious examples were the Public Buildings Commission^ created to build the city hall in Philadelphia, . . .; and the Penn Avenue Commissioners, operating in the City of Pittsburgh. . . .

L. 73, provides that corporations for profit may be chartered for the purpose of “construction and maintenance of sewers,” etc., “for the health, comfort and convenience of inhabitants . . . ” In the Tranter Case, it is provided by the terms of the contract that “after the cost of all of the public works and improvements to be constructed by defendant Authority shall have been duly paid out of the revenues received by defendant Authority from the same, then all of the property of said City conveyed to defendant Authority will revert to and become the property of the County of Allegheny improved by the public works and improvements constructed thereon by defendant Authority, without cost either to the said City or to the County of Allegheny.” In the instant case, the trust indenture <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>provides that “the township may, at its option, on April 1, 1959, or on any interest date thereafter redeem prior to the maturity thereof, any or all of the bonds of Series A<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> outstanding, upon payment of the principal amount thereof together with accrued interest.” The trust agreement further provides that after default and the trustee or receiver takes possession of the sewer system and operates and maintains and controls the rentals, the revenues shall be applied as follows: after the payment of costs and disbursements allowed by the court, counsel fees, expenses of the trustee, costs of operation, maintenance, repair, alteration, etc., then to the payment of the whole amount of principal and interest and taxes, if any, which shall then be owing or unpaid upon the bonds, and if there is any surplus, it shall be paid “to the township, or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same.” In the instant case, as in the Tranter case, the basic idea is that the revenues from the improvement shall be used for the payment of the improvement and that if the cost of the improvement has been liquidated from the revenues, the property will revert, in the Tranter case to the County of Allegheny and in the instant case to the Township of Abington. Even if there was no such provision in the instant case, that is, if the sewer system was to be constructed by a private corporation and permanently owned and managed by such a corporation, there would be no violation of Article III, section 20, of the Constitution. For private corporations or associations to administer governmental functions would lead to chaos, but to hold that the proprietary functions of municipalities cannot be administered by individuals or private corporations would paralyze municipal progress.

I make these observations and this illustration to call special attention to the necessity of reading the Constitution, where it relates to the powers of the legislative branch of the government, in a broad and liberal way, looking to its spirit as more controlling than its mere words. If a statute does not offend against the spirit, does not really do the thing which the constitution means to prohibit, then it should be sustained, although its form may be liable to objection under the strict words of the prohibition.”</blockquote>

As to <em>such </em>property, municipalities and townships “stand on the same footing as would any individual or body of persons upon whom the like special franchises had been conferred”: per Chief Justice Nelson<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> of the Supreme Court of New York (1843), in <em>Bailey v. New York City, </em><a href="/citations/?q=3%20Hill%20531" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="3 Hill 531">3 Hill 531</a>, 539, citing <em>Dartmouth College v.

Even if there was some slight doubt in my mind about the constitutionality of these acts that would not justify me in judging them unconstitutional. As Mr. Justice Linn, speaking for this court in the Tranter case, supra, said (quoting from <em>Sharpless v. Mayor of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/21/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="21 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="411603" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0147-01">21 Pa. 147</a>, 164) : “We can declare an Act of Assembly void, only when it violates the consti<a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>tution <em>clearly, palpably, plainly; </em>and in such manner as to leave <em>no doubt </em>or hesitation in our minds.”</p>

We should never forget,” said he, “that it [the constitution] is an instrument of government we are to construe; and . . . that must be the truest exposition which best harmonizes with its design, its objects, and its general structure.”</p>

For example in <em>Baily v. Phila., </em><a href="/pa/184/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="184 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="987926" data-case-paths="/pa/184/0594-01">184 Pa. 594</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%20494" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="39 A. 494">39 A. 494</a>, this court, speaking through Justice Mitchell, said: “The gas works are the property of the City of Philadelphia, not as a municipality but as a business corporation. ... In the performance of that function [supplying light], the city acts under authority merely and not under municipal obligation. . . . Hence, the city may change its mode of action. . . . It is urged that the city . . . cannot abdicate the func<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>tion [of lighting]. . . . This brings us back to the preliminary question on which the whole case rests, whether supplying . . . gas for lighting purposes is a strictly municipal function, or merely a power conferred on the city as a corporation. If the former, it is a duty as well as a power, and cannot be abandoned; if the latter, it is an authority only and may be exercised or not at the city’s option.” This court there held that Philadelphia had the right to lease its gas works to a private corporation for thirty years. If a city’s leasing of its gas works to a private corporation does not offend Article III, section 20, of the Constitution, I cannot understand how a township’s providing by due enactments that in a certain contingency of default, the bondholders who furnished the money with which to build a sewer system can, through a trustee or receiver take charge of that system and have the rentals applied to the liquidation of those bonds, offends Article III, section 20, of the Constitution. Providing a lighting system and providing a sewer system are equally functions of a municipality in its <em>proprietary capacity </em>and a municipality can deal with the property it holds in that capacity exactly as the township of Abington has dealt with it in the instant ease. Article III, section 20, of the Constitution has nothing whatever to do with property held by municipalities and townships in their proprietary capacity, and sewer systems, as this court has said at least three times in recent years “are owned by municipalities in their proprietary capacity.”</p>
