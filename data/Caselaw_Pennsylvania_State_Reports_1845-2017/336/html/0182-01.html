Walter Thompson Company, a commercial advertising corporation, for the transmission of a series of sponsored radio programs over one of its networks, comprising 26 stations. The series was sponsored by Shell Eastern Petroleum Products, Inc. The principal performer on the programs was A1 Jolson, a comedian. All of the participants, including the announcer, were employed and paid directly by the advertising company. A script for each program was prepared in advance, submitted to the broadcaster, and followed exactly by the performers at rehearsals in the broadcasting studio, where it was approved. The script for June 15, 1935, called for an interview by Jolson with the winner of an annual golf championship. In broadcasting from defendant’s studio in Radio City, New York, Jolson, when the program was one-half or two-thirds completed, suddenly interpolated an extemporaneous remark. In response to the golf champion’s statement that he secured his first job at the Summit Hotel, Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Jolson said: “That’s a rotten hotel.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The interjected remark was made without warning; it did not appear in the script, had not been made at rehearsal, and defendant did not know the words were to be used. Present in the studios were <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>defendant’s production director and the Thompson program director; neither had an opportunity to prevent the interjection.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[269,508,1151,478]]]'>An action in trespass for defamation was brought to recover damages for injury to the hotel’s reputation and business. No substantial attempt was made to show special damages, and the trial judge instructed the jury that the remarks were “slanderous per se.” The lessor broadcasting company was held liable for damages in the sum of $15,000, as awarded by the jury. Motions for new trial and judgment n. o. v. being refused, this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.6",234,[268,998,1149,369]]]'>The important question raised is whether a radio broadcasting company which leases its facilities is liable for an impromptu defamatory statement, interjected “ad lib.” into a radio broadcast by a person, hired by the lessees, and not in the employ of the broadcasting company, the words being carried to the radio listeners by its facilities.</p>
    <p id="b234-6" data-blocks='[["BL_234.7",234,[265,1379,1150,469]]]'>Although foreshadowed in one or two decisions and articles, this problem is unique; it is the first time the precise question has come before an appellate court in the United States or England. The law of defamation by radio is very much in its infancy, though there have been a few cases involving the liability of a broadcasting station or company therefor. . But the situations involved in those decisions differ vastly from that which is before us.</p>
    <p id="b234-7" data-blocks='[["BL_234.8",234,[263,1870,1151,414]]]'>The court below held that defendant’s liability was absolute though it was without any fault. The fact that it rented its facilities to another to publish and disseminate a nondefamatory program, and that the defamatory interjection was spoken by lessee’s employee under circumstances which precluded anticipation or prevention by the broadcaster, was treated as immaterial.</p>

    <p id="b235-3" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[207,521,1153,1519]]]'>The feature which distinguishes this case from the many cases cited for so-called liability without fault, is that here the broadcasting company rented its facilities to the advertising agency to broadcast a legitimate program. For this purpose the facilities were under the control of the agency. Appellant’s program director could not have prevented the utterance by lessee’s performer because of its suddenness; the supervision he exercised was merely to see that the facilities carried the program contained in the script. The duty of the monitor in the control room was to modulate and correct vocal sounds, and secure the audible transmission of intelligible, harmonious speech; he was, to this extent, as much a part of the rented facilities as the broadcasting equipment itself. His duty being to see that the program was produced clearly to the public over the air, he would be unable to exclude or eliminate a brief defamatory interjection, not only because of its suddenness, but also because his time is fully occupied with the technical details of his work. Moreover, it would require an expert in law to detect in extended remarks what was, or was not, defamation. In view of the positive assertion that, notwithstanding these circumstances, the broadcasting company is absolutely liable without fault, it will be necessary to examine the theory of absolute liability and the subjects to which it has been heretofore applied, so as to ascertain whether it is appropriate in this new form of defamation.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[208,2052,1153,371]],["BL_236.1",236,[273,355,1154,689]]]'>Some writers have traced the origin of liability without fault to an ancient principle that every wrong must have a remedy, and therefore it is urged that the doctrine is not new to the law of torts, in many phases of which it may be found today. Others, on the contrary, have stated that the judicial determination that there may be liability without fault cannot, in strict reason<a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>ing, be applied to tort law, which is grounded in intentional wrongful conduct or negligence, but that it, rather, assumes an independent sphere of compensation for injurious acts. The confusion of concepts has come about through the extension of the principle of liability without fault covering injuries to land or to rights in land, to tort liability to persons. Distinguished legal scholars, however, have pointed out that the rule of absolute liability persists in several actions, generally included in the field of tort law, such as trespass q. c. f., trespass for nuisance and trespass for injuries caused by wild or domestic animals known to be dangerous, as well as some others which will be touched on later.</p>
    <p id="b236-4" data-blocks='[["BL_236.5",236,[277,1063,1149,423]]]'>In our State, the doctrine of absolute liability has been invoked, almost without exception, only in that small group of actions which redress injuries to land, and it is only as to these that it can be fairly said that the doctrine prevails. This liability is a survival of the medieval law dictated by the landlord, in which the protection of the uninterrupted enjoyment of real property was a primary consideration.</p>
    <p id="b236-5" data-blocks='[["BL_236.6",236,[279,1498,1149,315]],["BL_237.1",237,[222,356,1150,310]]]'>In the very earliest times, all rights, real and personal, were probably entitled to absolute protection, and every injury redressed regardless of fault,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> but a sharp line of distinction has since been marked between liability for injuries to land and injuries to persons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The case of injuries to land may now be said to be the gen<a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>eral exception to the modern rule that liability will not be predicated on innocent and diligent conduct. A tort today implies fault or wrong. Tort liability must be founded upon some blameworthy conduct, or lack of due care resulting in the violation of a duty owing to others.</p>
    <p id="b237-3" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[223,687,1150,371]]]'>It was in the Nineteenth Century that the law of negligence in torts had its development. Personal-injury cases then consumed the greater portion of the time of the courts. Cases concerning rights in land yielded their earlier prominence, and the rules of law applicable to them have consequently remained, in the most part, unchanged, even to the present day.</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.5",237,[223,1069,1151,428]]]'>In Pennsylvania, the principle of liability without fault for injuries to the person has received scant consideration. The great body of our law of liability for personal injuries is that of liability through fault; liability based almost exclusively on wrongful conduct. There is, therefore, no proper analogy between the cases of liability without fault for injuries to land and those for personal injuries where fault must be present.</p>

In <em>Malone v.

Intrusions upon land by persons, animals, or substances cast thereon, usually involve intentional or negligent invasion of the close. The law, recognizing the natural tendency of cattle to stray, imposes a duty on the possessor to keep his flock from another’s land or to answer in damages. See <em>Barber v.

Here it would seem that the rule is not “absolute liability,” but that there is a duty to conform to a high standard of care. There is no case in this State where the owner of cattle has been held liable for damages caused by them where he built and maintained an adequate fence which was destroyed through no fault of his. And, in driving livestock along the highway, the OAvner or possessor is liable only in the absence of reasonable care. <em>Erdman v.

The strict rules of libel were originally directed at the printing press, which provided a wider means of publication. The differences between libel and slander, and the comparative ease of recovery in libel as against the more restricted and less stringent liability in slander, are well known.

The more serious consideration is the permanence of the printed libel, and its capacity for continuous future harm over a wide area. Slander, or the spoken word, is not bound to any set form; it is easily fabricated and made to appear much worse than actually spoken; it offers opportunity for fraudulent and fictitious claims; it is usually uttered in the presence of a few.

Newspaper defamations possess possibilities for real harm far greater than defamations by radio, as they constitute permanent, continuing records, which, through circulation, are constantly republished.

It was not conceived nor dreamed of when the law of libel and slander was being formulated.

The danger of attempting to apply the fixed principles of law governing either libel or slander to this new medium of communication is obvious. But the law is not so firmly and rigidly cast that it is incapable of meeting a new wrong as the demands of progress and change require. In this State our tort actions are in trespass; the pleader need not lay his cause either in slander or in libel, and, as defamation by radio possesses many attributes of both libel and slander, but differs from each, it might be regarded as a distinct form of action. Certainly, there is no necessity of extending to this situation a so-called rule of absolute liability without fault, particularly when our law of libel merely creates a high standard of care.

W. 82</a>, the defamatory remarks were made by a political speaker to whom it had extended its facilities. The speaker used a prepared script that had not been previously submitted to the broadcasting company, though it could have obtained the script had it so desired. No effort was made to stop the transmission although the length of the remarks would have enabled the company to have done so. The principal defense was privilege under the Federal Statute which prohibits the censoring of political addresses. The case was submitted on the issue of negligence resulting in a verdict for the defendant. This was reversed, the court holding the defendant liable by analogy to a newspaper publication. This was not a case of “ad libbing” nor of “leasing.” In <em>Miles v. Louise Wasmer, Inc., </em><a href="/wash/172/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="172 Wash. 466" data-case-ids="861314" data-case-paths="/wash/172/0466-01">172 Wash. 466</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20P.2d%20847" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="20 P.2d 847">20 P. (2d) 847</a>, the speaker was an announcer employed by the radio station. The defamatory words derogatory to plaintiff were from a prepared script which the company could have edited itself. Under the authority of the Sorensen case, liability was upheld. In <em>Coffey v. Midland Broadcasting Co., </em><a href="/f-supp/8/0889-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="8 F.

Time and facilities were leased to a commercial advertiser and the speaker was an employee of the advertiser. The defamatory remarks apparently were part of a prepared and rehearsed program appearing in the script submitted to and passed on by the broadcasting company in New York. The court in remanding the case recognized that the Sorensen and Miles cases could have been decided on the basis of negligence but held that in this particular case the facts were broader.
