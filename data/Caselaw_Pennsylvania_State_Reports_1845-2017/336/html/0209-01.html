    <p id="b261-10" data-blocks='[["BL_261.14",261,[180,1674,1153,641]]]'>On October 2, 1933, the Columbia Gas and Electric Company, a Delaware corporation, with its principal office in New York, applied for and obtained a certificate of authority to transact in Pennsylvania the business of “production of oil, gas and electricity and holding of real estate.” Prom that date until October 31, 1935, it owned and operated in this State plants for the manufacture of gasoline and natural gas. In the conduct of that business for the year 1935 it employed tangible property of a book value of $331,813.39, paid wages of $14,926.27 and received from sales $31,451.47, all within or assignable to the State.</p>

The great hulk of its activities consisted in acting as a holding company. It owned 50% to 100% of the stock of some 50 subsidiaries, a substantial investment in stocks, bonds, mortgages and notes of other companies, and had a large amount of accounts receivable and cash. In 1935 the total value of these intangible assets amounted to approximately $446,000,000. The court below found that the legal situs of this intangible property was outside of this State.</p>

    <p id="b263-3" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[180,479,1153,810]]]'>The taxing officials, from the argument presented in this Court, evidently based the settlement upon the assumption that the company was doing a holding company business in this State because of the following facts: The company had under lease several floors of the Union Trust Company Building in Pittsburgh at a rental of $80,000 per year, which, in turn, was billed proportionately to the operating subsidiaries in Pennsylvania. The company had on deposit in the Union Trust Company from $1,300,000 to $1,400,000. From this account loans were made to its subsidiaries and repaid by them into it; into the account were received dividends of upwards of $658,000, and approximately $522,000, representing the proceeds of gas sold by appellee to another company.</p>

It concluded from this, as well as other evidence, that the company did not conduct a holding company business in this State. It then found that the amendment imposed a franchise tax on foreign corporations; that such tax measured by the capital stock was subject to constitutional restrictions imposed by the due process, equal protection and interstate commerce clauses of the Federal Constitution; that the allocation of taxable value to this State must bear a fair relation to the amount of local business done here by the foreign corporation; that, in this instance, the apportionment formula resulted in allocating a too large taxable value to Pennsylvania, principally because of the <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>large amount of intangible properties wbieh were located in another State and used solely in the performance of the holding company functions. The court concluded that the formula and allocation fractions prescribed by the statute to ascertain the taxable value of the franchise, operated not only unreasonably in the case of the Columbia Gas and Electric Company but were “. . . inherent in the method of allocation, and arbitrarily and unreasonably affect every corporation which has a substantial part of its intangible property outside of the State, because under the system prescribed by the Act intangible property is brought proportionately into the State for a base upon which to apply the tax.” It therefore declared the Act unconstitutional generally. From this decision the Commonwealth has appealed.</p>

L. 420, as amended April 25, 1929, P. L. 657. Domestic corporations paid a tax of 5 mills on the whole amount of their capital stock less certain exemptions. Foreign corporations paid a tax at the same rate on that proportion of the value of their entire capital stock which the tangible assets within the State bore to all assets of the company.</p>

L. 184, is entitled: “An Act to Further Amend ... by substituting a franchise tax on foreign corporations in lieu of the capital stock tax on such corporations.” Section 2IB of the Act provides: “Every foreign corporation . . . shall be subject to and pay ... a franchise tax at the rate of 5 mills upon a taxable value to be determined in the following manner: The actual value of its whole capital stock of all kinds, including common, special and preferred shall be ascertained in the manner prescribed in the 20th Section of this Act and shall then be divided into three equal parts.” To each one-third of the value of this entire capital stock there are applied certain fractions, representative of the <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>fundamental elements of corporate structure, that there may be determined the taxable value allocable to this State to which the tax rate is to be applied. In the first fraction the numerator is the value of tangible property within the State and the denominator is the value of the entire tangible property wherever situated. In the second fraction the numerator is the gross expenditure for wages, salaries, commissions, et cetera paid in this State and the denominator the wages, et cetera, of all employees everywhere. In the third fraction the numerator is the gross receipts from business assignable to the State and the denominator is the total gross receipts from all business. As above noted, each fraction is applied against one-third of the value of the capital stock. Their sum total represents the taxable value.</p>

The assets of foreign corporations, so far as they were comprised of intangibles, were wholly free of tax notwithstanding that they may have played an important part in the conduct of the company’s local business.

We concur with the court below in its conclusion that the tax is a franchise tax and not a property tax. The legislature in the title to the act called it a franchise tax. While not conclusive, some weight should be given to this designation in determining the nature of the tax.

Where a tax is imposed directly on specific property it is a property tax. The incidence of a franchise or privilege tax is upon a franchise or privilege and not upon property or capital.

But we were there determining whether the owners of shares of stock in foreign corporations which pay taxes to this State should pay a personal property tax on these shares. Having discovered that it was the evident purpose of the legislature to have domestic corporations pay a capital stock tax of 5 mills and foreign corporations a tax of 5 mills on a taxable value, of which an underlying element is capital stock, we held that there was enough similarity between the methods of taxing foreign and domestic corporations to render exempt from personal property tax the shares of stock in foreign corporations, just as shares of stock in domestic corporations were exempt. The basic problem in that case was not the nature of the tax imposed on foreign corporations by the 1935 Act, but rather the problem of the exemption from personal property tax of the shares of stock in such foreign corporations.</p>

In part, this is demonstrated by the considerations which enter into the valuation and appraisement of capital stock. Capital stock, as that term is employed in the Act, is a valution of the corporation as a business, enterprise, not an appraisement of bare worth of tangible and intangible properties. Section 20 of the Act makes it a reflection of the going-concern value of the entire organization. See <em>Commonwealth v. Delaware, Susquehanna &amp; Schuyl kill R.

The determination of the value of the franchise under the amendatory Act may bring into consideration property situated within the Commonwealth, and give to it a functional value as part of an organic unit.

The Act considers the amount of tangible property in the State, compares it with all tangible property and applies it against the same base. Generally speaking, corporate business is transacted through the use of tangibles rather than intangibles. As the ratio of tangible assets in the State to tangibles situated everywhere varies, so it may be said that the value of the corporate franchise within this state varies. Moreover, the intangible worth of a going corporation as well as intangible assets themselves may be said to have some degree of correlation as to situs with tangibles. It was undoubtedly within the power of the legislature to permit this correlation to be worked out through the use of a fraction which considered tangible assets only, leaving a more exact correspondence to be brought about through the interaction and effect of the other fractions composed of gross receipts and payrolls. The fraction composed of the ratio of payroll within this State to payroll everywhere is indicative of corporate activity within this State, whether in the form of manufacturing, selling or otherwise. As these activities increase within this State so it may be said the value of the right to do business in this State increases. If the legislature had chosen to use a single one of these fractions and applied the same to the entire capital stock, certainly it could hardly be contended that it would be without its powers,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> provided proper consideration be given in each <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>case to the elements to be included or omitted in determining the value of the entire capital stock as the measure of the tax.

That it is the value of the franchise rather than the actual value of the property which is taken into account is clear from the factors which enter into the apportionment. They are the same which this Court considered in <em>Turco Paint &amp; Varnish Co. v.

In determining the franchise tax to be levied on the Columbia Gas and Electric Company, the value of its assets represented by capital stock used in connection with its holding company business should have been excluded by the taxing officials. In so holding it is to be understood that not all intangibles are to be disregarded for, to the extent that intangibles enter into the exercise of the franchise conferred by this state or privileges actually exercised within the state, such intangible value must properly be included. This redetermination of the tax due the Commonwealth will also require a readjustment in the figures prescribed in the statutory formula. For purposes of making the correct calculation of tax due, it will be essential that the separate phases of the business be determined not only with respect to capital stock values, but also with respect to computation of the statutory fractions.</p>

In such cases such assets must be excluded from the value of the entire capital stock in determining the measure of the tax. Cf. <em>Hans Rees’ Sons v.
