These findings expressly refuted the contentions of the defendants, and the chancellor thereupon held that Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Act had no reasonable relation to the safety of appellee’s employees or passengers, or of the public, and that those requirements, being oppressive, unreasonable and arbitrary, were unconstitutional in their application to appellee. Three hundred and forty-six exceptions, including those to the rejection of appellants’ requests, were filed.

The Act is a regulatory measure, within the class of legislation under which the Public Utility Commission acts. The Commission, as an arm of the legislature, has power to make certain regulations for utilities, but if the cost of compliance therewith is arbitrarily and unreasonably oppressive, such orders will be held void. See <em>Lehigh Valley R. R. Co. v.

General orders of the Commission may be unconstitutional as to one utility, and constitutional as to others.

What impressed us most was the highly speculative possibility of the danger of accidents alleged to exist. The resultant effectiveness of the Act under these circumstances could only be out of all reasonable proportion to the cost involved, which was found to be more than $4,500,000, or, as conceded by appellants, at least, in a request for a finding of fact, $2,900,000.</p>
