On April 14, 1936, counsel for the plaintiff accepted service of notice from defendant that on April 20, 1936, a petition for the satisfaction of the judgment would be presented. Plaintiff did not appear in opposition to the motion, whereupon the court directed the prothonotary “to enter full satisfaction upon the Judgment Docket of the said judgment ...” The satisfaction of the judgment was prima facie evidence that it had been paid by plaintiff’s taking the mortgaged premises at the foreclosure sale. It will be noticed that the petition to satisfy was not filed until six months had passed after the foreclosure sale and that in the interim the plaintiff had taken no steps pursuant to the Act of July 1, 1935, P. L. 503, to establish the amount of a deficiency judgment. So the matter stood until May 18, 1938, more than two years after the proceedings to satisfy, when the plaintiff filed the petition which began the present proceed<a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>ings. This petition set forth various steps culminating in the order of satisfaction, with an averment that plaintiff had no notice of the application to satisfy. As the defendant’s answer denies this averment, and sets forth a copy of plaintiff’s attorney’s acceptance of service— two facts not now challenged by plaintiff — we accept them and regard the order as one made after notice.</p>
    <p id="b431-3" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[171,741,1153,1027]]]'>Petitioner avers that the deficiency judgments Act approved July 1, 1935, P. L. 503, “upon the authority of which the above judgment was marked satisfied has been held unconstitutional ...” and that petitioner’s judgment against defendant remains a lien and that the court was without power to authorize the prothonotary to satisfy the judgment. Various grounds of unconstitutionality were asserted and the following relief was asked: “To grant a rule against the above named Antonio Zappa [defendant] to show cause why the judgment entered as of October Term, 1934, D. ¡3. B. No. 249, in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, should not be opened and your petitioner let into a defense as to the entry of said satisfaction, and to show cause why the said satisfaction should not be stricken from the .record.” The rule was granted, and, after hearing, was discharged. This appeal followed. The question now is, Was there abuse of discretion?</p>

Acts done pursuant to statute may be sustained though it be subsequently held unconstitutional: <em>Phila. v. Ry. Co., </em><a href="/pa/142/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="142 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="976681" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0484-01">142 Pa. 484</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.%20982" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="21 A. 982">21 A. 982</a>; <em>Strauss v.

In the first case it appeared that the city of Philadelphia for many years acted on the assumption that the legislation subsequently held invalid was valid; it was therefore held that the city was estopped on equitable grounds from subsequently repudiating its prior construction and recovering from a defendant on the theory that the law had been void from the beginning. In the Strauss case, the question arose between the bank, which was a mortgage creditor, and other creditors of the insolvent debtor whose property was in tlie hands of a receiver. To ascertain the credit to be allowed by the bank, it foreclosed a mortgage and purchased the property at a nominal bid and, in the receivership proceedings, sought to prove for the difference. Objection was made to the claim unless credited with the value of the security which had been taken <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>at the foreclosure. To meet tlie objection, a proceeding was brought under the deficiency judgment Act of 1935, supra, to ascertain the “fair value” of the premises purchased; the bank participated in this proceeding and, after it was adjudicated, proved for the difference in the receivership proceedings. Thereafter, the deficiency judgment Act having been declared unconstitutional, the bank sought to repudiate its action and to claim for the full amount reduced only by the amount for which the property was bought in foreclosure. We held the bank was bound by the valuation proceeding, saying: “But, jurisdiction having attached, and no appeal having been taken <em>(Fine v. Soifer, </em><a href="/pa/288/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="288 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="1100848" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0164-01">288 Pa. 164</a>, 173), the judgment of the Blair County court as to the amount remaining due is not impaired by the fact that it was based upon a statute subsequently declared to be unconstitutional. The decision became the law of the case, and neither of the parties to it can now collaterally assail or controvert it . . .” The statute was unconstitutional and, in a sense, void, but the relation of the bank to the adjudication under the statute required that effect be given to it because it was a fact in the process of adjudicating the point presented.

Dentler, </em><a href="/pa/33/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="33 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="988407" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0495-01">33 Pa. 495</a>, 499, 500.</p>
