Plaintiff brought two suits which, by order of court, were tried together. The one claimed benefits under the two policies for the period from April 22, 1935, to October 22, 1936, and for a return of the premiums which he had paid for the years 1935 and 1936. The other claimed disability payments for the period from October 22, 1936, to December 22, 1937, and for a return of thei premiums paid for 1937. Verdicts were recovered by plaintiff and the court overruled defendant’s motions for judgments n. o. v. and for a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b496-9" data-blocks='[["BL_496.12",496,[259,1724,1149,698]]]'>Plaintiff owned and managed a retail men’s and women’s furnishing store. Taken sick with diabetes and a nervous disorder known as neuro circulatory asthenia, he was compelled to cease work after April 22, 1935. During the three months from April 3 to July 4, 1936, he was in and about his store for two or three hours a day, mainly upon the recommendation of his physician who thought that a moderate amount of labor might have a beneficial psychological effect. The experiment, however, was unsuccessful, and, except for the latter part of 1937 when he made a similar effort, plaintiff had not resumed work when the second suit was started on December 20, 1937. .</p>

While the testimony of plaintiff’s physicians was somewhat indefinite in regard to the likely permanency of his disability, it amounted in effect to an expression of opinion on their part that he would probably not recover from his illness. As for the fact that he was able for three months in the spring of 1936 to do at least some work, this represented merely a trial effort suggested by the doctor for therapeutic purposes, and as plaintiff found that he was obliged to relinquish the attempt this interval in his enforced idleness would not, from a legal standpoint, impair the totality of his disability: <em>Kramer v.

If he is unable to do a substantial part — the greater part — of his ordinary work, that is a total disability. On the other hand, if he is just disabled from doing the lesser portion of his work, that is not total disability.” This is exactly the charge which was disapproved in <em>Cooper v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/317/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="317 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="8846033" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0405-01">317 Pa. 405</a>, where the policies provided that disability payments were to be made if the insured should become wholly disabled “from engaging in any and every occu<a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>pation or employment for wage or profit.” (In the present case the phrase used is: “totally and permanently disabled . . . so as to be prevented thereby from engaging in any occupation and performing any work for compensation or profit”.) The court there said, in an opinion by the present Chief Justice (pp. 407-408) : “It should be clear that disability to engage in <em>any </em>business or occupation does not mean disability merely to carry on the same business or occupation that he had previously been engaged in. ... A reasonable interpretation of the words of the policy is, that the total disability to engage in any occupation or work for compensation or profit which is insured against, means inability to perform any of the duties of any occupation which the insured might be ordinarily capable of performing.” Of course, as was there further pointed out, this does not mean that the insured must be a helpless invalid in order to become entitled to benefits under such a policy, nor is he barred from recovery because he may be able to perform a few trivial and desultory acts or light work of a limited character and at irregular intervals, but it does mean that it is not enough for the insured to show that he is unable to do a substantial part of his ordinary work. When the learned trial judge’s attention was called to the matter he stated that he considered that what he had told the jury was substantially the same as saying that total disability was such as would “prevent the insured from . . . carrying on any gainful business or occupation and his performing . . . an essential part of the work incident thereto.” But the two interpretations are not “substantially the same” but wholly different, and it would necessarily be a matter of conjecture as to which version the jury accepted: <em>Silvano v.

Plaintiff was asked in cross-examination whether he had not been working since the first of January, 1938. <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>This was objected to on the ground that his claim was for disability payments only until December 22, 1937, and that his condition since that time was immaterial. One of his witnesses was his sales clerk, who was asked in cross-examination whether plaintiff had not been back in the store since January, 1938. The same question was also asked of plaintiff’s brother who had taken over the management of the store. Plaintiff’s two attending physicians were each asked on cross-examination whether they knew what plaintiff had been doing since January 1, 1938. The learned trial judge sustained objections to all these questions, as well as to the interrogation of a physician regarding the condition in which he found plaintiff upon an examination made by him on behalf of defendant on November 14, 1938, a few days before the trial. These rulings raise the question whether plaintiff would be entitled to benefits for permanent disability if defendant were able to prove that at the time of the trial he was well and had returned to work.</p>

Whether a person be disabled for days, months or years, if he ultimately recovers he has not been <em>permanently </em>disabled. Disability is permanent only when it endures for life. If plaintiff, who was forty-four years of age, was disabled until he was forty-six, but thereafter recovered and returned to work, he was not permanently disabled. Indeed, it would be a linguistic absurdity to say of a person that he was <em>permanently disabled for two years. </em>These policies are not health and accident policies designed to give relief to the insured during temporary periods, from time to time, in which he may be incapacitated for working, but are intended to provide protection only in case of the more grievous condition of total and permanent disability.</p>

Physicians, whatever their professional learning and skill, cannot always make reliable prognostications, for in our age science is constantly devising methods of overcoming diseases formerly considered incurable. Therefore, if the insured had to establish the fact of permanency of disability to a degree of absolute certainty, no benefits would be recoverable until his death had furnished the only indubitable proof. Such a requirement would defeat the very object of the insurance, which is to make the benefits immediately available to the insured and provide him with the wherewithal to live while deprived of his wages or earnings. <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>Recognizing this fact, the courts have uniformly held that it is necessary for the insured to prove only that he is suffering from a disability which is reasonably <em>likely </em>to endure for the remainder of his life; this he may do, for example, by the testimony of physicians expressing professional opinions to that effect.</p>

Such a provision does not mean that whenever a disability lasts for three months it is to be deemed “permanent” within the intendment of the policy, but merely that, if there has been a continuance of the disability for such minimum period, <em>and </em>if, also, <em>due proof of its likely permanency is </em>furnished, the company will commence making payments (beginning as of the date of the commencement of such disability) on the provisional supposition that the disability is in fact a permanent one.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Thus the <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>insured may gain the benefit of his apparent condition while it lasts, but he cannot be given the benefit of the doubt when the reality is established. If, therefore, the company, being dissatisfied with the proofs furnished for that purpose, requires the insured to establish permanency of disability by evidence in court at a trial of the issue, and it is then shown that the disability was not a permanent one, however much it may have seemed so originally, no payments are recoverable, for a disability ended before proof of it is made could not have been a permanent one.</p>

This would result only because the truth became better ascertainable at the later period; recovery at an earlier trial would have been upon the basis of an alleged fact then apparently true but subsequently found to be untrue. In the present case, if defendant refused to pay benefits because it did not consider that the proof submitted by plaintiff established a reasonable likelihood of his permanent disability, it should have been given the opportunity at the trial to show, if it could, that its refusal was justified because plaintiff, in fact, had not been permanently disabled.</p>

      <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[268,1737,1153,680]]]'> There sometimes occurs a particular provision in a policy which requires special interpretation. Thus in <em>Losnecki v. Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New </em>York, <a href="/pa-super/106/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="106 Pa. Super. 259" data-case-ids="703058" data-case-paths="/pa-super/106/0259-01">106 Pa. Superior Ct. 259</a>, there was a clause that “if the insured shall be totally disabled as defined in this policy for a continuous period of not less than ninety days, such disability shall, during its further continuance, <em>be presumed to be permanent </em>...” The court apparently regarded this as establishing, not a factual, but a conclusive or irrebuttable presumption, and therefore, as the policy in effect defined permanent disability as one existing for ninety days, the insured might recover for each and every recurrence of disability of ninety days or more during the course of his lifetime. Whether this interpretation was right or wrong, the decision rested upon the clause limiting the ordinary meaning of the term “permanent,” and has no bearing upon the policies here in suit.</p>
