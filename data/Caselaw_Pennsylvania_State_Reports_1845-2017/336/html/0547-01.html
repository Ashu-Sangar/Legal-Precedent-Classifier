Judgment was entered upon the bond. The judgment was opened to permit the wife to make defense, and the trial, on the question of her liability, resulted in a finding in her favor.

Thomas McCaffrey, brother of John, was in the real estate business. Thomas introduced John to the assistant manager of the mortgage department of Peoples Savings and Trust Company, now Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company, the appellant. John told the assistant manager that he desired to apply for a mortgage loan. The assistant manager at his request filled out a printed form of application for the loan. John stated that he owned the property and that the mortgage was to be his. He signed the application and the address of Thomas’s real estate office was noted thereon. The loan was approved by the expectant lender. A letter was written to Thomas apprizing him of the fact. At this time it was not known that the property <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>to be mortgaged was owned by John and Ms wife by entireties. This was discovered when tbe title was examined at the instance of the attorney for the trust company. He prepared a bond and mortgage to be signed by both husband and wife and sent them to Thomas McCaffrey for execution. They were signed by husband and wife and returned to the attorney, who had the mortgage recorded. The papers are dated April 12, 1920. April 16, 1920, the attorney drew his firm’s check to the order of husband and wife for the amount of the loan and mailed it to them. The check was returned with their endorsements.</p>

L. 344 (sec. 2) prohibits her from assuming. The jury found on competent testimony that Mrs. McCaffrey had nothing to do with this loan except to sign the bond and mortgage when her husband requested <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>her to do1 so. It is undisputed that it was John McCaffrey (Mary’s husband) who applied orally for the loan and who signed the application for it. William Maisch, assistant manager of the mortgage department of the appellant company so testified. The majority opinion correctly states: “John told the assistant manager that he desired to apply for a mortgage loan. . . . The loan was approved.” Maisch al^o testified that the three applications for extensions of this loan were made by John McCaffrey, the husband. The circumstances attending Mrs. McCaffrey’s signing of the bond and mortgage were related by her under oath as follows: “I came out of the laundry with a basket full of clothes one afternoon about four o’clock and he said, ‘Mary, come here I want you to sign this.’ ” She was then asked these questions and made these answers: “Q. Who said that? A. My Mister, John McCaffrey. He said, ‘Mary, come here I want you to sign this,’ and I had my sleeves rolled up and I went and signed it and I took my basket of clothes and went out and hung up the clothes. . . . Q.

Miercken, </em><a href="/citations/?q=4%20Yeates%20437" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="4 Yeates 437">4 Yeates 437</a>, 440, and <em>McGlinn Distilling Co. v.

We also said in the same case that “the disability which the law casts upon a married woman in making a note [or other legal promise] as security for another is an <em>absolute </em>disability. Nothing that she can say or do can remove it.” This being the law, it follows that the <em>good fcvith </em>of the lender of money on a married woman’s promise to pay money which in fact it loaned to another, has no bear<a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>ing whatever on the question of her liability to discharge the promise. A married woman can no more be held to such a promise than can an infant. It is declared in 10 R. C. L. p. 738, sec. 55, that “if the contract [of a married woman] relates to a matter concerning which the common law disabilities continue, so that the contract is void for want of capacity or power to make it, the doctrine of estoppel cannot be invoked.” In <em>Pine Brook Bank v. </em>Kearney, <a href="/pa/303/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="303 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1130084" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0223-01">303 Pa. 223</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20365" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="154 A. 365">154 A. 365</a>, this court decided a case of a married woman’s suretyship where the married woman filed with the lending bank a <em>certificate </em>that the note was given for her own personal benefit and for the improvement of her separate estate. Since this certificate was contrary to <em>the facts, </em>we held that a married woman could not remove her statutory disability to contract by lying about it and that in an action to collect the judgment note the married woman could defend on the ground that she had <em>in fact </em>signed the note as surety for another. In <em>Murray v. McDonald, </em><a href="/pa/236/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="236 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="986762" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0026-01">236 Pa. 26</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20579" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="84 A. 579">84 A. 579</a>, this court held (quoting from the syllabus) : “A judgment entered against a married woman on a judgment note which she signed as surety for her husband, will be opened because the signing of such a note by a wife, not only contravenes public policy but also offends against a positive statute. The wife is not estopped from asserting her right to have the judgment opened because she falsely certified on the face of the note that it was given for her own personal use and not as a guaranty or surety for any other person; nor is she estopped by the fact that she took no steps to have the judgment opened until four years after its entry.”</p>

In the Levin Case the bank actually credited the wife’s account with the loan and she then signed a check for the money to her husband, but this was held, under the facts, to be immaterial and to be only <em>the form </em>which the transaction took. A long line of opinions of this court on this subject are <em>diametrically opposed </em>to the proposition that if a lender of money acts in good faith and in no way “deceives” a married woman and puts her name on the check as one of the payees, she can by merely endorsing that check become accommodation endorser, maker, guarantor or surety for another, the Act of June 8, 1893, to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

The <em>mortgage </em>was a valid, enforceable instrument, since there is no limitation on the power of a married woman to mortgage her real estate (with her husband’s joinder) for any purpose she may see fit <em>(Hanover Trust Co. v.

      <em>Under the facts found by the jury, </em>Mrs. McCaffrey’s signature on the bond imposed <em>no obligation whatsoever upon her, </em>because the Act of 1893 <em>prohibited </em>her from assuming an obligation as guarantor or surety for another. In <em>Johnson County v. Rugg, </em><a href="/iowa/18/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="18 Iowa 137" data-case-ids="339467" data-case-paths="/iowa/18/0137-01">18 Iowa 137</a>, it was held that “plaintiff’s remedy [against the wife] extended only to the mortgaged property,” and that the court could <em>not </em>direct a “general execution to issue against her, if the mortgaged property failed to pay the debt,” for though she had given a note at the time she signed the mortgage she did not receive any part of the borrowed money. The majority opinion in the instant case virtually nullifies the last six lines of section 2 of the Act of 1893, for it makes it possible to impose on a married woman liability for the debt of another by having her and that other person pledge with the lender some real or personal property which they jointly own and <em>then execute a bond or note to take care of a deficiency. </em>Suppose John McCaffrey had said to the bank: “I want to borrow $1,000. As security, my wife and I will place in your possession a car we jointly own and we will also both sign a note for $1,000.” Would the wife be bound by such a note? The Act of 1893 answers “No.” I cannot comprehend how the wife’s joining in the execution of the mortgage here (as she had the legal power to do) makes her liable on a <em>wholly distinct contract, </em>to wit, the bond, which the law <em>denies </em>her the power to execute <em>as surety for another.</em>

She was in no way deceived by its officers. When she endorsed the check they could rely upon her signature as showing that she received the money and that the loan was to her as well as to her husband.” This carries the implication that if a married woman is not <em>deceived </em>by the lender, but fully understands what she is doing, she is liable on the note or bond which she signs. This would mean that if she actually <em>intends </em>to become an accommodation maker or surety she would be liable. Such a premise ignores the main purpose of the law, which is to protect her against herself. None of the adjudicated cases has ever limited relief to instances where deception was practiced on the wife.</p>

If this is meant to imply that the borrowed money was used for the purpose of improving this property or in any other manner from which the wife derived advantage <em>there is not an iota of testimony to support it. </em>Even if there was such testimony, the question would still be for the jury. Despite the jury’s finding in Mrs. McCaffrey’s favor, this court now sanctions the imposition of liability upon all of her individual assets in order to pay her husband’s debt, though she never even met the agents of the lender of the money or made any representations of any kind to them.</p>

The fact that her co-owner is her husband can make no difference.” I believe that no previous decision of this court holds that a married woman who is a co-owner or tenant in common of property can become surety or guarantor of a loan when “as here” the jury found that the loan was made to another than herself, whether that other be her husband or the co-owner or co-tenant or someone else. The majority opinion states that defendant “years afterwards repudiated the transaction and denied liability.” I find no support for this statement. Mrs. McCaffrey had nothing to do with the loan; she did not even know that her husband was borrowing money. Her sole connection with it was in signing some papers at his request. No attempt was made to assert a claim against her, and no notice to her or demand for payment of principal or interest was made until the inception of the present case. The loan was extended several times on the application of the husband alone. When in 1934 judgment was entered on the bond, plaintiff stated of record in its petition that the judgment was desired so that it might “proceed with the sale of the property covered by the mortgage.” Not until 1937 did plaintiff request an assignment to it of the rents from the other properties. It was not until April 29, 1937, that the plaintiff notified Mrs. McCaffrey that it would issue an execution against her property unless she executed this assignment. The petition to open judgment and restrain execution was filed May 11, 1937, i. e., twelve days after the first notice to her that the plaintiff intended to hold her individual property liable for her husband’s debt. The majority opinion says: “Having joined in the obligation and received the proceeds of the loan, she [Mrs. McCaffrey] is liable and it is immaterial what she did with the money after receiving it.” Whether or not Mrs. McCaffrey <em>received the proceeds of the loan </em>was the <em>very fact in issue </em>in this case. She testified that she received “not a cent” of that loan, <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>and there was absolutely no testimony <em>to the contrary. </em>The jury believed her and rendered a verdict in accordance with that finding of fact and that verdict should, under the practice immemorially established, be conclusive in this court.

There a wife joined her husband in the execution of two mortgages on property held' by them as tenants by the entireties and in the execution of two bonds which the mortgages were given to secure. These bonds and mortgages were, accepted as a full release of a claim against <em>the husband. </em>Judgment was entered on one of the bonds, by virtue of its warrant, against both husband <em>and wife. </em>The latter secured a rule to open the judgment and one to satisfy it. Both rules were discharged and an appeal to this court folloAved. We reversed the order of the court below, and, speaking through Mr. Justice Drew, said: “The only question here involved is whether appellant was a surety on the bond upon Avhich judgment was entered. We think she was. The judgment ought to have been opened to let her into the defense accorded by the Married Women’s Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344, section 2.” He added: “Both husband and wife deposed that neither intended her undertaking to be that of a principal. There was no evidence to contradict them.” He then distinguished the case of <em>Frankford Trust Co. v.

If the note is given for her own benefit, it is valid; if it is given as “accommodation endorser, maker, guarantor or surety for another” it is -invalid. The validity of the note cannot be adjudged until the vital fact of its purpose is established. Therefore, it follows that as evidence of a legal obligation a married woman’s note is <em>on its face </em>valid; if a married woman pleads that her note was given for a prohibited purpose she has the burden of proving it.
