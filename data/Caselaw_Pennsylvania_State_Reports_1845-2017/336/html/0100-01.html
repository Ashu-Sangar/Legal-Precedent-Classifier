It is axiomatic- that he who asks to have a law declared unconstitutional takes upon himself the burden of proving beyond all doubt that it is so. This, of course, means that the legislature is presumed not only to have put the true interpretation on the Constitution, but also to have understood the facts of the particular case, and that it did not wilfully disregard either.

The designation of the city or county treasurer by the legislature as agent of the Commonwealth for the collection of certain taxes and fees is not the creation of a public office within the meaning of Article III, section 13, but is merely the establishment of an agency which the legislature may at any time modify or revote. The purpose of the framers of the Constitution in placing limitations upon legislative interference with the compensation received by a public officer for the duties normally incident to the office was to eliminate political or partisan pressure upon the incumbents of office after they had been elected or appointed: 8 Deb. Pa. Const. 332, 333. It was not their intent to narrowly circumscribe the appointment of such officers as special agents for the Commonwealth. It would be imposing an unreasonable restriction upon the legislature to hold that once having designated a certain city or county official as its agent for an express and limited purpose that it could not terminate such designation until the expira<a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>tion of the term of office held by such agent in any particular city or county. There is no relation whatsoever between the election to a city or county office and the express designation of that officer as a state agent, whose activities are solely statutory and entirely divorced from the functions of the office to which he was elected: <em>Knisely v. Cotterel, </em><a href="/pa/196/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="196 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="916794" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0614-01">196 Pa. 614</a>; <em>Luzerne County v.

Moreover, to hold as appellee urges would produce the result that a public officer during his term could not possibly be designated agent of the Commonwealth and be paid commissions upon fees collected by him in the course of such agency, since such appointment would involve a prohibited increase of his emoluments. In <em>Jones v. County of Northumberland, </em><a href="/pa-super/120/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="120 Pa. Super. 132" data-case-ids="986913" data-case-paths="/pa-super/120/0132-01">120 Pa. Superior Ct. 132</a>, it was held that the appointment of a city treasurer as agent to collect state and county taxes in a city during his term does not constitute a forbidden increase in emoluments under our Constitution. When the treasurer of Philadelphia is expressly named an agent for the State, in contradistinction to his normal duties as an elected public officer, he has no constitutional ground of objecting to the discontinuance of such agency by the legislature “because the state as principal could at any time change or withdraw the agency”; Com. <em>ex rel.
