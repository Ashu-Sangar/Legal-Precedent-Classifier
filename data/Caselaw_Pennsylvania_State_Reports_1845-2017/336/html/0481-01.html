Fifth Avenue, a main thoroughfare for traffic, with double street car tracks thereon, runs approximately east and west at the place where the accident occurred, and is intersected diagonally by Bellefield Avenue, which extends generally north and south. The crosswalk for pedestrians from the southwest to the northwest corners of the intersection is upon an angle toward the east, and is 71 feet in length, although Fifth Avenue is only 48 feet from curb to curb. The double tracks, totaling 14 feet 4 inches in width, are 21 feet from the south curb, and approximately 13 feet from the north curb of Fifth Avenue.</p>

She then walked to the southwest corner, where she waited until the trolley car passed, and the traffic light turned green for Bellefield Avenue. After looking to the left and observing that there was no oncoming traffic, she looked to her right or east, where she had a view for a distance of 320 feet to the point where Fifth Avenue curves toward the east, and there likewise the way was clear of vehicles. She started across the intersection to the northwest corner. As she neared the first rail of the trolley tracks, she looked again, and this time she noticed automobile headlights approaching from her right, about 300 feet distant. She continued to advance, directing her attention to the crosswalk upon which she was walking, which was rough and slippery from a recent rain, and at the same time watching for traffic upon Fifth Avenue.</p>

She thrust herself forward in an effort to escape injury, but the truck suddenly swerved and struck her with such force that she was hurled twenty feet from the place of impact. The truck was running upon the first or south rail of the tracks, over which plaintiff had just passed, and was, in consequence, upon the left or wrong side of Fifth Avenue, according to the direction in which it was proceeding.</p>

It turned red for Bellefield Avenue almost immediately after the accident. These witnesses also said that at the time she was struck, plaintiff was walking upon the usual pedestrian crossing from the southwest to the northwest corners of the intersection. One of the witnesses, who <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>was operating her car on Fifth Avenue in the same direction as and immediately behind defendant’s truck, stated that the light did not turn green for Fifth Avenue traffic until her own car reached the intersection; that just prior thereto the truck had passed her upon the left at a time when she was driving astride the north rail on Fifth Avenue. Her speed was then thirty to thirty-five miles an hour, and she testified that the truck had overtaken and passed her, continuing ahead at a greater speed.</p>

On approaching the crossing it was his duty, as we have so often said, to maintain a high degree of vigilance, to anticipate the presence of pedestrians within the intersection and to have his car under such control that he could stop at the shortest possible notice, or alter its direction, in order to avoid striking persons committed to the crossing: <em>Newman v.

Prior to bringing the present suit plaintiff sued the defendants upon the same cause of action to recover damages for the same injuries. In the trial of the first suit, at the conclusion of plaintiff’s testimony, the trial judge entered a compulsory nonsuit.

As a discontinuance does not constitute either an adjudication by an appropriate tribunal, of a party’s right of action or an acknowledgment that the claim is not good in law: <em>Sweigart v.

Defendants assert that once the motion to withdraw was submitted to the court in banc, it could be withdrawn and discontinued only with the consent of that body, and the order of a single judge was accordingly insufficient and invalid. This contention, however, is not supported by the record. It appears that the order was signed “By the Court”, and there is no indication upon its face that it was improperly entered. If the defendants believed the discontinuance to have been irregular, they should have petitioned the court below, in the first suit, to strike it off. They cannot attack its validity collaterally in the present case. In <em>Lindsay v.
