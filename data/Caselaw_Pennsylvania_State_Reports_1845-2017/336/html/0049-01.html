Judgment for the defendant was entered on a statutory demurrer, the learned court below being of opinion (1) that public policy prohibited suit by the minor against his mother and, (2) that the statutes (April 15, 1851, P. L. 669, 12 PS section 1601, and April 26, 1855, P. L. 309, as amended, 12 PS section 1602) gave no right of action to children when one parent survives.

The Act of 1855, as amended, provides: “That the persons entitled to <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>recover damages for any injuries causing death shall be the husband, widow, children, or parents of the deceased, and no other relatives; and that such husband, widow, children, or parents of the deceased shall be entitled to recover, whether he, she, or they be citizens or residents of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or citizens or residents of any other State or place . . . and the sum recovered shall go to them in the proportion they would take his or her personal estate in case of intestacy, and that without liability to creditors under the laws of this Commonwealth.” Section 2 of the original act provides: “That the declaration shall state who are the parties entitled in such action; the action shall be brought within one year after the death, and not thereafter.”</p>

The legislature made no exceptions, such as defendant would imply, to the effect that the child shall be deprived of the benefit of the statute when the surviving parent is the tort-feasor, or if the suit conflicts with a rule at times theretofore prohibiting suits disruptive of the family relation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The words of the conjectured excep<a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>tion are not found in the statute, and as it is complete without them, we are not authorized to add them.</p>

The daughter had left surviving a husband alleged to have deserted her, but no children. Defendant challenged the right of the plaintiff, as decedent’s mother, to bring suit in view of the fact that decedent’s husband survived. The court below held that plaintiff had no right of action and entered judgment for defendant. On plaintiff’s appeal, we reversed, granting leave to amend without prejudice, etc. In the course of the opinion, the Chief Justice said: “It would seem just and proper that, when a prior class has no beneficial interest in the proceeds of the recovery, but retains only the nominal right to sue and does not exercise such right, those who are beneficially entitled should not be barred thereby from prosecuting their claim. A proper procedure would be to allow them to use, as plaintiff, the name of the person entitled to bring the suit. The bringing of suit by a person having the real interest in the name of a legal plaintiff who no longer has such an interest is not unfamiliar practice in Pennsylvania, nor has a defendant ever been allowed to question the relations between the legal and the real plaintiff.” See also <em>Ronca v.

L. 669, and April 26, 1855, P. L. 309, since they do not exclude from the generality of their provisions cases in which a parent is the defendant. I cannot subscribe to this view. The well known history of these statutes is convincing proof of the fact that they did not have in contemplation the situation here involved or any intention to affect the law regarding it. If, at common law, it is against public policy for a minor child to sue its parent in tort, I do not think the Acts of 1851 and 1855 changed that rule in the cases to which they apply.</p>
    <p id="b106-3" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[260,995,1153,642]]]'>I am of opinion, however, that it is not against public policy for a minor to sue his parent, whatever the form of the action, where the suit is to vindicate <em>property </em>rights and not to recover damages for acts of violence or negligence affecting the person. For example, if a parent were to embezzle his child’s money, or physically destroy his property, there is no reason why suit should not be permitted even though the action be in trespass. An action for damages resulting from a parent’s death is to recover for a <em>property </em>loss — the deprivation of support that would have been received from the deceased parent had he lived.</p>

As I understand the majority opinion, the conclusion is reached that such a suit can be maintained, because, in their view, the public policy which forbade such a suit has been set aside by the death statutes of 1851 and 1855. It has been the opinion of bench and bar since the passage of these acts, that is to say for almost a century, that such an action does not lie, because public policy, jealous of the maintenance of good will in the family relation, <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>denied it. It seems to me that, in concluding otherwise, my brethren who differ in view from me must be of the belief that no public policy can now stand against the statutes, but there are, at least there have been, instances in which we have maintained until quite recently the rule that, notwithstanding these statutes, public policy forbids the pursuit of death actions against certain classes of tort-feasors, as in the cases of public charities, schools, religious institutions and municipal corporations carrying on a governmental function, so that it is not for all torts resulting in death that actions can be maintained: <em>Devers v.

The public policy forbidding actions for negligence by unemancipated minor children against parents has quite recently (March 1, 1938) been fully discussed by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Luster v. Luster, </em>— Mass. —, 13 N. E. (2nd) 438, which, calling attention to many cases, held that public policy forbids such suits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">*</a>

It recognizes this effect so far as the maintenance of the action is concerned, but denies the effect of the statute which would give damages to the mother by its express terms. The ruling is that she may not recover in damages from herself, although the statute expressly confers upon her a right of recovery. The opinion in this respect, therefore, upholds the pub-<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>lie policy that a person may not recover damages for his own wrong.</p>
