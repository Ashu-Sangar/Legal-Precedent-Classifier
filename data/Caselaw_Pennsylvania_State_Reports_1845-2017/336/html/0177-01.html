On Saturday evenings éntertainment is provided for the guests in the hotel dining room, and for this purpose an orchestra and several dancers and singers are employed. There is no stage for the performers, and the only seats are those at the tables. The dining room is open to the public, and no charge whatsoever is made for the entertainment. The hotel is licensed to serve liquor, and pays an annual amusement tax under the Liquor Control Law of November 29, 1933, (Special Session), P. L. 15, as amended July 18, 1935, P. L. 1246, Section 602(n). Cigars, cigarettes, candy and similar articles are sold in the dining room and at the hotel bar.</p>

L. 1709, Section 1, which provides: “From and after the passage of this act, each retail vender of or retail dealer in, goods, wares and merchandise shall pay an annual mercantile license tax of two dollars, and all persons so engaged shall pay one mill additional on each dollar of the whole volume, gross, of business transacted annually.”</p>

We have pointed out in <em>Wellsboro Hotel Company’s Appeal, </em>supra, that a hotel- or innkeeper who conducts a dining room for the convenience of his guests is engaged in rendering a service incidental to the conduct of his principal business. In the absence of an express provision, a mercantile license statute was held not to apply to such an ancillary part of the hotel business. We have reached the same conclusion as to the sales of candy, cigars and other merchandise under the Act here involved.</p>

    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[265,627,1155,967]]]'>It cannot reasonably be conceived that the Act was intended to embrace the hotelkeeper who dispenses such articles primarily to his guests on the premises, thereby serving their convenience as a part of his recognized obligation to care for their comfort. It cannot be held that he is conducting a distinct mercantile enterprise. The Supreme Court of the United States has expressed this view in <em>Toxaway Hotel Co. v. Smathers &amp; Co., </em><a href="/us/216/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="216 U.S. 439" data-case-ids="8289891" data-case-paths="/us/216/0439-01">216 U. S. 439</a>,466. It said: “For the present we shall deal only with the bare question as to whether innkeeping is within a proper definition of ‘trading’ or ‘mercantile pursuits.’ The keeping of a bar, cigar and newsstand are obviously but ordinary incidents to the main business when conducted within the inn, and primarily for the convenience of guests . . . Having thus narrowed the question, we must answer that a corporation engaged principally in running hotels is not a corporation engaged principally in ‘trading’ or ‘mercantile pursuits.’ ”* *<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In each of them the person taxed was within the express language of the taxing statute. Here, on the other hand, the long established distinction between a hotel business and a mercantile enterprise, supplies a cogent reason for the exclusion of the former from the operation of mercantile license laws. Although the candy, tobacco and other articles are <em>sold </em>to the guests, the sales are purely incidental to the primary business of the hotel. This portion of its business is no more subject to taxation under the Act of 1899 than is the operation of a dining room subject to the Eestaurant Mercantile License Tax imposed by the Act of April 25, 1907, P. L. 117.</p>
    <p id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[210,1079,1153,970]]]'>There seems little doubt that there is no liability for the tax assessed under the Amusement Tax Act of 1913, supra, for the gratuitous entertainment supplied to the guests of this hotel. However, we are not obliged to pass upon this question, nor to decide whether the furnishing of such entertainment is incidental to the operation of the hotel, because the Act of 1913 was expressly repealed to the extent that it could have any application to the present facts, by the Act of June 16, 1937, P. L. 1762, Section 1, amending Section 802 of the Liquor Control Act of 1933, supra. The Act of 1937 requires licensees to obtain amusement permits from the Liquor Control Board, repealing the Act of 1913 “insofar as it purports to impose a tax upon the licensees herein.” Appellee has complied with the provisions of this Act, and lias the required permit. Consequently, the present assessment, made after the effective date of the Act of 1937, was improper and void.</p>

L. 570, imposing a mercantile license tax on restaurants and eating-houses was not inconsistent with the Act of 1899, because they relate to different subjects of taxation. It is said (p. 404) : “Through the legislation of the state there is an apparent distinction made between dealers in merchandise and keepers of eating-houses.” This distinction applies with equal force in the case of hotels.</p>

However, in <em>Blauner’s, Inc., et al. v. Philadelphia et al., </em><a href="/pa/330/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="330 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1182979" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0340-01">330 Pa. 340</a>, this Court held that such transactions were “sales” under the common definition, and limited the Eansley decision to its holding that they were not “sales” within the mean<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>ing of the Act of 1899. The ease is, therefore, appropriate to the present discussion. It is clear, from the statement therein at page 518, that the real basis of the decision was the fact that a social club, even, when it furnishes cigars to its members for compensation, is not conducting a mercantile business under the Act of 1899.</p>
