These are, inter alia, as follows: Plaintiff is the owner of a tract of unseated surface land containing 416 acres situate in Chést Township, Cambria County. Pursuant to the provisions of the Act of June 5, 1913, P. L. 426, plaintiff caused this land to be classified as auxiliary forest reserves and entered into a contract with the State Forestry Reservation Commission as provided by that act. The commission thereupon certified the land to the County Commissioners of Cambria County and thereafter plaintiff’s land was valued for the purpose of taxation at the rate of $1 per acre under the provisions of the Act of 1913. One of the courts of common pleas of this Commonwealth declared this Act of 1913 unconstitutional, and no appeal from such decision having been taken, the Secretary of Forests and Waters, who had succeeded to the powers and duties of the State Forestry Reservation Commission, acting upon the opinion and advice of the Attorney General of this State, notified in October, 1934, the owners of all lands classified as auxiliary forest reserves under the Act of 1913, and the County Commissioners of the several counties wherein such lands are situate, that the contracts between the several owners and the State Forestry Reservation Commission as provided by that act were canceled.</p>

Section 2 provides that “all surface land which would be suitable for the growing of merchantable forest products, whether they are now growing or shall hereafter be planted out, sown by seed, or reproduced naturally, and would thereby contribute to an adequate lumber supply for the people, protect the water supply, and give aid to flood control, and to the prevention of soil erosion, may be set apart according to the provisions of this act and exclusively used for growing trees for production of such merchantable products, and is hereby constituted a separate and dis<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>tinct class of land to be known as forest reserves auxiliary to the State owned forest reserves. ...” This section further provides the method whereby the owner of surface land may cause his land to be included in the aforementioned classification. Section 8 provides, inter alia, that all surface land classified and set apart as auxiliary forest reserves under the provisions of the Act shall be rated in value for the purpose of taxation not in excess of $1.00 per acre and shall continue to be so rated so long as the land remains within the class established by section 2. Section 9 requires the County Commissioners to reduce the assessment on their records to a sum not in excess of $1 per acre.</p>

As to <em>when </em>trees shall be harvested, section 4 provides as follows: “Whenever trees growing on said surface land have become suitable for merchantable forest products, the secretary shall, at the request of the owner, or on his own motion, make an examination of said land and designate for the owner the trees to be cut, if in the judgment of the secretary there be any, and the cutting and removal of said trees so designated shall be in accordance with the instructions of the secretary.” A dispute between the secretary and the owner as to the desirability of the cutting and removal of the trees, is made a question for judicial determination.</p>

If neither of these persons wanted the timber harvested, it would not be, and no taxes would be paid on the land, except the nominal tax on a valuation of $1 an acre. If the timber is harvested, 10% of the stumpage value of the timber is payable as taxes. These stumpage taxes, therefore, might be paid fifty years after or at any other period, after the land was placed in the forest reserve class. If this stumpage tax, when, and if ever, paid, is divided by the number of years the land was in the favored class, the average tax per year would manifestly be of a rather small amount.</p>

That it does not <em>completely </em>exempt lands from taxation, does not alter the fact that it is <em>pro tanto </em>an act exempting lands from taxes they would otherwise bear. The contention that the stumpage tax when (if ever) paid is the equivalent of the sum of the annual taxes the land would otherwise have paid, is unsound. If such was the fact, that would defeat the very purpose of the Act, that purpose being to <em>reward </em>or <em>compensate </em>a landowner for setting aside his land “for growing trees.” For his contribution to the general welfare in doing this, he is relieved, in respect to such land, of the payment of all taxes except the nominal tax on a valuation of one dollar an acre, until that date, presumably in the far future, when he or the Secretary of Forests and Waters may decide that the timber should be harvested. To put the matter concretely, A may own a tract of land assessable at $100 an acre. By having his land accepted as an auxiliary forest reserve, he immediately secures a 99% reduction in his taxation until the indefinite future date (which <em>may never </em>arrive) when the timber is harvested. Even if the timber is harvested after the landowner has enjoyed a long period of immunity from taxation, only a tax amounting to 10% of the value of the “harvest” is imposed. Averaging this over the term <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>of years the land has been exempt, makes the average annual tax much less (it may fairly be assumed) than it would have been had the land not been put in the preferred class.</p>

The question presented to us is: Has the legislature the <em>power </em>under the Constitution to enact such a statute? This question the appellants emphatically answer: “No.” They claim that it is . a tax exemption statute and that therefore under section 2 of Article IX of the Constitution, it is- void, for that section so declares unless the property exempted is the property enumerated in section 1 of Article IX (section 1, B of Article IX has no application here), to wit: A, Public property used for public purposes; B, Actual places of religious worship; C, Places of burial not used or held for private or corporate profit; D, Institutions of purely public charity; and E, Beal and personal property owned, occupied and used by any branch, post or camp of honorably discharged soldiers, sailors and marines. It is, of course, well settled that when the Constitution enumerates the kind of property that may be exempted from taxation, it by implication excludes all other taxable property.</p>

This court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Sterrett, after referring to the above quoted sections 1 and 2 of Article IX of the Constitution, said: “These limitations on the power of the legislature mean something. They are plainly intended to secure, as far as possible, uniformity and relative equality of taxation, by prohibiting generally the exemption of a certain part of any recognized class of property, and subjecting the residue to a tax that should be borne uniformly by the entire <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>class,' and <em>by guarding against any other device that necessarily or intentionally infringes on the established rules of uniformity and relative equality </em>which, as we have seen, underlie every just system of taxation,” (italics supplied).</p>

It exacts that every man, by a definite and general rule, should know what proportion of his property the state demands; whatever liberty we may boast of in theory, it cannot exist in fact while [arbitrary] assessments continue’: 1 Hamilton’s Works (ed. 1885) 270.”</p>

Superior Ct. 32</a>, that court, declared unconstitutional, as violative of sections 1 and 2 of Article IX, the Act of April 20, 1905, P.

In that case, the legislature attempted a partial exemption of taxable property. Here the legislature attempted a partial exemption of taxable property. In both cases the legislature attempted to do something which the Constitution says it cannot do. That the exemption attempted in each case was only a partial exemption is immaterial. The difference between a hundred per cent exemption of property and a 99 per cent exemption or a 50 per cent exemption is only a difference in degree. All are odious to the constitutional principle of equality and uniformity. In <em>Koch v.

If this tenet is to prevail, the Constitution will become a mere symbol instead of the dominant charter of government it was ordained to be. Just as the 1905 and 1935 legislatures declared the public benefit to be derived from the cultivation of trees to be a warrant for the tax exemptions offered, so may future legislatures declare that the public benefit to be derived from the cultivation of potatoes or apple trees warrants the tax exemptions of the lands so used. The framers of the Constitution, recognizing the fact that every dollar of normal tax'burden arbitrarily subtracted from the land of one citizen means a commensurate tax burden added to the property of all other citizens, restricted the legislature’s power to exempt taxes to a few classes and then declared all other attempted exemptions “void.”</p>
    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[289,1392,1149,261]]]'>Since the Act of 1935 is plainly a tax exemption statute, as the Superior Court declared the similar Act of 1905 to be, and since the property exempted is not within the classes enumerated in section 1 of Article IX of the Constitution, the Act is unconstitutional.</p>

In that ease Justice Stewart, speaking for this court, said: “The legislature may not by arbitrary discrimination subject certain property to taxation, and exempt other property of the same kind and class and similarly situated from an equal burden. <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>. . . It is constantly to be borne in mind that the right of classification is allowed in order to avoid or correct inequalities, never to create them.” The Act now challenged creates inequalities of tax burdens. A and B may own adjoining lands. If A cultivates flowers or wheat or strawberries on his land, he is taxed on its actual value, which may be $100 or more an acre. If B cultivates trees, he may, with the consent of the Secretary of Forests and Waters, escape all taxation on the land (until the distant date when the trees are harvested) except a nominal tax on a valuation of $1 an acre.

It was intended to, and does, sweep away forever the power of the legislature to impose unequal burdens upon the people under the form of taxation. The evils which led up to its incorporation into the organic law are well known. The burden of maintaining the state has been, in repeated instances, lifted from the shoulders of favored classes and thrown upon the remainder of the community. This was done by means of favoritism and class legislation.

When the title to such lands is acquired by the State, they become exempt from taxation as “public lands.” But just because an owner devotes his land for a certain period of time to a use that promotes the public good, he does not thereby invest such land with the character of public lands. All lands which are properly utilized promote in some degree the public good but they cannot for that reason be wholly or partially exempted from taxation.</p>
