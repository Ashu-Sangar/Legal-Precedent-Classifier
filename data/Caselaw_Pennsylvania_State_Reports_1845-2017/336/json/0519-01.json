        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nLaura M. Grove sued the defendant for $2,000 insurance on the life of her husband, John W. Grove. The jury returned a verdict for the amount of the claim plus interest, to wit: $2,860.00. Defendant\u2019s motions for judgment n. o. v. and for a new trial were denied and this appeal followed.\nOn June 30, 1926, Grove, who was a clerk employed by the Carnegie Steel Company, purchased a participating certificate in the amount of $2,000.00 in Group Policy No. 2181, issued by the defendant to the Homestead Steel Works Employees Insurance and Safety Association of Carnegie Steel Company. In the spring of 1931, Grove became ill but he continued working until June 9, 1931. He was unable to work thereafter. The superintendent took the insured\u2019s employment card and wrote thereon: \u201cTerminated June 15, 1931, and paid to June 30th, inclusive.\u201d Later he cancelled this termination by drawing a line through what he had written and then wrote: \u201cLeave of absence for two months with the understanding he will not be back to this department.\u201d The card shows a further notation: \u201cLeave of absence extended 2 months 8-31-31.\u201d This meant that the leave of absence was extended to October 31, 1931. Below this appears the notation: \u201cDied 11-27-1931,\u201d i. e., November 27, 1931. No termination or notice of discharge appears upon the employment card which constitutes the official employment record of Grove with the Carnegie Steel Company.\nWilliam M. Menk, the Assistant Superintendent of the Plate Department of the steel company, testified that when an employee\u2019s connection with the company is finally terminated, he is given \u201ca written termination notice through the employment office.\u201d He was asked: \u201cDid you give him [Grove] such a notice?\u201d He answered: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge. Q. After that did you grant him a leave of absence? A. I did, for two months from July 1, 1931.\u201d He gave as a reason for the leave of absence the following: \u201cNecessary reduction in force. . . . Then he asked for leave of absence which would enable him to seek employment without any unnecessary hardship on his part in the plant.\u201d He said that the leave of absence was extended and that he signed the extension. There was no other leave of absence. He also admitted that he \u201cscratched out\u201d the notation on the employment card: \u201cTerminated June 15, 1931.\u201d The reason he did this was because of Grove\u2019s request for a leave of absence. After the re-instatement of the employee by striking out the termination phrase on the employment card, there is no evidence in the record of either a written or oral termination or discharge notice having been given to this employee. The insurance company claims that the insured\u2019s employment was terminated prior to his death and that therefore the following provision of the policy becomes operative: \u201cTermination and Conversion: The insurance upon the life of any member shall automatically cease upon his discontinuance of participation as evidenced in writing signed by him and filed with the Society, or upon termination of his membership in said Association or upon his ceasing to follow the occupation above specified.\u201d\nThe court below in its opinion correctly said: \u201cThe chief question to be decided is \u2018Was there sufficient evidence of the deceased\u2019s employment at the time of his death to submit this case to the jury and to uphold a verdict?\u2019 If the deceased was not an employee, naturally his executrix would have no right to recover. If he was an employee at the time of his death, she has.\u201d\nIn view of the fact that the words: \u201cTerminated June 15, 193\u00cd, and paid to June 30th, inclusive,\u201d on the employment card were later cancelled, the only significant thing remaining on the card is the following: \u201cLeave of absence extended 2 months 8-31-31,\u201d and beneath that: \u201cDied 11-27-1931.\u201d The court below in its opinion said. \u201cWhat is the legal effect of the before-cited notations? It seems to the trial judge that it is very clear that the deceased still held the position of an employee. The striking out of the word \u2018terminated\u2019 means that the plaintiff was not discharged and the words \u2018leave of absence\u2019 we believe are the equivalent of the words \u2018the deceased was granted a vacation.\u2019 If that were not so and if deceased did not still have a connection with the plant it would not have been necessary to have written on his employee\u2019s card that there was a continuation of his leave of absence. And this conclusion becomes stronger when hist employee\u2019s card showed that there was a notation made of his death.\u201d Though it was testified by the Assistant Superintendent that when an employee\u2019s employment ceases, he gets a termination notice, it is a fact that Grove never received such a notice.\nIn the case of Ozanich v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 119 Pa. Superior Ct. 52, the beneficiary of a group insurance policy brought an action to recover an amount specified in the policy which had been issued to her late husband, an employee of the Pressed Steel Car Company. The policy provided that $1,000 would be paid the beneficiary \u201cif death occurs while the employee is in the employ of the employer and while said group policy is in force.\u201d The question was whether or not his death occurred during his employment. President Judge Keller says in that case: \u201cOzanich was unquestionably an employee of the company on December 31, 1924 [when the group policy was issued]. He admittedly remained such an employee up to and including December 14, 1932. There is no competent proof in the case that following that date he was discharged, or that his employment was ever terminated by himself or his employer, within the meaning of the policy, or that he was even \u2018laid off,\u2019 prior to his death on January 4, 1933. . . . The only question at issue, then, was whether Ozanich\u2019s death occurred while he was in the employ of the Pressed Steel Car Co. . . . The foreman of the employer admitted that Ozanich worked for the company on December 14, 1932, and no one testified that he had thereafter been' discharged or had been notified that he was no longer in the employ of the company.\u201d The Superior Court held in that case that \u201cthere was ample evidence to support a finding by the jury that Ozanich was an employee of the Pressed Steel Car Company, within the meaning of the policy, on the day of his death.\u201d\nThe Secretary of the Employees\u2019 Association Union testified in the case at bar that he terminated the insurance of John W. Grove and so notified the insurance company. This testimony, however, is immaterial because the Secretary had no right to terminate the insurance of an employee nor was his testimony admissible as to what his \u201cunderstanding\u201d was, to wit, \u201cthat when an employee did not return after the expiration of his leave of absence his employment was terminated.\u201d\nComplaint is also made in support of the rule for a new trial to the statement of the trial judge that \u201cthe deceased was given a second leave of absence, during which period he died.\u201d When defendant\u2019s counsel called the court\u2019s attention to this statement, saying that such leave of absence expired October 31st and that he died on November 28th, the trial judge answered: \u201cYes, he did, but he died within the grace period contemplated by the policy of 31 days. I am glad you called it to my attention and I correct my charge.\u201d The court\u2019s reference to this grace period was misleading since there was no grace period which under the facts of this case would save the employee\u2019s insurance if he was not employed at the time of his death. However, the court affirmed the fourth point submitted by the defendant, which reads as follows: \u201cThe grace period of thirty-one days granted to the Association for the payment of each monthly premium after the first premium did not continue the insurance upon the life of John W. Grove under the Group Policy in force and effect for a period of thirty-one days after he had ceased to follow his specified occupation and the termination of his employment with the Carnegie Steel Company.\u201d After affirming that, the court added: \u201cBut I must call your attention to the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is that the deceased\u2019s employment was not terminated.\u201d\nTrial judges should be careful not to give the jury conflicting or confusing instructions. Such instructions have been adjudged grounds for reversal: Rice v. Com., 100 Pa. 28; Shaver v. McCarthy, 110 Pa. 339, 5 A. 614; and Com. v. Gerade, 145 Pa. 289, 22 A. 464. In the instant case the trial judge so repeatedly instructed the jury that there could be no recovery by the plaintiff unless Grove had the status of an employee at the time of his death that we do not believe that the jury was misled by the trial judge\u2019s inadvertent remarks that Grove died \u201cwithin the grace period contemplated by the policy of 31 days.\u201d\nThe jury found on sufficient evidence the facts that Grove\u2019s employment with the company had not been terminated and that his status was that of an employee on a leave of absence. It is true that the leave of absence had expired before his death but there is nothing in the record to establish that the expiration of this leave of absence was equivalent to a termination of his employment. It may be that the company officials looked upon Grove\u2019s employment as having been terminated at the expiration of his leave of absence, but their belief as to his status did not legally determine it. If he was discharged from the company\u2019s employ, he was, according to the testimony of the company\u2019s Assistant Superintendent, entitled to get a termination notice from the employment office.\nAppellant, in interpreting the opinion in the Ozanieh Case, supra, says: \u201cAny actual knowledge or reasonable means of knowledge satisfies the requirements of that opinion.\u201d The answer to that is Grove\u2019s knowledge or his reasonable means of knowledge as to his status was on this record a question for the jury. Appellant says further: \u201cIn the present case, it cannot seriously be contended that Grove had no knowledge of his status. The employer found it necessary to discharge Grove, and actual notice of discharge was given to Grove. While in the position of a discharged employee, he sought and obtained a leave of absence for a fixed period.\u201d We need point out here only this: that it\u2019s an anomaly for a \u201cdischarged employee\u201d to seek a leave of absence. He, if discharged, already has a \u201cleave of absence\u201d for an indefinite period. Appellant says further: \u201cGrove\u2019s knowledge that he would not be reemployed in his old department upon the termination of the leave, the reasons for seeking the leave of absence, the application to extend the leave of absence \u2014 all are very significant.\u201d All these facts may be true but who is to pass on their \u201csignificance\u201d? The court below rightly decided that the significance of these facts was for the jury\u2019s determination. Appellant also contends that it proved the existence of \u201ca usage that a person who did not make some arrangement at the end of his leave was automatically dropped from the employment rolls. That Grove must have known of this custom and the duty that it imposed upon him, is shown beyond doubt by his application for an extension of the leave.\u201d The very contentions made by appellant as to its proof, the existence of a \u201cusage,\u201d Grove\u2019s knowledge of the usage and as to an \u201cinescapable conclusion\u201d only make it more clear that the issues thus raised were determinable by a jury. See Szczygielski v. Travelers Ins. Co., 114 Pa. Superior Ct. 352, 174 A. 662.\nNor can we accept the contention of appellant that the phrase as used in the insurance contract, \u201cceasing to follow the occupation above specified,\u201d must be given the narrow construction appellant asks for. It is unreasonable to hold that an employee ceased to be protected by his group insurance policy the moment he ceased to follow the identical task which as an employee of that company he was following when he became insured. The \u201coccupation specified\u201d in the certificate issued to Grove was that of \u201cIron and Steel Manufacturing.\u201d This is broad enough to cover anything that contributed to the manufacture of iron and steel. When an employee ceases to follow his task because of illness or leave of absence or both, he does not thereby forfeit his status as an employee. See People v. Lynch, 149 N. Y. Supp. 895.\nThe error in appellant\u2019s position is in the assumption that \u201cexpiration of a leave of absence\u201d and \u201ctermination of employment\u201d1 are equivalent. They are not. Many members of official and industrial bodies obtain leaves of absence. Their status as members of those bodies does not terminate when the leave of absence expires even though at that time they do not \u201creturn to work.\u201d If the steel company intended to terminate Grove\u2019s employment at the expiration of his leave of absence, it should have given him due notice of that fact. Plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case showing that her husband at the time of his death was still within the protection of his group insurance policy, entitled her to go to the jury.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
