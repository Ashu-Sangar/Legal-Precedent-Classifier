Whether the Superior Court erred when it held that a private plaintiff who alleges deceptive conduct under the UTPCPL\u2019s \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision, 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4)(xxi), need not allege and prove justifiable reliance, contrary to the decisions of this Court, earlier decisions of the Superior Court, and federal decisions construing the UTPCPL.\n2. Whether the Superior Court erred when it held that a plaintiff may satisfy the UTPCPL\u2019s \u201cascertainable loss\u201d requirement by voluntarily hiring an attorney and allegedly incurring litigation costs to challenge allegedly wrongful conduct, even where, as here, the plaintiff paid no money to the defendant as a result of that conduct.",
