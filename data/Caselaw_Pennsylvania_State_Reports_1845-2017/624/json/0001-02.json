Allocatur is DENIED as to the remaining issue. The issues, as stated by petitioner are:\n(1) Does the Act\u2019s liability cap violate equal protection principles in this case where (a) the cap reduced the jury\u2019s verdict by over 96% because [petitioner] was injured by a local agency [that] operated the school bus; (b) [petitioner] would be entitled to recover the jury\u2019s full verdict had a private entity instead operated the school bus, as in commonplace among school districts; and (c) as this Court held forty years ago, political subdivision immunity is \u201can anachronism, without rational basis\u201d because local agencies may purchase liability insurance and tort liability promotes accountability and accident-prevention? See Ayala v. Philadelphia Board of Public Educ., 453 Pa. 584, 305 A.2d 877, 881-83 (1973).\n(2) Does the Act\u2019s liability cap violate equal protection principles in this case where (a) Pennsbury purchased $11 million in insurance, funded by taxpayers, including [petitioner\u2019s] parents; (b) [petitioner] could recover her judgment at least to the extent of the available insurance; and (c) the Commonwealth Court\u2019s majority opinion acknowledged that the available insurance presented \u201cintriguing, and perhaps appealing\u201d issues regarding the Act\u2019s constitutionality?\n(3) Does the liability cap violate [petitioner\u2019s] right to jury trial guaranteed by Article I, Section 6 of the Pennsylvania constitution where Pennsbury did not challenge the verdict\u2019s excessiveness yet the liability cap eviscerated the verdict by reducing [petitioner\u2019s] recovery by over 96%?\n(4) Does the liability cap impermissibly infringe on the judicial power set forth in Article V, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania constitution by forcing a more than 96% remittitur of the jury\u2019s verdict in this case, and thereby usurping the judiciary\u2019s exclusive and inherent power to determine remittitur requests?\n(5) Does the liability cap violate the open courts provision of Article I, Section 11 of the Pennsylvania constitution by forcing a more than 96% remittitur of the jury\u2019s verdict and therefore denying [petitioner] full redress of her injuries?\n(6) Does the liability cap violate the guarantee against liability limitations set forth in Article III, Section 18 of the Pennsylvania constitution, where this is not a workers\u2019 compensation matter?",
