Thus, as used in subsection 5985(a.l), “serious emotional distress that would substantially impair the child victim’s ... ability to reasonably communicate” refers to a state or characteristic that can be recognized and attested to by the child’s parent or custodian, or another person, such as one who has dealt with the child in a medical or therapeutic setting, or by the court alone after it observes and questions the child.

This provision was enacted by the General Assembly in 2004, following the 2003 amendment to Article 1, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charlton, </em><a href="/a2d/902/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="902 A.2d 554" data-case-ids="8414139" data-case-paths="/a2d/902/0554-01">902 A.2d 554</a>, 558 (Pa.Super.2006).

Thus, the text of the Pennsylvania Constitution guaranteeing accused persons the right to confront the witnesses against them was made identical to the text of the Confrontation Clause in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, the accused has the right "to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” In <em>Bergdoll, </em>the Commonwealth Court rejected a challenge to <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>the 2003 amendment, and this Court affirmed. As the Commonwealth Court explained, the amendment was proposed after we had ruled that laws permitting children to testify outside the physical presence of the accused, <em>e.g., </em>by closed circuit television, violated the Pennsylvania Constitution because such laws denied the accused the right to confront witnesses against him or her "face-to-face.” <em>Bergdoll, <a href="/a2d/858/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="858 A.2d 185" data-case-ids="9157588" data-case-paths="/a2d/858/0185-01">supra </a></em><a href="/a2d/858/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="858 A.2d 185" data-case-ids="9157588" data-case-paths="/a2d/858/0185-01">at 190</a>. By removing the "face-to-face” language from the Pennsylvania Constitution and making the confrontation clauses of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Sixth Amendment identical, the amendment was designed to permit the enactment of laws or the adoption of rules that would permit child victims or witnesses to testify in criminal proceedings outside the physical presence of the accused. <em><a href="/a2d/858/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="858 A.2d 185" data-case-ids="9157588" data-case-paths="/a2d/858/0185-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/858/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="858 A.2d 185" data-case-ids="9157588" data-case-paths="/a2d/858/0185-01">at 190-91</a>.</p>

In response, the trial court’s brief statement in lieu of an opinion, quoted by the Majority, see Maj. op. at 187-89, 84 A.3d at 683-84, made two points of relevance: (1) the order was bottomed squarely and exclusively upon the right of confrontation; and (2) the purpose of the coercive disclosure was to give appellant “the opportunity to present his own expert testimony concerning [the] complainant’s psychological state.” The court’s statement, although adverting generically <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>to “English common law and Roman law,” betrayed no awareness of contemporary American constitutional law involving the right of confrontation; indeed, the statement was unsupported by citation to, or discussion of, any relevant authority.</p>

First, the Commonwealth argued that the trial court erred in deciding to compel the release of the child’s confidential psychological records for analysis by the defense expert premised simply upon the request that the child be permitted to testify by closed circuit television. Second, the Commonwealth contended that the trial court violated the child’s constitutional rights by forcing her mother to waive any privilege the child may have.

The panel held that Section 5985 of the Judicial Code — the statute authorizing testimony by child victims or witnesses by “contemporaneous alternative method” — provides that the defendant’s counsel has the right to be present at the hearing concerning the child’s emotional ability to testify at trial in the presence of the defendant. Super. Ct. Op. at 12-14 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 5985(a.2)(2)). But, Section 5985 does not confer a right upon defendant to have his expert examine the child or to have his expert present testimony to contradict the Commonwealth’s expert. The panel “decline[d] to look beyond the statute’s plain meaning to find such a right.” <em>Id. </em>at 13. The panel never mentioned nor did it directly engage the trial court’s statement concerning the Confrontation Clause, upon which the decision below was grounded, albeit the panel did discuss Superior Court decisional authority which held that the right to confrontation and compulsory process are not violated by denying access to psychotherapeutic records. As Mr. Justice Saylor explains, the Superior Court’s approach in this case was not optimal: the panel did not engage the constitutional question directly nor did the panel discuss the <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>fact that the absence of an affirmatively granted statutory right to that review which the trial court ordered does not equate to the absence of any basis upon which the trial court would be authorized to order such relief.</p>

Appellant framed the issue as whether a defendant has a “right” to present informed expert testimony to rebut the Commonwealth’s evidence in support of its motion to allow the child to testify by closed circuit television. In his brief to this Court, appellant does not root his claim in the Confrontation Clause. Appellant argues that his right derives from the right to counsel (which he says subsumes other rights including compulsory process and confrontation) and also due process. Notably, appellant never acknowledges, discusses, nor attempts to distinguish <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em><a href="/us/497/0836-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="497 U.S. 836" data-case-ids="6220020" data-case-paths="/us/497/0836-01">497 U.S. 836</a>, <a href="/us/497/0836-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="497 U.S. 836" data-case-ids="6220020" data-case-paths="/us/497/0836-01">110 S.Ct. 3157</a>, <a href="/us/497/0836-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="497 U.S. 836" data-case-ids="6220020" data-case-paths="/us/497/0836-01">111 L.Ed.2d 666</a> (1990), which forecloses relief upon his claim on appeal, as the Majority explains. Just as notably, the trial court, which also did not acknowledge <em>Craig, </em>did not base its ruling upon due process or the generalized right to counsel suggested by appellant. One does not need a lawyer in order to confront witnesses; defendants permitted to proceed <em>pro se </em>do it all the time.</p>

It is a separate theoretical question, not currently before us, whether the trial court had some other discretionary authority to issue the order it issued, in the face of the child victim’s own rights, for purposes of discharging its duty under the statute. In light of narrow scope of the interlocutory appeal before us, I would not venture to decide these tangential issues.</p>

    <p id="b255-6" data-blocks='[["BL_255.6",255,[159,825,1153,1003]]]'>However, the scope of the trial court’s order in the instant matter was not so broad, on its face, that it encompassed having appellee’s expert testify, much less acknowledging a right to do so; the order merely granted appellee the ability to have “the child’s treating psychologist D discuss all aspects of the child’s diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to date with [appellant’s expert].” Trial Court Order, 8/13/10. That said, the record reveals the court’s intention in fashioning the order was to grant appellee’s expert access to information in order to prepare rebuttal testimony. <em>See </em>Trial Court Statement in Lieu of Opinion, 9/23/10, at 4 (emphasis added) (“It is inconceivable ... that a defendant could be denied [his confrontation] right without at least being given the opportunity to <em>present his own expert testimony </em>concerning a complainant’s psychological state.... ”). While I agree there is no statutory right to present an expert witness at a § 5985 hearing, I find nothing impermissible in the directive of the order here, which simply granted access to the records and the Commonwealth’s witness.</p>
    <p id="b255-7" data-blocks='[["BL_255.7",255,[158,1862,1154,473]],["BL_256.1",256,[285,294,1149,357]]]'>As Justice Saylor notes, there is a delicate balance between protecting the victim and protecting confrontation rights, both of which are acknowledged in our Constitution. The importance of the former needs no elucidation. The importance of the latter consists not only of the broad constitutional ramifications of denying face-to-face confrontation, but also the immediate pragmatic implications of going to trial before a jury that knows something is afoot when the most important witness is not in the courtroom. If the balancing decision is <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>not a “critical stage” in the sense of constitutional jurisprudence, it unquestionably is a critical stage in the pragmatic sense of how the trial will proceed. Granting the motion in derogation of the confrontation rights on balance may not be unconstitutional in a given case, but it will without question hamper the actual in-court defense to a not insignificant degree.</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[282,677,1149,835]]]'>The matter is brought to issue by the Commonwealth’s brief, which alleges certain facts, and the conclusion the Commonwealth wishes this Court to reach. The statute allows the trial court to determine the witnesses it wishes to consider, but if (as here) that includes persons other than the child, it is the Commonwealth that not only presents that evidence, but which tells the court what witnesses there are. While the statute is silent on this point, obviously one party only, the Commonwealth, gets to tell the court what witness could provide potentially relevant information that supports the motion — the court has no investigators, no information beyond the Commonwealth’s filing. Obviously, the Commonwealth witnesses will support the motion — they may have led to the motion in the first place. That is not to say this is done in bad faith, but the process is unilateral in nature, which fact is hardly inconsequential.</p>
    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[281,1536,1148,615]]]'>Perhaps understanding this, the court here thought the fairness of its decision-making might be enhanced by allowing the accused certain limited access to the witness the Commonwealth offered, and to the witness’s information. This was held improper by the Superior Court, and the majority, because the statute does not provide for presentation of defense evidence. This is true, but neither does the statute provide for the Commonwealth to present evidence — yet present it did. The statute simply allows the court to “hear testimony” — it is silent on the source of that testimony. It may not expressly allow evidence, but neither does it prohibit such evidence.</p>
    <p id="b256-6" data-blocks='[["BL_256.6",256,[280,2184,1146,146]],["BL_257.1",257,[164,296,1149,418]]]'>I am uncertain why there is conceptual opposition to allowing the court, faced with a difficult and transcendent decision, to get as much information as it can, and to consider a <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>potentially alternate viewpoint, if there is one. The entire hearing is optional with the court, and the lack of specific process bespeaks flexibility to hear that which the court thinks is appropriate or helpful. This is not consistent with permitting the court to hear only testimony which is prepared and presented by the moving party, insulated from meaningful examination by the party whose constitutional rights are directly being limited.</p>
    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[164,740,1150,473]]]'>As worded in the order, the child would not be subjected to examination by appellant’s expert; appellant’s expert was not given permission to testify. There are many reasons for retaining an expert, other than as a witness. An expert may offer educational consultation, or opinions that will be useful in evaluating or cross-examining the opposing witness and in generally preparing for the subject matter of the hearing. There is nothing in § 5985 precluding such use of an expert, nor of making information available to them.</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[163,1239,1150,421]]]'>Thus, I agree with the majority’s answer to the question as framed, that the defendant has no right to present evidence at a § 5985 proceeding, but disagree with the view that a defendant is prohibited from doing so. To make the hearing at all meaningful, I would acknowledge the authority of the court to allow such evidence, as well as access by both parties to appropriate information that the court feels would be helpful to its decision-making responsibilities.</p>

      <em> </em>While I tend toward the prediction that the Supreme Court ultimately will not overrule <em>Craig, </em>one cannot read <em>Crawford </em>and Coy without appreciating the Supreme Court’s sentiment that CVmy-based decisions to override constitutionally favored face-to-face confrontation are important, high-stakes determinations. In other words, there should be little question that statutory provisions delineating methods for propounding testimony against an accused other than via face-to-face confrontation operate in a very sensitive area of constitutional law. Here, one of my main differences with the majority opinion is in the weight allocated to Appellant’s interest in maintaining the entitlement to face-to-face confrontation, as compared to an alternative method (particularly in the majority’s treatment of whether a Section 5985 hearing represents a critical stage of a criminal prosecution, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 192-94, 84 A.3d at 686-87).</p>

The trial judge clearly took the conflicting interests at stake very seriously and attempted to fill in the gaps left by an ambiguous and rather cryptic statutory regime by employing the adversary process as a means to obtain adequate information. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>No. CP06-MD-0960-2010, slip op. at 4 (C.P. Berks Sept. 23, 2010) (“The right of the accused to confront witnesses against him is a right with roots dating back to English common law and Roman law. It is inconceivable to this court that a defendant could be denied that right without at least being given the opportunity to present his own expert testimony concerning a complainant’s psychological state, especially where the Commonwealth is the very party putting that psychological state at issue.”). The trial court, however, made a controversial finding of a waiver of confidentiality in the child witness’s treatment records based on the view that it was the child who was putting her own mental state at issue in the case. <em>See id.</em>

      <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>For its part, the Superior Court read Section 5985 as essentially precluding testimony by a defense expert, and, notably, it did so without specific reference to Appellant’s constitutional rights or the balancing assessment required by federal constitutional law. <em>See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>No. 1357 MDA 2010, slip op. at 13 (Pa.Super. May 31, 2011) (“[W]e decline to look beyond the statute’s plain meaning to find such a right [to have a defense expert examine a child-witness or present testimony at a Section 5985 hearing].”). Since I find the statute to be silent or ambiguous in this regard, because the salient constitutional inquiry does require a balancing of interests, and as courts are to presume that the General Assembly does not intend to violate the Constitution, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3), I believe the Superior Court’s reasoning is, at the very least, incomplete. Moreover, Appellant does not need to have a “right” to present expert testimony to benefit from an exercise of the trial court’s discretion in permitting such evidence (as occurred here), and the Superior Court’s decision does not seem to take this into account. For these reasons, I would, at the very least, vacate the Superior Court’s order and remand for a fuller assessment.</p>

Moreover, there is much evidence that emotions are more complex in character than the majority opinion portrays. <em>See, e.g., </em>Paula Niedenthal, Silva Krauth-Gruber &amp; Francois Ric, Psychology of Emotion: Interpersonal, Experiential And Cognitive Approaches 1-10 (2006) (discussing the difficulty of categorizing emotions and their composition from a number of component processes). Certainly there are policy reasons favoring limitations upon the depth of the inquiry into a child-witness's emotional state (to preserve confidentiality as best as possible and minimize harmful impact upon the child-witness). In some instances, a trial judge may also believe there are other available avenues of proof, or may consider the possibility of in <em>camera </em>review of records to determine whether there is a reasonable basis for pursuing alternative causes.</p>
