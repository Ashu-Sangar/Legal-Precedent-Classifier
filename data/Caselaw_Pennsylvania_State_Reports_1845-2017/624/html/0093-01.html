Thereafter, Ryan and her husband, residents of Montgomery County, filed in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas two separate lawsuits, the first against Eckel and the other against the City of Philadelphia (“City”) and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (“PennDOT”), wherein the Ryans alleged the highway was defectively designed. The claim against PennDOT was dismissed by stipulation, and the remaining parties agreed to transfer the actions against the City and Eckel to binding arbitration.</p>

The arbitration panel further determined that, “since <em>Allwein </em>is controlling, ...

The trial court further found that, in focusing on whether Section 1722 of the MVFRL controlled over the specific terms of the Policy, the arbitration panel assumed a conflict between the two provisions where none actually existed. With respect to the arbitration panel’s reliance on Section 1722 of the MVFRL, the trial court acknowledged that this Court, in <em>Tannenbaum v. Nationwide Ins.

Trial Court Opinion, 12/8/10, at 8. However, the trial court concluded that Section 1722 pertains only to a plaintiffs <em>procedural </em>right to pursue an action for UIM benefits against an insurer, not to a plaintiffs substantive right to payment of benefits, and suggested the arbitration panel instead should have focused on Section 1731(a), which creates a right to purchase UIM coverage, and Section 1731(c), which creates a qualified right to payment of benefits.</p>

The trial court further distinguished <em>Allwein </em>on the basis that the court therein did not mention Section 1722, and that there was no final determination from which to assess whether the plaintiffs damages exceeded both the tortfeasor’s insurance coverage and the UIM coverage.</p>

In so doing, the Superior Court recognized this Court’s “reticence to throw aside clear contractual language based on ‘the often formless face of public policy,’ ” but concluded it is “obliged to find contractual language to be contrary to public policy when it violates statutory language.” <em>AAA Mid-Atlantic Ins. Co. v. Ryan, </em>3273 EDA 2010 at 12, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.3d%201228" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="37 A.3d 1228">37 A.3d 1228</a> (Pa.Super. filed Oct. 12, 2011) (citations omitted). Noting that the “MVFRL establishes the prevailing public policy of the General Assembly in the area of underinsured motorist coverage,” the court examined the language of the MVFRL and opined that the UIM provisions of the MVFRL embody “two prevalent, and somewhat competing, public policy interests” — providing coverage to those injured by a tortfeasor who lacks adequate coverage, <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>and cost containment. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 15. Next, the Superior Court compared the language of the MVFRL with the language of the Policy and concluded the Policy’s Limit of Liability clause conflicted with the public policy embodied in the MVFRL, in that “[b]oth paragraphs B and D employ overly broad language, which frustrates the MVFRL’s interest in protecting ‘those injured by a [negligent driver] who lacks adequate coverage[.]’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 17 (citation omitted). The court further stated:</p>

Section 1722 delineates a limited and well-defined list of appropriate recovery sources; the section does not grant insurers a reduction for all sums paid. Specifically, section 1722 does not identify an award originating from a third-party design defect claim as an appropriate source of recovery for which an insurer should receive credit. Conversely, paragraph B uses language that purportedly allows the insurer a reduction for any sum paid, regardless of the source. Similarly, in explicitly barring duplicate recovery, paragraph D overreaches in the same manner as paragraph B. Paragraph D essentially grants the insurer credit for any amount paid, irrespective of whether the source of the payment appears on the list under section 1722. Consequently, neither paragraph B nor paragraph D comport with the well-established public policy underlying section 1722 of the MVFRL, as well as sections 1702 and 1731(c).</blockquote>

Thus, AAA contends the first step in determining whether someone is entitled to UIM benefits is to determine whether the injured party is entitled to recover damages from the underinsured party. AAA argues that the Ryans are not entitled to UIM benefits in this case for several reasons. First, AAA argues that the arbitration panel previously determined the amount of damages to which the Ryans were entitled, that the Ryans were fully paid for that award, and, therefore, that any additional award of damages under the UIM policy would allow for a <em>de facto </em>relitigation of the issue of damages in violation of the principles of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.</p>

AAA contends the Superior Court read Section 1722 in a vacuum, ignoring Section 1731(c), which provides for UIM coverage when (1) there is injury while using a motor vehicle, and (2) the injured person is “legally entitled to recover damages therefor.” AAA argues that, because the Ryans were fully compensated, they were not <em>legally entitled </em>to additional damages, and, thus, there was no triggering event to entitle them to UIM coverage under Section 1722.</p>

The Ryans further contend that Section 1722, which addresses the impact of other sources of recovery, is exhaustive, and, because recovery from the City on a highway design claim is not specifically listed under Section 1722, such recovery does not preclude their recovery of additional damages in an UIM proceeding.
