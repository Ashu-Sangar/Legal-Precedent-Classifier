While the local government in Philadelphia has undertaken to implement some modest reform measures relative to legal-services funding in the death-penalty arena, Petitioners reasonably question the adequacy of such changes, while pointing to other jurisdictions in which the courts have assumed a more active role. <em>See, e.g., State v.

Petitioners also cite evidence suggesting there is large disparity in terms of disposition results obtained on behalf of homicide defendants whose legal interests are advanced by the salaried attorneys of the Defender Association of Philadelphia and those represented by court-appointed lawyers subject to modified flat-fee arrangements. <em>See </em>James M.

State-level funding for indigent defense services — presently lacking in Pennsylvania and only one other state in the nation- — is at the core of nearly every reform recommendation. <em>See, e.g., </em>Nat'l Right to Counsel Comm., <em>Justice Denied: America’s Continuing Neglect of Our Constitutional Right to Counsel, </em>Const. Project 11-12, 54. While certainly, governments are currently operating under financial pressures, the Legislature has made the decision to authorize capital punishment in the Commonwealth. Accordingly, it and subordinate instrumentalities must ensure adequate funding to meet all attendant constitutional mandates, including the requirement for the Commonwealth to provide effective attorney stewardship for indigent defendants.</p>

Although the five<a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>fold increase in the flat fee paid to guilt phase and'penalty phase counsel under the new remuneration template for the FJD has resulted in greater numbers of qualified attorneys being on the appointment list, in my view, the majority fails to heed Judge Benjamin Lerner’s clear and substantial preference for an hourly rate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b679-5" data-blocks='[["BL_679.4",679,[158,613,1151,836]]]'>As Judge Lerner noted in his Recommendation and Report, although the “average” Philadelphia capital case requires one hundred twenty-five (125) attorney work hours, the potential complexities that may arise in litigating a capital case frequently require enlarging the number of hours counsel must devote to any given case above that of an “average” case, and thus, a one-size-fits-all flat fee is less than ideal. In my view, an hourly rate as suggested by Judge Lerner would be a fairer method of remuneration, and would have the added benefit of providing a greater measure of accountability because there would be an itemized bill from counsel for hours worked and tasks performed. Such itemization is more amenable to review and verification than a simple presentation of the request for issuance of the flat fee “earned” for an appointment, plus trial day <em>per diems. </em>I would defer to Judge Lerner’s wisdom on this point, and set an hourly rate.</p>

It is not as if Judge Lerner’s Updated Report and Recommendations, issued July 10, 2013, showed that all the problems flowing from the capital defense crisis in Philadelphia have been finally and permanently rectified, or even <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>that the trajectory of the program reforms going forward is certain. To the contrary, Judge Lerner warned, in his conclusions, that “the improvements ... are not self-sustaining, and they do not indicate that we can rest on our laurels.” Report, 7/10/13 at 9. Indeed, Judge Lerner noted that while the capital appointment list, which stands now at thirty-three (33) qualified attorneys is sufficient, it is “far from ideal,” and he pointed out the constant need to increase the number of qualified attorneys on the list due to normal career changes, the aging process and other attrition factors. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. Judge Lerner also expressed his view that under either an hourly rate or flat-fee system, it is likely that a fee increase will soon be required in order to continue to provide an incentive for qualified attorneys to accept capital appointments.</p>
    <p id="b680-4" data-blocks='[["BL_680.4",680,[275,1125,1150,682]]]'>Finally, I would note that Philadelphia is a big city with historically high annual homicide rates requiring a correspondingly large, fair and efficient capital justice system. While the changes instituted thus far have promoted better management of the capital dockets, in my view, the continued oversight of this Court is necessary simply due to the number of murders in Philadelphia, the size of the system designed to adjudicate those crimes, and the chronic underfunding that has debilitated the system to date. The system may at some time become fixed and self-sustaining. In my view, that time has not yet arrived. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent, and would not summarily dismiss the petition or discontinue the oversight of this Court.</p>
