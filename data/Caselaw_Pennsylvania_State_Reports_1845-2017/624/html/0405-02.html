Williams in connection with his petition filed under the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”). <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The discovery order directed the Commonwealth to produce to appellee’s standby counsel “all notes” prepared by the trial prosecutor “concerning interviews, witness preparation sessions, [and] witness examination outlines” for four of appellee’s co-conspirators who were also witnesses at trial. At this Court’s request, the parties have also addressed the jurisdictional issue of whether the PCRA court’s disposition is a collateral order, appealable pursuant to Rule of Appellate Procedure 313. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 313. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the PCRA court’s discovery order is immediately appealable pursuant to Rule 313. We further conclude that the PCRA court did not have “good cause” to issue the discovery order under Rule of Criminal <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>Procedure 902(E)(2), the rule governing PCRA discovery in capital cases.

Appellee was charged with first-degree murder and related crimes, and was tried in the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas, before the Honorable Edward D. Reibman. Appellee represented himself at trial, with standby counsel assisting; then-Assistant District Attorney (“ADA”) Maria L. Dantos, Esq., represented the Commonwealth. In 2007, Ms. Dantos was appointed, and later was elected, to the bench of the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas.</p>

Appellee also made personal accusations against the Commonwealth prosecutors, police officers, criminal justice personnel, and against his own standby counsel. Appellee imagined that he was the victim of a vast statewide conspiracy. Appellee called fellow inmate Louis Washington to testify, but then challenged Washington’s credibility when Washington testified unfavorably against appellee. Specifically, Washington testified that appellee' attempted to threaten him into arranging for an alibi witness (Washington’s mother), but instead Washington alerted the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth then arranged for a state trooper to portray Washington’s mother at the meeting during which appellee discussed the planned false alibi testimony. An audio recording of the meeting and the trooper’s testimony were offered into evidence at trial.</p>

In January 2011, appellee filed a supplementary discovery motion and the PCRA court again granted relief in part, ordering the Lehigh County Prison to <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>provide records reflecting the visitors for Commonwealth trial witnesses Miller, Peterson, French, Logan, and Avila, as well as appellee’s witness Washington, between May 1, 1995 and January 31, 2001.

The PCRA court entered an order— erroneously dated May 20 but docketed on May 25, 2011— granting appellee’s motion without first affording the Commonwealth an opportunity to be heard. The order stated that the Lehigh County District Attorney’s Office was to “produce to standby counsel” “[a]ll notes” of former ADA Dantos “concerning interviews, witness preparation sessions, [and] witness examination outlines for Luis Avila, Ralph Logan, Lamar Peterson, and Curtis French.” On May 27, 2011, the Commonwealth immediately asked for reconsideration.</p>

First, the Commonwealth objected that it did not have the opportunity to be heard on appellee’s discovery motion before it was granted. Judge Braxton explained that he had signed the order before boarding an airplane, and that he had difficulty communicating with the parties because he presided over cases in numerous counties throughout Pennsylvania. Judge Braxton did not identify any exigency to defeat the Commonwealth’s right to respond before the Commonwealth was ordered to turn over material from its trial file. On the discovery motion’s merits, the Commonwealth argued that the motion should not have been granted because it requested material protected by the work product doctrine and did not meet the “good cause” standard set forth in Criminal Rule 902(E)(2) (no discovery permitted in <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>first capital PCRA proceeding except upon leave of court after showing of good cause). The Commonwealth also asked the Court to review former ADA Dantos’s testimony from the earlier hearing because she had testified that she did not prepare notes related to all of the witnesses, and that, if any of the information she had gleaned during pre-trial interviews had been material, exculpatory or impeaching she would have disclosed it under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em><a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">373 U.S. 83</a>, <a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">83 S.Ct. 1194</a>, <a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">10 L.Ed.2d 215</a> (1963).</p>

Furthermore, according to appellee, he did not have to accept or rely on what former ADA Dantos said about the information contained in her file notes, because her testimony that the “witnesses were changing the stories to her” gave him good cause for discovery of her notes under <em>Brady. See </em>N.T., 6/6/11, at 204-08, 210, 214-15. The PCRA court then denied the motion for reconsideration but stayed its discovery order to allow the Commonwealth to pursue this appeal. <em><a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">at 219</a>. The court ordered that the file notes be preserved, and the Commonwealth complied. The Commonwealth timely appealed the PCRA court’s discovery order. In the meantime, the PCRA court proceeded with hearings on appellee’s PCRA petition.

The Commonwealth notes that, to be appealable under Rule 313, an order must be separable from the main cause of action; the right implicated must be important; and the claim must be such that, if immediate review is denied, the claim will be irreparably lost.

Second, according to the Commonwealth, protecting the work product of an attorney in a criminal case is an issue recognized as “important” because the doctrine “shelters the mental processes of the attorney, providing a privileged area within which he can analyze and prepare his client’s case,” which is vital “in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice system.” Commonwealth’s Brief, at 23 (quoting <em>United States v.

The trial prosecutor explained that she generally did not take notes, write reports, or document witness interviews, and that she followed that practice in this case. Instead, her practice was to simply talk to the witnesses. The trial prosecutor testified that she would have noted questions upon which to follow up at trial to explain discrepancies between a witness’s pre-trial statements and trial testimony, for example with respect to Logan’s trial statement that he hit Richard White with the gun with which appellee eventually murdered White. The trial prosecutor further testified that she had not made notes of any agreements with the witnesses, who had plea agreements to testify truthfully in federal cases related to several robberies. The trial prosecutor also stated that, while she discussed the witnesses’ prior statements with them, neither Avila nor Logan told her that their initial statements had been false; she continued that, in her experience in preparing witnesses for trial, additional information, changes in details, and explanations often came to light as a result of trust developed over the ongoing relationship. But, even though that development may have occurred with Avila and Logan, neither witness changed his core account that appellee killed Richard White. Indeed, according to the trial <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>prosecutor, if she had received any exculpatory evidence from the witnesses, she would have turned it over to appellee (who was representing himself) in court, on the record. The Commonwealth argues that former ADA Dantos’s testimony is clear that she did not create verbatim, or substantially verbatim, notes or reports of her interviews with the various witnesses; and any notes regarding planned lines of questioning of her witnesses at trial are plainly work product, not subject to disclosure. The Commonwealth then reemphasizes the deleterious side-effects of permitting disclosure of these notes to appellee.</p>

The Commonwealth also emphasizes that appellee had ample opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses at trial regarding any inconsistencies between their trial testimony and prior statements, as well as their federal plea agreements; his assertions that further evidence must exist, which was the premise for his <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>PCRA discovery request, either were speculative or were based upon misrepresentations of the record.

Appellee argues that other witnesses changed their stories as well, and that the changes were acknowledged by the trial prosecutor. He claims that his discovery request sought leave to look through the prosecutor’s notes and see if there was any undisclosed memorialization of the changed accounts.

The work product doctrine, on the other hand, is an exemption from discovery for certain types of documents, as illustrated in Criminal Rule 573(G): "Disclosure shall not be required of legal research or of records, correspondence, reports, or memoranda to the extent that they contain the opinions, theories, or conclusions of the attorney ... or members of their legal staffs.” For ease of discussion, we may refer to the doctrine as a privilege, while still appreciating the complexity.</p>

Further, in this capital appeal, in which Appellee’s conviction was based largely upon the testimony of his co-conspirators, the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”) court failed to set forth any meaningful analysis of the good cause standard for discovery, the work-product doctrine, the circumstances in this matter that led to its conclusion that the good cause requirement was met, or why the work product doctrine did not protect the Commonwealth from discovery. Thus, even assuming it is appropriate for our Court to reach the good cause issue, rather than reaching the merits (a conclusion I do not embrace), I would remand the matter to the PCRA court for the drafting of an opinion explaining the relevant standards of good cause, work product, the respective burdens of proof, and an analysis of the application of these standards to the circumstances of this matter.

Selenski, </em><a href="/pa/606/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="183" data-cite="606 Pa. 51" data-case-ids="4197972" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0051-01">606 Pa. 51</a>, <a href="/pa/606/0050-02" class="citation" data-index="184" data-cite="994 A.2d 1083" data-case-ids="4197888,4197972,4199504,7290850,7290875,7290900" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0050-02,/pa/606/0051-01,/pa/606/0050-01,/a2d/994/1083-01,/a2d/994/1083-02,/a2d/994/1083-03">994 A.2d 1083</a>, 1087 (Pa.2010). Further, an abuse of <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>discretion may not be found merely because an appellate court might have reached a different conclusion on the record before it. <em>Commonwealth v.

Indeed, in light of the absence of a meaningful PCRA court opinion, it appears that the majority has done just this, and rather than review for an abuse of discretion, has improperly engaged in <em>de novo </em>review. In my view, it is difficult in the extreme, and certainly imprudent in this capital matter, to analyze whether the PCRA court abused its discretion in these circumstances without an understanding of its rationale. Thus, I would remand this matter to the PCRA court for the drafting of an opinion explaining the basis for its discovery determinations. Only then will we be in a proper position to review the exercise of its discretion.</p>
