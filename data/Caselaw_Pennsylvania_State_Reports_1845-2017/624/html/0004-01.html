    <p id="b60-6" data-blocks='[["BL_60.5",60,[283,750,1150,901]]]'>The evidence adduced at Appellee’s jury trial established that, on January 31, 1995, Appellee, who was on parole for a robbery conviction at the time, and his brother, Dustin Spotz, engaged in an argument at the home of their mother and stepfather in Clearfield County. The argument began when Dustin’s fiancée’s teenage son placed a pet gerbil in front of Appellee’s face while he was watching television, resulting in Appellee yelling at the child and threatening to physically harm him. This angered Dustin, and the argument escalated into a physical confrontation, during which Dustin stabbed Appellee twice in the upper back with a butter knife, slightly wounding him. In response, Appellee threatened to kill Dustin, and he proceeded upstairs, returning with a handgun. Appellee fired eight shots at Dustin, two of which fatally struck Dustin in the chest. After Dustin fell to the ground, Appellee leaned over him, spit on his face, and stated, “There you go, pussy.”</p>
    <p id="b60-7" data-blocks='[["BL_60.6",60,[284,1679,1148,419]]]'>Dustin’s fiancée tried to call the police; however, Appellee grabbed the phone and declared nobody could call anyone until he escaped the scene. Appellee put the handgun in his pants and attempted to retrieve the spent bullet shells from the kitchen floor. Appellee, along with his paramour, Christine Noland, then fled the house in a vehicle driven by Appellee’s stepfather. Three days later, on February 3, 1995, the police apprehended Appellee at a motel in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In his version of events, Appellee indicated that, after Dustin said he was going to burn down the house and kill the kids, Dustin went into the kitchen where their stepfather was sitting and began throwing furniture. N.T., Trial, 9/25/1995, at 69-70, 73-74. In response, Appellee rushed into the kitchen, tried to push Dustin into a corner, and exchanged blows with him. N.T., Trial, 9/25/1995, at 75. With Appellee holding him, Dustin reached into the dish strainer, grabbed a butter knife, and stabbed Appellee. N.T., Trial, 9/25/1995, at 76. Appellee ran out of the kitchen, went upstairs to get his coat, which had a gun in the pocket, and returned to the kitchen where Dustin stood holding butter knives. N.T., Trial, 9/25/1995, at 81. Appellee admitted he told his stepfather to “get out of the way,” and he fired two shots at the floor. N.T., Trial, 9/25/1995, at 83. Appellee indicated Dustin looked at him and stated, “You don’t have any fuckin’ hair on your ass to shoot me, Pussy.” N.T., Trial, 9/25/1995, at 83. Appellee claimed Dustin had a butter knife in each hand and was about to attack him, his stepfather, and his mother, and <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>therefore, he shot Dustin in defensive response.

As relevant here, a PCRA petitioner will be granted relief only when he proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his conviction or sentence resulted from the “[i]n-effective assistance of counsel which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(h). “Counsel is presumed effective, and to rebut that presumption, the PCRA petitioner must demonstrate that counsel’s performance was deficient and that such deficiency prejudiced him.” <em>Colavita, </em><a href="/pa/606/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="606 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="4198882" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0001-01">606 Pa. at 21</a>, <a href="/pa/605/0669-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="993 A.2d 874" data-case-ids="3697476,3697817,4198882,7290308,7290325,7290380" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0669-01,/pa/605/0668-01,/pa/606/0001-01,/a2d/993/0874-01,/a2d/993/0874-02,/a2d/993/0874-03">993 A.2d at </a>886 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>supra). In Pennsylvania, we have refined the <em>Strickland </em>performance and prejudice test into a three-part inquiry. <em>See Pierce, supra. </em>Thus, to prove counsel ineffective, the petitioner must show that: (1) his underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) counsel had no reasonable basis for his action or inaction; and (3) the petitioner suffered actual prejudice as a result. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, the Commonwealth avers, as was within its province, the PCRA court specifically found Appellee’s trial counsel’s PCRA testimony not to be credible. <em>Commonwealth v.

That is, the Commonwealth asserts, based on the fact the PCRA court observed Appellee’s trial counsel’s demeanor during the hearing, as well as the fact Appellee’s trial counsel testified he “liked” Appellee, indicated he planned to represent Appellee at his upcoming three murder trials, and suggested he was aware Appellee could receive a new trial due to trial counsel’s ineffectiveness, the PCRA court properly concluded trial counsel’s testimony he simply “missed” the references was not credible.

However, since <em>Strickland/Pierce </em>requires an objective assessment of the reasonableness of counsel’s performance, this deference does not extend so far as to permit the PCRA court to base its decision on speculation derived from the testimony which it finds to be credible. <em>See Spotz I, </em><a href="/pa/582/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="582 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="650373" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0207-01">582 Pa. at 225</a>, <a href="/pa/582/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="870 A.2d 822" data-case-ids="650373,9019547" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0207-01,/a2d/870/0822-01">870 A.2d at 832</a> (indicating an objectively reasonable basis is required under <em>Strickland/Pierce </em>). Here, the PCRA court engaged in speculation when it concluded trial counsel strategically permitted the challenged cross-examination, without objection, as a means of seeking a new trial if an unfavorable verdict was returned. While the PCRA court explained it arrived at its theory based on the fact it found credible trial counsel’s general testimony (1) he intended to represent Appellee at his three other murder trials, (2) he testified he “liked” Appellee, and (3) he was aware that if Appellee’s appeal was granted he would receive a new trial, these cited facts do not support the PCRA court’s theory under the objective assessment of reasonableness required by <em>Strickland/Pierce. </em>Simply put, while the PCRA court was free to disbelieve trial counsel’s testimony he simply “missed” the challenged prosecutorial references, and we recognize few, if any, lawyers will admit to planting errors, an objective assessment of the record does not support the intentional, nefarious strategy provided by the PCRA court in the case <em>sub judice. </em>As we explained in <em>Spotz I, supra, </em>there are many reasons supporting, and a dearth of incentives for, trial counsel’s decision not to object to the challenged prosecutorial references in this particular case. <em>See Spotz I, </em><a href="/pa/582/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="582 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="650373" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0207-01">582 Pa. at 224-226</a>, <a href="/pa/582/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="870 A.2d 822" data-case-ids="650373,9019547" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0207-01,/a2d/870/0822-01">870 A.2d at 832-833</a>.

The Commonwealth submits that, contrary to this Court’s holding and directive in <em>Spotz I, </em>in determining whether Appellee met the “prejudice” prong, the Superior Court did not properly analyze the nature of the prosecutor’s post-arrest references against the strength of the prosecution’s case at trial. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Instead, the Commonwealth argues, the Superior Court applied an incorrect “harmless error” standard and summarily concluded the evidence against Appellee was not “so overwhelming that it rendered the error harmless.” Pointing to the fact the nature of the prosecutor’s references to Appellee’s post-arrest silence was “passing,” and the context of the references did not suggest to the jury that Appellee’s post-arrest silence was equated with a tacit admission of guilt, as well as detailing the evidence refuting Appellee’s claim of self-defense, the Commonwealth submits Appellee did not meet his burden of proving “actual prejudice.” Moreover, the Commonwealth notes the Superior Court’s decision was contradictory in that, on the one hand, the court <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>found prejudice on the basis the prosecutor’s references went to the “heart” of Appellee’s self-defense claim, while, on the other hand, the Superior Court specifically noted the evidence clearly showed Appellee did not act in self-defense since he was not free from fault in continuing the incident. Additionally, the Commonwealth notes, as this Court did in <em>Spotz I, </em>that the verdict in this case, though not an outright acquittal, nevertheless was favorable, as the verdict acquitted Appellee of the more serious counts of first and third degree murder.</p>

Appellee submits the prosecutor’s attack on Appellee’s credibility as to this issue undermined Appellee’s credibility as to the rest of his testimony, including Appellee’s testimony establishing he reasonably believed that deadly force was necessary to protect himself and/or his family from Dustin, resulting in the jury convicting him of voluntary manslaughter as opposed to outright acquitting him. That is, Appellee argues the only possible inference the jury could draw from the prosecutor’s references on cross-examination was that Appellee would not have remained silent if he had reasonably believed he had been acting in defense of self or others. As to the strength of the prosecution’s case at trial, Appellee, detailing the testimony and evidence presented by the defense at trial, submits the Superior Court did not err in holding “[wjhile there was evidence that supported the verdict, we cannot agree that the evidence was so overwhelming that it rendered the error harmless.” <em>Spotz, </em>No. 770 WDA 2010, <em>slip op. </em>at 8.</p>

    <blockquote id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[204,788,1110,1380]]]'>[A] defendant [raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel] is required to show actual prejudice; that is, that counsel’s ineffectiveness was of such magnitude that it ‘could have reasonably had an adverse effect on the outcome of the proceedings.’ <em>Pierce, </em>515 Pa. at 162, 527 A.2d at 977. This standard is different from the harmless error analysis that is typically applied when determining whether the trial court erred in taking or failing to take certain action. The harmless error standard, as set forth by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Story, </em>476 Pa. [391], 409, 383 A.2d [155], 164 [ (1978) ] (citations omitted), states that “[w]henever there is a <em>‘reasonable </em>possibility’ that an error ‘might have contributed to the conviction,’ the error is not harmless.” This standard, which places the burden on the Commonwealth to show that the error did not contribute to the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt, is a lesser standard than the <em>Pierce </em>prejudice standard, which requires the defendant to show that counsel’s conduct had an actual adverse effect on the outcome of the proceedings. This distinction appropriately arises from the difference between a direct attack on error occurring at trial and a collateral attack on the stewardship of counsel. In a collateral attack, we first presume that counsel is effective, and that not every error by counsel can or will result in a constitutional violation of a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Pierce, supra.</em>

The Commonwealth maintains, as it did in its second issue <em>supra, </em>the Superior Court applied an incorrect “harmless error” standard, and moreover, when the appropriate “actual prejudice” <em>Strickland/Pierce </em>standard is utilized, the totality of the evidence reveals the outcome of Appellee’s trial would not have been more favorable to him had his trial counsel objected to the trial court’s justification charge as it related to Appellee’s duty to retreat in defense of others. <em>See Ali, supra. </em>Summarizing the testimony and evidence, the Commonwealth submits that, even if the jury was instructed that Appellee’s duty to retreat was “directly equal” to his mother’s and stepfather’s duty to retreat, there is a reasonable probability the jury would still have convicted Appellee of voluntary manslaughter as opposed to relieving him of all culpability and acquitting him of the non-firearms charges. <em>Gribble, supra. </em>That is, the Commonwealth maintains that, even if instructed in the manner suggested by Appellee, the jury would have found Appellee shot Dustin “under a sudden and intense passion resulting from a serious provocation,” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2503(a)(1),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">20</a> and <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>would have rejected Appellee’s claim of defense of others.

Moreover, the record reveals there was overwhelming evidence presented at trial supporting the verdict of voluntary manslaughter under the theory that, at the time Appellee shot Dustin, he was acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by Dustin. <em>See Busanet, supra </em>(discussing overwhelming evidence of guilt as it relates to a finding of “actual prejudice” under the <em>Strickland/Pierce </em>standard); <em>Hutchinson, supra </em>(defining “heat of passion” voluntary manslaughter under Subsection 2503(a)(1)).
