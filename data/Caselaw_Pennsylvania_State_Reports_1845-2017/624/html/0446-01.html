Contrary to appellant’s assertions, appellate counsel’s performance, as evinced in appellant’s direct appeal briefs and evidentiary hearing transcripts, was more than adequate. Counsel’s briefs asserted trial counsel should have forced appellant to submit to psychiatric evaluation prior to the entry of his guilty plea to first degree murder. Appellate counsel supported her assertions by questioning trial counsel as to why he did not explore expert evaluation before advising appellant on a plea, especially due to the underlying mental “red flags” raised when the circumstances suggested appellant had engaged in sexual acts with a corpse. Appellate counsel developed expert testimony as to diminished capacity at the evidentiary hearing on trial counsel’s ineffectiveness, as Ralph E. Tarter, Ph.D. opined appellant “was functioning under extreme diminished <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>capacity.” N.T.

Further, as Dr. Martone had opined appellant only suffered from pedophilia, <em>see </em>Report of Christine Martone, M.D., 12/15/94, at 3-4, it was not unreasonable for appellate counsel to seek out another expert. Appellate counsel’s claims, which were presented and ultimately rejected on direct appeal, developed sufficient and adequate claims of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to explore a diminished capacity defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Merely because appellate counsel could have presented more or different experts does not prove she acted unreasonably.

Appellant also argues appellate counsel was ineffective because, had appellate counsel further investigated Dr. Martone’s and Dr. Tarter’s diagnoses, trial counsel’s ineffectiveness would have been apparent. Appellant asserts appellate counsel had no strategic reason for failing to properly present this claim, and exploiting the mental health evidence trial counsel failed to highlight would have resulted in appellant being awarded a new trial.

He also suggests counsel was ineffective for advising him to plead guilty to the second IDSI count. The Commonwealth contends this claim was previously litigated because we rejected it on direct appeal. It alleges the parties proceeded with the understanding the first IDSI count was the only felony relevant to the aggravating factor.

Thus, the record supports the PCRA court’s finding appellant was not prejudiced by the second count of IDSI, and appellant is not entitled to relief on this claim.

Our review of appellant's claims leads us to conclude appellate counsel, whose stewardship is the focus of our analysis, provided more than adequate representation of appellant on direct appeal. The dissent notes trial counsel’s efforts appear to have taken the path of least resistance, and that trial counsel’s deficiencies raise serious questions concerning whether appellant was afforded his constitutional right to effective representation. While we agree the Commonwealth has an obligation to provide an indigent capital defendant with the resources necessary for his defense, we do not believe, in the context of the circumstances, appellant received less than his entitlement. Appellate counsel litigated claims focused on trial counsel’s representation, underscoring in both written and oral advocacy the very facets of trial counsel's performance about which the dissent expresses concern. The alleged deficiencies of trial counsel that appellant now focuses on were not overlooked by appellate counsel, as the concurrence explains in more detail. Having thoroughly examined appellate counsel’s performance, which we have concluded was not below constitutional standards, we reject the assertion that appellant is entitled to further evidentiary proceedings in order to pursue his claims pertaining to trial counsel.</p>

    <p id="b544-12" data-blocks='[["BL_544.12",544,[278,1366,1149,678]]]'>To the extent appellant’s current claims depend upon a finding that counsel was ineffective on direct appeal, my own examination of the direct appeal record convinces me that appellant is not entitled to a remand for an evidentiary hearing. Two examples suffice to make my point. I turn first to appellant’s claim that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to present a diminished capacity defense. The Majority correctly observes that appellate counsel raised this claim on direct appeal and developed expert testimony in support of the claim. What is not fully or adequately conveyed by either this Court’s opinion on direct appeal or today’s Majority Opinion is the comprehensiveness of appellate counsel’s presentation of this claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

      <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>This was not an instance where direct appeal counsel raised a non-record-based claim with little or no support; instead, a review of the direct appeal briefs and evidentiary hearing transcripts reveals appellate counsel’s competent performance. Counsel’s brief in this Court argued that trial counsel should have had appellant examined by a psychiatric expert prior to the entry of his guilty plea to first-degree murder. This position was supported by appellate counsel’s questioning of trial counsel at the post-trial evidentiary hearing, where she pointedly asked trial counsel questions as to why he did not explore obtaining an expert before advising appellant to plead guilty, especially given the circumstances surrounding the murder which suggested that appellant had engaged in sexual acts with a dead victim. <em>See </em>N.T., 6/27-28/2000 (evidentiary hearing), at 93-96, 106-07. Appeal counsel also adduced through questioning trial counsel that Dr. Christine Martone, M.D., the chief psychiatrist at the Allegheny County Jail who was appointed by the trial court to evaluate appellant, only examined appellant after the entry of the guilty plea. Upon further questioning by appellate counsel, trial counsel testified that he relied on Dr. Martone’s expert report instead of obtaining a defense expert because he believed that she would be “neutral” and that there were only limited funds available for hiring experts by the Allegheny County Public Defender’s Office. However, counsel further admitted that he never made an inquiry about such funds. <em>Id. </em>at 117; <em>see also Fears, </em><a href="/pa/575/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="836 A.2d 52" data-case-ids="630415,9295629" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0281-01,/a2d/836/0052-01">836 A.2d at 73</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

      <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>Furthermore, also during the evidentiary hearing, direct appeal counsel presented expert testimony in support of a diminished capacity theory via Dr. Ralph Tarter, Ph.D., who specialized in clinical psychology and neuropsychology. Dr. Tarter conducted neuropsychological testing of appellant, reviewed background records provided by appellate counsel (which coincidentally were not obtained by trial counsel, <em>see </em>N.T., 6/27-28/2000, at 109), and reviewed the trial transcripts and police reports. Dr. Tarter testified to possible mitigating circumstances, but, more importantly for purposes of the instant claim, unequivocally opined that appellant was acting under diminished capacity at the time of the murder. <em>See id. </em>at 225 (“Based upon everything that I said this morning, I think quite strongly that the circumstances around that event, Mr. Fears decompensated, was psychotic and he certainly was functioning under extreme diminished capacity. I am sure he had no capacity at that point to clearly link behavior and intent to consequences.”).</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[274,1288,1149,847]]]'>It is true that direct appeal counsel ultimately tied her claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to explore evidence in support of third-degree murder, <em>i.e., </em>diminished capacity, to the overarching theory that trial counsel should never have advised appellant to plead guilty to first-degree murder. But, the fact remains that a claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness for failing to explore a diminished capacity defense was developed by appellate counsel at the hearing, and the claim was presented, and eventually rejected, on direct appeal. In my view, under these circumstances, the present layered ineffectiveness claim, which must focus upon appellate counsel, lacks merit, and indeed, amounts to little more than hindsight second-guessing. As the Majority observes, “[mjerely because appellate counsel could have presented more or different experts does not prove she acted unreasonably.” <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 464, 86 A.3d at 806.</p>

      <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>Second, regarding appellant’s claim that his mental health impairments prevented him from entering a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent guilty plea and waiver of a jury for purposes of the penalty phase, a more thorough review of direct appeal counsel’s performance likewise sheds important light. The Majority determines that appellant cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by direct appeal counsel’s presentation of this claim. The Majority bases its conclusion on the fact that “appellate counsel posited 12 factors to be considered” by this Court on direct appeal and provided a list of trial counsel’s alleged deficiencies. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 465, 86 A.3d at 806-07.</p>

As the Majority notes, eight of the enumerated factors specifically focused on trial counsel’s performance. These were the eight factors:</p>

      <em>See </em>Reply Brief of Appellant (on direct appeal), at 7-8. After providing this list of trial counsel’s deficiencies respecting the plea, direct appeal counsel pointedly concluded that, “A thorough and unvarnished analysis of the totality of the circumstances in this case should make this Court shudder at the cavalier approach to the death penalty taken by the lower court, the prosecution, and most unfortunately, by defense counsel.” <em>Id. </em>at 8 (emphasis added). In light of direct appeal counsel’s efforts, I am unconvinced by appellant’s current attack upon counsel respecting the voluntariness of appellant’s guilty plea.</p>
    <p id="b548-6" data-blocks='[["BL_548.6",548,[278,1060,1151,941]]]'>Mr. Justice Saylor’s Dissenting Opinion notes that trial counsel’s conduct was “troubling” as demonstrated by counsel’s apparent decision to take the path of least resistance at various phases of the proceedings and the related observation that the Commonwealth has an obligation to provide an indigent capital defendant with essential resources necessary to his defense. I share these sentiments generally. However, in this case, we have the interposition of new appointed counsel on appeal, who litigated claims focusing upon trial counsel and, in my view, this must change the calculus. Many of appellant’s positions here, forwarded by lawyers from the Philadelphia-based Federal Community Defender Office (“FCDO”), merely take claims identified and developed by appeal counsel and rejected by this Court, and spin off new theories of support or criticism. This all-out attack upon prior counsel is typical of the FCDO’s litigation style in these many cases where they have involved themselves questionably in state-court capital litigation.</p>
    <p id="b548-7" data-blocks='[["BL_548.7",548,[279,2025,1148,307]],["BL_549.1",549,[164,292,1149,623]]]'>The alleged deficiencies of trial counsel seized upon by federal counsel here did not escape the notice of direct appeal counsel. Notably, in the direct appeal brief, counsel argued that trial counsel had abdicated his responsibility to meaningfully test the prosecution’s case by advising appellant to plead guilty to first-degree murder; allowing a waiver of appellant’s <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>right to a sentencing jury while failing to fully inform appellant of the ramifications; conducting no independent investigation into appellant’s background for sentencing purposes; and moving into evidence the entire pre-sentence investigation report without limiting consideration of the highly prejudicial and inadmissible portions of the report. Indeed, counsel’s direct appeal brief is not unlike the Dissenting Opinion, as appellate counsel pointedly asserted, “[i]n the most critical areas of this case, counsel acquiesced to the prosecution’s legal theories---- Counsel’s total capitulation caused him to take the bad with the good.” <em>See </em>Brief of Appellant (on direct appeal), at 97-98.</p>

The lawsuit resulted in a settlement agreement, which was discussed by appellate counsel in her brief and was also the subject of extensive questioning of trial counsel during the evidentiary hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 98-99.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Appellate counsel also pointed to numerous changes that had taken place in the Allegheny County Public Defender’s Office since the time of appellant’s trial as proof of the deficiency in prior policies. <em>See </em>N.T., 6/27-28/2000, at 106-07. In short, the alleged <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>failings of trial counsel’s representation, both personal and systemic, did not escape the notice of appellate counsel; and in this case, at least, appellate counsel’s performance must be accounted for when the underlying claim sounds in the deficiencies of trial counsel.

      <em>See, e.g., </em>Majority Opinion, at 473, 86 A.3d at 811 (“Because the Public Defender’s Office lacked funds for an expert, and trial counsel believed Dr. Martone would provide helpful expert testimony, we found he acted reasonably.”). The State, however, has an obligation to provide an indigent capital defendant with essential resources necessary to his defense. Whether the responsibility for underrepresentation lies directly at the feet of the State or is attributable to errors or omissions on the part of the attorney the State has provided, the practical result to the indigent capital defendant will be the same: he will have been denied his constitutional right to an adequate defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

It is particularly troubling to me that trial counsel’s efforts, at each critical stage, appear to reflect the path of least resistance. He advocated a plea to first-degree murder (although he did not apprehend that prevailing law at the time did not recognize such a plea); he favored the waiver of Appellant's jury-trial right relative to penalty, thus foregoing the chance of gaining a life sentence by persuading only one of twelve jurors; without training or experience, counsel did so based on the dubious assumption that the trial judge would be impressed with Appellant’s decision to plead guilty and/or the very mixed information deriving from a pre-sentence report (whereas, predictably, the court was not impressed); counsel did nothing to approximate a reasonable life-history and mental health investigation; and he did not so much as ask the trial court for funding to secure a mental-health evaluation of his client.</p>
