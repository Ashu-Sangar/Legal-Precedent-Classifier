Because we conclude that the reviewable issues raised by Appellant’s appeal are without merit, sufficient evidence supports the verdict, and the sentence of death was not arbitrarily imposed or the product of passion or prejudice, we affirm the judgments of sentence.</p>

Seventy-eight-year-old Jean Heck was found by her neighbors lying dead in a pool of blood in her house in Upper St. Clair Township, on June 4, 2003. She had been beaten, strangled, stomped upon, and stabbed. Prior to the discovery of Ms. Heck’s body, one of the neighbors saw a man leave Ms. Heck’s house and drive away in a newer model vehicle. She later identified this individual in a police photo array as Appellant, Patrick Jason Stollar.</p>

It was later discovered that during the time the police were investigating the scene at the victim’s house on June 4, 2003, Appellant was at his bank unsuccessfully attempting to cash a check drawn from the victim’s account, purportedly executed by the victim, and made payable to him in the amount of $4,000. The next day, Appellant attempted to cash a second check drawn from the victim’s account, again purportedly executed by the victim, and made payable to him in the amount of $2,500.</p>

In this statement, Appellant confessed to the murder, providing details of the crime and further telling the police that he had gone to the victim’s house with the intent of robbing and killing her. Appellant additionally told the police that he had buried the clothing he had worn during the crime, the knife he had used to stab the victim, and certain items he had stolen from the victim’s purses. On June 6, 2003, Appellant took the police to the site where he had buried the aforementioned items. At the site, the police recovered the knife used to stab the victim, blood-spattered clothing, blood-covered tissues that corroborated Appellant’s statement that he had wiped blood from the knife with tissues taken from the victim’s house, the victim’s checkbook, a wallet containing the victim’s driver’s license, <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>and several credit cards that belonged to the victim.

With respect to the latter, Appellant was also charged with one count each of robbery, burglary, and theft by unlawful taking, and with two counts of forgery. Counsel was appointed to represent Appellant. At time of trial, Appellant’s stand-by counsel for the guilt phase was Robert L. Foreman, Esq., and his penalty-phase counsel was James E. DePasquale, Esq. A forensic social worker was also appointed to aid in Appellant’s defense.

The very next day, however, another hearing was held at which the court granted Appellant leave to withdraw his guilty pleas.

Following these hearings, the trial court determined that Appellant was competent to waive his right to the assistance of counsel. However, following additional hearings, including one on April 17, 2007, where an examining psychiatrist testified regarding her observations of Appellant, the court determined that Appellant was not competent to stand trial. On April 18, 2007, Appellant was once again committed for involuntary mental health treatment.</p>

Put another way, the trial court addressed the merits of appellant’s ineffectiveness claims, but not on the basis of what <em>Holmes </em>now recognizes as valid exceptions to the rule of deferral expressed in <em>Grant. </em>To wit, the court did not find appellant’s ineffectiveness claims to be so meritorious and apparent from the record as to require immediate vindication (to the contrary, the court rejected all of appellant’s ineffectiveness claims as essentially meritless); nor did the court reach the merits of these claims because appellant validly waived his right to PCRA review. Although the trial court proceeded under <em>Bomar, Holmes's </em>express disapproval of extensions of <em>Bomar, </em>and its limiting of <em>Bomar </em>to that case’s <em>pre-Grant </em>facts, requires that these claims be deferred to PCRA review, where appellant will be free to better develop them.</p>

New counsel raised a number of ineffectiveness claims post-verdict, but all such claims appear to have derived solely from the trial record, without supplementation by an external post-trial investigation. Thus, this case is not like <em>Bomar, </em>where new counsel marshaled a full and complete collateral attack. Furthermore, on appeal, appellant pursues but two of the claims he raised below, both of which are based upon the existing record, supplemented only by trial counsel’s testimony at the hearing on appellant’s post-verdict motions. It appears that the second claim is waived in whole or in part: the claim has morphed from alleging a failure to request a penalty phase jury charge on emotional disturbance mitigation (as argued below) into a broader challenge (now argued on appeal) alleging a failure to make use of guilt phase testimony to pursue mental health mitigation during the penalty phase. Given the importance of mitigation-based claims of ineffectiveness, and the fact that it is apparent that appellant suffers from some mental impairment or instability, it is better to afford him a full chance to develop this collateral claim — and any others he may have — under the PCRA.</p>
