      <em>Id. </em>However, this argument ignores § 4.08, titled “Principal Distributions,” which provides for the termination and distribution of the trust upon Mr. Miller’s death. <em>See id., </em>at 5 (“If the Settlor’s spouse ... predeceases the Settlor, the Trust shall terminate ... [and] shall be distributed, absolutely” first to appellees’ daughter, then her issue, then in equal shares to appellees’ individual siblings.). That is, this trust may end and the property pass before the settlor dies; as such, this situation is not equivalent to inheritance. Given that § 4.03 clearly provides an avenue by which trust distributions shall be made to persons other than Mrs. Miller prior to her death, the Miller Trust in the end fails to meet the definition of living trust or will substitute.</p>
