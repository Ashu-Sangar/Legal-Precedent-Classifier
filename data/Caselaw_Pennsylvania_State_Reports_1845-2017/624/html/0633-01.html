The only place wherein a statutory provision included within Subchapter C of the Home Rule Law specifically speaks to a change in the method of election is in the narrow exception for county commissioners in 53 Pa.C.S. § 2941(b). This provision renders the creation of a government study commission unnecessary prior to “changes in the method of election of a municipal governing body from at large elections to elections by district, maintain at-large elections or a combination of at-large elections and elections by district.” As such, these changes, otherwise covered by the broad language of Section 2930, may be accomplished via the Subchapter C procedure. <em>See </em>53 Pa.C.S. § 2941(b). Indeed, if the Commonwealth Court is correct that <em>any </em>amendments — no matter how fundamental — may be accomplished without a government study commission, then 53 Pa.C.S. § 2941(b) would be superfluous.</p>
