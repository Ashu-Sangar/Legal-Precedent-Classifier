To the extent this Court finds § 305(a)(1) unclear, the Commonwealth asserts the following considerations weigh heavily in favor of finding legislative intent to impose absolute liability: (1) “the mischief to be remedied is roving dogs which is in the public interest” and (2) § 305(a)(l)’s predecessor contained identical language and was interpreted as an absolute liability offense. Commonwealth’s Brief, at 14-15 (citation omitted); <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(3), (5) (delineating considerations to be applied in determining legislative intent). In response to appellant’s examples of “absurd” results stemming from interpreting § 305(a)(1) as an absolute liability offense, the Commonwealth notes defenses focusing on third-party action are still available for absolute liability offenses and contends appellant’s argument is based on a misapplication of the absurdity doctrine. The Commonwealth contends “[t]he absurdity doctrine allows that a provision may be either disregarded or judicially corrected as an error I if failing to do so would result in a disposition that no reasonable person could approve” and only applies “to correct obviously unintended dispositions[.]” Commonwealth’s Brief, at 17, 19. Section 305(a), the Commonwealth argues, was specifically written as a strict liability offense to “promote[ ] the public welfare by enforcing compliance through the regulation and confinement of dogs”; therefore, the absurdity doctrine does not apply. <em>Id., </em>at 19 (citations omitted).</p>

Section 305 of the Dog Law provides, in pertinent part, that it “shall be unlawful for the owner or keeper of any dog to fail to keep at all times the dog in any of the following manners: (1) confined within the premises of the owner; (2) firmly secured by means of a collar and chain - or other device so that it cannot stray beyond the premises on which it is secured; or (3) under the reasonable control of some person, or when engaged in lawful hunting, exhibition, performance events or field training.” 3 P.S. § 459-305(a). The Opinion in Support of Reversal (“OISR”) argues that this statute includes “somewhat obligatory terms” that do “not necessarily equate to an intent to impose absolute liability.” OISR at 477-78. But, just like Justice Eakin, I cannot agree that the language of Section 305 provides a mere suggestion. The plain language of the statute is mandatory, and clearly it includes no express <em>scienter </em>requirement. <em>See, e.g., Baehr v. Commonwealth, ex rel. Lower Merion Twp., </em>51 Pa.Cmwlth. 241, <a href="/citations/?q=414%20A.2d%20415" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="414 A.2d 415">414 A.2d 415</a>, 417 (1980) (identically-worded predecessor statute “unmistakably speaks in terms of strict liability for its violation, and a moment’s reflection on the purpose of the statute buttresses our conclusion”). <em>See also Commonwealth v.

Given the obvious public welfare purpose of the statute, I find no ambiguity in its language. And, at the time of the incident involved here, Muncy the dog was not confined within the owner’s premises, was not confined by means of a collar or chain or other device to prevent its straying beyond those premises, and was not under anyone’s reasonable control. Muncy ran freely across the street and attacked another dog. The evidence presented <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>was sufficient to find a violation. The mere fortuity that there were no serious injuries involved here does nothing to diminish the fact that Muncy’s uncontrolled and potentially dangerous behavior clearly demonstrates the reason why such a statute exists, and why its violation should constitute an absolute liability offense. Indeed, requiring <em>scienter </em>effectively neuters the statute; which is ironic since the statute is intended to neuter the carelessness of dog owners such as appellant.</p>

Following a bench trial in the instant case, the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County found Appellant guilty of a second violation of Section 305(a)(1), a misdemeanor of the third degree, 3 P.S. § 459-903(b)(2), and sentenced him to six months of non-reporting probation and a $500 fine.

Appellant also challenges the Superior Court’s proffered reason that it would be difficult to establish culpability in the absence of absolute liability, asserting that, while the mandate to confine a dog is stated in absolute terms, convenience of investigation and prosecution is not the primary inquiry in ascertaining the elements of an offense, citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Indeed, the statutory language concerning a violation if an owner “fail[s]” to confine his or her dog on the premises could suggest an assessment of reasonableness of action taken to confine a dog, implying a culpability component. In any event, these competing possibilities indicate that an intent to make the offense one of absolute liability certainly does not, in our view, “plainly appear.” Moreover, as noted above, we are mindful that absolute liability crimes are disfavored, and Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law is a penal statute that must be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1928(b)(1).</p>

Justice Eakin in his Opinion in Support of Affirmance offers that the term "fails” renders the statute unambiguous, and that the General Assembly intended to impose absolute criminal liability for a second conviction for failing to keep one’s dog confined. Opinion in Support of Affirmance (Eakin, J.) at 469-70. Justice Eakin contrasts this with Section 504-A of the Dog Law, 3 P.S. § 459-504-A, regarding dangerous dogs, and its use of the term "permit,” which in his view "clearly involv[es] an intent element.” <em>Id. </em>at 471. In our view, Justice Eakin’s distinction between these terms is overstated, as both "permitting” and "failing” suggest at least a degree of culpability. Moreover, the term "fail” is not as categorical in meaning as suggested by Justice Eakin, as other statutes containing such language have not been deemed to be absolute liability crimes. <em>See Commonwealth v. Bready, </em><a href="/pa-super/220/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="220 Pa. Super. 157" data-case-ids="798635" data-case-paths="/pa-super/220/0157-01">220 Pa.Super. 157</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=286%20A.2d%20654" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="286 A.2d 654">286 A.2d 654</a>, 656-57 (1971) (concluding statute imposing criminal liability on magistrate "who shall fail to” make monthly reports did <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>not impose strict liability). Also, notably absent from Justice Eakin's analysis is any recognition that our statutory construction be performed through the lens that it "plainly appear” the legislature intended to impose strict liability on dog owners or that the law disfavors absolute liability crimes.</p>
      <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.2",355,[204,1202,1119,975]]]'>Furthermore, Justice Eakin’s analogy to the keeping of a tiger imposing absolute liability actually sharpens our point. Under the Game and Wildlife Code, a tiger is defined as an "exotic wildlife,” which, in addition to tigers, includes, <em>inter alia, </em>lions, cheetahs, cougars, and bears. 34 Pa.C.S.A. § 2961. Possession of such exotic wildlife requires a permit. <em><a href="/citations/?q=286%20A.2d%20654" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="286 A.2d 654">Id.</a> </em>at § 2963. A possessor of such wildlife may be criminally liable if he or she “fail[s] to exercise due care in safeguarding the public from attack by exotic wildlife” or "[rjecklessly engage[s] in conduct which places or may place another person in danger of attack by exotic wildlife.” 34 Pa.C.S.A. § 2963(c)(3), (4). Thus, while the classic law school illustration may impose absolute liability on the keeper of a tiger, Pennsylvania law does not. That the Commonwealth must establish that the possessor of a wild animal, such as a tiger, has failed to exercise due care, or was reckless, before imposing criminal liability, supports our finding that a violation of Section 305 regarding a failure to confine a domesticated dog should not be interpreted as an absolute liability offense. Indeed, it would, in our view, be absurd to impose absolute liability on a pet owner who fails to confine his or her dog, but not upon one who fails to confine his or her lion, tiger, or bear. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922. Finally, Justice Eakin's analogy to speeding, while having visceral appeal, is similarly problematic, as the Motor Vehicle Code provision involving maximum speed limits mandates that "no person shall drive a vehicle at a speed in excess of" a maximum limit, 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3362, arguably a more unqualified command than a failure to confine.</p>

We acknowledge the oddity of a first violation of Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law being an absolute liability offense, but, despite the same language, a second violation requiring at least a showing of reckless<a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>ness. Yet, as explained above, Section 305 of the Crimes Code, by its terms, mandates this result. Moreover, in light of the significant prison term for conviction of a second violation, this approach is in keeping with the legislature's mandate to " 'tone down’ absolute or strict liability in penal law as a whole,” where such application of absolute liability "cannot be readily defended where the offense carries a possible jail sentence.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 305, official cmt.</p>

Contrary to Chief Justice Castille’s concern that our interpretation "effectively neuters the statute,” Opinion in Support of Affirmance (Castille, J.) at 472, we are confident that the Commonwealth would not be handicapped by the requirement of proving recklessness, and would be able to meet its burden with circumstantial evidence, just as it does in numerous other areas of criminal law, and, indeed, as noted above, is required to do so under the Game and Wildlife Code. <em>See supra </em>note 7.</p>
