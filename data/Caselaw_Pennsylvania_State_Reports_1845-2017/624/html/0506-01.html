As the relationship progressed, Tondra’s friends observed bruises, scars, and bite marks on her body that she attributed to Appellant, whom she described as abusive. In the spring of 1995, Tondra met a man named Cleveland English and secretly began spending time with him. As she grew closer to English, they discussed marriage, but Tondra was concerned about leaving Appellant. When English visited her at a street festival in June, 1995, Tondra was “horrified” and ordered English to stay away from her because Appellant carried a gun, and would shoot English without hesitation. Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), Feb. 10, 2000, at 124. English obeyed Tondra’s command and avoided her for the remainder of the day. One of Tondra’s closest friends, Fay Millner, testified that during the time that she and Tondra occupied a vendor booth at the street festival, and presumably after English’s departure, Appellant hid behind a tree and stared at Tondra for approximately one hour. <em>See </em>N.T., Feb. 11, 2000, at 31.</p>

To support her claims, she produced photographs of her injuries and an audiotape that contained a recorded telephone message in which Appellant threatened to kill her and her family. The photographs were consistent with Tondra’s physical appearance at the time of the interview; Detective Hart observed numerous signs of physical abuse on Tondra’s body including facial bruising, a black eye, and a bite mark on Tondra’s left arm. At the conclusion of the interview, Detective Hart charged Appellant with multiple crimes.</p>

Upon listening to the audiotape, from which she was able to positively identify Appellant’s voice, Officer Welsh advised Tondra to avoid her parents’ home and stay at a secure location. The following day, as Officer Welsh was discussing the matter with her supervisor, she received a frantic telephone call from Tondra’s father informing her that Appellant was pacing back and forth in front of the Dennis residence. Based on that information, Officer Welsh accompanied a team of parole agents to the house with orders to detain Appellant. Shortly thereafter, when the agents arrested Appellant on a nearby street, he was carrying a black gym bag that contained a bolt cutter and a dead bolt that had been removed surreptitiously from the rear entrance to the Dennis residence.</p>

A hearing was scheduled for January 25, 1996, and New York parole revocation specialist Darcella Jones telephoned Tondra numerous times to secure her attendance. Based on their telephone conversations, Jones assumed that Tondra would testify against Appellant at the hearing; however, on January 2,1996, Jones received a notarized letter from Tondra indicating that Appellant was innocent and that Tondra fabricated all of the allegations to punish Appellant after he informed her that he had been unfaithful to her. Jones wrote a letter to Tondra imploring her to testify against Appellant and received a second letter from Tondra, on January 22, 1996, reiterating that the charges were false and that she would not be attending the hearing. When Officer Welsh intervened on Jones’s behalf, Tondra explained that if she testified against Appellant, she would be killed. <em>See </em>N.T., Feb. 9, 2000, at 88. Unable to persuade Tondra to attend the parole revocation hearing, Jones could not sustain the charges against Appellant, and he was released from custody on January 30, 1996.</p>

She extinguished the lights and walked to the kitchen window, which overlooks 54th Street, and she observed a man and a woman arguing near the curb. Although she had a clear view of the couple, Fauntleroy could not see the man’s face because he was standing with his back to the window.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> As Fauntleroy turned to walk away, she heard a “pow” sound.

She drove to the intersection and found Tondra’s lifeless body lying in the street approximately 357 feet from the residence Appellant previously shared with his mother. Two nine-millimeter cartridge casings were recovered near the body, but no weapons were found. An autopsy revealed that Tondra had been shot once in the neck with a nine-millimeter handgun, and the bullet severed her spinal cord, which caused her to suffocate. The medical examiner opined that the manner of death was homicide.</p>

As a result, the case was re-assigned to Philadelphia Homicide Detective Thomas Kane in January, 1998. After speaking with numerous individuals in Philadelphia and New York who were acquainted with Appellant, Detective Kane obtained an arrest warrant charging Appellant with the murder of Tondra <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>Dennis. The arrest warrant was forwarded to New York authorities who believed Appellant was living in an apartment building located in the Bronx, and, on April 3, 1998, four detectives from New York City’s 44th Precinct proceeded to that address to execute the warrant. When no one answered the door, one of the detectives peered through a window and saw an individual who matched Appellant’s description. As Appellant was wanted for murder, the detectives summoned an emergency response team that surrounded the building and initiated contact with Appellant through a hostage negotiator. Approximately two hours and fifteen minutes later, Appellant surrendered peacefully to law enforcement officers.</p>
    <p id="b570-4" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[272,937,1151,1157]]]'>Appellant maintained his innocence and requested a jury trial. Over the course of the eight-day trial, the Commonwealth sought to prove Appellant’s guilt by documenting his abusive relationship with Tondra, establishing that he was in Philadelphia on the night of the murder, and showing that he harassed other girlfriends in a similar manner. To accomplish the second and third objectives, the Commonwealth presented testimony that Appellant patronized a Philadelphia pizzeria hours before Tondra was killed, notwithstanding that he contended that he was in New York at the time, and that Appellant attempted to control three other female partners through acts of violence and intimidation that prompted criminal charges and resulted in convictions for arson and assault. N.T., Feb. 2, 2000, at 56-58. Appellant downplayed the significance of his prior convictions, claimed that he and Tondra reconciled shortly before her death, and called an alibi ■witness, Esperita Granville, who testified that Appellant continuously resided in New York City from February through mid-March, 1996. According to Granville, Appellant moved into her Bronx apartment prior to the murder, and he returned home each night by 9:00 p.m. to comply with a curfew imposed by the New York State Board of Parole.</p>

We disagree. The record establishes that a man armed with a nine-millimeter handgun shot Tondra in the neck during an altercation that occurred near the home of Appellant’s mother. Additional testimony established that Appellant had been romantically involved with Tondra, that he had beaten her on numerous occasions, that he had threatened to kill Tondra and her family, and that New York authorities attempted to revoke his parole shortly before the murder because Tondra reported the threats and beatings to his parole officer. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, this circumstantial evidence was clearly sufficient to support the conclusion that Appellant was responsible for Tondra’s murder.

At trial, however, Tanesha did not testify that Appellant claimed responsibility for her brother’s death at his funeral, but rather that Appellant merely observed the funeral from an unknown vantage point, and King was unavailable to testify.

When Tanesha’s testimony failed to comport with the Commonwealth’s offer of proof, Appellant’s counsel did not move to strike the statements concerning Richard’s death, request a mistrial, or seek a limiting instruction to minimize the potential for prejudice.

Additionally, the trial court cautioned the jury that the prosecutor’s statements did not constitute evidence and that evidence of Appellant’s prior offenses should be considered only for the limited purpose of establishing that he acted pursuant to a common scheme, plan, or design.

Section 5721.1(b), specifically, appears to be concerned primarily, if not exclusively, with governmental interceptions of communications without prior approval, rather than with private interceptions. This statutory construct is logical, because civil actions are available to vindicate privacy interests affected by purely private action. Non-governmental recordings, such as the victim’s here, are only obliquely implicated by the statutory exclusionary rule because of the reference to the exceptions in Section 5704. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>§ 5704(4). The obvious purpose of the reference to Section 5704 in Section 5721.1 is to signal that the statutory exclusionary rule is not authorized if one of the exceptions to the prohibition of interception and disclosure applies. Any intent of the General Assembly to extend the statutory exclusionary rule beyond constitutional requirements to apply to private conduct requires at best circuitous construction by the Court. The intent is certainly not explicit.</p>

But, simply because the General Assembly imposed sanctions on private persons intercepting communications it is not automatically true that the General Assembly intended to penalize the government, and the people, in criminal prosecutions, if the government afterwards lawfully obtained the private recording. It is also counter-intuitive that suppression would be a rote remedy in cases of non-governmental interceptions, given that such actions are not of constitutional magnitude. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. </em>Blystone, <a href="/pa/519/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="519 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1813568" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0450-01">519 Pa. 450</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="519 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1813568" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0450-01">549 A.2d 81</a>, 87-88 (1988) (warrantless government interceptions of wire communications, with consent of one party, do not violate either Fourth Amendment of U.S. Constitution or Article I, Section 8 of Pennsylvania Constitution) (citing <em>Caceres, <a href="/us/440/0741-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="440 U.S. 741" data-case-ids="6188710" data-case-paths="/us/440/0741-01">supra</a> </em>(failure of IRS agent to follow agency regulations before recording conversations with taxpayer did not require suppression of recordings in prosecution of taxpayer for bribing agent)).</p>

It is one thing for the General Assembly to accept and codify a common law evidentiary rule, such as privilege rules. But, it is quite another matter to proscribe a legislative rule of evidence, particularly one which impedes the core truth-finding function of a criminal trial, and without advancing a constitutional value.

The totality of circumstances, as evident from the parties’ conversation — which the Majority reproduces in footnote 13— shows that appellant was well aware that the victim may have been taping the conversation and, nonetheless, he continued to make statements rather than disconnect the phone call. Appellant assented to the recording by repeatedly disavowing any expectation or interest in keeping the conversation with the victim private and expressing disinterest, in no unclear terms, in whether he was being recorded. In my view, appellant gave implied consent to the interception of his telephone conversation with the victim. The trial court did not err on this basis in admitting the recording of the parties’ conversation, containing highly probative, relevant evidence. <em>See </em>Tr. Ct. Op., 8/7/2008, at 13. Indeed, no cognizable value would be forwarded by exclusion of the recording especially where, as here, there was evidence that appellant was the cause of the victim’s unavailability, which prevented the victim from relaying to the jury the threats he unquestionably made during that phone call.</p>
