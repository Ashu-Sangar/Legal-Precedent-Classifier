    <blockquote id="b52-7" data-blocks='[["BL_52.6",52,[328,653,1104,736]]]'>(1) Does the Act’s liability cap violate equal protection principles in this case where (a) the cap reduced the jury’s verdict by over 96% because [petitioner] was injured by a local agency [that] operated the school bus; (b) [petitioner] would be entitled to recover the jury’s full verdict had a private entity instead operated the school bus, as in commonplace among school districts; and (c) as this Court held forty years ago, political subdivision immunity is “an anachronism, without rational basis” because local agencies may purchase liability insurance and tort liability promotes accountability and accident-prevention? <em>See Ayala v.

    <blockquote id="b52-8" data-blocks='[["BL_52.7",52,[327,1413,1105,473]]]'>(2) Does the Act’s liability cap violate equal protection principles in this case where (a) Pennsbury purchased $11 million in insurance, funded by taxpayers, including [petitioner’s] parents; (b) [petitioner] could recover her judgment at least to the extent of the available insurance; and (c) the Commonwealth Court’s majority opinion acknowledged that the available insurance presented “intriguing, and perhaps appealing” issues regarding the Act’s constitutionality?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b52-9" data-blocks='[["BL_52.8",52,[326,1907,1105,302]]]'>(3) Does the liability cap violate [petitioner’s] right to jury trial guaranteed by Article I, Section 6 of the Pennsylvania constitution where Pennsbury did not challenge the verdict’s excessiveness yet the liability cap eviscerated the verdict by reducing [petitioner’s] recovery by over 96%?</blockquote>
