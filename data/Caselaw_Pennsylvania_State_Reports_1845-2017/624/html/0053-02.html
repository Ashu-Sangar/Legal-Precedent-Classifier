The legislation which ultimately became Act 152 of 2004 originated in the Pennsylvania State Senate on January 29, 2003 with the introduction of Senate Bill 92 of 2003, P.N. 0091. (“S.B. 92, P.N. 91”). This eight-page bill had two sections amending Section 8103 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8103, governing deficiency judgment procedures in the courts of common pleas after an execution sale of real property. The first section set a six-month statute of limitations for certain judgment creditors or debtors to file a valuation petition for real property purchased at an execution sale,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> while the second section established, <em>inter alia, </em>deficiency judgment procedures when parcels of real property are located in more than one county.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> This bill was passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 11, 2003, and, thereafter, was considered by the full Senate three separate times, with final passage in the Senate occurring on March 5, 2003.</p>

After the second consideration, S.B. 92, P.N. 91 was referred to the House Appropriations Committee, which re-reported it on July 15, 2003, without amendment, for final consideration by the full House. However, during its final consideration on the House floor, the bill was amended to add two sections, one creating a separate chapter in Title 42 to <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>govern eviction proceedings between landlords and tenants, and another section amending the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act to establish the jurisdiction of county park police in counties of the third class.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> This altered legislation was redesignated S.B. 92, P.N. 1105.

At his sentencing hearing, the trial court entertained argument on this motion, rejected all of Appellant’s constitutional attacks, and sentenced him to an aggregate sentence of 13/6 to 27 years imprisonment.

Pursuant to the principles articulated in these cases, the court reviewed <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>the multiple provisions of Act 152 and, based on its observations that the provisions amending Megan’s Law were both the first and last sections of the law, comprising almost 60% of its total pages, determined that the focus of Act 152 was those amendments. The court opined that there was “little relationship” between the amendments to Megan’s Law and the provisions of Act 152 amending the deficiency judgment statutes, nor, in the court’s view, was there any apparent way to harmonize the other subjects of the bill involving the establishment of statutes of limitations and county police jurisdiction. <em>Neiman, </em><a href="/a3d/5/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 A.3d 353" data-case-ids="7285904" data-case-paths="/a3d/5/0353-01">5 A.3d at 359</a>.

The General Assembly asserts that “this Court should not sever any aspect of Act 152 [,and] [i]f Act 152 is found to violate <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>Article III, Section 3, then [it] should be treated as unconstitutional in its entirety.” Brief of the General Assembly at 16.</p>

However, such a determination of legislative intent becomes problematic where, as here, a piece of omnibus legislation contains a multiplicity of disparate subjects, and the subjects are enumerated within its title. In such circumstances, it is difficult for a reviewing court to parse, from the various subjects comprising the omnibus legislation, a “main” purpose for it, as the facts of the instant case illustrate.</p>
    <p id="b123-5" data-blocks='[["BL_123.5",123,[157,1026,1150,1065]]]'>It is true that, in terms of raw page numbers, a significant portion of Act 152 was comprised of the Megan’s Law amendments; however, this fact alone does not support the Superior Court’s conclusion that these amendments were the main purpose of the bill. These amendments were inserted <em>in toto </em>at the very end of the amendatory process and just before Act 152 was voted on by both houses of the General Assembly. By contrast, the other provisions relating to deficiency judgments were the sole subjects of the legislation which became Act 152 at its inception, and they remained in all subsequent versions until final passage; hence, an equally plausible argument can be made that this continuity of inclusion of these provisions by the General Assembly in all versions of the legislation which became Act 152, evidences its primary focus on having these provisions become law. Thus, this underscores the reality that discerning the “main” purpose of a piece of'legislation becomes an untenable exercise in conjecture when the legislation has metamorphosed during the legislative process to include a panoply of additional and disparate subjects.</p>

To some degree, however, any law passing through the enactment process is the result of salutary legislative compromise and the single-subject rule is not intended to completely discourage such compromise.

      <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>In light of these considerations, while I find the question to be exceedingly close, I do not believe that Act 152 clearly, plainly and palpably violates the single subject restriction. Initially, I accept the explanations of the Commonwealth and of the General Assembly that refinement of civil remedies, in the present context, is a sufficiently narrow legislative topic. The topic encompasses a manageable category of issues selected for inclusion and outlined in the Judicial Code. That the law amends primarily one title is not, of course, dispositive of the inquiry — as the Majority concludes also. Nevertheless, this fact is relevant to our inquiry because the very reason Pennsylvania laws are consolidated within the same title is because they generally have some close kinship. Moreover, it is not beyond cavil that the General Assembly would seek to remedy perceived gaps within the topic of statutory civil remedies at one time, via the same statute, for the purposes of efficiency and in order to ensure consistency. I recognize that the issue of refining civil remedies may not be as narrow as “gaming” was in the context of the Court’s decision in <em>PAGE, </em>but, at least in my view, neither is it as broad as the topic of “municipalities” was in the context of the decision in <em>City of Philadelphia </em>or the topic of “powers of county commissioners” was in the context of the decision in <em>Jury Commissioners. </em>Thus, in <em>City of Philadelphia, </em>the Court held that the subject of “municipalities” was too broad where used to describe provisions as different as restricting the political activities of police officers; authorizing parking authorities to undertake mixed-use development projects; imposing a citizenship requirement for board members of business improvement districts; transferring authority over Philadelphia’s taxis and limousines from the Public Utility Commission to the Philadelphia Parking Authority; repealing Section 209(k) of the Penn<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>sylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority Act; and authorizing municipalities to hold gifts in trust. <a href="/pa/575/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="838 A.2d 566" data-case-ids="630377,630455,9298628,9298712" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0541-01,/pa/575/0542-01,/a2d/838/0566-01,/a2d/838/0566-02">838 A.2d at 589</a>. In <em>Jury Commissioners, </em>the Court held that the subject “powers of county commissioners” was defined too broadly where it included permitting certain counties to abolish the office of jury commissioner; authorizing imposition of an excise tax on the rental of motor vehicles by counties of the first class; providing for regional renaissance initiatives; and creating procedures for commissioners of counties of the third through eighth class to sell personal property and surplus farm products. <a href="/pa/619/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="64 A.3d 611" data-case-ids="4232805,4233354,7310195,7310216" data-case-paths="/pa/619/0368-01,/pa/619/0369-01,/a3d/64/0611-01,/a3d/64/0611-02">64 A.3d at </a>613 n. 1. Meanwhile, the topic of “gaming” was deemed appropriate by the unanimous Court in <em>PAGE, </em>where it included creation of the Gaming Control Board; establishment of policies and procedures for gaming licenses for the installation and operation of slot machines; provisions to assist Pennsylvania’s horse racing industry through other gaming; and provisions for administration and enforcement of the gaming law. <a href="/pa/583/0274-02" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="877 A.2d 383" data-case-ids="687750,687765,687766,8955098,8955131,8955235" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0274-02,/pa/583/0274-01,/pa/583/0275-01,/a2d/877/0383-01,/a2d/877/0383-02,/a2d/877/0383-03">877 A.2d at 396</a>.</p>

Sections 3 and 4 delete and add, respectively, a period of limitations for the commencement of a civil action to the procedure for recovering damages for injury caused by exposure to asbestos. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5524, 5524.1. Section 6 amends the definition of “primary jurisdiction,” in relation to police officers. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8951.

    <p id="b131-4" data-blocks='[["BL_131.4",131,[158,437,1151,957]]]'>On the available spectrum, I find that the question of refining civil remedies, as defined in the present case, certainly is broad, but not unreasonably so, particularly in view of our precedent. All nineteen provisions of Act 152 amend aspects of existing categories of civil remedies, remedies that are already part of the Judicial Code. The Judicial Code supplies the outside parameters for which judicial remedies and what aspects of these remedies the statute addresses. Accordingly, in my view, the subject of refining judicial remedies — in the context of the statute before us — is not “boundless” as the Majority holds. Moreover, each of the component parts of Act 152 is germane to the subject so described. Two provisions amend definitions of terms for the purposes of the Judicial Code; several of the provisions describe periods of limitation for commencing particular types of actions; and the remaining provisions undertake substantial reconstruction of civil remedy schemes, including by creating a related enforcement mechanism within the Criminal Code.</p>

Ultimately, however, mindful of the constitutional presumption and the requirement that the provision must stand unless it clearly, plainly and palpably violated the Constitution, I would uphold the constitutionality of Act 152 as against this Article III, Section 3 single-subject challenge.</p>
