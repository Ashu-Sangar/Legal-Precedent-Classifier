Final orders in matters involving investigating grand juries are within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of this Court. 42 Pa.C.S. § 722(5).

Throughout the investigation, the OAG has issued subpoenas to the Commission and third parties. According to the Commission, it has produced more than 140,000 pages of material to the OAG in response to subpoena, but with regard to certain requested material, the Commission invoked the protections of the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product doctrine. The Commission sought to negotiate with the OAG a plan for production of the material through the use of a “privilege log.” The Commission proposed the following review process: 1) the OAG would identify in general terms (either by custodian, name of outside law firm, or some other specific identifying information) documents and communications of a potentially privileged nature that the OAG wished to review; 2) the Commission’s counsel would then review the material, produce documents that were not protected, and provide the OAG with a privilege log of any material that the Commission withheld on the basis of the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine; 3) following receipt of the privilege log, if the OAG either disagreed with the stated basis for withholding an item, or otherwise believed that an exception existed that would override the asserted protection, then the OAG would identify those items to the Commission’s counsel; and 4) if no agreement could be reached about those items, then counsel would promptly provide any material in question to a court for <em>in camera </em>review and disposition. <em>See </em>Pa. R.Crim. P. 573(F) (on motion, court may permit showing of disputed discovery material to be made in form of written statement to be inspected by court <em>in </em>camera). Commission’s Brief at 5-6.

Justice Saylor noted that he was uncomfortable with a movement away from that constancy of approach in the grand jury setting; and thus, he would have denied collateral order review. <em><a href="/pa/616/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="48 A.3d 1217" data-case-ids="4209739,7313392" data-case-paths="/pa/616/0414-01,/a3d/48/1217-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/616/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="48 A.3d 1217" data-case-ids="4209739,7313392" data-case-paths="/pa/616/0414-01,/a3d/48/1217-01">at 1217-18</a> (Saylor, J., dissenting).</p>

However, as Justice Saylor accurately noted in his dissent to our exercise of jurisdiction here, in cases where the interlocutory grand jury appeal derives from a privilege-based challenge to a subpoena, our approach has been to disallow review unless the appeal arises in the context of a contempt proceeding and actual sanction for failing to comply with the subpoena. Thus, we have held that “[o]ne seeking to challenge the propriety of a grand jury subpoena must generally choose between complying with the subpoena and litigating the validity through contempt proceedings,” noting that this “approach facilitates the development of an adequate factual record in support of the reasons supporting resistance to the subpoena.” <em>In re Twenty-Fourth Statewide Investigating Grand Jury, </em><a href="/pa/589/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="589 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="2571923" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0089-01">589 Pa. 89</a>, <a href="/pa/589/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="907 A.2d 505" data-case-ids="2571923,8932493" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0089-01,/a2d/907/0505-01">907 A.2d 505</a>, 510 (2006).

The Commission also cites federal case law that supports its position that government officials should be encouraged to seek legal advice and enjoy the confidential communication that accompanies that attorney-client relationship, in their effort to uphold the law; the Commission argues that agency officials “must know the law in order to comply with the law.” Commission’s Brief at 28-29 (citing <em>In re: Grand Jury Investigation, </em><a href="/f3d/399/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="399 F.3d 527" data-case-ids="1547112" data-case-paths="/f3d/399/0527-01">399 F.3d 527</a>, 534 (2d Cir.2005) (“Upholding the privilege furthers a culture in which consultation with government lawyers is accepted as a normal, desirable, and even indispensable part of conducting public business.

The Associations insist that objective judicial oversight of subpoenas is especially important due to the political vagaries inherent in government investigations. The Associations urge this Court to overrule the lower court’s “wholesale rejection of the privilege in the government agency context,” and support a remand to the lower court with instructions to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of any privilege log submitted for purposes of assessing whether the privilege applies to the documents at issue. In addition, the Pennsylvania Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers filed an <em>amicus </em>brief in support of the Commission, stating that, if the lower court’s decision were to stand, a lawyer whose advice was sought by a state employee would have to advise that employee that the attorney-client privilege did not apply to their relationship, in violation of various Rules of Professional Conduct, and state and federal constitutional provisions regarding the right to counsel.</p>

According to the OAG, the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine do not protect the records of a Commonwealth agency from a grand jury subpoena. The OAG argues that application of these protections to dealings between Commonwealth agencies and a grand jury, or the OAG, would mean public entities could cloak their procedures in secrecy and evade meaningful oversight of their operations. The OAG argues that evidentiary privileges undermine the search for truth and, as such, the party asserting the privilege bears the burden of proving it is applicable. The OAG states that there are no cases where a Commonwealth agency successfully asserted the attorney-client or work product privilege in response to a grand jury <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>subpoena or request for records by the OAG, and it rejects the Commission’s argument that it is entitled to invoke the privileges so that the Commission may foster candor with its counsel without fear of disclosure.

The OAG rejects the Commission’s argument that the Commission stands alone as the “client” rather than the Commission as a Commonwealth agency, asserting that the Commission is obviously not an entirely independent agency answerable only to itself. In addition, the OAG argues that the comment to Professional Rule of Conduct 1.13 does indeed address the representation of government agencies such as the Commission, and states that “when the client is a governmental organization, a different balance may be appropriate between maintaining confidentiality and assuring that the wrongful act is prevented or rectified, for public business is involved.” Pa.

The OAG also argues that the CAA specifically authorizes it to investigate and prosecute criminal charges against state officials or employees affecting the performance of their public duties. 71 P.S. §§ 732-205(a)(l), 732-206.

These facts present a unique context for considering the application of the attorney-client privilege, which we have stated is designed to foster candid communications between counsel and client — so that counsel can give legal advice based upon the most complete information — without creating a situation where the client might be reluctant to disclose all the necessary facts because the communication might later be made public. <em>See, e.g., Chmiel, </em><a href="/a2d/738/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="738 A.2d 406" data-case-ids="11564924,838538" data-case-paths="/a2d/738/0406-01,/pa/558/0478-01">738 A.2d at 425</a>.

It follows that the only proper manner of considering the privilege in these circumstances is that the client-citizenry has impliedly waived the attorney-client privilege that might otherwise shield from revelation evidence of corruption and criminal activity.

The Scope of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides, in relevant part: "[17] Under various legal provisions, including constitutional, statutory and common law, the responsibilities of government lawyers may include authority concerning legal matters that ordinarily reposes in the client in private client-lawyer relationships. For example, a lawyer for a government agency may have authority on behalf of the government to decide upon settlement or whether to appeal from an adverse judgment. Such authority in various respects is generally vested in the attorney general and the state’s attorney in state government, and their federal counterparts, and the same may be true of other government law officers. Also, lawyers under the supervision of these officers may be authorized to represent several government agencies in intragovernmental legal controversies in circumstances where a private lawyer could not represent multiple private clients.

To be sure, it is in the public interest for the grand jury to collect all the relevant evidence it can. However, it is also in the public interest for high state officials to receive and act upon the best possible legal advice. Indeed, the people of Connecticut have deemed the latter interest more important than the former: if state prosecutors had sought to compel George to reveal the conversations at issue, there is little doubt that the conversations would be protected. The Connecticut legislature has enacted a statute specifically providing that "[i]n any civil or criminal case or proceeding or in any legislative or administrative proceeding, all confidential communications shall be privileged and a government attorney shall not disclose any such communications unless an authorized representative of the public agency consents to waive the privilege and allow such disclosure.” Conn. Gen.Stat. § 52-146r(b). The people of Connecticut, then, acting through their representatives, have concluded that the public interest is advanced by upholding a governmental privilege even in the face of a criminal investigation.</blockquote>

Both the supervising judge below, and the OAG in its arguments to this Court, refer to an additional basis for finding the privilege "waived” and inapplicable here. First, they assert that because the General Assembly and the OAG itself are Commonwealth entities — just as the Commission is a Commonwealth entity — they are the same "client" for purposes of waiving any attorney-client privilege. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pa. R. Prof. Conduct 1.13, Explanatory Comment 6 ("Although in some circumstances the client may be a specific agency, it may also be a branch of government, such as the executive branch, or the government as a whole____"). Second, the supervising judge determined that the General Assembly effectively waived the attorney-client privilege for agencies under the OAG’s supervision when the OAG conducts grand jury investigations into agency business, by its choice of language in the books and papers provision of the CAA, which does not include any restrictions to access on the basis of a privilege. We need not reach or consider the viability of these additional reasons for holding the attorney-client privilege does not apply.</p>
