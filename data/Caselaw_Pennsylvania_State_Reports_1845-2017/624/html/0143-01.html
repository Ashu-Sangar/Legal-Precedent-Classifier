    <p id="b202-5" data-blocks='[["BL_202.6",202,[276,1114,1150,466]]]'>On May 21, 2000, Appellant arrived at the apartment of his step-daughter, Chetia Hurtt, with a handgun he was not licensed to carry. When he was let into the apartment, Appellant threatened to kill Hurtt, her boyfriend, Jeffrey Johnson, who was also present, and himself. After Appellant demanded Mr. Johnson leave the apartment, he pointed the gun at Hurtt, pushed her down, and attempted to remove her clothes. Meanwhile, Mr. Johnson informed police about what was occurring, and the police responded immediately.</p>

As the police were bringing Appellant out of the apartment, he attempted to escape. During the course of the ensuing investigation, Ms. Hurtt informed police that Appellant had been assaulting her for years and making threats against her family. She agreed to press charges. As a result of these events, Appellant was charged with rape, attempted rape, attempted escape, and related crimes. According to Ms. Hurtt’s subsequent testimony, following his arrest Appellant threatened to harm himself <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>and his family if Ms. Hurtt revealed his past assaults and persisted in pressing charges.</p>
    <p id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[158,417,1151,1050]]]'>As the time of Appellant’s rape trial drew near, Appellant acted on his threats. On June 11, 2001, two weeks before his trial for assaulting Ms. Hurtt was scheduled to begin, he directed the school bus company of his autistic teenage son, Sean, not to pick him up for school. Later that day, firefighters responded to a report of smoke coming from the home Appellant shared with his wife, Katherine, Sean, and his wife’s mother, Goldie Hurtt. When the firefighters gained entry, they discovered that the house was strewn with garbage and debris and the doors were barricaded. Once inside, they discovered Sean on the living room couch, and although they brought him out of the house alive, he later died at the hospital from blunt force trauma to the head. Firefighters discovered Katherine’s body in the kitchen, and it was later determined that she too died from blunt force trauma to the head. Goldie Hurtt was rescued from the house, unharmed. Appellant was discovered in the kitchen with several self-inflicted puncture wounds to the neck and chest. When emergency responders removed him from the house, he was extremely combative.</p>
    <p id="b203-6" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[156,1492,1152,730]]]'>At the hospital, Appellant indicated that he had killed his wife and started the fire, and that his motivation for doing so was anxiety and outrage over the pending rape allegations and imminent trial on these charges. Eight days later, on June 19, 2001, Appellant further explained that he bludgeoned his wife and son with a sledgehammer, left the house with the weapon and went to a local bar, where he consumed several drinks, and returned home. Upon his return, he spread debris around the house, barricaded the doors, and poured gasoline around the basement floor, which was ignited by the water heater. He attempted to stab himself, and then lay down next to his wife’s body. He explained that he intentionally piled debris around the house to fuel the fire and to “make sure that we were gone.” <em>Hairston, </em><a href="/pa/603/0660-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="985 A.2d 804" data-case-ids="4197056,7292756" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0660-01,/a2d/985/0804-01">985 A.2d at 807</a>.</p>

Meanwhile, on December 14, 2001, Appellant was convicted of <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>rape, sexual assault, burglary, attempted escape, and related charges resulting from his abuse of his step-daughter over a five year period from when Ms. Hurtt was fifteen to twenty-one, and from the charges for his conduct on May 21, 2000. At his murder trial, the Commonwealth argued that Appellant killed his wife and son to punish Ms. Hurtt for reporting to the authorities that Appellant held her at gun-point and attempted to rape her, and had raped her previously. At the penalty phase, the jury found two aggravating circumstances, and two mitigating circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Weighing these, the jury returned a sentence of death for both convictions, which the trial court imposed on July 11, 2002.</p>

After the time to file an appeal had expired, the trial court appointed new counsel on September 9, 2002. On January 14, 2003, appointed counsel moved to withdraw, before he had filed anything on Appellant’s behalf. Current counsel entered an appearance on August 22, 2005. Upon counsel’s request, on September 2, 2005, the trial court gave Appellant 45 days to file post-sentence motions, and eventually extended this time. Post-sentence motions were filed May 8, 2006. Following the Commonwealth’s answer, the trial court denied Appellant’s motions on June 2, 2008, and Appellant thereafter filed his notice of appeal to this Court on June 6, 2008.</p>

Consequently, we held that Appellant’s appeal period had already expired before he requested an extension of time to file post-sentence motions, and that all claims not associated with our automatic review of capital cases were not preserved. <em>Hairston, </em><a href="/pa/603/0660-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="985 A.2d 804" data-case-ids="4197056,7292756" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0660-01,/a2d/985/0804-01">985 A.2d at 808</a>.

    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[161,757,1152,680]]]'>Following our decision, Appellant filed a petition for relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541 <em>et seq., </em>arguing that prior counsel was ineffective for failing to file timely post-sentence motions and requesting the reinstatement of his appellate rights <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The Commonwealth filed an answer conceding that prior counsel was ineffective. The court granted relief by permitting Appellant to file a notice of appeal <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Appellant complied, raising numerous issues. In its responsive brief to this Court, the Commonwealth makes no argument that the trial court’s grant of <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief was inappropriate. We will therefore proceed to address the issues Appellant has raised.</p>

The trial court permitted the Commonwealth to introduce this evidence for two reasons: first, because it demonstrated malice by establishing that the deaths were intentional and not accidental; second, because it demonstrated Appellant’s consciousness of guilt by establishing that the fire was a suicide attempt. <em>See Commonwealth v. Sanchez, </em><a href="/pa-super/416/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="416 Pa.

The trial court explained to the jury that evidence of the fire was admitted not to show that Appellant was a person of bad character, but only to establish his state of mind at the time he acted.</p>

Appellant asserts that the trial court’s failure to engage in this balancing test was an abuse of discretion.</p>

According to Appellant, if the Commonwealth only wanted the jury to hear that Appellant had attempted suicide to demonstrate his consciousness of guilt, it could have introduced evidence of Appellant’s self-inflicted stab wounds and his hospital confession that he had tried to kill himself, without prejudicing him with evidence that he also committed arson. Finally, Appellant contends that the trial court’s jury instruction did not obviate its duty to evaluate the evidence’s probative value and potential for unfair prejudice in the first instance.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that the fire evidence generally established that Appellant intended to conceal the commission of the murders and to escape their consequences, and demonstrated the detailed and deliberate manner in which Appellant acted on the day of the murders.</p>

Following the trial court’s decision to permit the Commonwealth-to introduce evidence of the arson, Appellant requested that the trial court provide a jury instruction regarding second degree/felony murder, which is the killing of another with malice while engaged in the commission of a felony. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(b) (“A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the second degree when it is committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony.”). One such felony is arson. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3301. In support of this request, Appellant argued that the victims’ deaths occurred in the course of committing the felony of arson. The trial court refused to provide the requested jury instruction because it concluded there was no evidence tending to show that the murders were incidental to the act of arson; rather, the <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>evidence established that the arson was committed after Appellant committed the acts that caused the victims to die.</p>

In this regard, Appellant argues that there was sufficient evidence on the record for the jury to conclude that the homicides resulted not from premeditation, as the Commonwealth suggested, but were the incidental result of Appellant’s suicide attempt. Specifically, Appellant argues that a reasonable jury could have concluded that Appellant planned to commit suicide prior to assaulting his wife and son as demonstrated by Ms. Hurtt’s testimony that Appellant had threatened to harm himself and his family, that he bludgeoned them with a sledgehammer to incapacitate them so that his suicide plan would not be interrupted, and that he similarly barricaded the doors to the house to prevent anyone from exiting or entering the home before he was dead.

Although he survived for several days in the hospital, there is no indication that the fire contributed to his death.

    <p id="b230-12" data-blocks='[["BL_230.11",230,[277,1121,1150,849]]]'>First, regarding Appellant’s claim that the trial court erroneously failed to balance the probative value versus the prejudicial effect concerning the Commonwealth’s evidence of uncharged arson, <em>see </em>Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2), the majority posits that the trial court “mentally engaged” in such balancing and admonishes that “[tjhere is no requirement that [trial courts] record these mental deliberations on the record.” Majority Opinion, at 161, 84 A.3d at 667. I do not doubt that there was some off-the record engagement of the issue, and I acknowledge there is no requirement for courts to contemporaneously explain their time-of-trial rulings on objections. Nevertheless, upon the filing of an appeal trial courts must provide an explanation for challenged rulings or point to the place in the record where such reasons may be found, <em>see </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), the salutary purpose being to provide a sufficient foundation for the ensuing appellate review.</p>

Nevertheless, the trial court did appreciate that its ruling should subsume a balancing of probative value versus prejudicial effect. <em>See id. </em>at 9 (reflecting the trial court’s allusion to this relevant requirement under Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2)). Accordingly, I believe the court should have provided a fuller explanation for its ruling upon the filing of an appeal and the lodging of a statement of matters complained of on appeal raising the Rule 404(b)(2) issue. Concomitantly, I would not fault Appellant for pointing to the deficiency in the analysis which was provided by the trial court. Rather, I would simply invoke the precept that a valid verdict may be affirmed for any reason appearing as of record and rely on the majority’s able substantive assessment of the balancing inquiry. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 159-61, 84 A.3d at 666-67.</p>

One difficulty with <em>Bardo, </em>however, is that, although the Court recognized that the catch-all mitigator encompasses “any other evidence ... concerning the <em>character </em>and record of the defendant and the circumstances of the offense,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8), its holding failed to account for the character-based aspect. <em>Bardo, </em><a href="/pa/551/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="551 Pa. 140" data-case-ids="507771" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0140-01">551 Pa. at 151</a>, <a href="/a2d/709/0871-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="709 A.2d 871" data-case-ids="11836713,507771" data-case-paths="/a2d/709/0871-01,/pa/551/0140-01">709 A.2d at 876</a> (indicating that “[s]uch testimony has no relevance to the circumstances of the offense or appellant’s record,” with no mention of relevance to character).</p>

In this regard, another difficulty with <em>Bardo </em>is that the Court failed to distinguish between predictive testimony, such as was proffered in <em>Henry, </em>and explanations of past behavior as an indication of character, the latter of which, in my view, plainly qualifies as catch-all mitigation. Indeed, the <em>Henry </em>Court itself observed, approvingly, that the professor and religious activities director had been permitted to “testify freely regarding [the] appellant’s character and record.” <em>Henry, </em>524 Pa. at 156, <a href="/pa/524/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="524 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="1822776" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0135-01">569 A.2d at 939</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

This reasoning goes more to the circumstances-of-the-offense aspect of catch-all mitigation, rather than to the defendant’s character. As to the latter, Appellant posits that his wife’s visits were relevant to demonstrate that he continued to need and want his family's support. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 50. However, at least from my point of view, this seems to cast more sympathetic light upon the character of Appellant’s wife than his own character.</p>
