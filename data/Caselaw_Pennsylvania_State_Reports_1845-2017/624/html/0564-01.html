Grumbine, M.D., and members of her staff at Blair Medical Associates, Inc. [“Blair Medical,” Dr. Grumbine’s employer]. Anthony’s parents, Stephen and Nicole Passarello [Appellees], brought Anthony to Dr. Grumbine for multiple visits following his birth on May 31, 2001, and contacted Dr. Grumbine’s office seven times during the week preceding his death on August 4, 2001.

Dr. Grumbine suggested that time that Anthony might suffer from pyloric stenosis and noted that a barium swallow test might be indicated.

Dr. Grumbine found Anthony’s symptoms consistent with reactions to his immunizations of the previous day and concluded that he might also be in pain from acid reflux. Anthony’s symptoms remained unabated and on the following day, August 3, [Appellees] took him to the emergency room at Altoona Hospital, where the attending physician, Dr. Holly Thompson, found him to be in severe respiratory distress and confirmed that his heart rate had fallen dangerously low. Despite intubation and the use of a ventilator as well as other supportive measures, Anthony died during the early morning hours of August 4.

Trial, 4/24/09, at 36; R.R. 431a. As the trial neared its close, Dr. Grumbine and Blair Medical each submitted proposed points for charge, including differing versions of the “error in judgment” charge. Blair Medical’s proposed version of the charge read: “Under the law, physicians are permitted a broad range of judgment in their professional duties and physicians are not liable for errors of judgment unless it is proven that an error of judgment was the result of negligence.” Points for Charge of Blair Medical Associates at 3, ¶ 7. Dr. Grumbine’s proposed version of the charge stated, “If a physician employs the required judgment and care in reaching his or her diagnosis, the mere fact that he or she erred in the diagnosis will not render them liable, even though their treatment was not proper for the condition that actually existed.” Points for Charge of Rowena Grumbine, M.D. at 7, ¶ 17.</p>

However, the judge did not say exactly which, if any, of Blair Medical’s proposed charges it would actually read to the jury, and counsel for Appellees did not raise any objection at that time. The judge then proceeded to discuss Dr. Grumbine’s points for charge in detail, and when the judge addressed her proposed “error in judgment” charge, counsel for Appellees objected that the instruction would not be proper in this case. <em>See id. </em>at 85-86; R.R. at 480a-81a. However, the judge did not rule on the objection at that time. Because the conference was taking place on a Friday, the judge adjourned the conference and reconvened it on the following Monday morning, at which time Appellees’ counsel again objected to an “error in judgment” charge.</p>

It first instructed the jury on the objective standard of professional negligence, explaining that “a physician [whose] conduct falls below the standard of care is negligent.” N.T. Jury Charge, 4/27/09, at 13; R.R. at 529a. The judge told the jury that it was not to “rely on hindsight” and consider a “disastrous result” to be “proof of negligence,” but should rather “determine whether [Dr. Grumbine] failed to have and exercise ordinary skill, care, and knowledge of a specialist, in this case a pediatrician, in the circumstances which were present at the time.” <em>Id. </em>at 35; R.R. at 551a. The judge then read Blair Medical’s version of the “error in judgment” charge, and instructed the jury, “Under the law[,] physicians are permitted a broad range of judgment in their professional duties and physicians are not liable for errors of judgment unless it’s proven that an error of judgment was the result of negligence.” <em>Id. </em>at 35-36; R.R. at 551a-52a.</p>

Counsel then asked the judge, “[D]o I have those objections preserved, Your Honor?” The judge replied, “It’s my understanding you do.” <em>Id. </em>at 37; R.R. at 553a.

The court also stated that the instruction incorrectly “injects a subjective element into the jury’s deliberations” because it “improperly refocuses the jury’s attention on the physician’s state of mind at the time of treatment,” rather than on the standard of care, which is objective. <em><a href="/a2d/980/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="980 A.2d 159" data-case-ids="7292876" data-case-paths="/a2d/980/0159-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/980/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="980 A.2d 159" data-case-ids="7292876" data-case-paths="/a2d/980/0159-01">at 174</a>.

Dr. Grumbine further contends that Appellees waived their argument on appeal that the error in judgment charge should <em>never </em>be given by making only the narrower argument at trial that the instruction was not proper in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b625-5" data-blocks='[["BL_625.5",625,[158,915,1153,893]]]'>Dr. Grumbine’s first argument, that Appellees had failed to object to Blair Medical’s point for charge as well as her own point for charge on “error in judgment,” rings hollow for several reasons. First, Appellees here alleged essentially a series of acts of negligence — those of Dr. Grumbine — while co-defendant Blair Medical was sued only in an agency capacity. Thus, any error in judgment charge pertained to the singular behavior of Dr. Grumbine, and, accordingly, only one objection was necessary for the trial court to be placed on notice as to possible defects in an error in judgment charge pertaining to that party’s behavior. The requirement for a timely and specific objection at trial is to “ensure that the trial judge has a chance to correct alleged trial errors.” <em>Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/457/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="457 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="477868" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0255-01">457 Pa. 255</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="322 A.2d 114">322 A.2d 114</a>, 116 (1974).

Dr. Grumbine <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>asserts that her point for charge <em>“made no reference to a physician being liable for negligence,” </em>whereas Blair Medical’s point for charge stated “that a physician <em>is liable </em>for an error in judgment if that error in judgment <em>is caused by negligence.” </em>Dr. Grumbine’s Reply Brief at 3 n.3 (emphasis in original). Setting aside the fact that the essential question in a medical malpractice action is whether a health care provider was negligent, as to which question the jury would necessarily be instructed by the court, our view of Dr. Grumbine’s proposed point for charge is that it actually incorporated the concept of negligence by using other language. Dr. Grumbine’s proposed charge states: <em>“If a physician employs the required judgment and care in reaching his or her diagnosis, </em>the mere fact that he or she erred in the diagnosis will not render them liable, even though their treatment was not proper for the condition that actually existed.” Points for Charge of Rowena Grumbine, M.D. at 7, ¶ 17 (emphasis added).</p>

Appellees’ timely objection satisfied Rule 227(b)’s requirements. Indeed, the trial court told Appellees’ counsel that it was its understanding that the objection was preserved.</p>

    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.4",627,[154,563,1153,1275]]]'>Dr. Grumbine’s second argument is that Appellees preserved an objection only to the application of the error in judgment to the facts of the instant case, and not to an error in judgment charge generally. In their post-trial motions, Appellees asserted that they had objected at trial to an error of judgment charge for two reasons. The first reason was that the instant case involved a failure to test for a diagnosis, rendering the charge inapplicable. The second reason was that the trial court should have given the charge relating to medical malpractice cases found in the Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Jury Instructions, which had specifically rejected the error in judgment instruction. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Posh-Trial Relief, filed May 5, 2009, at 2-3. The trial transcript, however, suggests that when Appellees first made their objection during the pre-charge conference, they were relying only on the first reason. <em>See </em>N.T. Trial, 4/24/09, at 86; R.R. at 481a, comments of Appellees’ attorney (“There is specific law in medical malpractice cases dealing [with] when the error of judgment charge needs to be given and when it [does not].”). Unfortunately, there apparently was no transcription of the continuation of the pre-charge conference that occurred three days later, when the issue of the appropriateness of the error in judgment charge was purportedly also discussed among counsel and the trial judge. <em>See </em>Appellees’ Brief at 23 n.7.</p>

Yohe, </em><a href="/pa/412/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="412 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="1887259" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0094-01">412 Pa. 94</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.2d%20167" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="194 A.2d 167">194 A.2d 167</a>, 170-71 (1963). Blair Medical observes that this Court has never considered the concept of a physician’s error in judgment in the context of a jury charge, but that several Superior Court cases have upheld error in judgment charges. In one case, the court determined that a “mistake of judgment” instruction was appropriate in a case involving a difficult diagnosis because such instruction “properly directed the jury to base its verdict on whether a physician had failed to follow proper medical procedure and not infer a breach of the standard of care merely from [the patient’s] unfortunate result.” <em>Havasy v. Resnick, </em><a href="/pa-super/415/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="415 Pa.

In another case, the appellant had argued that the trial judge’s “mere error of judgment” charge was improper because the evidence showed that the defendant physician had not exercised <em>any </em>medical judgments. The Superior Court determined that the appellant’s argument was “puzzling, at best,” in that the evidence apparently demonstrated that the physician had made a series of decisions (“medical <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>judgments”) in rendering care to the patient, which the Superior Court detailed.

By contrast, Blair Medical asserts, the relevant charge in the present case is distinguishable, was accurate as a matter of law, and was not of a nature that the jury would find confusing. Specifically, Blair Medical notes that in <em>Pringle, </em>the jury was relevantly charged: <em>“The rule requiring a physician to use his best judgment does not make a physician liable for a mere error in judgment provided he does what he thinks best after careful examination.” </em>Blair Medical’s Brief at 12-13, quoting <em>Pringle, supra </em>at 164 (emphasis by the Superior Court). However, in the present case, Blair Medical notes that the jury was relevantly charged: “Under the law[,] physicians are permitted a broad range of judgment in their professional duties and physicians are not liable for errors of judgment unless it’s proven that an error of judgment was the result of negligence.” Blair Medical’s Brief at 13, quoting N.T. Jury Charge, 4/27/09, at 35-36; R.R. at 551a-52a. Based on the statements it highlights from the jury charges in the two cases, Blair Medical asserts that the jury in the instant case was directly informed that a physician would be liable for a negligent exercise of judgment, but that the jury in <em>Pringle </em>was not so instructed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Further, Blair Medical asserts that <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>the jury instruction in the present case did not in any fashion invite the jury to consider Dr. Grumbine’s motivations or subjective thoughts in connection with evaluating the doctor’s exercise of her judgment; rather, the jury was firmly instructed on the objective elements of the negligence that Appellees were required to prove.</p>

Dr. Grumbine argues that the Superior Court violated this precedent by simply singling out two purportedly offending sentences (pertaining to the error in judgment instruction) out of a 50-page typewritten charge as the basis for declaring a new trial, rather than examining the entire charge to determine whether these two sentences were so highly prejudicial to Appellees as to warrant a new trial. To illustrate her point, Dr. Grumbine quotes the far more extensive language from the trial court’s charge devoted to the concept of professional negligence and the standard of care, to which no objection was lodged by Appellees. Along these lines, Dr. Grumbine asserts that the jury instructions, as a whole, correctly informed the jury that a physician is not liable for non-negligent exercises of judgment. Thus, Dr. Grumbine asserts that a new trial should not have been granted because “the trial court’s <em>entire </em>[jury] instruction was a fair statement of Pennsylvania law.” Dr. Grumbine’s Brief at 23 (emphasis in original).</p>

A physician whose conduct falls below this standard of care is negligent.” Pa. SSJI (Civ) 14.10 (4th ed. 2011).

Simply put, if a physician does not “exercise reasonable care,” that physician will not be insulated from liability based on the fact that this failure constituted a “mere error in judgment,” or what he or she thought “best after a careful examination.” Conversely, if a physician does “exercise reasonable care,” that physician will generally not be liable, notwithstanding that he or she committed a “mere error in judgment,” or failed to do what he or she thought “best after a careful examination.” In either case, such factors are but elements of the overarching concept of due care. Clearly, the use of phrases regarding mistakes or errors in judgment, best judgment, and the like, in the decisional law of this Commonwealth, are meant to help illustrate the parameters of the standard of care of physicians, and are not meant to pose additional requirements for defendants, on one hand, or to undermine the bedrock “reasonable care” requirement on the other. However, the inclusion of such phrases in jury instructions seems unlikely to serve that purpose. To the contrary, such phrases, at worst, risk misstating the law. At best, they seem unnecessarily circular in form. In any event, such language seems far more likely to mislead and confuse the jury rather than to enlighten it.</blockquote>

[A]fter a jury has been charged on the fundamental principles regarding a physician’s standard of care, adding an “error of judgment” instruction only confuses, and does not clarify, the determinative issue regarding deviation from the standard of care. Second, the “error of judgment” charge wrongly injects a subjective element into the jury’s deliberations. The standard of care for physicians in Pennsylvania is objective in nature, as it centers on the knowledge, skill, and care normally possessed and exercised in the medical profession. The “error of judgment” charge improperly refocuses the jury’s attention on the physician’s state of mind at the time of treatment, even though the physician’s mental state is <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>irrelevant in determining whether he or she deviated from the standard of care.

Well what the judge will tell you when you talk about negligence[,] the issue is was she careless or was she unskilled in the care that she rendered or the decisions that she made? So you must ask yourself does a careless doctor spend 15 to 20 minutes on the phone with concerned parents on a Sunday? Does a careless doctor make special arrangements on a Monday morning before her office is even open, before nurses are even in the office[,] to see a child when a parent has concerns? Does a concerned or careless doctor sit there for an hour and actually watch the child eat? Does a careless doctor then make an unsolicited phone call to the house the next day just to see how he’s doing? Does that same careless doctor then spend an hour on Wednesday during a well-baby visit when the child is well? And does a careless doctor spend three — 30 to 40 minutes [sic] on the phone with parents the day after immunizations are given and then make another unsolicited phone call on Saturday[,] her day off[,] in the middle of her three day weekend off[,] to see how the child is doing? These facts show she — one thing[,] she’s attentive and she was conscientious. She ordered tests when she thought they were indicated. She made referral to the pediatric specialist when it was indicated. <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>Now every physician must use clinical judgment. You don’t practice medicine by textbook. There’s no guideline that you can go to. You don’t have something on your blackberry well there’s this symptom and this symptom so we’re gonna do this. They have to make decisions. A physician cannot warrant care and they cannot guarantee outcomes because of the uniqueness of treating human beings. To require otherwise, to require physicians to be perfect[,] is an impossible burden and we — the law recognizes that we will not do that. When you look at Dr. Grumbine’s judgments[,] were they careless, were they unskilled? When you come to the key issue, the August 2 phone call[,] she had to use her judgment^] and if her judgment was reasonable[,] then she was not careless and she was not unskilled.</blockquote>

This brief expands upon the arguments made by Blair Medical and Dr. Grumbine that a properly phrased error in judgment charge is sometimes necessary to inform the jury that a doctor could rationally make reasonable, non-negligent decisions that, in hindsight, proved to be incorrect so far as the patient's outcome is concerned. This argument is based on the premise that the practice of medicine is oftentimes an "art” requiring a physician to make a series of decisions based on symptomology. <em>Amicus </em>contends that a properly worded error in judgment instruction, rather than confusing a jury, would actually help clarify this critical aspect of medical practice and would remain true to the instruction's <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>original purpose to make explicit that an adverse outcome for a patient is not, on its own, a basis for a finding of negligence.</p>

The court’s brief error in judgment charge related back to the negligence charge by directly stating that a physician is liable for an error of judgment resulting from negligence.

This distinct directive potentially confused and misled the jury regarding the concepts of reasonable care and negligence, perhaps leading the <em>Pringle </em>jury to believe that an error in judgment relieves a physician of liability in all instances. It may be that the <em>Pringle </em>panel correctly decided that case in light of the distinctive charge given.

Specifically, medical malpractice actions involving straight negligence claims that the physician’s conduct fell below the standard of care, such as, for example, where a surgeon leaves implements or surgical equipment inside a patient’s body, would not be amenable to an error in judgment instruction. It is not difficult to envision, however, a scenario where a physician has two or more different potential paths to follow in treating a patient, including judgment calls such as whether to order certain diagnostic tests or to prescribe certain medications given the potential complications of the tests or drugs, and then used judgment in a manner that arguably comported with the standard of care, but where the ultimate result for the patient was not good. In that instance, it would be appropriate to charge the jury that it can find that a physician whose actions fall within the standard of care is not liable for an error in <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>judgment. The jury would then determine whether the physician’s exercise of judgment was reasonable and within the standard of care.

      <em>Pringle, </em>at 164 (citation and additional emphasis omitted). As the majority notes, in determining the “error in judgment” charge “has no place in medical malpractice cases[,]” the Superior Court reasoned:</p>

      <em>Id., </em>at 173-74. Where, as in this case, the jury is properly instructed on the standard of care and the additional language concerning the physician’s state of mind is omitted, the <em>Pringle </em>court’s concerns — and with them the basis for its “error in judgment” charge ban — are, in my opinion, obviated. To the extent a reasoned analysis could come to an alternative conclusion, the majority fails to engage in the same; instead, it focuses its analysis on the terms “error” and “judgment,” to the exclusion of the remainder of the jury charge given, and on its determination “that the essential principles that underlie error in judgment instructions are capable of being stated in a straightforward manner without incorporating phrases such as ‘error in judgment.’ ”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">3</a> Majority Op., at 591, 87 A.3d at 301.</p>
