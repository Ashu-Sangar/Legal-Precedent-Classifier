Rather, plaintiff is instead relying on the FDA’s decision, which occurred after Wyeth’s withdrawal of the medication, that the active ingredient contained in Redux was too unsafe to be prescribed to any class of patients for any purpose whatsoever. It is the FDA’s ultimate conclusion about Redux’s unsuitability for any patient that is the most critical evidence in this case. To the extent that Wyeth’s voluntary withdrawal is relevant, it is for the purpose of establishing “feasibility of precautionary measures,” which does not run afoul of the rule limiting the introduction into evidence of subsequent remedial measures. <em>See </em>Pa.

Thus, her position suggests that the law of negligence establishes a duty, on the part of manufacturers, which can be viewed on a continuum from the requirements of: a warning of dangers, through a stronger warning if justified by the known risks, through non-marketing or discontinuance of marketing when it becomes or should become known that the product simply should not be used in light of its relative risks. We agree with Appellee that this entire continuum is within the scope of the general <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>framework of the applicable duty of care, while highlighting our disapproval of Wyeth’s petition for manufacturer immunity at the most severe end of the scale.

It also appears that the panel believed that the phrase "unreasonably dangerous” was unique to strict-liability theory. <em>See <a href="/a3d/4/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="4 A.3d 160" data-case-ids="7284707" data-case-paths="/a3d/4/0160-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a3d/4/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="4 A.3d 160" data-case-ids="7284707" data-case-paths="/a3d/4/0160-01">at 165</a> (positing that "[a]lthough [Appellee] labels her claim as 'negligent and unreasonable marketing,’ her proposed cause of action duplicates a design defect claim, seeking to impose strict liability on Wyeth because Redux was unreasonably dangerous”).</p>

Moreover, the phrase "unreasonably dangerous” is derived from negligence theory; indeed, such derivation was the very justification employed by this Court in a seminal decision eschewing use of the term "unreasonably dangerous” before jurors in the strict-liability setting. <em>See Azzarello v.

Thus, by couching her claim on appeal as one for “negligent marketing” instead of “negligent design defect,” she preserved her claim for the former and waived any claim for the latter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a>

At trial, the burden was on appellee; as appellant in the Superior Court, the burden to preserve and develop the “design defect” theory of liability was hers, not Wyeth’s. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b); <em>Heim v.
