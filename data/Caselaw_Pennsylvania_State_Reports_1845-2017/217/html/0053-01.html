Noble, a proposition made by him shortly before the actual sale to Mr. Friend and some other matters, which appear in the evidence, together with the very contradictory and unsatisfactory accountgiven by these parties of their transactions, undoubtedly throw grave suspicion upon the bona fides of the sale by Jutte. There is not enough, however, in the evidence to justify the court in finding that Jutte received, or was to receive, more than $12.00 per share for the stock, or that he was guilty of positive bad faith in selling at that price, and the exceptions relating to the bona fides of the sale are, therefore, dismissed.</p>

The exceptions are numerous and cover almost every item of the account. The first exception is to the charge of proceeds of sale of 5,000 shares at $12.00 a share, the plaintiff’s claim' that the accountant should be charged with this stock at a much higher price. The other exceptions are to two items of credit claim, and are all dismissed, the items of credit being sufficiently discussed in the opinion heretofore filed.</p>

As suggested in the opinion filed the evidence in regard to the sale of the stock, all of which came from Jutte and the purchaser from him, was highly unsatisfactory. In <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>the first place the defendant stated the account of the number of shares sold by him and the price, at which they were sold as if from his books, in a way which could, hardly be correct, but which he stuck to in his testimony until it became evident that it could not be correct, when his counsel asked leave to amend his account. The statement of the account thus made was such as to show that nothing at all was coming to the plaintiff. It further appeared that upon negotiation for sale of the same stock six months before, he insisted upon the stock being put in along with other property at the price of $12.00 a share, and the other property put in at a price higher than was asked for it by the seller, so as to cover the difference between $25.00 a share and $12.00 a share. He ■ afterwards bought other stock at $25.00 a share. When in the winter of 1902 the stock was actually sold for $12.00 a share to an officer of the bank who was practically in charge of the defendant’s affairs, the transaction has a very artificial appearance, being carried on by correspondence in -writing between the parties practically in the same office. Considering these circumstances and the numerous contradictions and inconsistencies in the testimony of the parties to the transaction, we cannot help seriously doubting its good faith and suspect very strongly that the sale was merely a pretended one for the purpose of depriving the plaintiff of his share of the proceeds of the purchase of the stock. We would not, however, feel justified in finding the fact to be so.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[237,1692,1187,709]],["BL_87.1",87,[103,376,1183,1016]]]'>There is, however, another view of the case which we believe was not heretofore sufficiently considered. The defendant was as to this stock a partner with the plaintiff. It is true that the contract between them provided that the defendant should have “ full control of the stock of said road,” but that does not mean that he should sell when and as he pleased without consultation with the plaintiff or notice to him, and perhaps does not refer to the sale of it at all, nor does it mean that he should pledge it for his own individual debt. The duty ot the defendant under the contract was to sell the stock, if he sold it all, in the usual way, upon the open market, and to procure for it the best price that could be had. What the defendant did, was to pledge it for his own debt, and thus to put the control of it more or less out of his own hands, and then with<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>out notice to the plaintiff, who was entitled to receive one-fourth of the profits, without notice to the public, and without notice to or consultation with any of the several parties who had been negotiating for the stock from time to time and whose offers had been rejected, to sell it for less than one-half of what he had paid for similar stock not long before and less than one-half of what he had been offered for it not long before, to the officer in control of the bank which held it as collateral and in whose name one-half of it actually stood at the time upon the books of the company. And this sale was made of the whole of the 5,000 shares, although only two-thirds of the amount supposed to be received was required to pay the note for which it was pledged. It is true that no sales of the stock were made upon the open market by anyone before this transaction, but we have no hesitation in finding from the evidence that the stock was worth §25.00 a share at the time it was sold by the defendant at §12.00 a share. We think that the defendant having sold the stock under the circumstances above stated, is not in a position to complain that he is charged with the last price at which any of the stock was actually sold.</p>

This adds 165,000 to the debit side of the account and increases the same to be divided between the parties by that amount, making the same §69,206.46, instead of §4,206.46. Of this amount seventy-five per cent belongs to the defendant and twenty-five per cent, or §17,301.61, to the plaintiff, from which is to be deducted $911.86, leaving abalance in favor of the plaintiff of $16,389.75.</p>

    <p id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.10",88,[316,1258,1186,498]]]'>In September, 1900, plaintiff and Jutte, appellant’s decedent, made an agreement in writing by which plaintiff was to take up options on certain stock at $10.00 a share. He was to be paid $100 a month, and in case he sold the stock at a price satisfactory to Jutte he was to have twenty-five per cent of the profits. If, however, Jutte determined to take up said options himself then Jutte was to have a salary for his time, his investment was to be repaid with interest and then plaintiff was to have twenty-five per cent of the profits on the sale of the stock. Jutte was to have “ full control ” of the stock.</p>

It overlooks at least one attribute of partnership, the community of liability for losses. The case belongs rather to that class where compensation may be measured by a proportion of <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>profits without making a partnership : Haines &amp; Co.’s Estate, <a href="/pa/176/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="176 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="882207" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0354-01">176 Pa. 354</a>.</p>
    <p id="b89-4" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[128,483,1182,299]]]'>Jutte was to be the owner of the stock throughout the transactions. The sales by plaintiff under the options he took were to be <em>“ </em>at a profit satisfactory to ” Jutte; no such provision as to the satisfaction of plaintiff was made as to sales by Jutte; the latter was “ to have full control of the stock; ” and he could terminate the agreement on ten days’ notice in writing.</p>
    <p id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.5",89,[123,789,1184,1373]]]'>It is clear that Jutte was the owner, the principal, and plaintiff only an agent to purchase, and within limits to sell. He was, however, an agent with an interest in the proceeds of the sales Avhich entitled him to an account and to the exhibition of good faith on the part of Jutte in getting the best price obtainable. For mistakes by Avhich he missed sales at higher prices than he could subsequently obtain, or other errors of judgment Jutte was not liable, but he Avas bound to good faith toAvards plaintiff. At the first adjudication the learned judge below stated the account on these principles and found a balance due of only $139.51. But on the second adjudication upon exceptions filed to the first, he raised the amount to $16,389.75. The difference arises from the different views of a sale of a large block of the stock at $12.00 a share. This sale was attacked as fraudulent and collusive with the purpose of defrauding plaintiff. On this the court said, <em>“ </em>Considering these circumstances and the numerous contradictions and inconsistencies in the testimony of the parties to the transaction, Ave cannot help seriously doubting its good faith and suspect very strongly that the sale was merely a pretended one for the purpose of depriving the plaintiff of his share of the proceeds of the purchase of the stock. We would not, however, feel justified in finding the fact to be so.” He did, however, find that as there Avas a partnership the sale by Jutte was such a failure of duty to plaintiff as his partner as to make him liable for the price that the stock was actually worth and had been sold for within a comparatively short time.</p>

The latter <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>can only be held, liable for actual bad faith. This was the basis, moreover, on which plaintiff’s bill was filed.
