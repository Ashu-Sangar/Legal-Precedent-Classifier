It is true that he filed in the court below a brief statement of errors, in accordance with equity rule 92, which statement has been substituted in the place of the assignments of error. But rule 92, by its terms, contemplates the filing of assignments of error in the appellate court, notwithstanding the fact that a statement of errors has been filed in the court below. This was expressly pointed out in Croasdale v.

On an appeal, we can consider only such errors in the record as have been properly assigned under the last mentioned rule.

The trial judge having the parties and witnesses before him, found as a fact, that the false and fraudulent representation was made. This finding was not only supported by ample testimony, but it is sustained by the weight of the evidence, and, under such circumstances, we have said many times that a finding of fact will not be disturbed by the appellate court: McPherran’s Est., <a href="/pa/212/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="212 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="941846" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0425-01">212 Pa. 425</a>; First National Bank v.

See Lindley on Partnership, 2d Am. Ed. 482; Richards v. Todd, <a href="/mass/127/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="127 Mass. 167" data-case-ids="2152614" data-case-paths="/mass/127/0167-01">127 Mass. 167</a>; Ingraham v.

The general rule is thus stated in 22 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 209: “ Where a partner has been led into a partnership by means of fraud and deceit, he may maintain a suit in equity for a dissolution, even though he proves no pecuniary damage; or he may maintain a suit to rescind the contract, and require his partner to place him in statu quo provided, of course, he has not ratified the contract after knowledge of the fraud. And in Smith v. Everett, <a href="/mass/126/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="126 Mass. 304" data-case-ids="728026" data-case-paths="/mass/126/0304-01">126 Mass. 304</a>, Justice Gray in discussing this principle, said: “Upon the allegations in the bill, which are admitted by the demurrer, the defendant, by false and fraudulent representations as to the extent of his business, induced the plaintiff to enter into a partnership with him for a definite period, which would make the plaintiff liable to creditors as a partner. Against such liability by reason of the defendant’s fraud, a court of law could afford the plaintiff no adequate remedy. Equity has, therefore, jurisdiction to order the partnership articles to be can<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>celed, and to restrain the defendant from using the plaintiff’s name as a partner; and having-obtained jurisdiction for that purpose, may administer complete relief in the same suit, by ordering the defendant to repay the sums advanced or expended by the plaintiff on account of the partnership.”</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.4",358,[282,631,1185,761]]]'>During the trial defendant made an offer to prove that the plant purchased by him from the York Candy Company was worth as much or more than the amount he stated he had paid for it in cash, $51,000. But the court excluded the offer as immaterial. An exception was taken, but there is no assignment of error to the ruling, and the question is not properly before us. But counsel for appellant raise the same point in the argument by contending that if the property was worth the amount stated, no pecuniary damage was suffered by the plaintiff, and he is not, therefore, entitled to relief in this action. But the attitude of partners toward each other is one which demands implicit fairness and good faith. No man ought to be compelled to remain in partnership with one who has deceived and tricked him, at the very outset of their career and at the inception of their mutual relations.</p>
    <p id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[277,1398,1188,761]]]'>“ The relation of partners is one' implying the highest degree of mutual confidence. By such relation each becomes the custodian, not only of the property, but to a great degree of the character and business standing of the other. For the court, therefore, in an equitable action, to uphold a contract consummated by fraud, and thus, as between the deceiver and the deceived, to bind the property and character of the latter, would seem to be not only inequitable, but oppressive. Nor should the relation be continued until the injured and deceived party has been subjected to actual loss, which he may prove in dollars and cents. When he appeals to the court for relief and establishes the fraud, he should be relieved from the hazard of a business combination into which he had been inveigled by fraud and misrepresentation : ” Harlow v.

How, then, is it possible, with any justice, to enforce the contract against him in any part ? The learned court below ivas undoubtedly right in setting the contract wholly aside. As to the appointment of a receiver for partnership property, at the instance of one of the partners, this court said, in Sloan v. Moore, <a href="/pa/37/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="37 Pa. 217" data-case-ids="418916" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0217-01">37 Pa. 217</a>, by Justice Strong, “ When a dissolution is intended, or has already taken place, a court of equity will always appoint a receiver, provided there be some breach of the duty of a partner or of the contract of partnership. See cases collected in Collier on Partnership, 354, n. 4. Indeed, it is difficult to see how the necessity of a receiver can be avoided, on the dissolution of a partnership, when the parties cannot agree as to the disposition of the joint effects, for no one has a right to their possession and control superior to that of the other.” In the present case the court below gave to the defendant every opportunity to effect a settlement with the plaintiff, but without result. Nothing remained then but to appoint a receiver. The injunction followed as a matter of course.</p>

A bill for that purpose would, however, have sustained a decree for dissolution only from the filing of the bill, and with a due regard for the rights of both parties. The injunction and the appointment of a receiver were' not only irregular and improvident, but highly unjust and injurious in that they practically confiscated the appellant’s property on a charge of fraud which may have been perpetrated but which certainly was not proved and which the appellant was denied the opportunity of disproving.</p>
