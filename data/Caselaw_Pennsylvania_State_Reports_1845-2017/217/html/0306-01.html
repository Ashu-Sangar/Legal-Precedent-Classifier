He also further set forth in his answer that the auditing judge had, before the final confirmation of the decree, his attention called to certain matters which made the decree erroneous, and that the judge had requested respondent to permit the matter to stand over until he was physically able to give it attention, but that he died before he could do so.</p>

    <p id="b337-10" data-blocks='[["BL_337.10",337,[172,1276,1182,456]]]'>A decree was regularly made that appellant should turn over to his successor in the trust the balance found to be in his hands op the adjudication of his accounts. Whether or not the appellant is correct in his assumption that the auditing judge, the late president judge of the orphans’ court, became convinced that the decree was erroneous, and would have corrected it, no exceptions appear on the record and the decree was confirmed absolutely. There is, therefore, nothing to show any error in the decree now appealed from.</p>
