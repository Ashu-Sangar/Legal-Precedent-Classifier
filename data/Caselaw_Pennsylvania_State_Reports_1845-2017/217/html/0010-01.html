This corporation took over the property and business of the firm, and preferred and common stock was issued therefor. Messrs.

Boswell. All of the holders of the common stock onApril 20, 1899, entered into an agreement which is quoted below in the opinion of the court. On April 28, 1905, a meeting of the common stockholders was held at which all the common stockholders were present, except the defendant.

In this case on April 28, 1905, after notice to all holders of common stock of the company, a meeting was held for the purpose of determining whether or not the common stock held by defendant should be appraised and taken under the agreement of April 20, 1899, defendant being at that time no longer <em>“ </em>actively engaged in the management” of the company either as an officer or employee. At that meeting it was unanimously resolved that defendant had ceased to be a desirable associate, and his stock appraised by more than a majority in interest of the stockholders at $149.71 per share in cash. Whether the making of the agreement of April 20, 1899, was judicious, is not a question for us to determine. The parties to the document had a right to make it, and having executed it with full knowledge of its contents, its terms are the law of the case and as such must be enforced against them and be observed by them: Boswell v. Boggs, supra. The contract being a binding obligation upon the parties, it seems to us the sole question for determination is, did complainants act in good faith; if they did, defendant must acquiesce in and submit to the action taken by them. Whether a holder of stock shall retain his common stock in the company depends entirely upon the opinion honestly exercised by his associates. Defendant had been with the company since its organization and the testimony shows no objection to him on the part of his associates until within the last two years of his association with them. During a portion of that time he was in ill health, which fact may have induced some of the acts his associates now complain of. However that may be, his associates by a unanimous vote determined that in their opinion he was no longer a <em>“ </em>desirable associate,” and that he should dispose of his stock in the manner provided by the agreement of 1899. Each stockholder called as a witness gave his reasons for voting as he did. The reasons given were in some respects trivial, but as a whole were, in our opinion, sufficient to negative bad faith upon their part. While many of the reasons given by the witnesses to support their action were either refuted by defendant, or to <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>some extent explained, it is apparent there was feeling among the small stockholders occasioned by defendant’s conduct toward them, his absence from the store, and his refusal to acquiesce in the proposed transfer of the 1,500 shares of common stock by Messrs. Boggs and Buhl, and it is also apparent that the discontent of these stockholders, who were heads of the largest and most profitable departments of the store, would, if continued, act to the detriment of the company. All the stockholders were particularly interested in the success of the company, Messrs. Boggs and Buhl, not only on account of their large holdings, but also the pride they had in the business, and the other stockholders because of their investment in the preferred stock, which was no doubt large to them, and also in the future promise to them from the business. It was therefore vitally important to the interest of all that there should be harmony among the holders of the stock, and that all should be in constant attendance at the store and exercise their best efforts to extend and increase the business. Whether defendant was discharged from the company’s service or quit voluntarily, we think is immaterial so far as this proceeding is concerned. He ceased to be actively engaged in the management of the company’s business, and was, in the opinion of the other stockholders, deemed to be an “undesirable associate.” They, therefore, had a right under the agreement of April 20,1899, to appraise and redeem his stock.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b43-5" data-blocks='[["BL_43.4",43,[143,1653,1174,760]],["BL_44.1",44,[265,360,1195,2038]]]'>In the event of the stock of a member being appraised and taken, the agreement provides that the appraisement shall be made by the holders of the majority of the common stock “ and they are hereby empowered to appraise the cash value of said stock.” In this case the cash value was fixed at $149.71 per share and was arrived at by ascertaining the value of the company’s assets and deducting therefrom its liabilities and the par value of preferred stock, the difference representing the value of the common stock. The amount thus fixed was the value at the end of the fiscal year of the company, February 3, preceding. By bringing the statement down to date of appraisement the value was increased to $159.20 per share, against which was a claim of the commonwealth for bonus amounting to $117,000, or about $12.00 per share. Defendant’s contention is that this appraisement is unreasonably be<a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>low what it ought to be in view of the - profits applicable to the stock, and also because it does not include any allowance for good will, which was valued at $1,000,000 at the time of the formation of the corporation. At the organization of the company the common stock was not represented by any tangible property. It was valueless, and whether it should in the future have a value depended entirely upon an increase of the company’s assets over and above the value of the preferred stock. This latter stock has preference at all times over the common stock, and in the event of the winding up of the corporation, no part of the funds realized from sale of the property can be applied to the common stock until all liabilities and the preferred stock and its. accrued dividends have been fully paid. The testimony of both Mr. Boggs and Mr. Buhl is that the common stock represented nothing of value at the time it was issued and was given free of costs to the purchasers of the preferred. As the contract empowers a majority of the stockholders to appraise the value of a retiring holder’s stock, and that having been done in this case, the appraisement must stand unless the testimony shows bad faith on the part of those who made it. Owing to the conditions attached to the stock, it has no market value; no one outside of those actively engaged in the management of the corporation could be induced to purchase it, and, while the earnings of the company have been large, the value of the stock can hardly be based upon the dividends declared upon it, for the reason that dividends may be discontinued at any time and the earnings used for other purposes. While what was intended by the words “ appraise the cash value ” of the stock is capable of more than one interpretation, it seems to us, taking the agreement as a whole and also considering the fact that the stock must always be held by a person engaged in the management of the company’s business, the intention of the parties to the agreement was that “ cash value ” should be the sum shown by the value of the assets of the company applicable to the stock. This, it seems to us, is a fair and equitable standard for arriving at the common stock’s value, and the rule which under all circumstances will most nearly do justice between the parties, in the event of an appraisement and redemption as in this case. . .</p>

Whether we were right in finding that the value fixed by the stockholders at $149.71 is correct, depends entirely upon whether $1,000,000 for good will should be added to the value represented by goods and tangible property applicable to that stock. If that amount should be added, the appraisement is entirely too low; if not, in our opinion, it is not unfair. At the time of preparing our findings and conclusions, we carefully considered this question and concluded that the agreement of April 20, 1899, contemplated in the event of the stock of a member being purchased by the other members, the purchaser should only be required to pay for it according to its real value as represented by tangible property. We have not been convinced that we were in error in reaching this conclusion. At the time the stock was issued it was not represented by any property and had no value, and to-day its value depends entirely upon the value of the corporation’s property over and <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>above that necessary to pay debts and liquidate the preferred stock. As that surplus property fluctuates, so does the actual value of the common stock rise or fall. When we consider all the circumstances, that is, that the stock when issued had no value, that the persons owning it must be actively engaged in the management of the corporation, that it is never sold on the market, and that the preferred stock is subject to redemption at any time, it seems to us that its cash value is the price shown by the value of the assets of the corporation applicable to it, which in this case at the time of the appraisement was approximately $149.71 per share. The argument that the offer of Messrs. Boggs and Buhl to sell 1,500 shares of their common stock holdings to employees at $200 per share is evidence of a greater value than $149.71, is not sound, in our judgment. In that offer Messrs. Boggs and Buhl agreed to sell with no other security for the purchase money than the stock itself, and to accept payment at such times and in such amounts as might suit the purchaser. Such terms would not indicate a cash value.</p>
