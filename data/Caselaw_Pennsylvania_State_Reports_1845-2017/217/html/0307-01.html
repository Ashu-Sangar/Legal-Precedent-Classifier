By her marriage in 1869 to James Hirst, the wife became the mother of six children, and he having died, in 1880, she became the wife of Charles Dyson.</p>

But the presumption against crime, and still more the presumption in favor of legitimacy, forbid such a result; and nothing less than positive, affirmative proof to the contrary can be accepted as sufficient to overcome such presumptions, especially in view of the great lapse of time and of the further fact that both parties are dead. Every intendent and every inference will be made in favor of innocence and legitimacy: Best on Evidence, sec. 346. “ So strong is this presumption,” it is said in 1 Greenleaf’s Evidence, sec. 35, “ that even when the guilt can only be established by proving a negative,- the negative must, in such cases, be proved by the party alleging the guilt, though the general rule of law devolves the burden of proof on the party holding the affirmative,” See also Wile’s Estate, 6 Pa.

Upon this point no importance whatever can be attached to the testimony of the daughter who remained with the wife in England, with regard to the absence of a divorce. She was but two years old when her father came to America, and but thirteen when her mother married James Hirst, in 1869. The conclusion reached by the auditing judge in favor of the claim of the wife whom the decedent married in 1868 might well be sustained on the ground thus suggested ; but he has placed it upon grounds which are unanswerable and conclusive. If, when the decedent contracted the second marriage, he had not been divorced from the woman whom, years before, he had left in England, the marriage, although solemnized in church, as it was, with due religious ceremony, was void, in spite of the conceded innocence of the wife and her ignorance of the existence of any obstacle. Nor could it have acquired validity if the first wife had survived the husband, no matter how great the lapse' of time or what the belief in the community in which the parties resided. But the first wife did not survive. She died in May, 1891, and the decedent lived until October, 1904. During all this time, a period of more than thirteen years, the person to whom he had been formally married in 1868 was recognized by him and by herself and by the community as his lawful wife. Naturally there was no repetition of a marriage ceremony, or any formal expression of marriage contract, for the wife never had knowledge that the one already entered into was not valid ; but each day during these many years that they thus lived together there was an assertion by acts and conduct which in law are as efficacious as words for establishing a contract by implication.</p>
