Late in the year 1890, plaintiff submitted to defendants certain <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>propositions in writing. The propositions were made by plaintiff as stated in the writing, “in consequence of the great loss which would be incurred by the sudden changing of his commission house.” One of the propositions was as follows: “ If defendants will agree to remain in business for one year from January 1, 1891, he (plaintiff), will guarantee the entire business against losses by bad debts for one per cent.” This proposition was accepted, and defendants continued in business during the entire year 1891. Late in the year 1891, plaintiffs made this proposition in writing: “Plaintiff hereby agrees to guarantee defendants against all losses from failures, for and in consideration of the sum of one per cent upon the net amount of their sales for the year 1892.” The defendants accepted this' offer orally. They continued to sell plaintiff’s goods until April 1, 1892, when they went out of business. Another firm took their place, accepting transfer from defendants of their accounts, and conducted under their own name the business formerly carried on by the defendants, employing the same manager, using the same store, and the same salesmen and clerks, and conforming substantially to the same rules as to giving credit. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the contract between the parties required the defendants to continue the sale of plaintiff’s goods during the whole of the year 1892; (2) that for the breach of the contract plaintiff was entitled to recover from defendants one per cent of the total sales, less the losses; and (3) that the sales made and the losses incurred during the remainder of the year 1892, while the business was conducted by the firm which succeeded the defendants, could be taken as the data on which to estimate the commission or profits due the plaintiff. ,</p>

The plaintiff was a manufacturer of woolen goods, in the city of Philadelphia. The defendants were commission merchants and carried on the business in Philadelphia and New York. For a few years prior to 1890, they were the sole consignees and agents of the plaintiff in selling his goods, for which they received a fixed percentage of the amount of sales made as compensation for their services. On December 12, 1890, the plaintiff submitted certain propositions to the defendants in writing which they accepted, among which were the following: “In consequence of the great loss which would be incurred by the sudden changing of his commission house, Thomas H. Wilson, makes to Wernwag &amp; Dawson, the following propositions: ‘(a) That on and after January 1, 1891 to July 1, 1891, that he will allow Wernwag <em>&amp; </em>Dawson 7)% commissions on all goods sold and entered for Ms account; (b) That for and in consideration of <em>\\% </em>on the total sales of Wernwag <em>&amp; </em>Dawson, he will guarantee all accounts sold by them between January 1 and July 1, 1891, this to include goods sold before July 1,1891, and not entered until after that date; (c) If Wernwag &amp; Dawson wilhagree to rema,in in business for one year from January 1, 1891, he will guarantee the entire business against losses by bad debts for one per cent; (d) On or before July 1, 1891, Wernwag &amp; Dawson will decide whether they will remain in business for the balance of the year, say from July 1, <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>1891 to December 31, 1891.

He claims that under the contract between the parties the defendants were to continue the business during the whole of 1892, and that by failing to do so he is injured to the extent of one per cent of the sales which the defendants would have made from April 1, 1892, the date of thg dissolution of their partnership, to December 31, 1892, less the losses ■which they would have sustained during that period. The defendants, on the other hand, deny that the contract between the parties contemplated that they should continue the busi<a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>ness during the whole of the year 1892, or obligated them to do so, and contend that if such is the correct interpretation of the contract, the proper measure of damages for its breach is not one per cent of the sales which they would have made had they continued in business for the whole year, less the losses; that such profits are too remote and too unpertain as a measure of damages for the alleged default.

We are clear that this is a proper interpretation of the contract. In Lacy v. Green, <a href="/pa/84/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="84 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1053524" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0514-01">84 Pa. 514</a>, Woodward, J., delivering the opinion, says (p. 518): “ Where the meaning of an agreement is doubtful, its terms are to be considered in the light thrown on them by approved or admitted illustrative facts. The situation in which the parties stand, the necessities for which they would naturally provide, the conveniences they would probably seek to secure, and the circumstances and relations of the property in regard to which they have negotiated, are all elements in the interpretation of an ambiguous contract.” We think the language of the proposition of November 10, 1891, made by Wilson to the defendants, discloses clearly an intention that the business should be continued for the whole of the ensuing year. His guaranty, as therein expressed, is against all losses from failures, and the consideration which he is to receive is a percent<a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>age “ upon the net amount of their (defendants’) sales for the year 1892.” The percentage, therefore, was not to be computed upon such sales as they might make in 1892, or until the dissolution of their partnership, or until they discontinued their business, but was stated clearly and distinctly to be upon the “ net amount of their sales for the year 1892.” When we consider all the circumstances under which the contract was made it is still made more apparent that such is the proper interpretation of the agreement of the parties. The agreement of the previous year between the same parties assists in construing the contract under consideration. By that agreement it appears that the plaintiff apprehended a great loss from any sudden changing of his commission house, and that it was entered into for the purpose of preventing such a change. It is apparent that the same reasons existed for his desire to prevent a sudden change in his commission house when the contract of 1891 was made, and hence it is fair to infer that by the contract of 1891 he intended to guard against a sudden or unexpected changing of his commission house, and desired to fix a definite time on which he might rely for his goods being sold by the defendants. By the contract of 1890 it also appears that the parties considered and agreed that a fair consideration for guaranteeing the business against losses was one per cent on the total sales for an entire year; and further, that the consideration for guaranteeing the business for a half year should be one and one-half per cent on the sales for that period. In that contract the stipulation for the consideration in the first instance was for a percentage for six months, but with a provision that if the defendants remained in business for the whole year the plaintiff was <em>“ </em>to guarantee the entire business against losses by bad debts for one per cent.”</p>

With these facts before him, it cannot be assumed that the plaintiff would agree to guarantee against losses for an indefinite time which might exclude the heaviest selling months of the year, and especially should we not presume that the plaintiff would consent to one per cent commission in view of the further fact, suggested above, that he demanded and received one and one-half per cent for guaranteeing against losses for the first six months of the preceding year.</p>

As we have seen, the defendants dissolved their partnership and discontinued their business on April 1, 1892. The referee found that “aftersaid dissolution, the firm of Minot, Hooper and Co. of New York took the place of the defendants, accepting transfer from defendants of their accounts, and conducted under their own name the business formerly carried on by the defendants, employing the same manager, using the same store and the same salesmen and clerks, and conforming substantially to the same rules as to giving credit.” It appears that those who had been the defendants’ consignors prior to the dissolution of the partnership, including the plaintiff, thereafter consigned their goods for the balance of 1892 to Minot, Hooper <em>&amp; </em>Co. The goods of the plaintiff in the possession of the defendants at the dissolution of their firm were also transferred to the samo firm, and the plaintiff and the defendants agreed as to the quantity and quality of the goods transferred. The referee also found, and his finding was sustained by the court, that “ if the defendants had remained in business, the plaintiff would have received one per cent on the amount of net proceeds of <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>sales, for the balance of the year, less'the losses. The amount of this difference can be ascertained by subtracting the actual losses on sales made by Minot,-Hooper &amp; Co., during that period from one per cent upon the amount of net proceeds of sales by that firm. ... It is reasonably certain that the defendants, had they remained in business and performed their part of the contract in good faith, would have made the same sales and losses as were made by their successors.” The referee, therefore, held that the measure of damages was one per cent upon the net proceeds of sales made by Minot, Hooper &amp; Co., from April 1 to December 31, 1892, less the losses.</p>

There can be no good reason why they should not be recovered when they are capable of definite estimation. The injured party has the right to demand and receive from the defaulting party full compensation for the loss he has sustained by a breach of the contract. Each party knows the terms of the contract and, therefore, is presumed to know the loss each will sustain by its breach. Hence when either party refuses to observe his agreement he knows the necessary consequence of his act which is to deprive the other party of the value of his bargain, the equivalent of which is the profits he would realize if its terms had been complied with.

Assuming the contract to have covered that period, the commissions as guarantor to which the plaintiff would have been entitled had the defendants continued their business are susceptible of proof and sufficiently certain and definite to warrant a recovery. As found <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>by the referee, Minot, Hooper <em>&amp; </em>Co. “ took the place of the defendants, accepting transfer from defendants of their accounts, and conducted under their own name the business formerly carried on by the defendants, employing the same manager, using the same store and the same salesmen and clerks, and conforming substantially to the same rules as to giving credit.” On the dissolution of the defendants’ partnership, the plaintiff transferred to Minot, Hooper &amp; Co. all his goods which a statement prepared by defendants showed to be in their possession. The sales made by that firm under these circumstances are criteria from which can be definitely estimated the sales which the defendants would have made had they continued their business as required by the contract. These are actual sales made under precisely the same conditions as if the defendants had been the firm conducting the business. As found by the referee, the business was carried on for the remainder of the year 1892 in the same store, with the same consignors, with the same manager and with the same clerks and salesmen as it had been prior thereto by the defendants.. There is no evidence in the case that would warrant the conclusion that the sales made in the name of Minot, Hooper <em>&amp; </em>Co. during the period in question and the losses sustained were greater or less in number or amount than would have been the sales and losses if defendants had continued the business. On the contrary, the evidence is convincing that the sales and losses would have been practically the same. There is, therefore, no sufficient reason why the sales made and the losses incurred during the remainder of the year 1892, while the business was conducted in the name of Minot, Hooper <em>&amp; </em>Co., should not be taken as the data on which to estimate the commissions or profits due the plaintiff in this action. Such profits are not speculative, imaginary, or uncertain, but are determined by a standard that renders them almost as certain as if the business had been continued by the defendants. The law does not require absolute certainty as to tlie data upon which profits are to be estimated, but certainty to a reasonable degree or extent so that the damages may rest upon a definite basis and not wholly in speculation and conjecture. If prospective or probable profits are ever to be held as having been sufficiently and certainly proved as a <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>measure of damages for a breach, of contract, then the plaintiff here must be permitted to recover.

It was a contract of insurance by which the plaintiff was to guarantee the defendants against loss by reason of bad debts, upon all sales made by the defendants during the year. The compensation of the plaintiff for insuring against this risk of loss was to be one per cent of the amount of the sales. If the sales were large in volume, the commission would be large in proportion; if the sales were small, the commission would be reduced accordingly. There was no agreement as to any definite amount of sales or commission, beyond the fact that it was to be limited to one per cent of the amount of those sales, whatever they were. If the defendants had remained in business during the entire year, while their sales might have been greater, yet the risk of loss to be borne by the plaintiff would also have been larger. When the defendants ceased doing business in April, 1892, then, at that instant, the risk of insurance against bad debts which the plaintiff was called upon to bear also came to an end. He was not thereafter called upon to insure the defendants any further against the risk of loss by reason of bad debts, and he therefore necessarily was not in a position from that time on to earn any more commissions, and this for the obvious reason that his commission was limited to one per cent of the actual amount of the sales. When the sales ceased the insurance ceased, and the compensation to be paid for it, as a matter of course, also ceased. The opinion of the majority of the court has apparently taken no account of this fact; and it permits the plaintiff to recover commissions against the defendants upon a large amount of sales which were never in fact made by them, and as to which plaintiff took no risk of insurance whatever, and upon which he therefore had no right to ask for compensation. The affirmance of this case gives to <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>the plaintiff something for nothing.
