    <p id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[297,412,1184,600]]]'>The very much over-invoked principle of the duty of employers to provide a safe place for employees to work in has no application to this case. Some occupations involve risks and dangers that are inherent, and an employer is not an insurer against these. The appellant ivas employed on a repair train, and the very nature of his employment involved the risks of stopping at irregular times and places, getting on and off without the facilities expected at regular stations and the corresponding duty of special care in so doing. There was nothing in the case to, show that the place furnished plaintiff to work in was not as safe as the nature of the work permitted.</p>
