It is a piece of legislation passed in the interest of the public health and the general welfare, and neither the head of the department nor any one of the four subordinate officers fills an office, the creation of which is forbidden by the constitution. Nothing is said in the <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>act as to the powers of the dairy and food commissioner, and it cannot, therefore, be said that the respondent ought to be ousted because he is exercising powers which the legislature, in the act authorizing his appointment, attempted to confer upon him in violation of the constitution. He is simply directed to perform, under the supervision of the head of the department, the duties which had been imposed upon the dairy and food commissioner when that officer was appointed by the president of the state board of agriculture, under the act of 1893, and that act is to be read in connection with the act of 1895, simply for the ascertainment of what duties had been imposed by it upon the dairy and food commissioner, anti which the act of 1895 requires him to perform. Turning to the act of 1893, we find the duty imposed upon the agent of the state board of agriculture, now the dairy and food commissioner appointed under the act of 1895, to be the execution and enforcement of all laws then in force, or thereafter to be enacted, in relation to the adulteration or imitation of dairy products. By the act of 1893, the state board of agriculture was charged with the enforcement of the provisions of the Act of May 21, 1885, P. L. 22, and, for the purpose of securing the enforcement of the provisions of that act or any other act concerning dairy products, it was authorized to appoint an agent, to be known as dairy and food commissioner, charged under its direction with the execution and enforcement of said laws. The act of 1885, which was the act intended to be enforced, is a constitutional piece of legislation: Powell v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/114/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="114 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="550023" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0265-01">114 Pa. 265</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=127%20U.S.%206" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="127 U.S. 6">127 </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=127%20U.S.%206" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="127 U.S. 6">U. S. 6</a> </em>78. The only, judgment that can be entered against the respondent in this proceeding is ouster, and, having been appointed by the governor under a statute authorizing his appointment, which in itself contravenes no clause of the constitution and confers upon him no powers to be exercised by virtue of his office forbidden to be exercised by any state officer, his title to the office cannot be questioned.</p>

III. sec. 27 of the constitution, which provides that, <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>“ No state office shall be continued or created for the inspection or measuring of any merchandise, manufacture or commodity, but any county or municipality may appoint such officer when authorized by law.” If other acts than that of 1895, under which the respondent admittedly was appointed and by which his duties alone are defined, confer powers upon him which ho cannot be permitted to exercise, we are not to pass' upon them in this proceeding. If he has been appointed to a lawful office, carrying with it by the words of the act creating it no coiistitutionally forbidden powers, he is not to be ousted because subsequent legislation may have conferred such powers upon him. His right to hold a lawful office is one thing ; his right to exercise enlarged powers which he may not lawfully exercise is another, and, having determined that he is holding a lawful office, we leave the question of his right to exercise alleged forbidden powers to be raised in some other proceeding, in which specific acts said to be performed by him under statutory powers prohibited by the constitution may be set forth and inquired into and restrained, if unlawful.</p>
