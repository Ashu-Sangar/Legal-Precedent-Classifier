The averments of the bill are that the decedent because of sickness and the infirmities of age was unable to transact business, and that the assignment was procured by undue influence and fraud. Neither of these averments was sustained by the evidence. It was found by the learned judge that the decedent was not mentally weak when the assignment was made, but was of sound mind and capable of transacting business and fully understood the nature and character of his acts; that no confidential relations existed between him and his son, and that there was no evidence that he was in any way influenced to make <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>the assignment or that it was not his voluntary act.
