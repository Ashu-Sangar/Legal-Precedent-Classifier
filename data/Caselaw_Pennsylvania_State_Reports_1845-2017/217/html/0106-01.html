It cannot be said with certainty that if he looked ho saw the train, nor that, if he saw it, he observed in the darkness and storm that it was backing to the crossing, since the natural inference from the position of the engine would be that it would move in the opposite direction. The testimony offered by the defendant to rebut the presumption was far from being clear and indisputable. It was wholly discredited by the jury for reasons satisfactory to the learned trial judge, as we learn from his opinion. The testimony on behalf of the plaintiff to show that no signal of the movement of the train was given was more than merely negative. One of her witnesses, who was walking between the tracks in the direction the train was moving and observed it as it passed him and kept it under observation until the accident, testified positively that neither bell nor whistle was sounded. The plaintiff’s case rested upon the presumption of care, unrebutted by proof that would have -warranted the court in holding that it was overcome, and upon testimony tending to show negligence on the part of the defendant. It was clearly for the jury.</p>
