The several bills in equity were filed by property owners to restrain the collection of the assessments made against their properties. It is contended that the assessments are illegal because the proceedings under which they were made are based upon an act of assembly that is in conflict with the constitution of the state; secondly, that the sewers constructed were paid for'by loans created under a vote of the electors of the township and by an ordinance of the commissioners, and that such action was conclusive against any further assessment to pay for the construction of the sewers; and thirdly, that the methods of assessment invoked are illegal, and cannot be enforced even if the properties are liable to assessment.</p>

On April 16, 1902, the board of township commissioners passed an ordinance to establish and maintain a system of sewers, culverts, pipes and drainage to dispose of domestic drainage and sewage in said township. A system of sewers was designated on plans and maps and was subsequently constructed. The work was completed prior to February 23, 1905, but within six months of said date. The action of the township commissioners was in pursuance of the authority conferred upon them by the act of the general assembly, approved May 24, 1901, P. L. 294.</p>

The township commissioners ascertained that the cost of the sewer system would amount to more than two per centum of the last preceding assessed valuation of taxable property in said township. They resolved to submit to the electors the question, whether an indebtedness of $250,000 should be incurred “ for the purpose of paying the cost of constructing a system of sewers and drainage in said township as heretofore planned and adopted, including the pumping engines and necessary appurtenances.” A majority of the votes polled in the whole township was in favor of incurring the said indebtedness. After this vote of the electors, the township commis- - sioners on May 20, 1903, accepted the bids of the contractors for the construction of a portion of the system of sewers. Bonds were issued for the purpose of securing the loan of $250,000, and these were negotiated and the money was realized by the township commissioners.</p>

It was ascertained that the loan of $250,000 was insufficient to pay for the projected sewer system, and on June 1, 1904, the board of township commissioners passed an ordinance authorizing an additional loan of $200,000 to complete the sewer system. Bonds to this amount were also negotiated, <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>and on July 20, 1904, the board of township commissioners, by ordinance, appropriated $140,000 out of said second loan, to the committee on health and drainage for the purpose of sewer construction.</p>

All of this sum was paid or provided for from the proceeds of the two loans aforesaid. This sewer system so constructed and paid for is the identical system now in use. The assessments in controversy are for benefits, and the commissioners demand from the property owners the payment of over $300,000 of the said expenditure of $424,000.</p>

By ordinance of the board of township commissioners, property owners abutting on said sewers could bo required to connect with and use the sewers of the township. In pursuance of said ordinance the owners of property abutting on the said sewers were notified to connect their respective buildings with said sewers. Failure to observe the order subjected the property owner to certain penalties. The board of township commissioners .also established a rate of annual charges for all persons who connected with the sewers. These annual sewer charges will produce an amount somewhat in excess of the cost of operating and maintaining the sewer system. This action on the part of the township commissioners, requiring connections and annual rentals, was all taken prior to the passage of the Act of February 23, 1905, P. L. 22, and the action was taken by authority of the Act of May 24, 1901, P. L. 294.</p>

These taxes were so levied on June 24, 1903, and June 1, 1904, to cover a period of twenty-nine years, during which time the bonds were to be liquidated.</p>

The court of common pleas was to appoint the jury. Several juries were appointed by said court to assess the damages for injury to private property. The complainant for the estate of Wistar Morris (Bill No. 16) had a jury appointed, and the jury in that case awarded damages in the sum of $1,500. The report was filed on February 6, 1905 — that is, before the passage of the act of February 23, 1905. The township commissioners took an appeal from the award.</p>

The money to pay for the entire system of sewers was in the hands of the township commissioners as early as July 20, 1904, when the last appropriation was made to the committee on health and drainage. The annual rates for the use of the sewers were established apparently as early as December 2, 1903. The construction of the sower system was completed, the money for its cost was paid or provided for, and its operation was assured by the enforced connections and the rentals for its maintenance. This was the condition of affairs for some time prior to February 23, 1905, although less than six months intervened between the completion of the system and the date just named.</p>

On March 1,1905, an ordinance was passed by the township commissioners in pursuance of the act of the general assembly of February 23, 1905. According to this ordinance there is no change in the sewer system in the slightest degree, either in construction or operation, but liability of the property owners for the costs of construction is changed. Under the new ordinance the cost of the service sewers — $300,000— is to be paid by the property owners benefited, while under the original proceedings the entire cost was placed on all the landowners within the township.</p>

There is, however, no assessment for this line over private ground. Mr. Bailey'is assessed for the sewer line on. Lancaster avenue, and also for the line on Church street or Lin wood avenue, áñd his property abuts on these streets. The same is true where a line of pipes passes over a section of the Haverford college grounds.

The whole territory in districts Nos. 1 and 2 is devoted to or is ripe for residential purposes, although some of the owners may be unwilling to sell presently. Where the streets and roads are not lined with built up houses and stores, the lands are devoted to line residential homes, ornamented with trees and shrubbery, and enjoy all the comforts of city homes, so far as water pipes, street lights, police and fire protection, and fine streets are concerned.

In many respects wherein the constitutionality of the act is attacked, it is almost identical in language with that part of the Act of May 23, 1889, P.

The act of 1905, which is attacked in these proceedings, deals with a subject proper for municipal regulation, and is, therefore, within the legislative province. There are, it is true, some features of the act of 1905 which cannot be sustained, as pointed out in the opinion of the court below, but they are not so interwoven with the balance of the act, that they render the whole statute unconstitutional and void.</p>

The Act of May 24, 1901, P. L. 294, amendatory of this clause of section 7 of the former act, omitted the provision authorizing the cost of the sewer to be charged on the property benefited* but conferred power on the township to enter on private lands for the construction of sewers. The act of February 23, 1905 restores the power of the townships to <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>assess the cost of the sewer on the properties benefited. Legislation, therefore, bearing upon townships of the first class has conferred upon such townships the power and authority of other municipalities in regard to the construction and maintenance of sewers, as well as providing for the expenses necessarily incurred for the purpose. As suggested above, the creation and maintenance of a sewer system for a municipality is clearly a municipal function and hence the legislature may confer authority for the purpose on a class of municipalities without impinging the constitution.</p>
    <p id="AX-" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[298,885,1190,1514]]]'>As we have said, the act under consideration is very similar to former legislation on the same subject enacted for cities of the third class. We have ruled that it is within the province of the legislature to authorize the division of the territory of a municipality into sewer districts and provide for alternative methods of assessment. See Oil City v. Oil City Boiler Works, <a href="/pa/152/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="152 Pa. 318" data-case-ids="838159" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0318-01">152 Pa. 318</a>. We think it quite clear that there is a necessity for such division in townships of the first class, much more than in boroughs and in cities. Part of the township may be sparsely settled and needing no system of sewers, while other parts of it may be densely populated, as much so as a-borough or city, and needing a system of sewers and drainage. If the legislature can confer authority upon the councils of boroughs and cities to make such divisions, it is quite apparent, we think, that it can confer a like authority upon the commissioners of a first-class township. In the cases before us the court has found that the whole territory in sewer districts Nos. 1 and 2 is devoted to or is ripe for residential purposes, and that the inhabitants enjoy all the comforts of city homes. The properties in these districts were held to be subject to the foot front rule of assessment. On the other hand, the court found that sewer district No. 3 was rural and not thickly populated, and held that it was proper to assess the property in that district according to the benefits derived. The court, therefore, in both instances, followed the well-established rule announced by this court that the foot front rale is applicable to property situated in á city or other densely populated community, and that the rural properties must be assessed according to the benefits derived from the improvement.</p>

This provision of the act of 1905, however, is sustained by Commonwealth v. Woods, <a href="/pa/44/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="44 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="484226" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0113-01">44 Pa. 113</a>, as well as by later decisions of this court. In the Woods case the court held an act of assembly to be constitutional which authorized the councils of Pitts-burg to construct sewers in the streets, and to appoint three viewers to levy and assess the cost upon the property benefited and to make report thereof to the city councils, and provided that the assessment, when approved by the councils, should be a lien on the property assessed. An appropriate ordinance was passed to carry out the provisions of the act of assembly. In delivering the opinion in that case Mr. Justice Read, quoting from Gault’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/33/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="33 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="988435" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0094-01">33 Pa. 94</a>, says (p. 100): “ States and cities cannot exist without taxation.

In the many decisions on the subject it has uniformly been ruled that this section refers only to such taxes as are of a general nature, and does not apply to such as are levied for local improvements. It is also suggested that the act exceeds the general powers of taxation conferred upon the legislature, and its effect is to confiscate private property, in violation of the restrictions of the declaration of rights. But this position finds nothing to sustain it in the numerous cases of this <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>court cited 'by counsel for that purpose. None of those cases decide that the legislature does not have the power to authorize a. municipality to construct a necessary sewer system and impose the cost upon the abutting property owners according to the benefits derived from the improvement. That is the extent of the authority conferred by the act of 1905 on the board of commissioners of townships of the first class. It is strictly within the rule established by our decisions, which requires the assessment to be made on the basis that the benefits are local and essentially peculiar to the property assessed and that the limit of the benefits is the limit of the taxing power.</p>

The learned court below has fully answered this contention in the opinion filed. In City of Chester v. Black, <a href="/pa/132/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="132 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="970645" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0568-01">132 Pa. 568</a>, it is said (p. 571): “ The principle has been repeatedly recognized in this state that, where the legislature has antecedent power to authorize a tax, it can cure, by retroactive law, an irregularity or want of authority in levying it, though thereby a right of action which had been vested in an individual should be divested. . . . The constitutionality of this kind of legislation is not open to objection.” In Magee v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/46/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="46 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="420628" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0358-01">46 Pa. 358</a>, it was held that an act of assembly was constitutional which authorized the city councils of Pittsburg to grade and pave the streets and to collect the cost and expense from the owners of lots abutting thereon, by an equal assessment upon the front foot of each owner, and providing for the appointment of appraisers to value and appraise the paving, the cost of which had been paid or assumed by the city. In that case one of the points for instruction submitted by the defendant, and which this court held was rightly refused, was the following: “ That if the jury believe that the city of Pittsburg has paid for the paving for which this suit is brought, and that said payments were made from moneys collected by general taxation, and that the property to be subject to the lien here <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>was assessed and taxed for said purpose, and that the amount so assessed was paid, the plaintiff cannot recover.” In re Beechwood Avenue, <a href="/pa/194/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="194 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="912484" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0086-01">194 Pa. 86</a> was an appeal by a property owner from the order of the court below confirming a report of viewers appointed to assess damages for improving Beechwood avenue in the city of Pittsburg. One of the exceptions to the report of viewers, filed by appellant and overruled by the court, is as follows: “ The cost of said improvement has been provided for by city bonds payable by taxpayers generally, and the present assessment amounts to double taxation, and is unjust, inequitable and illegal.” In sustaining the position of the court below Mr. <em>Chief </em>Justice Stereett said (p. 91):</p>

In providing the fund referred to, it was never intended by the city to relieve from assessments for <em>‘ </em>special benefits ’ any property fronting on her newly improved streets, avenues or boulevards that may be actually benefited specially, that is, benefited over and above the general benefit accruing to it in common with other property in the vicinity of such improvements.” Here the complaining property owners are in error in thinking that the sewer system constructed by the township is a general public improvement and that, therefore, they should not be required to contribute for the benefits they have received from the improvement. The township was divided into sewer districts and the improvements were in those districts, and hence were local to that part of the territory embraced in the whole township. Those districts were the territory accommodated by the improvement and, being local, may be paid for by the abutting property owners.</p>

In such cases the land is taken, injured or destroyed by virtue of the power of eminent domain, and in the assessment of dam<a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>ages the owner cannot be deprived of his constitutional right to demand a trial by jury.</p>
    <p id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[272,444,1180,511]]]'>We fail to see that the act of 1905 deprives the complaining landowners of any constitutional right. Taxation is a- legitimate burden imposed upon the property owner, and Ke must submit to it when he is not discriminated against in behalf of others similarly situated. If the property owners of townships of the first class believe that the method adopted by the act of 1905 for meeting the expenses incurred in constructing and maintaining sewer systems imposes unjust or unequal taxation, their relief must come from the legislative, and not the judicial, department of the government.</p>
