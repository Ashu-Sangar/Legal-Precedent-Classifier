If anybody was responsible for it other than the plaintiff himself it was Big Mike, who was not a vice principal, nor a principal. At most he was foreman or boss, as he was called, but in this accident he was a coemployee at the time the accident happened, for which the company would not be liable. We therefore direct a nonsuit.”</p>
