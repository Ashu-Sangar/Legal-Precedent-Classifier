Subsequently the contractors went into 'bankruptcy, and their trustee demanded the money represented by the order on the ground that the order was an illegal preference. The board paid the money into court. A feigned issue was framed between the subcontractor as plaintiff, and the trustee in bankruptcy as defendant. <em>Held, </em>(1) that as the board by payment into court had declined to raise questions between itself and the subcontractors, the trustee was riot in a position to do so; and (2) that the only question before the court was whether the contractors were insolvent when they gave the order, and whether the subcontractor knew it at that time.</p>

White was a subcontractor for the roofing of the building. On October 7,1901, Jackson &amp; Fulton gave to Scott A. White an order on the school board for $4,000. This order was accepted.

The latter demanded the amount of the order from the school board, but was refused. The board paid the money'into court.

Second, it sets up a new contract between the school board and the plaintiff that is without consideration, and which by the pleadings has been the cause of litigation against the school board.

Third, because under the pleadings the offer raises a mixed question of law and fact, and is, therefore, too general.</p>

    <p id="b57-6" data-blocks='[["BL_57.7",57,[128,746,1181,865]]]'>This was a feigned issue to determine the right to a fund in court. The general contractors for a school building made a subcontract with plaintiff for part of the work, and gave him an order on the school board which the board accepted. Subsequently the general contractors went into bankruptcy and their trustee demanded the money for plaintiff’s work on the ground that the order was an illegal preference. The board paid the amount into court. The questions of consideration and of a new contract by the board, ultra vires, argued by appellant are not in the case. The board by payment into court declined to raise them and the appellant is not in position to do so. And the evidence as to litigation against the school board was irrelevant for the same reason. At the trial, therefore, there was nothing in issue but the alleged illegal preference. That depended on whether the contractors were insolvent when they gave the order, and whether plaintiff knew it at that time. The jury found these facts in plaintiff’s favor.</p>
