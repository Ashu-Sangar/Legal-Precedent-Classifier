It appeared that prior to the accident plaintiff asked his superior for a new flatter, saying that the old one was worn, or a little cracked. The old flatter was not shown to the boss, nor did he promise to remedy the defect, but simply told the workman that it was good enough and to go ahead with it. <em>Held, </em>that the workman’s employer was not responsible for his injury.</p>

One of the plaintiff’s helpers told him the flatter was cracked. Plaintiff asked Preisen for a new flatter. He replied, “ Go ahead and use it; I haven’t any more ; it is good enough; go ahead with it.” Plaintiff worked with the flatter for about an hour, the helpers striking it with sledges weighing about thirteen or fourteen pounds, when - the piece of steel flew off where it was cracked and struck him in the eye.
