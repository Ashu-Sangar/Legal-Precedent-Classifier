It was made in 1682 for 2,000 years. The consideration was, as you have been told, a peppercorn and so many shillings — five shillings. I believe it is for each 100 acres of land. Now you will say what bearing that has upon the question of presumption. There was a letting, a lease of 500 acres of land in the township of Upper Chichester to a son for 2,000 years, yielding and paying yearly during the said term unto William Withers, his heirs and assigns, one peppercorn at or upon the feast of St. Michael, the archangel, if the same be lawfully demanded. It was not to be paid outright, but it was to be paid if it should be demanded by the lessor, and also paying and discharging the aforesaid chief or quit rent of a shilling yearly as aforesaid, one shilling for each 100 acres. So you see the consideration of the old lease for 2,000 years, which was to a son, was, if the lessor should demand it, he should pay a peppercorn, and in addition one shilling for each- 100 acres of land. You will say what bearing a lease for 2,000 years, for a nominal consideration, has upon the question whether or not, when in 1823 the owner of this land began to convey it in fee simple — whether it is reasonable to suppose that there was a grant to them and that it had been lost.] [8]</p>

This chain of title to the leasehold estate extended down to the titles of Erasmus Morton and Nehemiah Broomall, but when their estates were partitioned in 1823 and 1831 it was assumed in the proceedings that each owned a fee in the land.</p>

The deed made by the administrators of Nehemiah Broomall to Robert Boyd, in pursuance of the sale under the partition proceedings, expressly undertakes to convey the fee. Aaron Morton, who took by allotment, and Robert Boyd, who took by deed, under the respective partitions, took “fee simple estates,” or else they took nothing. The .unexpired term of the Withers lease was personal property, and not susceptible of partition. The partition proceedings show no reference to any lease, and there was no apparent intention to deal in any way with a lease, and if there had been any such purpose, there was no jurisdiction in the orphans’ court to make partition of personalty.</p>

But even if the partitions were void, the holdings of the parties were adverse to the rights of anyone claiming under the lease. During a period of over sixty years, all the wills, deeds and mortgages in the chain of title assumed to pass the fee and made no reference to any leasehold interest.

But in the present case Matthew Boyd, and his predecessors in title, took possession under a proceeding of record, in which the title was openly and avowedly claimed as a fee simple, and in absolute defiance of the claim of anyone in opposition thereto. And there is not a trace of any claim being made by anyone as landlord during a period of more than sixty years. The parties who took possession under the partition proceedings were fully justified in supposing that they were taking possession in fee. “ Where one enters without knowledge of the tenancy, and irrespective of it, in the assertion of a title on its face adverse to the lessor, though derived, as here, from the tenant, his possession will be hostile, if unequivocal acts and declarations manifest an intention to hold in despite of all others. ... Of the facts that have been recognized as indicative of hostile intent, none are perhaps more decisive than the exhibition of a paper title, independent of that residing in the original owner, by color of which the party justifies his entry : ” Dikeman v.

After a great lapse of time and a series of circumstances disclosing the enjoyment of an unchallenged title during such period, <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>the courts will presume whatever grant may be necessary to quiet the title. It is not sufficient for a stranger to rest upon an ancient outstanding title. In Jackson v. Hudson, 3 Johnson, 375, Chancellor Kent said: “If- a defendant sets up an outstanding title existing in a stranger, it must be a present subsisting title; it must-be one that is living and operating, otherwise the presumption will be that it has become extinguished.” This language, was cited with approval by Chief Justice Gibson in. Hasting v. Wagner, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 215" data-case-ids="481763" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0215-01">7 W. &amp; S. 215</a>, where he said: “ These presumptions conduce to repose, and there is a growing tendency to encourage them not only here, but elsewhere. In Jackson v. Hudson (<a href="/citations/?q=3%20Johns.%20Rep.%20375" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="3 Johns. Rep. 375">3 Johns. Rep. 375</a>), the Supreme Court of New York were of opinion that to constitute a defense in ejectment an outstanding title in a third person must be a present and operative one, else it will be presumed to have been extinguished only by a conveyance, and to whom ? Not to the defendant who does not pretend to claim under it, but to the plaintiff who has claimed the tract for thirty years and acted as the owner of it.” The same chief justice in Taylor v. Douherty, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 324" data-case-ids="1852507" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0324-01">1 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 324</a> said, in referring to the case then before him: “We have the expenditure of money, not in a single contested act of ownership, but in acts repeated and persisted in for more than thirty years, as regards the ownership of the warrant, and without any adverse claim to it whatever. On every principle of authority and reason, this was sufficient not only to be left to the jury, but, in the absence of conflicting evidence, to command a verdict. The execution of a deed is presumed from possession in conformity to it for thirty years; and why the entire existence of a deed should not be presumed from acts of ownership for the same period, which are equivalent to possession, it would not be easy to determine.” Many other cases to the same effect might be cited in support of this principle, such as Carter v.
