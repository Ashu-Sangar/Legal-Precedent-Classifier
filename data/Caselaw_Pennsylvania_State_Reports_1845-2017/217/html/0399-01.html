    <p id="b430-7" data-blocks='[["BL_430.8",430,[280,1434,1182,648]]]'>In the present case the learned judge below went fully and carefully into the inquiry. It would not be desirable to encumber the report with the details, but the result may be summed up substantially in his finding that the interest in the matter in its widest aspect was confined to a portion of the borough of Bristol, and the population of the borough is less than one-tenth that of the county. He was, therefore, “ quite satisfied that there will be no difficulty in obtaining a disinterested and impartial jury, jurors who have never even heard of the case.” With his local knowledge of the places and the people, the judge’s opinion is much more likely to be correct than ours could be, and we certainly have not been shown any reason to interfere with it.</p>
