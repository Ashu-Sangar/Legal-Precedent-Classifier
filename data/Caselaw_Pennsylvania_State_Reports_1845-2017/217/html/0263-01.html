I said, yes, I can go over the bridge and the mill property and the Perkiomen, and get it off that way, but I said I could hardly haul a heavy load and it is very unhandy. Well, he said, Mr. Bromer, I wish you would do that, and in the next season you shall have your crossing ready in time for harvest. Well, I considered about this a little, and with the barn and yard as it was then, it was certainly of great importance to me, and especially the barn, and I said, Mr. Seipt, how would this do ; I -would be willing; I would be willing to do without a crossing as long as you let me use this ground and the barn ;. if I can have the use of that, I will go around and bring over my crops in that way, but, I said, whenever you make me a road, and you want to occupy this ground, I have no longer to build a barn except for the lowland which I have to fill up ; then I want my crossing and must have it. He said that was all right; he seemed to be very much pleased ; he seemed to be more pleased than I was; he extended his hand and said, Mr. Bromer, that is a bargain, and this was nearly thirty-six years ago, and I have kept- my side of the bargain forthwith.”</p>

Rafferty, <a href="/pa/128/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="128 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="567067" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0337-01">128 Pa. 337</a>. The instruction as to the standard of evidence required that it must be clear, precise and indubitable in the sense that it carries conviction to the mind and by witnesses who know and are credible, was full and accurate. The plaintiff was corroborated as to the making of the contemporaneous oral agreement, and as to its terms by a witness who was present when the writing was executed and by proof that the defendant has remained <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>in possession of the land thirty-six years under an arrangement by which his right,to insist on a crossing and the duty of the plaintiff to construct one were suspended. Under the testimony the establishment of a crossing was distinctly a part of the consideration, and until established there was no right of possession.</p>
