The referee \u201c had all these witnesses before him; he noted their manner of testifying, and has had the benefit of having heard the live evidence as it came from the lips of the witnesses, rather than reading their words in cold type, and he is free to say that the testimony of Mr. Lawrence \u2014 that he repaired the hole on April 8, 1904\u2014 did not impress him in point of accuracy, as to date of repair. The referee is, therefore, constrained to disregard the evidence of repair on April 8, 1904 ; and to find that from at least March 31, 1904, to and including the day of the alleged accident to the plaintiff, a defect or hole as described by the witnesses actually existed in the footway in question.\u201d He, therefore, found that the accident was due to the city\u2019s negligence. This finding was approved by the court and there is nothing to justify us in disturbing it.\nJ udgment affirmed..",
