        "text": "Per Curiam,\nIt may be conceded that a devise of realty in the words of this testatrix\u2019s will would create a fee. But this is under the rule in Shelly\u2019s case, which has become a rale of property, and operates without regard to the donor\u2019s intent, and generally to defeat it. But the cardinal rule which dominates all others in the construction of wills is that the intent of the testator if not unlawful shall be carried out. The exception made by the rule in Shelly\u2019s case does not extend to bequests of personalty, and though the analogy may sometimes in default of better guide be followed, it is never allowed to defeat a plain intent. It may also be conceded that a gift of the income or profits of personalty, without more, will carry the absolute property of the donee. But this is never allowed where it appears by words of limitation or by gift over, or in other way, that the testator intended a less estate. In Eichelberger\u2019s Estate, 135 Pa. 160 (171), an unrestricted gift of a sum of money in the first clause of the bequest was held to be limited to the interest for life, by the words that followed directing the sum to be placed at interest and the interest paid annually to the legatee for life, and if he died leaving no heirs of his body then the sum bequeathed to go over to testator\u2019s other heirs. And in Ritter\u2019s Est., 118 Pa. 577, a bequest of the interest of a sum of money to be paid annually for life, with no trustee interposed, no investment directed and no specific limitation over was nevertheless held only a gift for life, because the intent of the testator was clear to give only that much. The principle at the base of all the decisions is expressed in Bentley v. Kauffman, 86 Pa. 99, that where the intent of the testator is to sever the product from its source and make a gift of the former only, a bequest of income will not carry the principal.\nThe present case is much stronger than Ritter\u2019s Estate, and comes exactly within Bentley v. Kauffman. The testatrix made no gift to her son of anything but the interest of the snm named, limited even that expressly to his life, directed that the principal should be charged on her farm during his life and that at his death it should be paid to his heirs. It is difficult to see how she could have made her intention plainer.\nDecree affirmed.",

T., 1906, by William E. Fritz, from decree of O. O. Montgomery Co., Oot. T., 1903, No. 21, dismissing petition for an order to pay money in Estate of Sarah B. Dull, deceased.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nApril 1, 1907:\nPetition for an order to pay the principal of a legacy charged on land.\nFrom the record it appeared that Sarah B. Dull by her will which was probated on November 17, 1885, directed, inter alia, as follows:\n\u201c Item. \u2014 I give, devise and bequeath to my son Boss B. Dull the interest on Two Thousand Dollars, to be paid to him semi-annually, the principal to remain properly secured in the farm on which I now reside during his natural life, and at his death the principal shall be paid to his heirs.\u201d\nIt appeared that in partition proceedings certain land of the decedent was awarded to William B. Dull, charged with the payment of the legacy of $2,000 above mentioned. It also appeared that by various assignments the interest of Boss B. Dull became invested in the petitioner, William E. Fritz. The petition averred that petitioner was entitled to the principal of the fund, since Boss B. Dull was dead. It appeared that Boss B. Dull left to survive him a widow and one son, Harry B. Dull; the latter claimed the ownership of the principal of the legacy on the ground that his father had an interest only in the income for life. The orphans\u2019 court adopted this view and dismissed the petition.\nError assigned ivas the decree of the court.\nLouis M. Childs, for appellant, cited :\nBacon\u2019s App., 57 Pa. 504; Dodson v.
