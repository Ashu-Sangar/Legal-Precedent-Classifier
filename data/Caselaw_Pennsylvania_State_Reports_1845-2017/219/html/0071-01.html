Poison, or poisonous or infectious substances also ordinarily mean substances that are in their nature poisonous or infectious, and that are generally recognized and known as such. An infinitesimal poisonous germ, or that which it generates, is not poison as the word is ordinarily understood. Nor is it, or its product, popularly known as a substance. If we were to adopt the scientific or medical meaning of the term, as we are in effect asked to do by the defendant, we would have to hold that everything containing a poisonous generating germ, or an infectious germ, is a poisonous or infectious substance. But in the ordinary use of the language we would not speak of either a liquid or a solid which contains a poisonous or infectious germ as essentially a poisonous or infectious substance. If we did, it would be difficult to mention'any substance which cannot be so characterized. There is nothing in the policy to satisfy us that when it was issued, either the insurer or insured was versed in the germ theory, and that either intended the words of article eight to be taken in any other than their common and usual sense. W e are not prepared to say that they meant that an accidental death, due to the bite of a dog, or of any other animal, should fall without the accident benefits of the policy. Suppose the insured had been accidentally shot and, as a result of the accident, suffered with blood poisoning from the bullet received into his body and died. It would hardly be said to be a case of contact with poison, or with a poisonous or infectious substance, in the ordinary acceptation of the term. We can see no real distinction between such a case and the one at bar. When we come to interpret insurance policies in the light of advanced medical science, then we may agree with the contention of the defendant. Until then, however, we must interpret them as the terms employed in them are commonly used and understood.</p>

However this may be the health provisions of the policy do not provide for any payment in case of death by disease, but only for indemnity during the existence of the disease. The present claim is a claim for the death of the insured, and, if it is covered by the policy, falls within the provisions relating to accidents. The case cannot be excluded from the accident provisions of the policy, if the injury is of the character described therein and is the proximate cause of the death, merely because the injury is accompanied by a disease or sickness mentioned in the health provisions of the policy. If excluded at all, it would be excluded because it is a case of contact with poison, of poisonous or infectious substances within the meaning of article eight. But, as we have seen, it is not such a case. The motion for judgment non obstante veredicto is, therefore, overruled, and judgment is directed to be entered on the verdict upon payment of the jury fee.</p>
