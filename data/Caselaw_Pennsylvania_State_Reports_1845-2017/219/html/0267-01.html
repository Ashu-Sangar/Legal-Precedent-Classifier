The testimony of Mr. Shannon shows that <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>he accepted, this assignnaent as a payment and entered credit for the same and did not hold it as collateral, although he retains possession of the original note against Eshelman. Had the instrument been negotiable and assigned for value before maturity, without notice, and whether for a present consideration, in payment of a pre-existing debt, or as a collateral, the assignee would hold it free and discharged of any defense or rights of the maker. When the instrument assigned is a nonnegotiable one, a bona fide assignee for value before maturity takes it discharged of the equities of persons not parties to it of which he had no notice, but takes it subject to all of the equities between the original parties. The acceptance by Mr. Shannon of the assignment of the debt for $1,500, re-represented by the bond and mortgage in this suit, as a payment, and not as collateral, and an entry of credit for the same on the note which he held against Mr. Eshelman, would tend to rebut any presumption that he held it as collateral, and would be a sufficient consideration to support the assignment. The assignee gave credit to the bond and mortgage as recorded and relied upon it. iso proof has been offered to show that the bond and mortgage was not just what it represented to be on its face and, therefore, the mistaken or fraudulent declarations made by the mortgagee in direct contradiction of the plain terms of the mortgage, after he had parted with all of his interest therein, could not be held to estop the assignee from obtaining a judgment on the scire facias sur mortgage against the terre-tenant, and especially so when a judgment has been previously obtained thereon against the mortgagor. Otherwise it would permit persons, who were so disposed, to fraudulently enter into a combination to obtain money from an innocent assignee of a valid mortgage. Even if the assignment was held as collateral it is not clear that the mistaken declarations of the assignor thereafter made, could be used as an estoppel against the assignee. The assignment of a mortgage may be recorded, but no statute has been cited which requires it to be done.</p>

If the agent of the terre-tenant relied upon the record as to this and presumed that he was still the owner for the reason that no assignment to anyone for the same had been recorded, still it would be the duty of a man of ordinary caution and prudence to definitely inquire as to this, and rely upon the mortgage as recorded and not upon the loose verbal declarations in contradiction thereof. Had there been any evidence offered to-show that the mortgage in suit was not just what it purported to be, and was not a valid existing debt as between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, then, of course, the assignee would stand in the same position as the mortgagee; or had the mortgagor or terre-tenant, after the assignment and without actual or record notice thereof, actually paid the mortgagee the bond secured by the mortgage, obtained possession of the bond and thereby extinguished the debt, an entirely different question would be presented. If the bond was paid and delivered' to the mortgagor or terre-tenant by the mortgagee, the latter would be held to have received the debt for the use of the assignee. As between the assignee and outside parties it is really immaterial whether the admittedly mistaken declarations, as alleged to have been communicated b.y the mortgagee to the agent of the terre-tenant, were made before or after the assignment to the present plaintiff, as he took it clear of the equities of any outside parties.</p>

McHenry, the terre-tenant, who alone made defense, purchased the prop<a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>erty from Conlon in June, 1903. The ground of her defense was that before paying the purchase money, her counsel, representing her in the purchase, was told by Eshelman that the mortgage was given for the same debt that was secured by two judgments which were prior liens on the property, and that acting on the belief that this was the case, a settlement was made with Conlon.</p>

The record does not fully sustain the statement made in the opinion of the court that the undisputed testimony showed this. There was no direct testimony on this subject, but it was not in dispute that an assignment had been made October 25, 1901, as recited in the writ of scire facias, although a later assignment was executed in 1905. The trial was apparently proceeded with on the assumption, the correctness of which has not at any time been questioned, that the mortgage was assigned in 1901 by an indorsement on the back thereof, and that a second assignment bearing the same date as the first was executed in 1905, because the first had not been acknowledged and could not be recorded. The case having been tried on this assumption, it should bo considered on review as if the proofs had been made.
