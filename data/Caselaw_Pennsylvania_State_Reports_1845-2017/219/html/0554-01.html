The petitioners, two of the beneficiaries under the latter trust, now claim that it was testator’s intention to give the Orphan Belief Fund five-eighths of his entire estate, and that the decree should be so modified. If this claim be well founded, as the widow took four-eighths of the personalty and there <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>were but four-eighths left for distribution, the whole fund for distribution should have been given to the trustee for the Orphan Relief Fund. In the sixth paragraph the testator gave the residue of his estate, after paying debts, pecuniary legacies and satisfying all legal claims of his widow, to a trustee. He then sets apart one-fourth of the trust estate for the Downs’s children, one-eighth for Ethel Jacoby, and the remaining portion, viz.: five-eighths for the Orphan Relief Fund. There is surely nothing in the will indicating any intention on the testator’s part to give the Orphan Relief Fund five-eighths of his entire estate. His direction in the will that “ the principal must not be impaired ” refers only to the preservation of the corpus of the gift and not to its amount.</p>
