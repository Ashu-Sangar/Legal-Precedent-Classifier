Huth, who was a member of the board of directors and secretary of the company <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>at the time the resolution upon which the plaintiff relies was passed, was not present at the meeting when said resolution purports to have been adopted, and that he had no prior notice of such meeting.</p>

Huth as secretary and member of the board of directors, according to his own evidence, attended but two meetings of the board, one when the board was organized, and the other in the year 1903, when the capital stock of the company was increased to $100,000, and that at the meetings he attended he kept the minutes on slips of paper, which he turned over to the president of the board immediately thereafter, and the same were transcribed into the minute book which the plaintiff has brought into court by L. Thumm, who signed the same “ P. J. Huth, per Th.”; that at all the meetings of the board, save the two meetings last above mentioned, L. Thumm acted as secretary pro. tern, until he was elected the regular secretary of the board, and kept and recorded all of the minutes except those of one meeting, which, in 'his absence, were kept by Thomas C. Fry. After L. Thumm was elected secretary of the company, according to his testimony, and it seems to be undisputed, he continued to keep the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors in the same minute book, being the one offered by the plaintiff in this action. This book, according to the testimony, contains, among other matters, the minutes relative to the increase of the capital stock of the defendant company to $100,000, and it likewise contains the minutes of the meeting held on November 18, 1902, at which time a contract for the erection of the brewery was authorized and let, at the contract price of $281,350. L. Thumm continued to act as secretary of the company until some time in the month of October, 1901, when his successor was elected. From the evidence it appears that there were two rival factions in the brewing company, and that those who received the greater number of votes at <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>the October election, 1904, were not recognized by one of the factions, and that since that time litigation has been in progress for the purpose of requiring the former officers, including the said L. Thumm, to turn over the minute book and other books and papers of the corporation to their successors in office, and which said litigation at the time of the trial in this case was yet pending. L. Thumm has testified that in the month of October, 1904, he turned the minute book in question over to the corresponding secretary, the plaintiff in this action; that during the time he acted as secretary pro. tem. and as secretary of the company, he kept the said minute book at the office of the defendant company in Pittsburg, in the company’s safe.</p>

Wyss-Thalman, the plaintiff in this suit, has testified to the fact that the minute book was turned over to her by L. Thumm in October, 1904, and that she placed the same in the safe of the company, in the company’s office in the city of Pittsburg, where it has been kept ever since, the key of the safe remaining in her possession. L. Thumm has testified that he recorded the minutes correctly, and that they are all in his handwriting save the minutes of one meeting, which were kept by Thomas C. Fry ; that he has examined the book, and identifies it as the book in which he kept the minutes, and says that no alterations or changes, whatsoever, have been made in the minutes since the same were written by him. The plaintiff has testified that the minute book and the minutes therein remaining are the same as they ivere when the book was turned over to her in October, 1904.</p>

The plaintiff has offered evidence to show the reason why the book did not come into court in the regular way, to wit: that there was a dispute as to who was the lawful custodian of the minute book, and that there was litigation pending concerning such matter. The defendant has not denied the fact of the existence of such dispute, and no officer or stockholder of the company has denied the fact that the said book is the minute book of the defendant company.</p>

In accordance with the previous resolution the board of directors of the Beaver Valley Brewing Company met this Tuesday, November 18, 1902, in their office, in the Bissell Block, at 5:30 p. m., all directors being present except P. J. Huth, V. Wyss-Thalman presiding. The minutes of the previous meeting, held November 11, 1902, were read and approved. Motion made and duly seconded that Miss Fannie L. Wyss-Thalman be engaged as corresponding secretary at fifteen dollars per week, commencing from date, November 18, 1902. Carried.” This resolution appears to have been passed at the same meeting when the contract for the erection of the brewery of the defendant company was authorized.</p>

And one with knowledge or notice of the fact that a meeting of the board of directors was held without authority of law, cannot recover in a case where he has to depend for his recovery upon the action taken at such meeting. A corporation, however, will be estopped from denying the validity of its minutes, where one without notice or knowledge of the irregularity has entered into a contract with the corporation on faith of the minutes of its board of directors, and in good faith parted with his property, or rendered services of which the corporation received the benefit. In the case of Manhattan Hardware Co. v. Roland, <a href="/pa/128/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="128 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="567044" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0119-01">128 Pa. 119</a>, Mr. Justice McCoixtim, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, among other things, said: “In February, 1886, Roland, in good faith, loaned to the Manhattan Hardware Company $15,000 upon bond and mortgage. The mortgage was duly executed under the seal of the corporation, and was promptly recorded. It recites a resolution which appears upon the minutes of the corporation, authorizing it. The money secured by it was received by the company and used for its benefit. It is not alleged that any stockholder was ignorant of these transactions, or protested against them. The corporation cannot deny the accuracy of its own minutes as against a party who loaned it money on the faith of them.”</p>

Iluth, one of the directors, was not at the meeting of the board of directors when the resolution upon which the plaintiff relies was passed, and that he did not have any prior notice of such meeting. There is no evidence that prior to the time of the passage of the resolution in question, the plaintiff in this action was in the employ of the defendant company in any capacity, or that it was her business to give notice to members of the board of directors, or to any stockholder or officer of the company in relation to any matter whatsoever. There is no evidence upon the record that the plaintiff had any knowledge or notice of the fact that P. J. Iluth did not have sufficient and proper notice of the meeting of the board of directors at which the resolution upon which she relies was passed. Under the law, we do not think that it was her duty to make an investigation, <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>before entering upon the performance of her duties, to ascertain whether or not everything had been done by the officers of the defendant company to constitute a lawful directors’ meeting. Prior to the time of entering upon her employment she could have no concern with the minutes of the board of directors, and even after her employment the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors were such matters as were not under her control. She was justified in relying upon the validity of the resolution, without investigation. In the case of Manhattan Hardware Co. v. Phalen, <a href="/pa/128/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="128 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="567011" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0110-01">128 Pa. 110</a>, it was held that where the mortgage of a manufacturing corporation, executed under the corporate seal, reciting a resolution of the directors that it was unanimously authorized by the stockholders, the affidavit of defense to a scire facias thereon, averring that the mortgage was not authorized by the stockholders, and that no stockholders’ meeting had been called upon the subject, was insufficient to prevent summary judgment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b226-4" data-blocks='[["BL_226.4",226,[311,1242,1188,599]]]'>In the last mentioned case it was held that Phalen was not bound to inquire into the regularity of the proceedings leading up to the making of the mortgage, and that inasmuch as the company received Phalen’s money and got the benefit of it, the hardware company was estopped from denying the validity of the mortgage. In the present case, the jury evidently found that the plaintiff rendered the services for which she brought her suit; and as she was not required to look beyond the resolution employing her, we are of the opinion that the fact that P. J. Huth did not attend the meeting, and had no notice thereof, will not avail the defendant by way of defense to this action.</p>
