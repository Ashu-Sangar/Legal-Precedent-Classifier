Both parties to the suit claimed under Mrs. Margaret R. Nulton. The plaintiffs were her grandsons, and claimed under a devise in her will. The defendants Daniel L. Nulton, and Laura G., his wife, were the son and daughter-in-law of Mrs. Nulton, and claimed under an alleged parol sale made by her in consideration of services to be performed by them for her benefit. The question at issue, was whether there was such a sale or not. It appears from the evidence that the property in question was the homestead of Mrs. Nulton and her husband, John R. Nulton, prior to 1875. In that year Daniel L. Nulton, who was living with his parents, ivas married, and brought his wife to live with them. In 1878 the father died, and Daniel and his wife continued to live in the homestead with the mother. The defendants claim that after the father’s death, Mrs. Nulton gave them the homestead, in consideration of their agreement to take care of her during the remainder of her life; that Daniel was to attend to the business affairs of the mother, and the wife was to care for her in the house, and do the housekeeping. There was testimony tending to show that defendants were in possession of the premises in controversy from the time of the alleged sale until this suit was brought. The mother continued to reside at the homestead until September 17, 1902, when being ill, she was taken to the home of her daughter, Mrs. Wright, where she remained until her death in March, 1904. She was then in her ninetieth year. On February 1, 1893, Mrs. Nulton made a will, by which she gave to her son Daniel the homestead property in trust for <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>the use of himself and his wife during their lives, with remainder to his children and, in default of issue, to the issue of the testatrix’s other children. She also devised other real estate to her son Daniel. On June 13, 1899, she made a codicil to her will, by which she gave sixty-six feet of the lot to her son and his wife absolutely. On July 3, 1903, after she had removed to Mrs. Wright’s house, she made a new will, expressly revoking all former wills, by which she gave the homestead property absolutely to William Wright and George S. Wright, her grandsons, the present plaintiffs. This will was ratified by a codicil made on October 28, 1903.</p>
    <p id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.4",288,[270,926,1183,355]]]'>The defendants offered the original will and codicil in evidence as they stated, “ for the purpose of corroborating the parol gift and agreement proven by the defendants in this case, and as being a writing made by the donor subsequently to the parol gift and in pursuance thereof.” They were admitted subject to exception, and their admission forms the subject of the first and second assignments of error.</p>
    <p id="b288-6" data-blocks='[["BL_288.5",288,[267,1286,1187,649]]]'>The court submitted to the jury the question as to whether there was a parol gift as claimed, and whether defendants had performed their part of the agreement. The jury found for defendants, and judgment was entered on the verdict. The substance of the contention here made by the plaintiffs on appeal, is that defendants offered no evidence sufficient to prove title in them, and that the trial judge should have held as matter of law, that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. We have then to consider (1) whether the evidence offered by defendants was sufficient to establish a parol sale of the land, and (2) whether the revoked will and codicil were such writings as would take the alleged sale out of the statute of frauds.</p>

At the time the agreement was said to have been made, the homestead property had a frontage of 135 feet on Market street. Ho claim for all of this is made at the present time by defendants, nor did the contract specify how much of it was included. In Hart v. Carroll, <a href="/pa/85/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="85 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="440531" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0508-01">85 Pa. 508</a>, Justice Woodward, said (p. 510): <em>“ </em>In order to take a parol contract for the sale of lands out of the operation of the statute of frauds, its terms <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>must be shown by full, complete, satisfactory and indubitable proof. The evidence must define the boundaries and indicate the quantity of the land. It must fix the amount of the consideration. It must establish the fact that possession was taken in pursuance of the contract, and at or immediately after the time it was made, the fact that the change of possession was notorious, and the fact that it has been exclusive, continuous and maintained. And it must show performance or part performance by the vendee which could not be compensated in damages, and such as would make rescission inequitable and unjust. These rules have been settled by along series of authorities.” So also in Sample v. Horlacher, <a href="/pa/177/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="177 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="883598" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0247-01">177 Pa. 247</a>, it was held that an alleged parol sale from mother to son, where no boundaries were defined by the contract, was not an exception to the statute of frauds, although the son had entered into possession, and made improvements.</p>
    <p id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[143,1163,1185,1229]]]'>In the present case it appears that the defendants were clearly living upon the property before the alleged contract was made, and there was no visible change of possession in pursuance thereof. The subsequent possession was merely a continuation of that previously existing. This is not sufficient under the doctrine of Dougan v. Blocher, <a href="/pa/24/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="24 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="9502984" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0028-01">24 Pa. 28</a>, for it was there held that evidence of possession taken before the alleged parol contract, is not sufficient to establish part performance. Justice Woodward, said (p. 34): “ Possession, to be part performance, must be taken under and in pursuance of the contract, and it must be maintained as it is taken; and unless accompanied by such improvements and arrangements as will not reasonably admit of compensation in damages, is not, even when so taken and maintained, such part performance of a parol contract as will take it out of the statute of frauds.” And in Christy v. Barnhart, <a href="/pa/14/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="14 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="405987" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0260-01">14 Pa. 260</a>, Justice Bell said : “ It is not to be disputed, at this time of day, that to withdraw a parol sale of lands from the blighting effects of the statute of frauds, there must be an open and absolute possession taken in pursuance of the contract, with a view to the performance of it. It is consequently a settled rule that a parol sale to a tenant in possession is within the statute, though his possession be afterwards continued, because there is no change of possession, in execution of the contract.”</p>

      <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>It further appears from the evidence in this case that whatever the character of the possession of the property was, which the vendees had subsequent to the parol sale, it was not exclusive, but was exercised jointly with the mother. This does not meet the test laid down by the decisions. For instance, in Chadwick v. Felt, <a href="/pa/35/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="35 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="990417" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0305-01">35 Pa. 305</a>, the court below affirmed the point submitted by the plaintiff, “ that the position necessaiy to take a parol contract for the purchase of land out of. the prohibition of the statute must be one taken and maintained under and in pursuance of the contract, and must be exclusive in the vendee.” Also one that if the vendee was in possession of the land in controversy prior to the alleged parol contract, “ and his subsequent occupancy was a mere continuance thereof, his purchase lacked an essential to give it validity as a parol contract.” Justice Strong said (p. 307): “ The points propounded by the plaintiff below were in strict accordance with the law, as it has repeatedly been declared in this court, and the court of common pleas could do nothing else than affirm them.”</p>
    <p id="b290-5" data-blocks='[["BL_290.4",290,[273,1323,1184,289]]]'>And again in Bowers v.

As this court said, in Ackerman v. Fisher, <a href="/pa/57/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="57 Pa. 457" data-case-ids="1010398" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0457-01">57 Pa. 457</a>: “ In such a case it has more than once been said that clearer and stronger evidence is required of the father’s intention to part with his dominion over, and ownership of, the property than is required in cases of parol contracts between strangers in blood. This is because a parent and child do not commonly deal with each other as they deal with strangers. . . . When an attempt is made to set up a parol contract of sale against a father, either by his son or one claiming under the son, the evidence of the contract must be direct, positive, express and unambiguous. Hot only must the terms and conditions of the contract and its subject be well and clearly defined, but it has been held that the .contracting par<a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>ties must be brought together face to face. The witnesses must have heard the bargain when it was made, or must have heard the parties repeat it in each other’s presence. A contract is not to be inferred from the declarations of one of the parties.” This case is followed with approval in Edwards v. Morgan, <a href="/pa/100/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="100 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="498449" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0330-01">100 Pa. 330</a>; Burgess v.

    <p id="b291-6" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[159,949,1182,444]]]'>With regard to the second question here involved, as to the sufficiency of the will of 1893 to take the contract out of the statute of frauds, it will be noted that this action of ejectment was brought to recover possession of a lot of ground with a frontage of fifty-eight feet on Market street, and a depth of 112.5 feet. It is marked No. 2 on the plan attached to Mrs. Multon’s will, by which it was devised to plaintiffs. The will describes it as having thereon the house in which testatrix had resided.</p>

    <p id="b291-8" data-blocks='[["BL_291.7",291,[161,1718,1182,456]]]'>By the will of 1893 she devised to Daniel L. Multon a lot of sixty-six feet and one of forty-nine feet, both fronting on Market street, and the latter containing the homestead. The former is claimed by appellant to have been part of the homestead property, and Barclay Multon testified to that effect. These lots were devised to, Daniel L. Multon, not absolutely, but in trust for the use of himself during life and to his wife, if she survived him, during widowhood, with remainder to the grandchildren of testatrix.</p>
    <p id="b291-9" data-blocks='[["BL_291.8",291,[164,2181,1179,250]],["BL_292.1",292,[292,370,1182,296]]]'>By the codicil of 1899, exhibit “ 6,” the first lot, sixty-six feet in front, was given absolutely to Daniel L. Multon and Laura Multon, his wife. On July 23, 1903, Mrs. Multon conveyed for a nominal consideration this lot to Daniel L. Multon, who on the same day conveyed it to his wife. This lot is <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>not included in the present suit. The will of 1893 also provided that, in addition to the forty-nine feet devised to Daniel L. JSTulton, he was to have an alleyway adjoining such lot, the width not being specified. His counsel claim that it was to be at least nine feet, which would make the fifty-eight feet included in the writ.</p>

    <p id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[290,936,1184,445]]]'>1. All the witnesses agree that Mrs. JSTulton stated that she had given the homestead to both Daniel and his wife, and they now claim to hold it as tenants by entireties, which would be the result of such a gift. But the devise in the will was to Daniel L. JSTulton alone. It was not absolute, but in trust for certain purposes. He was given the use of it for life, with use to his wife during widowhood, if she survived him. This was an entirely different estate from that claimed under the parol contract.</p>
    <p id="b292-6" data-blocks='[["BL_292.6",292,[290,1397,1184,452]]]'>2. The consideration for the parol sale was the agreement of Daniel and his wife to care for Mrs. JSTulton, her business and her household affairs during the remainder of her life. But no such consideration appears in the will. On the contrary, the will states another and entirely different consideration. It says: “ In consideration that my son Daniel L. JSTulton shall and will undertake and continue to execute personally the trust hereby committed to him, he shall be allowed the free use,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b292-7" data-blocks='[["BL_292.7",292,[291,1857,1182,458]]]'>It is manifest upon the face of the will, that the testatrix did not intend to give Daniel L. JSTulton and Laura G. JSTulton an estate by entireties in the property devised, or to give them any interest in consideration of their agreement to care for her and her business. The will, therefore, cannot be construed as a memorandum in writing of the alleged contract under which appellees claim, and it should not have been admitted in evidence. It had no force beyond that of a testamentary paper which has been revoked by a subsequent will.</p>
    <p id="b292-8" data-blocks='[["BL_292.8",292,[290,2321,1180,97]],["BL_293.1",293,[147,383,1183,300]]]'>3. In addition, the will is inconsistent with the contention that a parol gift was made by Mrs. JSTulton. By the will she <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>asserts ownership of the property claimed to have been previously given by her to her son and daughter-in-law, and undertakes to dispose of it in a different way from the disposition alleged to have been made by parol. So the will, instead of establishing a parol contract, negatives the claim that it was written in pursuance of such a contract.</p>
