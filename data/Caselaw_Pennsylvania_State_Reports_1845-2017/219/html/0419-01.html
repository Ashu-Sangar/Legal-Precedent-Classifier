We have some evidence that he paid bills, but where a man is living in his wife’s house and his wife has property or money and she chooses to pay the bills, and he does not pay any bills, that is not a neglect or refusal to provide for his wife, because his wife has as much right to give him the rent of a house, or to give him the groceries or things he eats as she has to give him anything else, and the presumption would be that if she did that she was giving them to him, and therefore there is no neglect or refusal on his part to provide. The question would, therefore, be as to what took place after that time, and I imagine there is very little difference between the questions as to whether he neglected to provide for her and whether he deserted her, because if he deserted her, of course he didn’t provide for her, and if what he did was not a desertion, and she claimed the right and undertook to stay where she pleased, without going with him, then he would not be bound to provide for her. So substantially the question is all one, whether or not he deserted her after this date in September.] [20]</p>

Under clause (e) of sec. 5 of the evidence Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, no person whose interest shall be adverse to the right of a deceased party shall be a competent witness to any matter occurring before the death of such party. The exception in the same section, “ unless the issue or inquiry be devisavit vel non, or be any other issue or inquiry respecting the property of a deceased owner, and the controversy be between parties respectively claiming such property by devolution on the death of such owner, in which case all persons shall be fully competent witnesses,” does not apply. The husband here claimed by devolution of law, that is, as tenant by the curtesy, an estate by descent, Cooke v. Doron, <a href="/pa/215/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="215 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="948399" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0393-01">215 Pa. 393</a>, while the plaintiff claimed under the wife’s will, that is, by purchase. He therefore stood in her place, and the husband’s claim was adverse to her title which the plaintiff represented. Had the plaintiff claimed as heir or next of kin he would have claimed by devolution as the husband did, and both would have been competent witnesses under the exception quoted.

All the testimony given, even if the offers which were rejected should be included, show nothing more than quarrels, dissatisfaction with, the presence of the husband’s children by a former marriage, payment by the wife of many if not most of the bills, and other causes of dissension, but all of these together fall far short of showing desertion. The plain result of the whole was to show that the wife being dissatisfied with the domestic situation, preferred to live apart, and therefore left the husband. The judge in a careful and elaborate charge submitted the question to the jury. He might well have directed a verdict for defendant.</p>
