The justice copied the will from a form in the handwriting of the beneficiary who was present in the room when the will was executed and told the testatrix, who was palsied, to take her time and write carefully. The form was explained by showing that it was an exact copy, except as to names, etc., of the will of testatrix’s former husband, from whom she had derived her property, and which she kept by her, among her important papers. There was evidence that the beneficiary was of a domineering disposition, controlled the testatrix, interfered with her affairs, and kept other relatives away. On the other hand, it appeared, without contradiction that the beneficiary was a niece of the testatrix, daughter of a favorite sister of the whole blood; that she was invited to live with testatrix, and after her mother’s death was intrusted with household duties and took care of her aunt from that time. It also appeared that the testatrix lived for two years and a half after the making of the will, showed it to at least one friend and told why she had made it, and had abundant opportunity to have destroyed or changed it if she had desired. <em>Held, </em>that the court committed no error in setting aside a verdict against the will.</p>
