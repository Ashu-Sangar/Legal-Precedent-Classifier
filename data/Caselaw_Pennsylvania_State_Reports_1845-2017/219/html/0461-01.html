    <p id="b495-6" data-blocks='[["BL_495.8",495,[97,1254,1184,1018]]]'>It appears that a division in the state organization of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics arose in Pennsylvania during the year 1900, resulting in the formation of two factions. On October 2, 1900, Duquesne Lodge, No. 110, by formal resolution, declared its adherence to the faction of the state council, headed by S. B. Woods. The other faction recognized Wobensmith. Duquesne Council refused to pay to the state council organization, headed by Wobensmith, certain per capita taxes, and, for that reason, on August 22, 1901, the state council, acting in accordance with its constitution and by-laws, suspended the Duquesne council from the privileges of membership, and on January 6, 1903, revoked its charter for the same reason. On May 10, 1904, in quo warranto proceedings in court of common pleas, No. 4, of Philadelphia county, it was adjudged that the officers, headed by Wobensmith, were the legal officers of the state council, and that the Woods faction, to which the Duquesne council had given its adherence, was not entitled to the offices. This decree was not appealed from, and it is conceded that it has settled that controversy.</p>

Defendants tendered all the effects demanded except a sum of money contributed for sick and funeral benefits, and which was shown to have amounted on January 6, 1903, when the charter was revoked, to «$2,031.18. The present bill was filed to compel the defendants to account for and pay over this fund to the state council. While the prayers of the bill are drawn to cover all property and effects of the Duquesne council, the controversy between the parties is only as to the fund in question.</p>

It does not appear that the state council had any plan or arrangement for the collection or payment of any sick or funeral benefits. All the beneficial features of that nature were left to the care of the local councils. This fund in question was made up entirely from the voluntary contributions of the members of the local council, placed in the hands of its trustees, to be disbursed by them for the benefit of the sick and the families of the dead of its members. With the control and administration of this fund the state council does not seem to have had anything to do. The authorities amply sustain the contention that funds raised by the members of subordinate bodies of this character, for sick and <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>funeral benefits, belong to the subordinate association, and are to be distributed by them to the parties for whose use and benefit they were contributed. It is held that the revocation of the charter of a subordinate body by the supreme body cannot have the effect of confiscating the property owned absolutely by the local body.</p>

In such cases considerations of public policy will always prevail. In mere matters of discipline, where no property right is involved, the decisions of the superior organization, if regularly rendered and not intentionally unjust, will be regarded as final. . . . Forfeiture of the conventional charter of a society incorporated by the state will not divest its property, nor can the property be affected by a secession of part of its members. Even if unincorporated, the majority of a society have generally the right to cut loose from a superior governing body, <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>and the minority have no redress if the property is used for the general purpose for which it was acquired:” 1 Bacon on Benefit Societies (1904), sec. 116.</p>
    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[277,519,1188,966]]]'>Does the Act of June 20, 1883, P. L. 132, change in any way the application of this principle in Pennsylvania? We think not. It does not attempt to divest any property rights, and if it did it would be unconstitutional. When properly construed, we think it is intended to provide for the disposal of such property as belonged to the subordinate lodge as a whole and which in case of dissolution of the association, would belong to no one, as it was held in common by the membership of the local body, while in existence. We see no indication that it was intended to reach a special trust fund, contributed for a special local purpose, and for the benefit only of the sick, and the families of deceased members of the local council. But be that as it may, and without expressly deciding that point, it is clear that the act does expressly provide that whatever property is transferred, shall be taken and held upon the same trusts, and for the same purpose and intents for which it was received and held by the subordinate association, so that in any event it would in this case have to be held for the purpose for which created.</p>

As the learned trial judge says,, there is neither averment nor proof that any part of the fund was paid to any of these defendants, so the bill was properly dismissed for that reason. The action of the court below is also vindicated by another reason suggested in the opinion. That is, the fund has already been distributed to the parties for whom it was contributed, and who would ultimately be entitled to it. They cannot be paid a second time, and therefore to allow a recovery here, would be to divert the fund from the purposes of the trust, and this would not only be in violation of the terms of the act of 1883, but of the constitutional provisions as to property rights. The fund was created in good faith at a time when the subordinate council was in good standing, to be paid out as sick and funeral benefits to its own members; and as a fact it was paid out in good faith to the persons, and for the pur<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>poses for which it was contributed, prior to the decision of the court which determined that it was in allegiance to the wrong faction. It will not do to say that such payment was void. We agree with the court below, that under the facts of the case the payments so made should be approved by a court of equity. To hold otherwise would be to say that equity should do an inequitable thing.</p>
