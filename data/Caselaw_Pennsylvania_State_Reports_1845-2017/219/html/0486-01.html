Hogg, this decedent, both of Pittsburg, partners doing business as Totten <em>&amp; </em>Company, in the Massachusetts courts for the purpose of recovering $16,000 damages for an alleged breach of a contract.

The effect of the transfer by Totten to Hogg of the former’s interest in the firm assets was to convert them into the individual property of the latter, and if he did covenant with Totten to pay the firm’s debts, which, however, is not admitted in the answers, no trust was created; but it was only a personal covenant which could be enforced by Totten alone. Moreover, it appears that when the assets of the firm were assigned to the decedent that both Totten and the firm were insolvent, and that the decedent expended more than their value in the payment of the firm’s debts; the partnership was then dissolved, and as its assets were applied to the payment of its debts, there never were any in the executors’ hands to be applied to the payment of the petitioner’s judgment, if it be valid as against firm assets.</p>
