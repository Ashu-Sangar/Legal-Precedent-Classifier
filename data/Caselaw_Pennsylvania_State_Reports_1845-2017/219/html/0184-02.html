Knight, the testator, has in express words given his wife the right, if she so desires, to sell his farm, and to invest the proceeds in other farming land, it will not be seriously questioned that the will does create a present power to sell, and as there is nothing in the will fixing either the time or manner of sale, we are of opinion that the widow would have the right to sell the farm at such times as she might think best, and either as a whole, or in parcels, as she might deem best for the best interest of the whole estate.</p>

And it is difficult to perceive how it could practically be otherwise. Reinvestments are eminently matters for the exercise of sound discretion. The failure of a due exercise of such discretion may involve the trustee in direct personal liability for a breach of trust. To coerce precipitate action by the trustee may be most deleterious to the trust fund; while to keep the purchaser in a state of suspended liability, until such reinvestment is properly made and duly secured according to the terms of the trust, would embarrass, if not totally nullify the whole power to sell: ” Dalzell v.
