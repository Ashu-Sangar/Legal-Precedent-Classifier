The stone and cement so disclaimed and other stone and cement not claimed was thereafter sold by the sheriff and purchased by plaintiff.

      <em>“ </em>The director reserves the right to accept or reject any or all stone for want of conformity with these specifications at any time previous to its being finally accepted and paid for in full by the city, notwithstanding that it may have previously passed inspection.”</p>

The expression, “ stored as required by the director,” enabled the city to require such disposition of rejected material as would free the premises and prevent use of rejected material in the construction of the reservoir.</p>

Delivery does not consist in the mere transfer of location or custody of the property. The agreement that the material should be inspected and condemned for want of conformity to the specifications implied that if not of a quality which would pass inspection, Clark Sons Company <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>was not obliged to accept. Until accepted by the city, no right of property vested in Clark Sons Company, nor was the company responsible, under the terms of the contract, for its price. The passing of the title to specific chattels depends upon the intention of the parties to be derived from the contract. There must be the minds of both parties concurring in the transfer, the intent of one to deliver and the other to receive.</p>

If condemned, the right of the property remained in the subcontractor, and no obligation rested upon the contractor to either accept the material or pay therefor. It was not denied by defendant that the material had been condemned, but it was contended that the city, on annulment of the contract between the city and Clark Sons Company, became entitled to all material in and about the work.</p>

The defendant company had notice of plaintiff’s claim, and in disregard of such notice appropriated and used the material in the construction of the reservoir.</p>

The property in controversy was furnished by Gianini, a subcontractor, to be used in the construction of a reservoir, under an agreement with the principal contractor, a corporation, that all materials •furnished by him should be subject to approval by the director of public works. The property was inspected and rejected and afterwards sold by the sheriff as the property of Gianini. The corporation was not required to accept materials that did not pass inspection by the director of public works and it did not accept these. It had no claim to them and made none, and the defendant, in carrying out th'e contract to protect its interest as surety for the contractor, acquired no right to the property.</p>
    <p id="b638-9" data-blocks='[["BL_638.10",638,[307,1659,489,44]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
