The statement also showed that the defendant had received the assets, and paid the debts of the limited partnership provided by the contract, and for nine years had paid interest to the plaintiff on his share. An affidavit of defense was filed by a person who stated that he was secretary and treasurer of the defendant, to the effect, that neither the defendant nor its officers, naming certain officers, but not the president, had any knowledge of the transaction, except what was shown in defendant’s books, and that they had no knowledge of, nor did they authorize the written contract of sale. The affidavit denied that defendant had entered into said contract, and that the president executed it on behalf of the defendant. There was no allegation, however, as to when the officers named had become officers of the company; there was no specific denial that the plaintiff was paid interest; and no denial that a reasonable time had elapsed within which to make payment. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit of defense was insufficient to prevent judgment.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[112,1112,1184,610]]]'>Undoubtedly it was a contract of sale. By no possible construction of the language used can it be hold that the defendant was merely the agent of the plaintiff and his associates to sell said assets and then account for the proceeds. It is true no time is fixed for payment, but then the law adds that payment shall be made “ within a reasonable time under all circumstances,” and there is no denial of the plaintiff’s averment that a reasonable time has elapsed. The plain meaning is that it was a sale, and payment was to be made within a reasonable time ; but, if the assets were sooner converted, then payment was to be sooner made, and the defendant thereby relieved from further payments of interest.</p>

None that we can discover. That paper (a transcript of defendant’s books), sets forth that the entry is “ to make transfer to our books of purchase of plaiting machines,” etc., belonging to the Standard Plaiter Company, Ltd., and of patents belonging to C. O. Emmons personally, “ made as of April 27, 1895,” which is the date of the agreement, exhibit “ A.” The paper further states that, “ Above accounts are to be paid as rapidly as Plaiter merchandise is sold, irrespective of expense of selling, commencing with Standard Plaiter Company account, and thereafter in order named.” This is the order of payment, which it is not denied was designated by the stock<a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>holders of the Standard Plaiter Company, Ltd., shortly after the paper, exhibit “ A,” was signed. It is evident that the party who made the above entry upon defendant’s book had before him the contract, exhibit “ A,” and also the designation of the order of payment. Whilst there are some differences in the amounts due some of the parties, yet there is no difference in the amount due the plaintiff, and there is no denial that the amount of his claim is $3,449.33.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[255,764,1191,653]]]'>The difference between $20,000 and $16,900, the amount to be paid for these assets, or $3,100, is probably what was to be paid Emmons for his patents, as named in exhibit “ C.” The difference between $5,690, debts of the Standard Plaiter Company, Ltd., and $5,123.75, the amount actually paid, or $566.25, is probably discounts upon these debts. It will be observed that two of the stockholders, mentioned in exhibit “A,” to wit: Mrs. J. M. Emmons, $995, and L. M. Peed, $663.35, have dropped out of exhibit “ C.” Probably they transferred their claims to Charles C. Emmons. If all the aforesaid amounts are added to the amount stated in exhibit “ A ” as due Charles O. Emmons, $4,709.32, the aggregate will be $10,033.92, the amount stated to be due him in exhibit “.C.”</p>

But the important facts are, that there is no denial of the amount of plaintiff’s claim, that the papers show the contract was one of sale and not of agency, and that there is no denial that a reasonable time has elapsed within which to make payment. We think that exhibit “ C ” and the admissions referred to amount to a ratification on the part of defendant of the contract, exhibit “ A.”</p>
