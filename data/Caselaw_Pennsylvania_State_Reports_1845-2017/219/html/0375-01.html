A claim of respondent to a contingent right upon the death of the life tenant, who is averred to be a person different from the petitioner although it refers to the future, is still a present dispute of the title by which the petitioner holds possession, and is therefore within the act.</p>

The argument of appellant is that the plaintiff’s present right of possession and her possession in fact are not disputed, the appellant’s claim being only to a contingent right upon the death of Keefer whom she avers to be the life tenant. <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>But this though it refers to the future is still a present dispute of the title by which the plaintiff holds possession and is, therefore, within the act. “ What the party in possession needs and what the act gives him is the right to a present adjudication of his title:” Canal Co. v.

In general the better practice is to make the petitioner the defendant in analogy to ejectment where the party in possession is not called on to disclose his title until he knows by whom and on what grounds it is attacked.

It may well be as argued by appellant that some cases will be found to present difficulties in the application of the statute, but these are not likely to be insuperable. It is a remedial act with great elasticity under the control of the courts and the increasing resort to it shows the general judgment of the profession that it is effective as well as convenient. It should be construed and applied in furtherance of this view.</p>
