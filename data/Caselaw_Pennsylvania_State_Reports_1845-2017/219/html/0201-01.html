Such proceedings should be dismissed because of insufficient proof of fraud; of the lapse of time; of the death of the guardian and trustee; of the presumption of settlement and consequent bar by the statute; and of the petitioner's laches.</p>

Hopkins her executor. Hopkins subsequently became a trustee of the property left in trust by the will, and also thereafter a guardian of Edward Rahm, Jr., a son of Virginia Rahm. Edward Rahm, Jr., became of age on June 27,1881. Shortly thereafter Hopkins filed his final account as guardian, and made settlement with his ward. In 1905, Edward Rahm, Jr., filed a petition for a citation to the Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Company, ancillary administrator of the estate of James H. Hopkins, deceased. He claimed that Hopkins, as executor, trustee and guardian, had omitted from his accounts securities aggregating in value $31,512.56.'</p>
