The photographs in this case show a railing. According to the testimony it was up away from the step nine inches, the amount of projection of the cement wall. It was easily reached, and was put there for the purpose of protecting people from falling from the steps, and also a hand rail. The plaintiff recognized that and took hold of it. He gives no good excuse why he let go of it, why he did not continue to protect himself by that rail. He stepped to the middle and walked down until he was within four or five steps of the first landing when the very thing happened to him which he feared, and which he had every reason to expect. In that <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>he was, to my mind, plainly guilty of negligence. The only excuse he gives was that he could not continue to hold the rail on account of the spikes which he said projected half an inch above the rail. They are shown on these various pictures, and shown to be far enough apart to take hold, but he does not say that there was anything dangerous about them, simply that they caught his glove; he does not say they prevented him from taking hold, or even taking hold of the grill work below the rail.</p>

    <p id="b659-8" data-blocks='[["BL_659.10",659,[125,1358,1182,457]]]'>The plaintiff, coming to the stairway leading to tho station, found a hand rail plainly intended for the convenience and safety of persons descending. He recognized the purpose and the usefulness of the rail by taking hold of it at first, but then, finding his glove caught in some projecting points or knobs on the rail, he let go of it and took the middle of the steps although he knew they were slippery with ice. Thus, to avoid what was, at most, an inconvenience, he voluntarily encountered a manifest danger. He thus took upon himself the risk.</p>
