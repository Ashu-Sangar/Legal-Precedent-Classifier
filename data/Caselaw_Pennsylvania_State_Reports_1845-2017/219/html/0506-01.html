Such a memorandum is not a part of the res geste, but is a secret act of the defendant of which the plaintiff had no notice, and could not be supposed to have acquiesced in by silence.</p>

The cases where such declarations or memoranda become evidence are where the claim is challenged as an afterthought and it becomes material to show that it was, as it purports to be, cotemporary with the transaction.</p>
