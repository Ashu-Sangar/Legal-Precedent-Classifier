In this manner the creditors were deprived of their share of the assets which of right they were entitled to. And the next morning after the sale, Eichards, the purchaser of all the personal property set forth in the appraisement, excepting the pig, turned the property over to the administratrix without having removed any of it from the place where it was sold or paying any money over to the administratrix, and without receiving any profit from the transaction. Eichards, who was present at the audit, was not called to explain this transaction. The auditor is of opinion that it was the duty of the administratrix to call him as a witness to explain his connection with this sale, and her failure to do so, in connection with the other testimony, satisfies the auditor that there was an agreement between them by which he was to purchase the property for her.</p>

The circumstances of the sale were such that the auditor drew the inference that it was in violation of the rule that a trustee may not buy at his own sale. There was evidence to sustain this view and the finding having been approved by the court we can only disturb it for clear error, which has not been shown.</p>
