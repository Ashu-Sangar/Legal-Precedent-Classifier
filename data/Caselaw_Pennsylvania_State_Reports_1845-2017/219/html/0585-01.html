Semple and William Semple, which prevents the plaintiff from making a good and marketable title for the lands described in the agreement or contract of sale, the specific performance of which is sought. Under the will of William Semple there was bequeathed to James Semple, in trust for Robert S. Semple, seven forty-fifths of the estate of the testator, including the land in question, in trust to manage the said portion and pay the income and profits or so much of the principal as the trustee in his discretion should think fit, and at the death of Robert S. Semple to pay over the portion to the children of Robert living at his death, or in default of issue living at the death of Robert S. Semple, to the children and heirs of the testator, share and share alike, James M. and William Semple being two of such heirs. Robert S. Semple was not made a party to the proceedings in partition, nor was it necessary that he should be made a party. His interest could be and was represented by his trustee, who took the whole legal estate: Hutchison’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/82/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="82 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1047981" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0509-01">82 Pa. 509</a>; Phelps v. Townsley, <a href="/mass/92/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="92 Mass. 554" data-case-ids="2116944" data-case-paths="/mass/92/0554-01">92 Mass. 554</a>; Rules of Supreme Court in Equity, 23rd Rule. Hor was it necessary to appoint a trustee to represent the interest of the unborn children of Robert Semple. The estate given to James M. Semple, trustee, was a devise of the whole legal estate, because the estate is given to him and his heirs and appointees with the right to dispose of the an<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>nual income and such portion of the principal as the trustee in his uncontrolled discretion should think fit, and he could maintain a bill in partition for the purpose of having the trust estate set aside in severalty. This case seems to us to differ from the case of Holmes v. Woods, <a href="/pa/168/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="168 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="868547" data-case-paths="/pa/168/0530-01">168 Pa. 530</a>, in that the whole legal estate having passed to James Semple, and he having been made a party representing that entire legal estate, 'he necessarily represented the interest of the unborn children. He then, too, as the holder of the legal title could have maintained partition for the purpose , of having the interest set aside in severalty. In Hutchison’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/82/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="82 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1047981" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0509-01">82 Pa. 509</a>, the petition for partition was dismissed because those holding the equitable title sought partition and thereby deprived the holder of the legal estate of his title and control and prevented him from performing the duties placed, upon him by the will. The converse of his proposition is therefore true, that the holder of the legal estate may without interference on the part of his cestui que trust, or those having a contingent interest, for the better performance of-his trust, have partition in order to have the interest set aside in severalty. We know of no case refusing partition to the holder of whole legal estate. To admit the cestui que trust or a trustee for the unborn children, would,' if it is necessary to make them parties, bring them in where they would have the right to and might do the very thing prohibited by the case of Hutchison’s Appeal, that is, strip the holder of the legal estate of all the power and duties placed on him by the testator. James Semple, trustee, having authority, then, and full power to appear and represent the interests of the cestui que trust and the unborn children of Robert under the devise to Robert S. Semple, and having accepted, chosen and taken in severalty certain purparts, all contingent interests were taken away from the property in controversy in this case and became attached to the other purparts chosen by James Semple in the partition proceedings: Merklein v. Trapnell, <a href="/pa/34/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="34 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="417980" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0042-01">34 Pa. 42</a>. But James M. Semple and William Semple were not necessary parties to the bill in partition because their interest had been taken from them by the judicial sale of their interests upon the executions upon judgments obtained against them. The interest of James M. Semple in the real estate, and his contingent interest in the por<a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>tion of the devise to .Tamos'Semple in trust for Robert S. Semple, were seized upon by the sheriff and sold and became vested in Robert Cartwright. The same is said of the interest of William Semple in the real estate and his contingent interest under the devise to Robert Semple, which was seized by the sheriff upon a proper judgment and conveyed to John D. Brown, trustee. Were authority necessary to sustain the position that the contingent interest can be sold at sheriff’s sale we have it in the very old case of Roe v. Humphreys, <a href="/yeates/1/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Yeates 427" data-case-ids="6776047" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0427-01">1 Yeates, 427</a>; the case of Drake v.

Under these authorities, then, and under the findings of fact that the sheriff did levy upon and seize all the right, title, interest and claim of James M. Semple and William Semple in the land in question, there can be but one conclusion — that they had no further interest in those lands and that their complete title to them passed to Cartwright and Brown, and therefore the subsequent proceedings in partition by the master’s sale gave to Thomas Kenyon, the plaintiff, an estate in fee simple in the lands described in the first paragraph of the bill, and he holds those lands by good and marketable title, which he can convey to the defendant. A decree should, therefore, be drawn in accordance with the conclusions found above.</p>
