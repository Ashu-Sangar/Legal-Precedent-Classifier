    <p class="summary" id="b219-11" data-blocks='[["BL_219.16",219,[136,1306,1182,652]]]'>On June 13, 1906, a contract was executed between these parties, whereby George Emerick agreed to convey to Harvey Emerick an undivided one-half interest in a certain tract of land in Canoe township, containing forty-seven and one-half acres, which was formerly the property of John Emerick, deceased, for the consideration therein named, and the said Harvey Emerick agreed to pay said consideration to the said George Emerick, if he had a fee simple interest in the undivided one-half interest which he proposed to convey. This conveyance depends upon the construction of the will of John Emerick, who died March 28, 1891, and whose will was admitted to probate on June 8, 1891. The clauses of the will to be construed are as follows:</p>

Second. I give and bequeath to my daughter Kate (Collket) ten dollars. Third that that the said H. Emerick &amp; G.

    <p class="summary" id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[257,612,1194,456]]]'>In arriving at a proper construction, we must first ascertain the intention of the. testator and, in finding this intention, we. must be governed by the language of the will. The language of devise is “ I give and bequeath my land or farm to my two sons Harvey Emerick and George Emerick, in trust to make their living and to their children after them.” The word “ children ” is a word of purchase and not of limitation and must be so construed, since it is not clear that the grantor used it as intending to use it in the sense of heirs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[257,1074,1185,188]]]'>We have searched this will to ascertain whether testator by any expression therein, indicated any intention, other than that expressed by literal words used, and find nothing to aid us.</p>
