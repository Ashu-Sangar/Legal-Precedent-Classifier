By an act of assembly which requires that a contract of a married woman for the sale of her separate real estate shall not be binding unless acknowledged by her she escapes performance, her husband, J. T. Willard, being called upon by the other party to the contract to perform his part thereof. When once the option is accepted within the optionary period, which is not denied, a party is bound to perform his written contract unless he could show some failure on the part of the other party to the contract that would release him. The only point raised by him for which he claimed he should be released from performing this contract is that the written notice, served upon him and his wife, dated June 28, 1900, is addressed alone “to Emma R. Willard;” but this notice Throckmorton, the party who served it, testi<a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>fies was read to the husband and wife, and a copy left with them at their residence on the date mentioned. It referred to “ the option given by you to W. S. Throckmorton, dated July 8, 1899, and assigned by him to me for the sale of your coal, etc.,” and further stipulated that he, Thompson, would have survey made and “ will make abstract of title and prepare a deed as promptly as possible, you to furnish me your title papers, plots, etc., at once or send same to my attorney at Waynesburg, Pa.,” verbally informing them of the name of the attorney. Here was a written notice within the time of the acceptance of the coal embraced in the option in which the husband and wife had joined. The purpose of the notice in writing to purchase was clearly made known to the parties to this option, and was such a notice under the contract as would hold Thompson to a specific performance of his contract as to the entire acreage embraced in said option. The said W. S. Throckmorton, who served said notice upon the date it purports to be served, testified that when he served the notice upon the Willards, both husband and wife, that when asked why Emma R. Willard’s name alone appeared in said notice, replied that said notice was intended for both of them. This the Willards deny in their answer and deny on the stand, but the weight of the evidence is in favor of the contention on that point by Throckmorton. There was admittedly a copy of this notice left at the house of the Willards, the original being brought away by Throckmorton, and this explains the son of the Willards saying he found the notice lying upon the table after his departure.</p>
