In order to be assured of this, as well as to assist his wife and daughter with their baggage, he entered the train with them, informing the brakeman as he was about to enter that he himself was not going away, but only his wife and daughter. Quite a number of others boarded the train at the Butler station. The plaintiff, his wife and daughter, entered the coach at the rear end and walked the length of the car, about seventy-six feet, to the stateroom, which was located at the front end of the coach. After seeing his wife and daughter safely located in their room the suggestion was made to him by someone that the train was starting or about to start, and that he had better get off, which he proceeded to do. The plaintiff testifies as follows: “ Well, Mrs. Purvis, when I said that I guessed everything is all right, she says, ‘ Mow hurry and get offand Mr. Haworth says, ‘Yes, I guess the train is in motion and the conductor was standing right alongside of me.”</p>

The action of the court was, on writ of error, affirmed, and while the act of the plaintiff, in alighting from the train at the side door, was a prominent feature of the case, yet the Supreme Court, in its opinion, <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>says: “Neither the language of the conductor while she stood in the side door, nor the assistance he gave her in alighting, nor both combined, charged the company with responsibility for the consequences of her careless act. ...

On discovering his mistake he said to an employee on the train, “ Stop, please, and let me off; I want to go to New York,” and received the reply, “We cannot stop this train, step over on your left side and jump off; we are going slow.” He jumped off, and in doing so was injured and, having brought suit against the company, a compulsory nonsuit was entered. On appeal to the Supreme Court the action of the court below in refusing to take off the nonsuit was affirmed. The court says : “ The sole attempted extenuation of the act lies in the conversation with the person called by the plaintiff a trainman, but whether the person was the conductor of the train, a brakeman or a Pullman car porter does not appear. It does appear, however, that he did not order the plaintiff to jump from the car, and that what he said amounted at most to a suggestion or expression of opinion that he might do so.”</p>

In the case at bar the plaintiff alighted from the moving train because it was his fixed purpose to do so. When asked the question on cross-examination, “You intended to get off?” he answered, <em>“ </em>Certainly, that was what I was there for.” That he realized the danger of doing so is evident from his further testimony wherein he says: <em>“ Y </em>es, I remember when 1 was running down the aisle of thinking, now, I must be careful and get off towards the engine, and that is the way I jumped.” The language of the brakeman, “ Hurry up and get off,” did not impel the plaintiff to do so against his will. It did not even suggest to him that he jump off, but simply hastened him in doing that which he purposed doing in any event. It amounted to no more than an expression of opinion on part of the brakeman that he could get off the moving train if he did so quickly. Ho constraint was put upon plaintiff. He was not impelled to do that which he would not otherwise have done. The very fact, as testified to by plaintiff, that his own purpose was to alight from the train, negatives the idea of any outside constraint or direction. The language of the brakeman at most but suggested haste in that which plaintiff already purposed doing. But, as said in Deery v. Railroad Co., 163 Ba. 403, “ In such case something more is required to render the company liable than its employee’s consent to the passenger’s negligent act.” The brakeman’s language wras not responsible for the plaintiff’s initiative, nor did it excuse the exercise of his own judgment.</p>

    <p id="b233-4" data-blocks='[["BL_233.6",233,[163,589,1180,544]]]'>This is a hard case and appellant’s counsel has presented a very able argument to take it out of the general rule that to get on or off a moving train is negligence per se. We have re-examined the authorities to see if it can be brought within the exceptions, but it cannot consistently be done. The rule is founded on solid considerations of public policy for the safety of the traveling community, the exceptions are few in number and the cases must come very clearly within them. The learned judge below has discussed the law and the facts very fully and accurately and, on his opinion, the judgment is affirmed.</p>
