L. 1136, which contained the following provisions : “ That all real estate situated in said city, owned or possessed by any corporation except religious and educational corporations, shall be and is hereby made subject to taxation for city purposes, the same as other property in said city ; any law or laws contrary to or' inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed.

The city of Harrisburg is, therefore, a city of the third class, and subject to the provisions of the Act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 230, and the Act of May 23, 1889, P. L. 277, entitled “ An act providing for the incorporation and government of cities of the third class.” The question is whether these statutes relating to the classification of cities and the government of cities of the third class repeal the local and special provisions relating to taxation contained in the act of 1860 and the act of 1868, above recited, conferring peculiar powers of taxation upon the city of Harrisburg.</p>

This statute was, however, inconsistent with the acts of 1860 and 1868 in that it fixed the limit of the levy in any one year at ten mills, no such limitation being found in the earlier statutes, and, further, in that, in sec. 36, it provided a new and entirely different manner of collecting taxes. The act of 1871 provided that the powers of cities of the third class “ shall be and remain as now provided by law, except where otherwise provided by this act.” It is not asserted that the city has attempted to levy taxes to exceed ten mills on the dollar in any one year upon the property of the appellant, and if the power of the city to levy a tax upon the real estate of the corporation has been taken away, it must be because of a later statute.</p>

L. 277, provided a complete system of taxation for cities of the third class, designated the property and occupations which should be subject to tax, enacted that the assessors who should fix the valuation of such property should be chosen by the qualified electors of the city, not of the several wards, ordained the manner in which such assessors should discharge their duties, created a board to hear and determine appeals from such assessments, designated the officer to whom taxes should be paid, provided a manner for enforcing payment, and fixed penalties for failure to pay the tax after it became due. The system thus provided is from beginning to end inconsistent wfith that which was authorized by the local acts of 1860 and 1868 applicable to the city of Harrisburg alone. The provision wTiich is material to the present inquiry is that which designates the property which shall be subject to tax. The act of 1889 authorized and empowered cities of the third class : “ To levy and collect taxes for general revenue purposes, not to exceed ten mills on the dollar in any one year, on all persons, real, personal and mixed property within the limits of said city, taxable according to the laws of the state of Pennsylvania for county purposes ; the valuation of such property to be assessed as hereinafter provided.” The statute also authorized the collection of a tax, upon the same property, for the purpose of paying interest on bonded indebt<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>edness and for the payment of loans to support the government and make the necessary improvements in said city, and it also authorized the imposition of a poll tax not to exceed $1.00 and a license tax not exceeding $100 annually upon certain businesses and occupations. The real estate which under this act is subject to be taxed for city purposes, by a city of the third class, is such as is taxable for county purposes. This provision is'inconsistent with the provisions of the acts of 1860 and 1868, which authorized the city of Harrisburg to levy taxes upon property which had been subject to taxation “ for borough purposes in the borough of Harrisburg,” and upon the real estate of corporations located within said city. The act of 1889 provided that: “ All acts or parts of acts inconsistent herewith, or supplied by the provisions hereof, be and the same are hereby repealed.”</p>

Brown, <a href="/pa/210/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="210 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="937788" data-case-paths="/pa/210/0029-01">210 Pa. 29</a>, in dealing with the question of the repeal of a local and special act by a later general statute, after a painstaking review of the authorities, thus summarizes his conclusion : <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>
      <em>“ </em>First, the rule that a general statute does not repeal by implication a local act with different or inconsistent provisions, is still the prevailing rule. Secondly, but the rule being founded on a presumption of legislative intent, will not apply when a contrary intent is clearly apparent. Thirdly, where the clear general intent of the legislature is to establish a uniform and mandatory system as in the municipal classification acts, the presumption must be that the local acts are intended to be repealed. Fourthly, where an act is passed to carry into effect a mandatory general provision of the constitution, the presumption must be that it was intended to repeal even local acts inconsistent with its terms.” The learned Chief Justice says, in the same opinion, “ What the cases decide and are authority for, is that as the legislative intent in the classification of municipalities is apparent, to make a uniform system and framework of government, public officers, powers and duties in each class, the presumption is that as to such matters local acts must give way to the general act of classification whenever they conflict.” When the legislative intention to provide a uniform system for all subjects to which it relates clearly appears, no repealing words are necessary: Chalfant v. Edwards, <a href="/pa/176/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="176 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="882185" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0067-01">176 Pa. 67</a>; Quinn v. Cumberland County, <a href="/pa/162/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="162 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="856742" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0055-01">162 Pa. 55</a>. This case is squarely ruled by Commonwealth ex rel. McKirdy v. Macferron, Treasurer of Allegheny City, <a href="/pa/152/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="152 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="838153" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0244-01">152 Pa. 244</a>. The city of Allegheny had not accepted the provisions of the act of 1874, and had continued to be governed under its special charter and laws until 1890, when because of increase in population it became a city of the second class, and it no longer had the option to continue its old form of government, but must pass into and be governed by the laws relating to cities of the second class. Among the local and special laws by which it had been governed under its old charter was a complete taxing system, which, like that of the city of Harrisburg, was somewhat peculiar. The relator in that case attempted to pay his taxes in the old manner, the city treasurer refused to accept the tax, and McKirdy, the relator, proceeded by mandamus. The case reached the Supreme Court and is reported as above cited, and it was held : “ It is clear, therefore, that in order to adjust itself to the class into which it has come, this city must leave its. old system behind it, and <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>take on that which the law has prescribed for it as a member of the second class. This is rendered still more apparent when we remember that the power to levy and collect taxes is one of the ‘ corporate powers ’ which the classification acts have undertaken to regulate, and that the officers through whom such levy and collection are made are £ corporate officers,’ whose powers and duties are defined and adjusted by the same acts. If no provision for the levy and collection of taxes in cities of the second class had been made, the system previously in existence in such cities would have remained undisturbed under the express declaration of the first section of the act of 1874; but to the extent to which the law has regulated the exercise of the taxing power, or modified the powers and duties of the officers through whom it is exercised, to that extent the old system is superseded by the new.” Mr. Justice Williams, who spoke for the Supreme Court in Commonwealth v. Macferron, thus states the rule : ££ Whenever, therefore, any law regulating the municipal affairs of cities of a given class shall be found to conflict with a previous local statute applicable to any member of the class relating to the Same subject, the .latter must give way by reason of the nature and purposes of class legislation. In this manner existing diversities will gradually disappear, and uniformity throughout the class will be finally secured.”</p>
