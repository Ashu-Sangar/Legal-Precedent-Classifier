        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Stewart,\nFrom the nature and character of the affidavit of defense filed, and the manner in which this case was proceeded with, we must conclude that the effort of both sides, to some extent at least, was to try the case upon its merits. The attempt led to peculiar results. Ordinarily the affidavit of defense constitutes no part of the pleadings, but our recent act relating to mechanics\u2019 liens contemplates that the real issue in such cases is to be defined through affidavit and counter affidavit. The issue of fact upon which the case was made to turn, would not have been possible under the plaintiffs\u2019 statement of claim according to the ordinary rules of pleading. The claim filed set out a contract with the defendant company, to superintend for it the erection and construction of the buildings therein described, and to purchase the materials and secure the labor required ; for which service plaintiffs were to receive as compensation ten per cent of the entire cost of the buildings, certain items to be excluded. It averred further that the service plaintiffs had contracted to perform had been rendered, and the demand was for the sum stipulated, based on the entire cost. The contract here set up was an entire one, and the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover anything thereunder depended upon full performance by them: Shaw v. Turnpike, 2 P. & W. 454. Had the defense been made to rest on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to perform in full, it must have ended the plaintiffs\u2019 case, since it was admitted very early upon the trial that plaintiffs were dismissed from the work long before its completion, and that thereafter they had no connection with it. \"While the fact of dismissal was stated in the affidavit of defense, it was not there stated as a substantive defense on which defendant relied, but was referred to only in connection with matters of set-off which were specially set out. The reference to it was introduced only to limit and restrict plaintiffs\u2019 right of recovery to services rendered before dismissal. This fully appears by the request for instruction submitted by defendant\u2019s counsel. The case as tried was made to turn upon the question whether defendant was justified in dismissing the plaintiffs. If issue had been joined on the averment of full performance, this question could not have been inquired into. It could have been pertinent only under a claim for the value of the labor performed, independent of the contract, on the ground that full performance of the contract had been prevented by defendant\u2019s unjustifiable interference. But here, and we must assume it to have been by mutual consent, since it was without objection, it was made the controlling question. In submitting it the court instructed the jury in the general charge that if they found that the defendant had discharged the plaintiffs from the work without justifying cause before its completion, they should render a verdict in plaintiffs\u2019 favor for the full amount they would be entitled to had they performed in full their contract; that is to say, for ten per cent of the entire cost of the completed building. The jury found for the plaintiffs, and rendered their verdict in accordance with the court\u2019s instruction. The instruction was manifestly erroneous. By no sort of construction can a mechanic\u2019s lien be made to embrace anything, whether labor or material, not actually furnished. Plaintiffs had a right to subject the buildings to a lien for the work they did upon and about its erection and construction; but a claim for anything beyond necessarily sounded in damages, and these can never be made the subject of a mechanic\u2019s lien. \u201c A lien for work and materials on the, building is a privilege derived entirely from statutory provision, and cannot be maintained beyond the express grant of the act of assembly:\u201d Tilford v. Wallace, 3 Watts, 141. No where in our mechanic\u2019s lien law can be found even a suggestion that a lien may be maintained under it for anything not actually furnished, much less any express warrant. This instruction from the court having been assigned for error, it must be sustained.\nDefendant\u2019s counsel submitted the following point: \u201c This being a proceeding upon a mechanic\u2019s lien, the plaintiffs cannot recover in the action, except for superintendence actually done up to the time they were discharged and material then purchased under the contract.\u201d Here we have a standard for determining the amount plaintiffs are entitled to recover, quite as mistaken as that adopted by the court. Nothing short of an admitted agreement between the parties that it should be the proper standard could make it so. The case was tried on the lien as filed, for an entire contract, or it was tried apart from the contract on a quantum meruit, one or other. In neither case could the standard here set up obtain. The court committed no error in refusing the point, and the assignment relating to this action by the court is overruled. For the error committed by the court in the general charge to the jury, above referred to, the case must be sent back for another trial. Because of the pleadings and the manner in which the case was tried complications have resulted, but it is not for us to remove these.\nJudgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded.",

T., 1907, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 3, Allegheny Co., Aug. T., 1904, No. 502, on verdict for plaintiffs in case of George H. Deeds and James A. Deeds, Copartners as Deeds Brothers, v.

If you find that their commissions were based upon the entire cost of the building and that no right to dismiss them was reserved in the contract, then their commission should be based upon the entire cost of construction, ehminating or taking out those items which by the terms of the agreement they were not entitled to receive commissions upon.] [2]\nDefendant presented this point. This being a proceeding upon a mechanic\u2019s lien, the plaintiffs cannot recover in this action except for superintendence actually done up to the time they were discharged and material then purchased under the contract.

McNary, for appellant.\nUnder an entire contract a material man\u2019s lien cannot be made available by part performance: Maryland Brick Co. v. Spilman, 76 Md. 337.\nOn the. other hand, where the contract fails of completion by the fault of the owner, the contractor is entitled to his lien to the extent of his actual performance: Canal Co. v. Gordon, 6 Wall. 561; Dennistoun v. McAllister, 4 E. D. Smith (N. Y.), 729; Doll v. Coogan, 48 App. Div. (N.
