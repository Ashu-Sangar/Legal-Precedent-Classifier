E. Bostwick.\u201d This is a perfectly plain and simple devise of the house to Mrs. Marthens, with a pecuniary legacy to Mrs. Bostwick, contingent on the sale of the house by the devisee for more than the sum named. The legacy did not impair or incumber the fee given to the devisee and a sale by her would have carried a good title to the purchaser without regard to the amount of the purchase money. All the discussion about powers or trusts, the value of the house, etc., is outside of the case. The testator imposed no obligation on his devisee to sell, and no court had authority to do so for him, either directly or indirectly, by an inquiry into the value of the house and a demand on the devisee to account for the estimated surplus upon a supposititious sale. The devisee in her lifetime could not have been called upon either to sell or to account on the basis of a sale, and when she died without having sold, all possibility of the happening of the contingency passed and the interest of Mrs. Bostwick came to an end.\nDecree affirmed.",

T., 1907, by Oliver F. Bostwick, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., May T., 1905, No. 189, dismissing petition for citation in Estate of Edward G. Walker, deceased.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for citation.\nThe petition prayed the court to award a citation to Charles Marthens, Mrs. Samuel Aldrich, Charles Marthens, Jr., William Marthens, Walker Marthens, Lida Marthens and Louis Kabel and Charles Marthens, executor of Edward G. Walker, to appear and show cause why the amount of a legacy to Mrs. Mary E. Bostwick should not be ascertained and payment made to petitioner, and in default of payment to show cause why certain property should not be sold and said legacy paid, and for such other relief as the court may deem proper and just.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nThe court in an opinion by Hawkins, P. J., dismissed the petition.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nMorton Hunter, for appellant.\nJ. McF. Carpenter, with him Geo. N. Chalfant, J. E. McKelvy and J.
