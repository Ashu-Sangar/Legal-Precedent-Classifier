        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe learned judge below found as facts, inter alia, \u201c That the coal now being mined and transported over the plaintiff\u2019s road will be exhausted within the next two years, when said railroad will be abandoned. There is some evidence about a lower stratum or vein of coal, but it never has been worked in that locality, and the evidence is not persuasive that it ever will be. If, as it now appears, the maintenance of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad is dependent upon the shipment of coal from the Brock mines, it will be abandoned by the time, or very shortly after, the defendant\u2019s road is completed and ready for operation.\u201d And, farther, that the plaintiff has \u201c leased to the Erie Railroad Company its railroad, with all its appurtenances and equipment, for a term of four years, which, according to the testimony now before the court, covers the time said railroad will continue to exist, and the said Erie Railroad Company, so far as it has the power and so far as its rights are involved, has granted the defendant company, upon certain conditions and restrictions, the right to cross said leased road at grade.\u201d\nIt thus appears that the complainant, having no present interest which is injured, is not now in position to sustain this action. Grade crossings are, however, opposed to the policy of the law, and the bill should therefore be retained for further proceedings should the situation be changed. In the meantime the order dissolving the injunction is affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Brock Railroad Company, Appellant, v. Brookville & Mahoning Railroad Company.\nRailroads \u2014 Grade crossings \u2014 Equity.\nA court of equity will not continue a preliminary injunction in a suit brought by one railroad company against another railroad company to enjoin a grade crossing, where the court finds as a fact, that the plaintiff company\u2019s .road was used only for carrying cars from a certain mine, and that this coal would be exhausted and the railroad discontinued before or about the time the defendant\u2019s road will be built, and also that the plaintiff had leased its road to another railroad company which had agreed with the defendant company that a grade crossing should be constructed.\nArgued Oct. 19, 1907.\nAppeal, No. 191, Oct. T., 1907, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. Jefferson Co., Aug. T., 1907, No. 4, dissolving preliminary injunction in case of Brock Railroad Company v.
