    "head_matter": "Knight v. Church, Appellant.\nWill \u2014 Devise\u2014Power of sale \u2014 Application of purchase money.\nLand devised to a wife in trust and if she \u201cdesires she can sell said farm and invest the money in other farm land,\u201d creates a present power of sale in the wife, and if she exercises the power and sells the land, the purchaser is under no obligation to see to the application of the purchase money.\nArgued Oct. 21, 1907.\nAppeal, No. 68, Oct. T., 1907, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Greene Co., May T., 1906, No. 92, for plaintiff on case stated in suit of Ori L. Knight, Executrix of last will and testament of John R. Knight, deceased, v. Rinehart B. Church.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Browen, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated to determine marketable title to land.\nIngraham, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThe second clause of the will of John R. Knight, deceased, provides as follows:\n\u201cMy farm situated in Center twp. ... I direct that my wife shall have control of said farm, renting farm, paying taxes, & etc. and paying Wayne his share of income until W ayne becomes of age, or if my wife desires she can sell said farm and invest the money in other farming land.\n\u201c Should she sell said farm she shall not give bond for the money received from farm until she invests in other land.\u201d\nThe questions for determination here are :\n1. Does the will of John R. Knight create a present power to sell?\n2. Is the power to sell, if one presently exists, sufficient for sale of part of the land only, i. e., the surface, reserving the coal ?\n3. Is Rinehart B. Church, the purchaser, required to look to the application of the proceeds of sale ?\nAs John R. Knight, the testator, has in express words given his wife the right, if she so desires, to sell his farm, and to invest the proceeds in other farming land, it will not be seriously questioned that the will does create a present power to sell, and as there is nothing in the will fixing either the time or manner of sale, we are of opinion that the widow would have the right to sell the farm at such times as she might think best, and either as a whole, or in parcels, as she might deem best for the best interest of the whole estate.\nWhile the third question, \u201c Is Rinehart B. Church, the purchaser, required to look to the application of the proceeds of sale ? \u201d is not new, still it is one that has not often been before the courts for consideration.\nIn trusts of certain nature, as, for instance, if it be for the payment of legacies, which are scheduled or specified, the purchaser is bound to see that the purchase money is properly applied.\n\u201c But he is not bound to see the money applied, where the trust is for the payment of debts generally and also for the payment of .legacies; and where the trust is for the payment of debts generally, the purchaser is not bound to see to the application of the purchase money, although he has notice of the debts; for a purchaser cannot be expected to see to the observance of a trust so unlimited and undefined: \u201d Grant v. Hook, 13 Sergeant & Rawle, 259.\nIn this case the language of the will is, \u201c or if my wife desires she can sell said farm and invest the money in other farming land.\u201d\nProm this it will be seen that the sale of the land and the reinvestment of the proceeds of the sale are both left to the sound discretion of the trustee; she may sell or not, as she may determine after the exercise of due deliberation and discretion : and if she does sell she is required to reinvest the proceeds of the sale in such other farming land as she, after due deliberation and in the exercise of sound discretion, may select.\n\u201c Whenever a trustee empowered to sell, is at the same time authorized and required to reinvest the avails of the trust property, under the same trusts with which the original estate was clothed, the purchaser is discharged from all obligation to see to the proper application of the purchase money paid by him to the trustee. And it is difficult to perceive how it could practically be otherwise. Reinvestments are eminently matters for the exercise of sound discretion. The failure of a due exercise of such discretion may involve the trustee in direct personal liability for a breach of trust. To coerce precipitate action by the trustee may be most deleterious to the trust fund; while to keep the purchaser in a state of suspended liability, until such reinvestment is properly made and duly secured according to the terms of the trust, would embarrass, if not totally nullify the whole power to sell: \u201d Dalzell v. Crawford, 1 Parsons, 37, 60.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, we are of opinion that the purchaser is not bound to see to the application of the purchase money.\nJudgment for the plaintiff.\nError assigned was the judgment of the court.\nJames J. Purman, for appellant.\nJohn L. Wood, for appellee, was not heard.\nNovember 14, 1907:"
