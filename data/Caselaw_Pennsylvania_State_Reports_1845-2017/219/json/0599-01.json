    "head_matter": "Burnett\u2019s Estate.\nParent and child \u2014 Adoption\u2014Inheritance\u2014Intestate laws \u2014 Acts of May 4, 1855, P. L. 430, April 13, 1887, P. L. 53, and May 19, 1887, P. L. 125.\nAn adopted child, under the laws of Pennsylvania, cannot inherit from collateral kindred of the adopting parents.\nArgued Nov. 8, 1907.\nAppeal, No. 155, Oct. T., 1907, by Clara Burnett, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., April T., 1907, No. 100, overruling exceptions to adjudication in Estate of Martin H. Burnett.\nBefore Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nOver, J., filed the following adjudication :\nMartin H. Burnett died intestate November 22, 1905, leaving to survive him one brother, one sister, and children of a deceased brother.\nElias Burnett, another brother, a resident of the state of Ohio, died before the decedent, leaving no issue; he, however, had adopted under the laws of that state as his son, one John Ferguson, a minor, whose guardian claims that he is entitled to share in the distribution of the estate under our intestate laws and statutes relating to adoption. Under the latter, however, an adopted child \u201c has the rights of a child without being a child \u201d and can inherit from the adopting parent: Schafer v. Eneu, 54 Pa. 304.\nThis decedent having left a brother and sister, and a nephew and niece, children of a deceased brother and sister, the estate is to be distributed under sec. 3 of the act of April 8, 1833, which provides that:\n\u201c If such intestate shall leave brothers or sisters, .... and also nephews and nieces, being children of such deceased brother or sister, .... every such brother and sister shall receive such share as he or she would have received if all the brothers and sisters who shall then be dead, leaving children, had been living at the death of the intestate, and such nephews and nieces shall take by representations of their parents respectively, .such share only as would have descended to such parents if they had been living at the death of the intestate.\u201d\nThe parents referred to here are not the adopted but the natural parents, and as this claimant is not a child of the intestate\u2019s deceased brother, nor intestate\u2019s nephew, it follows that he is not entitled to distribution.\nOn exceptions, Over, J., filed the following opinion :\nThe claimant and Elias Burnett were residents of the state of Ohio, and the former was adopted by the latter under the laws of that state. As both wore domiciled there and the adoption is not repugnant to the jurisprudence of this state, it seems to be valid here: Foster v. Waterman, 124 Mass. 592; Wharton\u2019s Conflict of Laws, sec. 251; but the adopted child can only inherit in this state under our laws of descent: Smith v. Derr\u2019s Administrators, 34 Pa. 127. As he is not of the blood of this intestate, he cannot inherit from him under the intestate act of 1833; but it is contended that under the statute providing for the adoption of children, he can. The seventh section of the act of May 4, 1855, which was amended by the act of May 19, 1887, Stewart\u2019s Purdon, page 279, pl. 1, only as to the necessary parties to the adoption proceedings, provided that an adopted child should \u201c have all the rights of a child and heir of such adopting parent.\u201d It does not, however, give such a child the lights of a nephew or niece, and of a collateral heir of the brothers and sisters of the adopting parent; and if it had been the intention to change the intestate acts so that intestate\u2019s testate should descend without his consent to a person not of his blood, surely such an intention would have been clearly expressed. It is suggested that if the adopted child has all the rights of a child, it necessarily has the rights of inheritance, as a natural child of the adopting parents. If so the child could inherit as such from the natural children, and it would not have been necessary to provide in the concluding part of the section that the adopted child and other children of the adopting parent should \u201c inherit from and through each other as if all had been the lawful children of the same parent.\u201d The obvious purpose of the act was to provide for the adoption of children, and to amend the intestate laws only so that the adopted child could inherit from the adopting parent and his children.\nThe only other Act relating to the matter is that of April 13, 1887, P. L. 53, Stewart\u2019s Purdon, 2006, pl. 60. This act gives the inheritance of the estate of an adopted child to the adoption parent and their lawful heirs and kindred, to the exclusion of the natural parent, kindred and heirs at law of the child, reserving, however, to the husband and wife of the child their rights under the intestate laws, \u201cprovided, however, that this Act shall only apply to such property as the adopted child shall have inherited or derived from the adopting parent of their kindred.\u201d At first blush it seems that the right of the child to inherit from the adopting parents\u2019 collaterals was recognized by the proviso; but this right did not exist when the act was passed, and in construing it, the word \u201cderived\u201d should follow.\u201cor,\u201d so that it would read \u201c or derived from their kindred.\u201d Under the act of 1855, the adopting parent could not inherit from the child: Commonwealth v. Powel, 16 W. N. C. 297; and the purpose of the act was to give such a parent and his kindred the right of inheritance as to any estate the child inherited or derived from them, and under the act they seem to have a prior right to the adopted child\u2019s issue.\nThe exceptions to the adjudication must be dismissed.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nStephen Stone, with him Wm. M. Roach and Wm. A. Stone, for appellant.\nThe apparent intention of the legislature and of the courts since the passage of the adoption acts, has been to extend to an adopted child all the rights, privileges and duties of a natural child: Schafer v. Eneu, 54 Pa. 304; Kohler\u2019s Est., 199 Pa. 455; Rowan\u2019s Est., 132 Pa. 299; Morgan v. Reel, 213 Pa. 81.\nJas. W. Collins, for appellee,\ncited: Ross v. Ross, 129 Mass. 243; Quigley v. Mitchell, 41 Ohio, 375; Upson v. Noble, 35 Ohio Rep. 655.\nJanuary 6, 1908:"
