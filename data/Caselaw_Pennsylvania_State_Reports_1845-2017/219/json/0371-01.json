Nothing could be clearer than the testator\u2019s actual intent that-the event on which the contingency depended was not his own death but that of Joseph, the life tenant. Joseph had a child, but she died before he did, and when the time for determining the contingency arrived there was no child or grandchild of Joseph \u201cthen living\u201d and by the clear expression of the testator\u2019s intent the remainder-men under the will were his sons Robert and Andrew and the latter\u2019s children: Wood v.
