Riehl, Appellant.\nEquity \u2014 Equity jurisdiction \u2014 Account\u2014Principal and agent.\nA bill in equity by a principal against an agent for an account is prima facie cognizable in equity, and the jurisdiction of equity is not subsequently ousted by the fact that the substantial contest between the parties finally narrows down to a single item.\nArgued Nov. 4, 1907.\nAppeal, No. 126, Oct. T., 1907, by defendant, from decree of C. P. No. 3, Allegheny Co., Nov. T., 1905, No. 425, on bill in equity in case of George Fischer, Executor of John Fischer, deceased, v. Leonard Riehl.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for an account.\nBefore Kennedy, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that John Fischer and the defendant, Leonard Riehl, stood in the relation of father-in-law and son-in-law to each other. Riehl was also Fischer\u2019s agent under a power of attorney. The bill sought for an accounting for various items, but the contest finally narrowed down to the question as to whether Riehl was entitled to retain for his services $2,000 out of moneys which he had collected. The court disallowed the claim and entered a decree against the defendant for $2,000.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nWm. M. Hall, with him O. P. Metcalf, for appellant.\n\u2014 The plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law either in assumpsit or trespass, and, the account being unilateral, not complicated, and not requiring discovery, equity has no jurisdiction: Paton v. Clark, 156 Pa. 49; Graham v. Cummings, 208 Pa. 516; Holland v. Hallahan, 211 Pa. 223.\nSamuel McClay, of Reed, Smith, Shaw & Beal, with him Alexander Gilfillan, for appellee.\nA bill in equity for an account can be maintained in this case: Bredin v. Kingland, 4 Watts, 420; McFadden v. Sallada, 6 Pa. 283; Reeside v. Reeside, 49 Pa. 322.\nJanuary 6, 1908:"
