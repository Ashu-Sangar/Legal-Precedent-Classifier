T., 1907, by C. Montieth Gilpin, from decree of C. P. Armstrong Co., Dec. T., 1906, No. 88, on bill in equity in case of Valentine Neubert v. Phebe B. Colwell and her husband, Henry A. Colwell, Mary H. Hudson and her husband, Robert Hudson, O. W. Gilpin and Mary E. Adele Gilpin, C. Montieth Gilpin and Elizabeth McConnell.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for partition.\nBefore Patton, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that John Gilpin died in 1883, seized of an undivided one-sixth of a lot known as No. 136 in Kittanning borough. Valentine Neubert owned an undivided two-thirds and Phebe B. Colwell and Mary H. Hudson an undivided one-twelfth part each. The court entered a decree allowing the partition but debarred O. Montieth Gilpin from participation therein on the ground that he had no present or expectant right or interest in the land. Gilpin appealed.\nError assigned was decree debarring Gilpin from participating in the partition.\nC. E. Harrington and M. F. Leason, for appellant.\nFrank P. Prichard, with him Orr Buffington and Oliver W. Gilpin, for appellees.\nJanuary 6, 1908:"
