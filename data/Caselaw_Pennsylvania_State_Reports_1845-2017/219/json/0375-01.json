        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Mitchell,\nThe Act of June 10, 1893, P. L. 415, was intended to settle title to land as well as possession, and the requirement of sec. 2 as to the petitioner is that he shall be in possession of the land \u201c claiming to hold or own possession of the same by any right or title whatsoever, which right or title or right of possession shall be disputed,\u201d etc. It is not merely the petitioner\u2019s possession which must be disputed and which he may defend under the act, but the title by which his possession is held. The argument of appellant is that the plaintiff\u2019s present right of possession and her possession in fact are not disputed, the appellant\u2019s claim being only to a contingent right upon the death of Keefer whom she avers to be the life tenant. But this though it refers to the future is still a present dispute of the title by which the plaintiff holds possession and is, therefore, within the act. \u201c What the party in possession needs and what the act gives him is the right to a present adjudication of his title:\u201d Canal Co. v. Genet, 169 Pa. 343.\nThe very point was decided in Stamey v. Barkley, 211 Pa. 313, where the petitioner\u2019s present right of possession was not disputed, but the adverse right set up was of a contract to purchase at a future time, and the contest was on one hand to remove the cloud on petitioner\u2019s title and on the other to maintain it.\nAnd the same point was again decided in Smith v. Hibbs, 213 Pa. 202, where a remainder-man making no claim to present possession, but duly served along with the life tenant, was held to be barred by the proceeding.\nA second objection by appellant is that the petitioner in possession was made the plaintiff in the issue. But it does not appear how this did any harm to appellant. In general the better practice is to make the petitioner the defendant in analogy to ejectment where the party in possession is not called on to disclose his title until he knows by whom and on what grounds it is attacked. But as said in \u00dcllom v. Hughes, 201 Pa. 305, the issue both as to substance and form is under the entire control of the court, to bo molded to fit the requirements of the real controversy between the parties. It may well be as argued by appellant that some cases will be found to present difficulties in the application of the statute, but these are not likely to be insuperable. It is a remedial act with great elasticity under the control of the courts and the increasing resort to it shows the general judgment of the profession that it is effective as well as convenient. It should be construed and applied in furtherance of this view.\nThe deed from Lambert and wife to Eliza and Joseph Keefer, assuming it to be read as the parties here and the court below read it, clearly conveyed a fee tail special which the statute converted into a fee simple. The only doubt about it might be whether the heirs of the body of the Keefers are properly to be included among the parties of the second part. They are only mentioned in the premises to the deed while the operative words of the grant and the habendum are to \u201c the parties of the second part, their heirs and assigns.\u201d But notwithstanding the inartificial form the intent of the deed seems to be as the court held.\nJudgment affirmed:",

L. 415 \u2014 Issue\u2014Parties.\nThe Act of Juno 10, 1893, P. L. 415, was intended to settle title to land as well as possession, and the requirement of sec. 2 as to the petitioner is that he shall be in possession of the land \u201cclaiming to hold or own possession of the same by any right or title whatsoever, which right or title or right of possession shall be disputed,\u201d etc. It is not merely the petitioner\u2019s possession which must be disputed and which he may defend under the acts but the title by which his possession is held. A claim of respondent to a contingent right upon the death of the life tenant, who is averred to be a person different from the petitioner although it refers to the future, is still a present dispute of the title by which the petitioner holds possession, and is therefore within the act.\nIn an issue framed under the Act of June 10,1893, P. L. 415, the better practice is to make the petitioner the defendant in the issue, but it is not ground, to reverse the judgment because the respondent was made the defendant. The issue both as to substance and form is under the entire control of the court, to be moulded to fit the requirements of the real controversy between the parties.\nDeed \u2014 Fee tail special \u2014 Fee simple estate \u2014 Heirs of the body.\nWhere the premises of a deed recite the deed as made between the grantor and his wife and the grantee and his wife \u201c for their natural lives, and afterward to the heirs begotten from their bodies in fee simple,\u201d and the grant is \u201cunto the said parties of the second part, their heirs and assigns,\u201d the deed will be construed as conveying a fee tail special which the statute converts into a fee simple.\nArgued Oct. 24, 1907.\nAppeal, No. 6, Oct.

J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for an issue to settle title to land under Act of June 10, 1893, P. L. 415.\nThe petition of Abbie Kimmel represented that she is the owner and has title in fee simple to a tract of land in Quemahoning and Stony creek townships, containing eighty-seven and three-quarters acres, being the same tract. conveyed to petitioner by Valentine Hay and wife by deed dated February 20, 1894. That she resides upon and has possession of the whole of said tract of land. That David A. Lambert and wife conveyed to Joseph and Eliza Keefer and their certain heirs, by deed dated May 18, 1877, and under the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, and under the act of 1855, vested in said Joseph and Eliza Keefer title in fee simple, and they conveyed to Yalentine Hay.\nThat Clara K. Shaffer claims a .right or title to said tract of land under the deed to Joseph and Eliza Keefer aforesaid as one of the children of said Joseph and Eliza Keefer. That petitioner had made a sale of the coal on said land and Clara K. Shaffer served notice of her claim on the purchaser, and praying the court to grant a rule upon said Clara K. Shaffer to show cause why an issue shall not be framed to settle and determine their respective rights and title to said land.\nClara K. Shaffer by answer admitted the title to the premises in dispute was vested in David Lambert, recited the deed of David Lambert above, quoting therefrom, and averred that Eliza Keefer died on May 29, 1899, leaving to survive her a husband, the said Joseph Keefer, who is still living, and the following heirs : (1) Austin Denison, (2) Mary Jane Friodline, (3) your respondent, Clara K. Shaffer, (4) the petitioner, Abbie Kimmel. And the said Austin Denison and Mary Jane Friedline are not children of the said Joseph Keefer, and averring that the deed from David Lambert to Eliza and Joseph Keefer vested in them a life estate, and at the death of both of the life tenants an estate in fee simple in Abbie Kimmel and Clara K.' Shaffer, and denying that the court had any right to make an order compelling respondent to institute an action of ejectment before the death of said Joseph Keefer.\nThe deed in dispute was as follows :\n\u201c This Indenture, made the 18th day of May, in the year of Our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy-seven, between David Lambert and Ann Mariah Lambert, his wife, of Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, and State of Pennsylvania, of the first part, and Eliza Keifer and Joseph Keifer, her husband, of Quemahoning Township, county and State aforesaid, for their natural lives, and afterward to the heirs begotten from the bodies of said Eliza Keifer and Joseph Keifer, her husband, in fee simple, of the second part.\n\u201c Witnesseth : That the said parties of the first part, for and in consideration of the sum of Eight Hundred ($800) Dollars, etc., do grant, bargain, sell, etc., unto the said parties of the second part, their heirs and assigns, all the following described piece of land, etc.\n\u201c Acknowledged 18th May, 1877.
