Any one of them would require a reversal of the decree.\nDecree reversed and petition dismissed at the costs of the petitioner.",

Such proceedings should be dismissed because of insufficient proof of fraud; of the lapse of time; of the death of the guardian and trustee; of the presumption of settlement and consequent bar by the statute; and of the petitioner's laches.\nArgued Oct. 30, 1907.\nAppeal, No. 73, Oct. T., 1907, by Fidelity Title & Trust Company, Ancillary Administrator of the Estate of James H. Hopkins, deceased, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., Oct. T., 1905, No. 236, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in Estate of Virginia Rahm, deceased.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nReversed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that Virginia Rahm died in 1870, leaving a will by which she appointed James J. Hopkins her executor. Hopkins subsequently became a trustee of the property left in trust by the will, and also thereafter a guardian of Edward Rahm, Jr., a son of Virginia Rahm. Edward Rahm, Jr., became of age on June 27,1881. Shortly thereafter Hopkins filed his final account as guardian, and made settlement with his ward. In 1905, Edward Rahm, Jr., filed a petition for a citation to the Fidelity Title & Trust Company, ancillary administrator of the estate of James H. Hopkins, deceased. He claimed that Hopkins, as executor, trustee and guardian, had omitted from his accounts securities aggregating in value $31,512.56.'\nThe court in an opinion by Hawkins, P. J., sustained an adjudication in which the above amount was awarded to petitioner, together with interest from October 5,1875, compounded at four per cent, and amounting to $74,510.99, making an aggregating surcharge of $106,023.55.\nMiller, J., filed a dissenting opinion which is quoted in part in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nCharles P. Orr, of Orr & Lazear, and D. T. Watson, for appellant.\nGeorge R. Wallace, with him Henry A. Damis and Thomas Watson, for appellee.\nNovember 14, 1907:"
