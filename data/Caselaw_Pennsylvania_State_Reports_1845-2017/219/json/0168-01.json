    "head_matter": "Hatfield v. Clovis, Appellant.\nContract \u2014 Mines and mining \u2014 Coal option \u2014 Time.\nWhere a coal option provides that \u201cthe party of the second part shall have until the tenth day of July, 1905, to accept the coal herein described,\u201d and that on failure to give notice of acceptance \u201cby the said date\u201d the contract shall be void, the party of the second part has until the tenth day of July in which to accept the option.\nArgued Oct 21, 1907.\nAppeal, No. 154, Oct. T., 1907, by defendant, from decree of C. P. Greene Co., No. 105, in equity, on bill in equity in case of William K. Hatfield v. L. B. Clovis.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for specific performance.\nBefore Taylor, J., specially presiding.\nFrom the record it appeared that on May 19, 1905, L. B. Clovis executed an option in writing to H. J. Price for certain coal lands.\nThe option contained the following provision:\n\u201cFor and in consideration of the sum of $1.00, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, the party of the first part agree that the party of the second part shall have until July 10, 1905, to accept the coal herein described, as the same may be determined by the engineers of the party of the first part (the party of the first part to furnish a complete abstract of title). And if the party of the second part does not give notice of such acceptance by the said date, this contract shall be void and of no further effect.\u201d\nThe option subsequently came into the ownership of William K. Hatfield, the plaintiff, by mesne assignments from Price.\nThe court found, inter alia, the following facts:\n4. That on July 8, 1905, J. A. Phillips for H. J. Price and Smith Hood, Jr., gave notice to said L. B. Clovis of their acceptance and election to purchase said coal and mining rights on the terms set forth in said contract, and tendered the $100 to pay the expenses of surveying, making abstract, etc., as stipulated in said contract, which was refused by the said L. B. Clovis; and that again on July 10, 1905, H. J. Price and Joseph Phillips gave notice thereof, to the said L. B. Clovis, of the acceptance of said contract and at the same time tendered him the sum of $100, to pay the expenses of surveying, making abstract, etc., which said money so tendered the said L. B. Clovis refused to accept.\nThe court entered a decree of specific performance.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nJ. W. Ray, with him D. S. Walton and J. B. Donley & Son, for appellant.\nThe word \u201c until \u201d may have either an exclusive or an inclusive meaning, according to the subject to which it is applied, the nature of the transaction which it specifies, and the connection in which it is used. Considering the word as it appears in the contract in suit, in relation to the subject-matter of the contract, the nature of the transaction and the connection in which it is used, the defendant contends that its meaning is exclusive. Especially does he so contend when it is considered in connection with the word \u201c by \u201d as it stands in the second clause above quoted, from the contract in suit. Primarily the word \u201c until \u201d is one of exclusion: Rex v. Stevens, 5 East, 243; Webster v. French, 12 Ill. 302; Corbin v. Ketcham, 87 Ind. 138; Bemis v. Leonard, 118 Mass. 502; People v. Walker, 17 N. Y. 502; People v. Crissey, 91 N. Y. 616; State v. Perkins, 139 Mo. 106 (40 S. W. Repr. 650); Eshelman v. Snyder, 82 Ind. 498.\n\"When a contract calls for performance \u201c by \u201d a certain date the contract must be performed before that date: Rankin v. Woodworth, 3 P. & W. 48.\nJames J. Purman, for appellee.\nThe word \u201c until \u201d included July 10: Thomson v. Life Ins. Co., 4 Pa. Dist. Rep. 382; Kendall v. Kingsley, 120 Mass. 94; Bunce v. Reed, 16 Barb. (N. Y.) 347; Dakins v. Wagner, 3 Dowling\u2019s Prac. Rep. 535; Weld v. Barker, 153 Pa. 465; Browne v. Browne, 3 S. & R. 496.\nNovember 4, 1907:"
