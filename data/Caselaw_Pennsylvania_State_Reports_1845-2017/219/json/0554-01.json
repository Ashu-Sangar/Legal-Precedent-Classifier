    "head_matter": "Jacoby\u2019s Estate.\nWill \u2014 Construction\u2014Distribution.\nWhere a testator after expressly stating that he leaves nothing to his widow, gives certain legacies and directs that the balance of his estate shall be held in trust to pay one-fourth of the income thereof to certain beneficiaries^ one-eighth thereof to another beneficiary, and the remaining portion to a charity, and the widow elects to take against his will, the charity is not entitled to an amount equal to five-eighths of the income from the balance of the estate, including the widow\u2019s share, but is only entitled to five-eighths of the income from the balance of the estate after the widow\u2019s share has been deducted.\nArgued Nov. 7, 1907.\nAppeals, Nos. 151, 171 and 207, Oct. Term, 1907, by Saint Peter\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Orphans\u2019 Home of Allegheny County, Ethel Jacoby Crane and Mary H. Downs, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., Oct. T., 1897, No. 60, dismissing petitions for review in Estate of George T. Jacoby, deceased.\nBefore Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for review.\nFrom the record it appeared that George T. Jacoby, the decedent, died testate, without issue, leaving to survive him his widow, Caroline Jacoby. He left a valuable estate, which he disposed of as follows : One. thousand dollars to his executors and trustee, the income to be applied to keeping his cemetery lot in repair ; his library to the Lawrenceville branch of the Y. M. C. A.; $1,000 to his namesake, George T. J, Folk.\nIn the fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth paragraphs of his will he provided as follows :\n\u201c Fifth. My wife, Caroline Jacoby, having without just cause entirely separated herself from me since 1881, and by every means in her power annoyed and sought to injure mo, and willfully neglected and refused to live with me as my wife, and believing that she has forfeited all rights as such, I give and devise nothing more than the law will grant to her under the circumstances, besides this she has received already more than her share of my estate.\n\u201c I especially direct my executors at the expense of my estate to contest any claim she may set up, and they must use all legal means and spare no expense in their efforts to defeat any dower or other interest in or to any of my estate, real or personal, that I may die possessed of, or that may be herein mentioned.\n\u201c Sixth. The balance of my estate, proceeds of real estate and personal property, I direct my executors to pay the same over unto the Safe Deposit & Trust Company of Pittsburg, as trustee in trust that it will invest the same in first bond and mortgage to be approved by the court, and pay out the net income annually as follows, to wit:\n\u201c One-half (reduced to one-fourth by the codicil) to the children of M.ary Downs, formerly Mary Goldinger, now residing in Greenville, Mercer county, Pennsylvania, share and share alike to all children that she may have living at the time of any annual distribution. The mother shall be entitled to receive and receipt for the interest of such of her children as shall be under the age of 21 years, provided she uses the same for educating her said children; her children at the present time are Lois Mary Downs, Inez Martha Downs, Sophia Ethel Downs, Sylvester Dewitt Downs, and John Paul Downs; as each child arrives at the age of 21 years he or she shall alone receipt for his or her interest, and as each arrives at the age of 27 years the said trustee shall pay to him or her the principal. These legacies not to lapse but go to the surviving children.\n\u201cSeventh. I give, devise, and bequeath to Ethel Jacoby, daughter of my brother Frederick, one-eighth of my estate to be held by my said trustee in the same manner and upon the same conditions as to payment of interest up to 21 years and principal at her arrival at age of 27 years, as provided in the sixth clause.\n\u201c Hinth. The remaining portion of my estate is to be invested in mortgages so as aforesaid approved and be known as G. T. Jacoby Protestant Orphan Belief Fund, and the net income arising therefrom paid to the various Protestant orphan asylums and institutions wherein orphans are cared for within the county of Allegheny, but only to such as are strictly under. Protestant management and that teach the Protestant religion, also to the Concordia Home of Butler county, share and share alike.\n\u201c If by reason of death any of said legacies should lapse by reason of the death of the legatee before the principal is paid to him or her then his or her share shall be added to the relief fund, excepting only the case of the children of Mary Do whs.\n\u201cHo asylum shall be entitled .to its portion until due proof has been made that in it is taught the Protestant religion.\n\u201c The principal must not be impaired as it is my desire so far as I am able to establish a permanent relief fund.\u201d\nThe widow elected to take against the will. The court, after deducting the widow\u2019s share, distributed one-eighth of the remainder of the estate to the trustee for Ethel Jacoby, one-fourth thereof to the trustee for the children of Mary Downs, and the remainder to the charity. All three of the appellants filed petitions for review.\nAll the petitions were dismissed in opinions by Over, J.\nThe opinion dismissing the petition of the charity was as follows:\nIn the decree made in this case August 15, 1899, there was distributed to testator\u2019s widow one-half of his personalty, and to the Safe Deposit & Trust Company, trustee, one-fourth of the residue for Mary Downs and her children, one-eighth for Ethel Jacoby and five-eighths for the Orphan Belief Fund. The petitioners, two of the beneficiaries under the latter trust, now claim that it was testator\u2019s intention to give the Orphan Belief Fund five-eighths of his entire estate, and that the decree should be so modified. If this claim be well founded, as the widow took four-eighths of the personalty and there were but four-eighths left for distribution, the whole fund for distribution should have been given to the trustee for the Orphan Relief Fund. In the sixth paragraph the testator gave the residue of his estate, after paying debts, pecuniary legacies and satisfying all legal claims of his widow, to a trustee. He then sets apart one-fourth of the trust estate for the Downs\u2019s children, one-eighth for Ethel Jacoby, and the remaining portion, viz.: five-eighths for the Orphan Relief Fund. There is surely nothing in the will indicating any intention on the testator\u2019s part to give the Orphan Relief Fund five-eighths of his entire estate. His direction in the will that \u201c the principal must not be impaired \u201d refers only to the preservation of the corpus of the gift and not to its amount.\nFor these and other reasons given in the opinion filed August 15, 1899, the petition must be dismissed.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing the petition for review.\nMorton Hunter, for the Saint Peter\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Orphans\u2019 Home of Allegheny county.\nJames R. Sterrett, of Patterson, Sterrett & Acheson, for Pittsburg and Allegheny Home for Friendless.\nSamuel S. Mehard and Q. A. Gordon, for Mary H. Downs and her children.\nGeorge E. Alter, with him G. K. Wright, for Ethel Jacoby Crane.\nJanuary 6, 1908:"
