Hartman lent money to Duphorn for a year at 8 per cent, on a note, stated to be at 6 per cent., with Danner as surety; about maturity Hartman agreed to an extension for a year, upon Duphorn paying 2 per cent, usury, and in the same way for a third year. The usury was paid after tho maturity of the note. Danner had no knowledge of the usury or the extensions. Held, that the contract for usury being illegal, it was without consideration and therefore not binding on Hartman, and he could recover from Danner notwithstanding the giving of time.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b37-9" data-blocks='[["BL_37.9",37,[151,1106,1170,604]]]'>Answer: “ This proposition of law is not correct. An agreement to pay an increase of interest, or a sum of money for an extension of time, if not paid will not have the effect of a binding contract; but where the stipulated sum of money is actually paid the contract is an executed one, as far as the debtor can make it so, and binds the lender or payee to give the stipulated time and suspends his right to bring suit, and consequently discharges the surety, unless he assented to the contract stipulating for an extension of the time of payment, or knowing it did not dissent from it. The case of Galbreath <em>v. </em>Fullerton, cited from the 2d volume of the Legal Opinion, p. 105, does not apply to the facts stated in this point; for in that case the question presented was whether the parties to an unexecuted usurious contract are, both or either of them, bound for its performance.”</p>

At the time the note was given, Duphorn, without the knowledge of Danner, agreed to pay two per cent, extra interest, and gave his due-bill for the usury, which was afterwards paid. A short time before the note fell due Hartman agreed to extend the time for another year upon Duphorn’s giving his due-bill for two per cent, extra interest, which was also afterwards paid. In the spring of 1869 the time was again in like manner extended, Duphorn giving to Hartman and his wife ten dollars worth of goods for the extra two per cent., which would not have been due under this arrangement, supposing it to be valid, until April 1870.

What effect then did the payment of the due-bill given just before the maturity of the note produce ? Assuming it to have been paid after the note had fallen due, it was in law a part payment on account of the debt and latyful interest. It cannot be doubted that either Duphorn or Danner, when sued on the note, could have insisted upon a credit for this amount. Such is clearly the provision of the Act of May 28th 1858, Pamph. L. 622 : “ It shall be lawful for such borrower or debtor, at his option, to retain and deduct such excess from the amount of any such debt.” . What the principal had a right to deduct as payment, the surety may certainly avail himself of. ' It follows, logically, that the payment of this due-bill — and the same principle applies to the subsequent payment in goods — having been made after the maturity of the debt, formed no sufficient consideration for the contract to give further time.</p>

There must be some legal benefit to the one party or injury to the other, though it may be of the slightest kind. It must be a benefit or injury, which the law can recognise and appreciate, not the performance in part or in whole of that which is already an ascertained and matured obligation.</p>
