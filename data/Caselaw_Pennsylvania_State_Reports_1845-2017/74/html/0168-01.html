There was evidence that the attorney and friend offered it to Bergner for $13,000, and he accepted the offer, the conveyance was made by Thompson to a railroad company, who paid §13,000 to discharge his debts and $7000_ to Bergner. In a suit to recover the amount in Bergner’s hands after deducting what was due him, the question was whether there was a sale to Bergner. The court charged that there was no authority in these alleged agents to sell, and their act was not ratified, as Thompson refused to make the deed to Bergner, but made it to the company. There was nothing in the evidence to permit Bergner to hold the §7000: “ his right is to compensation, not to take the property or purchase-money.” <em>Held </em>to be error as a binding instruction, the whole was for the jury.</p>

The latter claims that he bought the tavern-stand for $20,000, sold to him by Messrs. Herr and; Haines as agents of Thompson; the one was an attorney at law, and as such had no power to sell; the other was an agent by parol, and from his statement it is by no means certain what he meant or intended. Thompson and wife refused to make the deed to Bergner, but made it directly to the company. The judgments of Bergner were paid off out of this purchase-money, without his having given credit for the previous payment, and this suit is brought to recover that money, received, but never credited. The $7000 were not paid to Thompson, but to Detweilor, Bergner’s attorney, and by him applied on the judgment still standing open, without having entered on them the previous payments. In that way they were overpaid. [The attorney for the defendant contends that, as there was no mistake, this money cannot be recovered back. We think otherwise. The action of assumpsit is a most liberal and equitable one ; will lie whenever one man has received money which, in equity and good conscience, belongs to another. This over-payment was not made under any decree or order of court; was not collected by execution, but came into the hands of the'plaintiff’s attorney in the judgment through the purchaser of the house and lot, and was applied by him. Thus Bergner has received the money twice, and cannot .retain it with a good con<a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>science. This is the proper form of action in which to recover it back.] It is said that Bergner was at trouble and expense in effecting the sale of the property to the railroad eompany, which was doubtless the case, and for which he should be liberally paid. Make him a full and fair allowance in settling the claim, and find your verdict for the balance, if anything, which he was overpaid on the judgments.”</p>
