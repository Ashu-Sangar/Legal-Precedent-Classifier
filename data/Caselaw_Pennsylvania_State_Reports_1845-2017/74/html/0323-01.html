After the sale to Metcalf and before he conveyed to Mrs. Perkins, she and her husband made a mortgage to him, then one to Brecht, both which were recorded ; and then executed the Selden mortgage which was not acknowledged by Mrs. Perkins : the Metcalf mortgage was assigned to Brecht.

Joseph C. Selden also, about that time, prepared a mortgage to secure his wards’ claim, and sent it to Mr. and Mrs. Perkins to be executed.

Metcalf testified: * * * “I had a conversation with Mr. Brecht some two or three weeks before the deed was left at the recorder’s office. I then informed him of the arrangement that was made before I sold the property. He, Brecht, knew of this arrangement when he bought my mortgage. I do not know that Brecht ever had any knowledge of the arrangement about the Selden mortgage before the time mentioned. I never had any talk with him about it till he came to me and we had negotiations about selling the mortgage.” * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b325-7" data-blocks='[["BL_325.7",325,[137,929,1162,292]]]'>James Sill testified; * ‡ * “It was, I believe, in January or February 1871, not far from that time, that John Brecht spoke to me about this matter, and my best recollection is that I spoke in general terms of this arrangement, but I could not give him the amount that was due. I think that I told him that the amount was from eight to twelve hundred dollars, though I am not positive on this.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b325-8" data-blocks='[["BL_325.8",325,[136,1232,1162,776]]]'>R. L. Perkins testified: <em>“ </em>On the day of the sale, before the sale, I had conversation with John Brecht on the subject of the sale. I said to John Brecht that if he would not bid on the property that his mortgage should be reinstated on the balance of the farm after what was to be sold to F. P. Bailey was set off to him, Bailey. I do not remember that John Brecht made any reply in words, but seemed to assent and did not bid. By reinstating his claim or mortgage I meant to place him in the same position, in relation to other liens upon the property, that he then held. The property was sold for the nominal sum of five hundred dollars. I am confident Brecht knew of the order in which the liens stood against the property, and Brecht knew that his claim or ljen was the last. I am confident Brecht had knowledge of the Selden lien. After the sheriff’s sale to November Term 1868, I reinstated Brecht’s claim. The only reason I did not reinstate the new Selden mortgage was because I did not think the computation was correct. This farm was worth in May 1871, one hundred dollars an acre; there were about 113 acres of it, all improved.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AAI" data-blocks='[["BL_325.9",325,[135,2008,1162,379]]]'>John Brecht testified: * * * “Perkins saw me when at court, and said that the land was to be sold; that there would be about §4000_ left due to Metcalf ahead of my claim, and Perkins said that the land would be sold and the claim of the mortgage would go on-it again. He said he would give me a new mortgage on the land, but that Metcalf would have a mortgage ahead of mine. I made no reply whatever. I did not attend the sale. The first knowledge I had of this claim known as John C. Selden’s trust was in the winter of 1870-1871.”</p>

But, unfortunately for them, Brecht Ayas not a party to that arrangement, and his mortgage Ayas executed and recorded nearly two years before the Selden mortgage was reinstated, and it is not claimed, and it does not appear in the evidence, that Brecht knew of the arrangement either before or at the time his mortgage Avas executed, but that he knew of it, at most, only a month or two prior to the second Selden mortgage lien being perfected, if perfected it was, Avhich Avas recorded on the 20th day of March 1871, long after Brecht’s lien was perfected.

Selden’s mortgage was not acknowledged before an officer duly authorized by law to take such acknowledgment, and was therefore utterly ineffectual to convey or encumber the estate of Mrs. Perkins. At the time Brecht’s mortgage was executed Mrs. Perkins had no legal title. The deed from the purchaser to her, though executed, had not been delivered, as the auditor reports. If she had an equitable estate —a right to call upon Metcalf to execute and deliver to her a deed — it was an equity grounded upon the agreement of the parties at the sheriff’s .sale, by which she was bound to reinstate all the mortgages upon the part of the land to which she was entitled, according to their respective priorities. A chancellor would not have decreed a conveyance to her from Metcalf, without at the 9same time providing that she should carry out that agreement. It is hardly necessary to observe that the recording of Brecht’s . mortgage, after the delivery of the deed of Metcalf to Mrs. Perkins, did not cure the want of title in Mrs. Perkins at the time she executed th,e mortgage to him.</p>

The eighty-sixth section of the Act of June 16th 1836, Pamph. L. 777, provides that <em>“ </em>in all cases of sales upon execution as afore<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>said, when there shall be disputes concerning the distribution of the money arising therefrom, the court from which the execution shall have issued shall have power, after reasonable notice given, either personally or by advertisement, to hear and determine the same according to law and equity.” At law Mrs. Perkins was entitled to receive the balance of the fund after the payment of the purchase-money to Metcalf, as far as appears no subsequent liens having been presented. Mrs. Perkins did not appear <em>to </em>make any claim. If then Mrs. Perkins was in equity bound by the agreement alleged to reinstate the several mortgages in the order of priority as they stood before the first sheriff’s sale, and a chancellor would have decreed the specific performance of that agreement, then in equity in Pennsylvania whatever a chancellor would decree to be done shall be considered as actually done. The auditor reported that such an agreement was entered into, and on the faith of it Selden allowed the sale to go on and did not bid to secure his interest. It is not perhaps very material whether Brecht was a party to this arrangement or not, but if it be considered important, we think upon the evidence the auditor ought to have reported asa fact that'he was. Perkins testified: “On the day of the sale, at November Term 1868, before the sale, I had a conversation on the subject, of the sale. I said to John Brecht that if he would not bid on the property, that his mortgage should be reinstated on the balance of the farm, after what was to be sold to E. P. Bailey was set off to him, Bailey. I do not remember that John Brecht made any reply in words, but seemed to assent.” John Brecht in his deposition did not deny this, but said he did not know of Selden’s mortgage. But he ought to have known of it. The mortgage was on record, and he had constructive notice of it. His assent was to the arrangement that the sheriff’s sale was not to affect the relative position of those who had liens on the property. It was evidently very much for his interest at the time. A large price was to be obtained for a part of the land, which was to be applied to the reduction of the purchase-money mortgage, thus improving the security of all the parties. We think therefore that the Selden mortgage was entitled in equity to priority of payment over that to Brecht.</p>
