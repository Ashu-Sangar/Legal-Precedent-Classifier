      <em>“ </em>On the 15th day of May 1852, Henry Backenstose executed his last will, which was admitted to probate on the 3d day of January 1864, he having died shortly before this time. The will is extremely contradictory, and hard to be understood; and what <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>adds to the difficulty, his widow, to whom the estate was bequeathed for life, declined taking under the will, and claimed her distributive share under the intestate laws. The testator, amongst other things, directs that within one year after the death of his widow, all of his land shall be sold by his executors, and the money remaining in their hands, after all expenditures, shall be divided into ten equal shares, which he distributes among ten persons named, one of whom now petitions this court to have distribution made according to the terms of the will. This is resisted by the executors, on the ground that they cannot legally do so, the time therefor not having arrived — the widow being in full life. It is contended that the legacies are not vested, but contingent; and that the contingency on which they were to be paid has not yet happened. This depends on the effect of the widow’s renunciation. Although the devises and bequests for the use of the widow are somewhat contradictory, yet we can readily collect from the whole wording of the instrument that she was the main object of the testator’s care and bounty, and that the division of the estate was postponed solely for her benefit. Such being the case when she declined receiving the gift as intended, what was the effect on the other beneficiarios ? This question is answered in terms by the decision of the Supreme Court in Brown and Sterrett’s Appeal, 8 Casey 62, where it is held that when lands are given to a widow for life, and after her death the executors were directed to sell and divide the estate, as the sale was postponed for her benefit, she had the power to waive this advantage, and did so by electing to take under the intestate laws, whereupon her life estate became extinct, and it was the duty of the executors to make sale immediately. Such was the course pursued here, as the executors proceeded to ■sell that portion of the real estate expressly reserved to the wife, ®n her renunciation under the will. Again, it is held in Styer <em>v. </em>Ereas, 3 Harris 339 (see p. 342), that although it is a general .principle that the power to sell on the happening of a certain event •cannot well be executed before it has transpired, yet there arc exceptions. Where an event turns up which the testator had not •contemplated, a court is compelled to inquire how he would have •provided for it had it been foreseen — in short, to suppose an indention for him when he had none. In that case the sale was sanctioned, although the event had not occurred. The principles of this case are virtually recognised in Styer’s Appeal, 9 Harris 86. And where the power to the executors was to sell on the death of the widow, and she joined in making the sale, it was held good. The intention of the testator is to govern, and the postponement having been introduced for the benefit of the widow, she ■could waive it, and the executors could sell before the contingency happened. No one could complain, as no one was injured thereby. •Hast <em>n. </em>Porter, 1 Harris 533. The judge considers that had it <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>not been for the desire to provide for his wife, he would have ordered the whole estate to be immediately sold for the purpose of. distribution. The same principle has been repeatedly recognised where property was demised to a trustee for the use of a married woman during the lifetime of her husband. It was held in one case, Koenig’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 352, that the trust ceased on the divorce of the wife, as the object of the trust was to protect the property against the husband. It matters not what may be the duration of an estate given to a trustee by will. It continues no longer than the thing sought to be secured by the trust demands: Id. 355; Ilill on Trustees 339 <em>et seq. </em>In the case under consideration the executors-were trustees of this property. The real estate was directed to be sold by them, which is the same in legal effect, under the 13th section of the Act of 24th of February 1834, as if it had been devised to them to be sold. The widow’s renunciation under the will had the same legal effect as her natural death. The éxecutors could at once make sale, and distribution among the devisees under the will would immediately follow; all reason for suspending the same 'having ceased. It was all intended for the benefit of the widow, who waived it by her own act.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b147-6" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[138,1300,1171,466]]]'>“ Another question of no small moment and of no inconsiderable difficulty arises under the sixth division of this will, whether the legacies therein given are vested or contingent ? According to our understanding of the law of the- case, the question does not arise at present, and possibly never may, as the devisees therein named may have all been living at the time the widow renounced, or even at present. • We have no sufficient statement of the situation of those devisees, either in the petition'dr answers. That all will be made apparent by the report of the auditor appointed to make distribution, and if the point arises in the report, it must be determined.</p>

We should know the precise situation of every one claiming "an interest before entering on that subject. It must be borne in mind that this will was made in 1852, nearly twenty years ago, and the situation of the devisees may have been greatly changed since that time. Who died and who survived we do not know. Some may have passed off during the fourteen years that the testator lived, and thus the legacies may have lapsed.</p>
