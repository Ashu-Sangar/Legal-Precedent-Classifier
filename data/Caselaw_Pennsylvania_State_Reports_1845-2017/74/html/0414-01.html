In like manner, upon the death of Jonathan without leaving legitimate issue, the land given to him was to be sold, and the proceeds be distributed by the testator’s executors; the residuary portion thereof to be divided among his grandchildren. It is very clear that the testator had the same beneficiaries in his mind in each case. All the authorities concur in saying that the devise over should be considered in determining whether the estate should vest on the death of the first taker. In distributing the proceeds of the land in which his wife had a limited use, he gave the names of the several parents of his grandchildren who were to take; thus fixing beyond any question that the recipients should be no further removed from him. In the latter distribution he does not unnecessarily repeat the names of the parents of his grandchildren, but evidently had the same pei’sons in view. This excludes the idea that the issue of Jonathan had reference to some remote period of the future. The intention to refer to a definite failure of issue is further shown by the fact that he had in his mind the contingency of Jonathan’s dying before all the legacies given to the testator’s daughters had become due, or had been paid out of the residuary estate devised for that purpose. Again, in for ever debarring from the benefit of any bequeath made “ any of my grandchildren who shall be guilty of having an illegitimate child, or is guilty of the sin of intemperance, or that do wickedly and irreverently profane Hod’s holy name,” and in giving it to those of them “whose life and conversation is free from reproach,” he manifestly had in his mind his immediate grandchildren, and excluded the idea of a more remote future, when the character and habits of his beneficiaries should be inquired into. This view is most fully sustained by Johnson <em>v. </em>Currin, 10 Barr 498. There the devise was to testator’s daughter, her heirs and assigns, and “ if any of my daughters die without heirs of their body, their part to be equally divided between the survivors of them, and my grandchildren. Held, an executory devise to the grandchildren and surviving daughters, and not a remainder which could be barred by the first taker. The cases of Lapsley <em>v. </em>Lapsley, 9 Barr 130, and Criley <em>v. </em>Chamberlain, <em>supra, </em>are urged as leading to a different conclusion. <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>Each of those cases was decided under its peculiar circumstances. Neither of them denies that if the whole will clearly indicates a different intention, full effect shall not be given to such intention. The rule is clearly stated in Smith ,on Executory Interests 505, ch. 13, rule 2: “If there are any ^expressions clearly showing that by issue the testator meant children, or particular individuals among his descendants, or any expressions indicative of an intent absolutely inconsistent with or not included in any estate tail in the ancestor, then the word issue'will be construed a word of purchase, if the issue may take as purchasers consistently with the rule against perpetuities; and the ancestor will take an estate for life, with a contingent or vested remainder, as the case may be.” The correctness of this rule is clearly recognised in Sheets’s Estate, 2 P. F. Smith 257; Taylor <em>v. </em>Taylor, <em>supra; </em>Fahrney <em>v. </em>Holsinger, 15 P. F. Smith 388; McCullough <em>v. </em>Fenton, Id. 418; Yarnall’s Appeal, 20 Id. 335.</p>
