The office is at the north-west corner of the building fronting on Garrison alley, from which there is an entrance to it by a door and short flight of steps.

Breed testified: “ 1869 was in service of defendant, clerk in his office; was in office at time plaintiff was hurt. Part of goods from depot were delivered at platform, some at the shed opposite, and some at office-door on alley; it depended very much upon their bulk. The large boxes of bolts were generally delivered at shed; boxes of paints and other things at platform. It depended more upon where they were to be used in the building, than upon the bulk. The greater portion was delivered at some place in the yard, after having gone in the gate. Generally it was light goods that were delivered on alley; the goods from depot were generally taken into yard. It was the business of any of the clerks who happened to be at hand to sign dray-books. Persons in office can see wagon pass the window in the yard. There is a window in wall facing the elevator opening. There was no gas-burner nearer than twenty or twenty-five feet to opening in floor; there was no barricade around opening. There were seventy-five or eighty workmen in this establishment; may have been more. Our men generally took the goods into building after they were left upon the platform. This door at platform was as much a thoroughfare as any door about the building. The first floor is occupied by machinery almost altogether, except at the door. This door is as much a thoroughfare, except it may be the door on alley. The office occupies one corner of the main building, thirty feet by eighteen feet, perhaps. Two doors open into office; there is none from yard into office; the only way to get to office is through the door on Garrison alley or through this door; this door at platform is about eight feet wide; there is a smaller door in it, on left-hand side as you come from the opening, about three feet wide. The opening for elevator is about eighteen or twenty inches from front of large door. This was an elevator used for hoisting things with; one side of elevator was open, next door; the other side was enclosed. * * * There was one door faced the door on <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>Garrison alley; the other was on the side next elevator opening, on side of office which adjoined opening; there was a space'partitioned off, adjoining elevator for a wash and coal room. You passed out this door, went straight forward for eight or nine feet, then turned and went to the left, for perhaps thirteen feet, which would bring you to door opening on platform; the door on Garrison alley has a platform with steps leading up. There is quite a large double door which leads into a small space or entry. There was a sign above it, ‘ Office.’ It is nailed on door-cheek and projects; the letters were probably six or eight inches in size; there is no glass in door, but a large glass above it, perhaps twenty lights of 8 by 10 glass. The sign is above the door. Immediately opposite this door is an opening into the works, and diagonally across entry is a door leading into office. On the door leading into works in the entry, there was a notice, ‘ No admittance without permission from the office.’ The door on Garrison alley is thirty feet from corner. The door into works is generally closed; open when there is any necessity for it. There are windows lookout into alley between door and where you turn into open space. * * * The long way of office is perhaps twenty feet, and that brings you to the elevator. This glass partition is the division between office and elevator; the wall of building makes another side of elevator: this closet partitioned off, and opening into the office formed another side of elevator, and the fourth side next this large door at platform was open ; when the small door at platform was open, the side of it is five or six feet from elevator. One entering there would have to go four if not five paces before he came to opening of elevator; in going from the door in large one to go to office-door you would go directly forward for thirteen or fourteen feet, and about five feet from elevator, as you would go forward you would draw a little to the right; having gone thus far you would go directly to the right; around this partition forming the closet, go forward eight or nine feet to office-door. You could not get into office by going across this elevator, there is no door there. Was on premises before and after accident; there was no obstruction in this passage from small door at platform to office-door; it Avas open ; there Avas a notice at this platform door, ‘No admittance without permission from the office;’ think it-read, ‘ Positively no admittance,’ &amp;c.

There Avas a tAvo-story building across this open space ; there was a door in it opposite the large door. This small door was' used for persons running in and out, for carrying -small packages through, and for running a Avheelbarrow through. This door, which I have described, is as much a thoroughfare as any other; was used by workmen about the building, going in and <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>out building and attending to their work about the yard; that is what I meant by a thoroughfare, that it was used by the men employed about building, as much as any other door; the manufactory was in operation at the time of accident; the fans were in operation; they made quite a large noise — a heavy noise and jarring. The elevator was in use at time of accident. I might say it is in constant use, almost constantly passing from one floor to another, it may seldom stand idle, we use it for moving material from one floor to another; there are five stories in building and a cellar. My recollection is, that it was pretty dark, think it was fifteen or twenty minutes after five that accident occurred; we stop factory one-quarter to six. It was a dark Monday evening; it was nearly night, still twilight to a certain extent, but was rapidly getting on to be dark. Gas was lit in office. We usually light up on such an evening about four or half past four o’clock. * * * The persons who used this door were workmen; and persons who delivered freights there went into that door and went in there. Having entered that door, they would go around to office-door. We generally came out to receive the freight; when persons went in they would go in and around to office-door; sometimes they would come to window and rap; when they did come in, they would go in that way. When loading or unloading elevator, this opening was used; things were carried over it. The sign was legible; it had beep up some time, and bore weather-marks; it faced the entrance, so that a person entering yard could see it; in such a way as this, we could not see it very far.”</p>

      <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>At the time of the injury, the plaintiff was in company with the driver of the team, assisting in the delivery of the goods to the defendant. He was further charged with the duty of procuring a receipt therefor. With the receipt-book in his hands, he entered the door on the way to the office, for the purpose of procuring the receipt. In ignorance of the hole, passing along, with the gaslight from the office thrown in his face, but not upon the hole, he fell therein. He had entered the same door through which other employees of Haney &amp; Co. had been accustomed to pass for a like purpose. The plaintiff was at the defendant’s works for a lawful purpose, and upon business which made it proper for him to go to the office. Whether he had a right to enter that particular door which he did enter, for the purpose of passing to the office, and whether, having entered, he was afterwards guilty of negligence, should have been submitted to the jury. We think, therefore, the learned judge erred in directing a nonsuit.</p>

Where a person was killed while standing upon a platform between two tracks, by a passing train overlapping a portion of the platform, it wras held admissible to show that the railroad company caused the platform to be removed the day after: Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Henderson, 1 P. F. Smith 315. The same principle is affirmed in West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>McElwee, 17 P. F. Smith 311.</p>
