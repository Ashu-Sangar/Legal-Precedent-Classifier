He also found that, prior to June 5th 1868, an amount of money more than sufficient to have paid and discharged all that indebtedness, had been assessed and collected. It had not been so applied, and the obligations remained unpaid.

The irregular settlements made with the township auditors were so unsatisfactory that they failed to enlighten him. Many of the papers had been destroyed.
