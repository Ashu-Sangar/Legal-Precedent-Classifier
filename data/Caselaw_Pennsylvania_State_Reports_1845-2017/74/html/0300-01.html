    <p id="b305-8" data-blocks='[["BL_305.8",305,[128,1606,1173,822]],["BL_306.1",306,[301,390,1161,131]]]'>A sale of land upon a judgment recovered upon a mortgage was held to confer a good title upon the purchaser, although the defendant ivas dead when the first writ of sci. fa. issued, and the sheriff returned that there were no terre-tenants: Warder <em>v. </em>Tainter, <a href="/watts/4/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="4 Watts 270" data-case-ids="1842713" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0270-01">4 Watts 270</a>. This Act of 1705 applies to cases of judgments reversed for errors of fact as well as errors of law: <a href="/watts/4/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="4 Watts 270" data-case-ids="1842713" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0270-01">Id.</a> It extends to cases where the judgment and all subsequent proceedings were set aside after the sale: Hays <em>v. </em>Shannon, <a href="/watts/5/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="5 Watts 548" data-case-ids="1844029" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0548-01">5 Watts 548</a>. So where the original judgment was void, but it had been revived by the issuing of two writs of sci. fa. post annum et diem, each of which was returnedmM, anda sale of land made thereon, it was held to pass a good title to the purchaser: Feger <em>v. </em>Kroh, <a href="/watts/6/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="6 Watts 294" data-case-ids="1846045" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0294-01">6 Watts 294</a>. A judgment regularly revived by sci. fa. is not void, even if the original judgment was void. A sci. fa. is a substitute here for an action of debt elsewhere ; the judgment on it is <em>quod recuperet </em>instead of a bare award of execution, it therefore' warrants the awarding of the execution : Hays <em>v. </em>Shannon, <em>supra. </em>The last judgment cannot be considered invalid, although it was entered on a sci. fa. issued on a previous judgment that was void.: <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>Buehler’s Heirs <em>v. </em>Buffington <em>et </em>al., <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20278" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="7 Wright 278">7 Wright 278</a>. The new judgment being regular upon its face and voidable only, has a sufficient vitality to support the sale.</p>
    <p id="b306-15" data-blocks='[["BL_306.6",306,[302,522,1163,419]]]'>The case of Dorrance <em>v. </em>Scott, <a href="/whart/3/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="3 Whart. 309" data-case-ids="1833424" data-case-paths="/whart/3/0309-01">3 Whart. 309</a>, is not in entire accord with the other cases cited, yet it is distinguishable in two particulars. The original judgment was entered upon a bond executed by a married woman and therefore absolutely void; and the revived judgment was. upon a sci. fa. <em>quare executionem. </em>I may further add, that it was not an action to recover the land from the purchaser at sheriff’s sale, but was one of lien and the distribution of the proceeds of the sale. The protective Act of 1705 does not appear to have been referred to by either the counsel or the court.</p>
    <p id="b306-16" data-blocks='[["BL_306.7",306,[303,951,1162,347]]]'>The answer covered by the first assignment is somewhat obscure. The record showed the equitable plaintiff in the judgment to have been the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale. That fact was unquestioned. The court should therefore have answered in more specific terms that, if Guthrie claimed and received the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale, or any part thereof, he was estopped from controverting the validity of the sale, although'the plaintiff in the judgment was also the purchaser.</p>
    <p id="b306-17" data-blocks='[["BL_306.8",306,[306,1298,1156,83]]]'>This rule applies whether the sale was void or only voidable : Smith <em>v. </em>Warden, 7 Harris 424.</p>
    <p id="b306-18" data-blocks='[["BL_306.9",306,[348,1385,713,42]]]'>The other assignments are not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b306-19" data-blocks='[["BL_306.10",306,[422,1427,1000,43]]]'>Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>
