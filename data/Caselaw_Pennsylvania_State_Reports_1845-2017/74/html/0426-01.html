Brady &amp; Co., and was introduced by Mr. Brady to Mr. Cowen, and was asked the question as to the probable value of land in Washington county. I answered the question by stating that in my judgment lands were worth from seventy to eighty dollars per acre. Mr. Cowen then commenced to open a conversation with me regarding a negotiation with James T. Brady &amp; Co. I stopped him by saying that I had no connection with Mr. Brady’s .house, and did not desire to know anything in reference to his business negotiations. I did this because I thought Mr. Cowen was under the impression that I was connected with the banking-house. On the 17th day of October 1871, the mortgages, certificates of no defence and prothonotary’s certificates were all before the bank. The assignment of the bond was made there, that day by Mr. Brady, for his bank, and the memoranda on the mortgages made by Mr. Brady, agreeing to have the mortgages assigned to the bank on the record of Washington county. Previous to the purchasing of these securities by the bank, I had no conversation or understanding with James T. Brady &amp; Co., regarding their probable purchase by the bank; nor do I know of any director or other officer of the bank having any such understanding. * * * On the 10th day of October 1870, at a meeting of the board of directors, the treasurer, as is the custom, informed them that he had considerable funds to invest in proper securities, and as a large portion of the money was payments on the capital stock of the bank, it would not be checked against. He thought it advisable to make an investment in some long loan. Mr. James T. Brady then stated to the board that he had some mortgages which <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>had eight years to run, or nearly. He made a statement of the amounts respectively, and they aggregated f40,000. The matter of making so large an investment in a single transaction was fully discussed by the members of the board. Seven of the nine members were then present, one or two of the members offering objections to these particular securities- because the lands securing the loan were situated in a county other than Allegheny county, Pa. But after a free discussion, their objections were withdrawn, and the board agreed to make the negotiation, provided the titles were good, and the terms satisfactory. These securities were taken precisely in the same form and the same manner that we now, and ever have, taken securities for the bank. * * * The bank had no knowledge of what James T. Brady &amp; Co. made by the negotiation of these securities. Speaking about the bank I mean myself, for I presume no other member of the board would have any knowledge. These were not negotiated differently from all other securities taken by us. I' know distinctly and positively that the securities were not taken by Mr. Brady in trust for the Duquesne Savings Bank, or for the bank. The connection of this bank with that of the firm of James T. Brady &amp; Co. is of the same character as that held with our eastern correspondents, namely, that we keep a deposit account there, and eheclt upon it regularly as we do with other banking institutions with which we have accounts; and James T. Brady, of the firm of James T. Brady &amp; Co., has no more to do with this bank, than the other directors and stockholders have. * * * I don’t think that any officer of the bank made inquiry of the Cowens as to whether they had any set-off or defence to the payment of these securities, because the bank had in their possession the certificates to that effect, signed by the Cowens respectively, and therefore took it for granted that they had no set-off to- the payment of the same. To the best of my recollection and knowledge the bonds, mortgages, certificates of prothonotary, and certificates of no defence, were delivered into the custody of the bank at one and the same time, by Mr. Brady, or by some one for him.”</p>

The question then presents itself whether the certificates of no defence, given contemporaneously with the execution of a mortgage which is usurious, will avail in the hands of an assignee who makes no inquiry of the debtors of any kind, at the time of the assignment. Bonds are expressly made transferable by an Act of Assembly, and as such are an article of commerce. A man may bonfi fide purchase any security he can at the lowest possible price, and not be liable for the penalties of usury.

      <em>“ </em>The general rule is that the assignee takes subject to the equities of the assignor. The exception is, where inquiry is made and a defence precluded.

It is settled that any transaction, however artificial it may be, the effect of <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>which would be an evasion of the statute, may be set aside in so far as it is usurious. The certificates' of no defence were entirely nugatory, so far as James T. Brady &amp; Co. were concerned, had the obligors refused to pay its usury and gave no right to James T. Brady which was not already given by the mortgage. Any right to enforce the usurious contract which the Duquesne Bank might have, cannot be claimed through James T. Brady &amp; Co. The firm not possessing that right, have hot assigned such a right to the bank. To hold that the certificates protected the bank because of their new tradition by James T.

That he occupied a position in the transaction which was adverse to the bank, cannot relieve it from the consequences of his silence, when the bank has confided to him, as its chief officer, the duty of protecting its interests.

The Duquesne Bank, as assignee of Brady &amp; Co., stood in no better position than they, these securities not being negotiable. The bank, however, sets up certificates given by the Cowens to Brady &amp; Co., a part of the machinery to enable them to effectuate the usury, declaring that they have no set-off of defence to the payment of the judgment and mortgages, and that the whole sum is justly due and payable. The bank alleges that the Cowens are estopped by the certificates from setting up the usury.

He finds this from a variety of circumstances: the relation of James Brady as president of the bank; the intimacy of Campbell, the treasurer, with the firm of Brady &amp; Co., his frequent visits there; the practice of Brady &amp; Co. in selling their claims to the bank, and the discount at which Brady sold this claim; the testimony of Brady that when the mortgages-were offered by him to the bank, the matter was fully and elaborately discussed in the board of directors, and the hesitation on part of some of the members; his telling them he did not care whether they took the mortgages or not, and their final agreement to purchase at three per cent, per annum discount off, allowing Brady &amp; Co. for the use of the money while they held the mortgages; the price paid by the bank to Brady &amp; Co., $30,690 ; Brady &amp; Co.’s profits, $607.18, and the additional interest paid them, making a profit of about $1000. These are significant facts, making it highly probable the bank knew that Brady &amp; Co. had advanced on these securities a sum less by their profits than the sum paid by the bank. Looking at the relations between Brady and Brady &amp; Co. and the bank, the discussions about the purchase, the difficulty among the members of the board, the amount of the securities, $40,000, the time the debt had to run, and the sum paid by the bank, $30,690, and allowing Brady &amp; Co. for the use of the money while they held the securities, included in a calculation of the profits of Brady &amp; Co., it cannot be believed that the bank supposed for a moment Brady &amp; Co. had advanced to the Cowens the full $40,000. The master has found the knowledge of the bank, and the court has confirmed his finding. We cannot say there was plain mistake in this finding ; indeed the probabilities are with it; and we must take the fact to be true that the bank knew of the sum paid to the Cowens by Brady &amp; Co., and consequently knew of the usury. The defence is one under a statute which lays its hands upon the usury as an illegal act; contrary therefore to equity also; and it becomes the duty of all courts to maintain the law. The bank taking the securities with a knowledge of the usury, it cannot set up the certificates given to Brady &amp; Co. as an estoppel. If by such a device the usury can be upheld, the law may be avoided in a most easy manner.</p>
