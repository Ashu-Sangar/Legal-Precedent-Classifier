They were to build a freight and passenger depot on a piece of ground I deeded to them the same day. I wanted them to give it to me in writing, as it was not in the deed. Mr. Phillips said he would give it to me any time, as he had not time then ; he had to go away. He said it was not necessary, but he would give it any time. They said they would give their word of honor that they would do everything they had promised. This was before I signed the release. I would not have signed the release if I had not believed them. They said it would make my property worth double to have the depot there. They were there about an hour; maybe not so long. They went oif immediately after I signed the deed of release. They had been there several times before that day on the same business. McCullough was there some three or four times, and Mr. Phillips, I think, twice. I think the second time they came, they left the deed for the ground forme to examine. The right of way was embodied in that deed at first — both the ground for the depot lot and the right of way. I refused to sign it. He said it was not drawn up according to orders at all. The solicitor had drawn it up, he said. The next time they had both deeds with them. I then executed them, after an alteration being made in the deed for the ground. They talked over this matter before I signed the release at several interviews. They never did what they said. * * * I told Mr. McCullough that there was a report out that they were going to take the depot to Phillipsburg. He assured me they would go on and put it up, just as they had agreed to. They never put the building up. * * * Phillips said if I did not let it go on my ground, he would have to put it further up, and that would injure my property. I told him I would let him have about an acre to put a depot on for a thousand dollars, and would give him the right of way rather than it should go below. Didn’t tell Col. Phillips I would take a thousand dollars and make him a release and deed. I would not have taken $2000 at that time for that lot for any other purpose. * * * I told him I would give him an acre to put the depot on for one thousand dollars, and they were not to use it for anything else. I was paid the one thousand dollars. The terms agreed upon about the right of way were, <em>‘ </em>that they were to take the buildings down and build the roads.’ He, Phillips, did agree to build a depot on the lot that he gave $1000 for. They pledged their honor that they would do these things. The promises were made as to both bargains. I did not ask Col. Phillips to put in the $1000 deed a covenant in regard to the freight and passenger depot. My wife would not sign the deed till the covenant about taverns, &amp;c., was inserted. I requested <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>that it be put in writing as agreed, and they said it was not at all necessary. Col.

Philips and Mr. McCullough coming to our house about the right of way. Recollect signing the deed for the depot lot. They were there three times, I think. Their first errand was the right of way. The second time they came they proposed to buy the acre of ground for a freight and passenger depot, and what an advantage it would be to our property — that it would double it. Col. Phillips and Mr. McCuilough came the day we signed the deed. They sent for me to come and sign the paper. I was not willing to do it unless Col. Phillips would give it <em>‘ </em>in writing’ all that he intended and promised to do. Mr. Phillips said the property would be worth double. I said I could not see it. I said, how would it be if our living was taken away from us ? We were then getting our living by store and freight. He said Watterson could make more money after they got their buildings up by selling salt; that business would be ‘ brisker ’ than at present. I wanted it put in writing, or put <em>on </em>the deed I signed. They said they had not room, or had not time, but would give me papers to that effect if I would sign it. Phillips said if we would give them the right of way the property would be worth so much more. I insisted on their doing what they said. I said I would not have a tavern or restaurant on the lot. Phillips said to McCullough that it did not amount to much, they could put that in. They were to have the right of way for one dollar, if they would go on and put up the building, that is, if I understand the writings. This was all before the papers were’signed. After the papers were signed they both left. I was out several times and was waiting for Phillips and McCullough to give-us in writing what they agreed to do. They sent for me again. Mr. Phillips said it was not necessary, and they had not time at present; that he would give me his word and honor that he would do all he agreed to. Then I took the deed and signed it, but told the justice of the peace that I did not do it with a good will, without they would give us the <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>writings.

He said we ought to give him the right of way and the ground for less, as putting the buildings on would double the property. He said the railroad would make our property double what it was. He used that as an argument. Phillips first asked for the acre of ground. The right of way was not then mentioned. Phillips came back and said he would give the thousand dollars, and that was the bargain for that lot. They were to have the right of way for $1 if they would do what they said. This was with Col. Phillips. He said he would put up the buildings and make that the main point for Clarion county.”</p>

I asked him what he would take for a certain piece of ground near his house, containing about an acre. * * * I asked him what he would take for it. He said $1000. I told him I thought it too much. I went to Watterson and offered if he would give me that piece of ground and the right of way for $10001 would close with him. He agreed to take it. We were to make a stone wall, move his stable, or pay for a school-house. If the warehouse should have to be moved, we were to do it. I told Mr. Watterson that we wanted to build a freight and passenger depot on the lot, but it was never spoken of as a part of the consideration. That was the <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>agreement we made. Mr. Gulden made out the deed, and in it he embodied the right of way. When the paper was presented to me I stated it was not drawn in the manner I would like to have. I preferred to have it divided — put in the $1000 for the lot and for the deed of right of way. I wanted the consideration for right of way to be put in as one dollar. About three weeks after I had the deed prepared, as agreed upon with Mr. Watterson, we had the deed of release, and went to Mr. Watterson. Presented the deeds to Watterson. He looked over them. Watterson read over the papers, then went into an adjoining room and talked to Mrs.’ Watterson. Came out and remarked Mrs. Watterson did not feel willing to sign the deed for this acre of ground. I asked what the objection was. He said she was not willing to sign it unless we were willing to insert the provision about the tavern or restaurant. I told Mr. Watterson that I thought it was entirely unnecessary to insert that, for our charter prohibited us from embarking in tavern-keeping business.' He still insisted, and I turned to Mr. McCullough and directed him to put it in. It was put in, then handed it to Mr. Watterson, who took the pen and signed it. His wife was in the room at the time. . Mrs. Watterson took the deed into another room, Esq. Hall accompanying her. She signed the deed. Release was signed at the same time. Both were acknowledged by Esq. Hall. Nothing was said that day except what I have told you. * * * Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Watterson ever asked me to even build a depot. They asked me to put in writing the building of a stone wall, or pay him for doing it — to take down, or pay him for it, the wash-house, school-house, stable and blacksmith-shop, and we were to pay for the stable. I told him that that was not necessary, and pledged him that it should be carried out precisely as agreed upon, for we were going right on. Neither Mr. or Mrs. Watterson asked me to put in writing that we would build a depot on the lot we bought. I paid the thousand dollars, built the stone wall, two hundred feet long, four feet at top.” * * *</p>

The first question in the case arises on the measure of evidence necessary to establish the agreement for the erection of the depot; and this turns on the release of the right of way given by the plaintiff to the company. This paper is not printed for our inspection, but we presume, as there has been no controversy upon its terms, it was in the ordinary form, giving the right to enter and build the road, and releasing the value of the land occupied, and all damages arising out of its location and use. If the proof of the contract to build a depot on the one-acre lot does not contradict the terms or legal effect of the release, only the ordinary measure of evidence would be required to establish the contract, to wit: so much as would incline the weight of evidence to the side of the plaintiff. But if the evidence contradicts the release or its legal effect, it must possess the measure necessary to prove fraud or plain mistake, to wit, that which is clear and satisfactory.</p>
    <p id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.6",216,[284,1142,1164,980]]]'>In what respect does the agreement to erect the depot contradict the release ? We can perceive none. It does not contradict the consideration of one dollar paid by the company: that money might be paid and the contract also be made to build the depot. Indeed, the nominal consideration in the release would lead to a ready inference, that something else was the consideration of a right of way through a mile and a quarter of land. It does not contradict the terms of the release itself. These are all admitted by the plaintiff, and indeed he rests upon them as the reason and consideration of the railroad company’s promise to erect the depot. In no respect can we perceive that the plaintiff gainsays or desires to disprove or alter the release. On the other hand, it does not seem to follow, because the railroad company agreed to pay a nominal consideration of one dollar, that they did not promise to do something else as an equivalent for the right they obtained. The agreement to erect the depot is independent and executory— something to be done in the future; and does not conflict with the release. Both may stand together. The case of Weaver <em>v. </em>Wood, 9 Barr 220, is directly in point on this question. To this may be added Hayden <em>v. </em>Mentzer, 10 S. &amp; R. 323; Strawbridge <em>v. </em>Cutledge, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 394" data-case-ids="481803" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0394-01">7 W. &amp; S. 394</a>. The court erred, therefore, in the measure of proof, which, said the court, must be clear, strong and indubitable.</p>
    <p id="b216-7" data-blocks='[["BL_216.7",216,[285,2131,1160,304]],["BL_217.1",217,[129,403,1173,1559]]]'>The next question is upon the effect of the agreement. The contract for the depot, when found by the jury, would stand before them with equal effect, as if it had been reduced to writing, and then arises the question of damages. The court below held the measure of damages to be the same as that given to the owner of land taken by the company under a legal proceeding ; that is to say, the difference in the value between what his property was <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>worth before the railroad was located through it, and its value after completion of the road, with interest on such amount. See answer to plaintiff’s fifth point. But if a written agreement to build a depot had been given when the release was delivered, how would the case stand ? Clearly this would have introduced a new element. Whether this would increase or diminish the value to be assessed in a legal proceeding would not now be a question: for this, it is to he presumed, the parties considered when they made the contract. It must he presumed the company considered it better for them to erect the depot, in order to obtain the right of way, than it would be to go to law and take the chances. Such being the effect of the agreement, the terms of the question of damages would be changed. Instead, then, of the question being the difference in value of the land before and after the building of the road, considering all advantages and disadvantages to the owner, the question would be upon the additional value which would accrue to the plaintiff’s land in the event of erecting such a depot as" the contract called for. Under the contract, whatever specific advantages would accrue to the land from the adjacent depot and station, would have to be added to the plaintiff’s claim, for this would be his loss in case of a breach of the contract. While the profits of his business cannot be added to his damages, for these are speculative and uncertain, the business advantages, which constitute the characteristics of the land and give it value, are not to be thrown out of consideration in determining the value of the land. Clearly, if the depot and station would make the plaintiff’s land more valuable as a place of business, by bringing to it business it would not possess without them, they give greater value to the land to the extent of the increase by reason of their being placed there, and therefore, fall within the scope of the contract. They were the thing bargained for, and the consequent loss would 'fall within the damages, to the extent they would have added to the value of the land. The ruling of the court excluded this element of value given by the contract, and confined the measure of damages as if no contract had been made. This was an error. In other respects we perceive nothing requiring comment.</p>
