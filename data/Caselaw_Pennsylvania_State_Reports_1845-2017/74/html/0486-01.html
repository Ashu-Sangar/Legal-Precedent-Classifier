Some of the local taxes I could not put down, as they were not given to me. I did not make the entries for the two years last past all in one year. * * *’ I did not get all in the book until a few months before the sale. I had some in before the 1st of last January; not three months before. * * * I always carried forward the previous valuations, unless otherwise directed by the county commissioners. * * * I know it was in my regular routine of business. In my experience the heading and the taxes columns would be carried out for the two years, the first. I always took the valuation from the valuation of the previous years, without any direct orders from the county commissioners to that effect. The object of keeping this book was to make up the record for the treasurer’s sale. When this book was once made out and finished, then the treasurer made up his sale-book from it. It is not the habit of the county for the county commissioners to receive taxes for unseated lands. A man having taxes to pay must go to the county treasurer. The treasurer would have nothing in his office to enable him to receive taxes, other than what he obtained from this book. Until this book was made up, there was no manner by which a man could pay his taxes on unseated land. * * * To make this book two things were necessary. 1. The valuation; and next, the rate <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>of taxes. "We always had the rate of taxation established by the commissioners, and the valuation we took from the previous years without any special orders upon that subject by the commissioners. I do not know that the assessors of the county ever acted upon the valuation of unseated lands. I did at one time request them to return the unseated lands, and furnished them with lists. It was since 1867. They returned them in such condition that I could not use them. Before that time I do not know of any instance in which the assessor appraised or valued the unseated lands of the county. I know of one or two instances in which the taxes were entered in this book only a day or two before the sale. I know that some were entered so late that they could not be taken into the account, and had to be carried on to succeeding sale. * * * My impression is that each and every year, immediately after the assessments of the county taxes, the county taxes were carried out in this book. * * * After the rates of taxes were fixed, by the county commissioners, the treasurer could ascertain, by a matter of calculation, the county taxes. * * * The county tax was always ascertained after the rate was fixed. * * * I think that soon after the commissioners fixed the county rates, I carried the county taxes out in the columns. I cannot state any particular time that the - entries were made. When I was treasurer I frequently examined their books. I had no difficulty at any time in ascertaining the amount of county and state tax. This book was made up as a record to show all parties how much they had to pay on their tracts. Sometimes the road, poor, school and bounty taxes were in them. The bounty taxes of Coal township were not in time for the sale previous to the last, and were carried into the last sale. * * * When I said that the county taxes could be ascertained after the rates were fixed by the commissioners, I mean by taking the previous valuation.”</p>

The Act of Assembly of the 12th of April 1842, which is remedial in all its provisions (Purdon 901, pi. 8), declares that “ all records of the county commissioners charging lands as unseated, with arrears of taxes, shall be evidence of an assessment.” I am therefore of opinion, and so instruct you, that there is evidence in this case of an assessment upon the tracts of land mentioned and described on the commissioners’ books.

This is a question to be determined by^you under all the evidence in the cause. The rate per cent, being fixed, and a valuation or assessment by the proper authorities constitute an assessment. The work of calculating and carrying out the amount or sums due on each tract is merely clerical and can be done at any time when any person wishes to pay the tax, and the time when the calculations were made and carried out on the books are not so material, the question is, when was the assessment made and the rate of tax fixed, and when made was the land unseated. If it was unseated at the time the assessment was made, then a subsequent occupation or seating of it will not affect the validity of the sale. The fact, whether the land was seated or unseated at the time the tax ivas assessed, is for the jury. As soon as a person enters upon an unseated tract of land, whether as an intruder or tenant, under a lease from the owner, and becomes a resident upon it, or without becoming a resident improves and occupies it in such a way as to furnish upon the land the means of making and levying the taxes by distress, it is considered in law as seated, and no longer liable to be assessed with taxes and sold for them if they remain unpaid. A tract ceases to be unseated as soon as it is actually occupied with a view to permanent use as the property of the occupant. If the jury believe from the evidence that the land in controversy was actually assessed and the rates fixed by the proper authorities as early as February 3d 1864, when the commissioners fixed the rate of county taxes at two mills on the dollar, and the land was then unseated, the sale on the — day of June 1866, by the county treasurer, being more than one year after the taxes were due and remained unpaid, passed a good title to the purchaser, but, if the jury find that the taxes were not assessed and the rates fixed by the county commissioners until after the lands had become seated, then the <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>purchaser acquired no title by the tax sale.

The maxim that ‘all acts are presumed to have been rightly and regularly done ’ applies with force to a treasurer’s sale, for where acts are of an official nature, or require the action or concurrence of official persons, a presumption arises in favor of their due' execution.

In the main, it was a fair exposition of the law applicable to the facts. The statement that the valuations are to be made and returned by the township assessors, and that these returns, with their valuations and the rates affixed, constitute a legal assessment, was made in answer to a point, and repeated in the charge evidently in consequence of a contest upon <em>the </em>question, what constitutes a true assessment ? It cannot be expected that the court shall refrain from any expression of opinion upon subjects of contest before it, nor is it error when the court clearly puts the case to the jury on its true question. The following cases show that the court did not mistake the character of a regular assessment: Wells <em>v. </em>Smyth, 5 P. F. Smith 159, where the eases are collected; Lyman <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, 6 P. F. Smith 501; McReynolds <em>v. </em>Longenberger, 7 Id. 13. But the court did not charge that the plaintiff was bound to prove such an assessment in order to support a sale for taxes; and on the contrary, referring to the Act of 12th April 1842, making all the records of the county commissioners <em>charging </em>lands as unseated with arrears of taxes evidence of assessment, the judge expressly instructed the jury that there was evidence of an assessment upon <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>the tracts of land mentioned and described in the commissioners’ books, and that those books ‘were evidence of an assessment, by virtue of the act, without other evidence of action on the part of township assessors. The same instruction is conveyed in answer to the third and fourth points, and is repeated and enlarged upon in the last part of the charge. It is in vain to contend that the jury must have been constrained by the definition of a regular assessment to consider it as binding on them in their finding. They were clearly and often informed that under the Act of 1842, the commissioners’ book containing the charges against this body of lands, and for which they were sold, was sufficient to support the sale. The judge took fairly the distinction, arising upon the Act of 1842, which is taken by our brother Sharswood in the case of Hess <em>v. </em>Herrington, 23 P. F. Smith 438, holding that when such evidence exists, the <em>irregularity </em>in the actual assessment, if any, is aided by the fourth section of the Act of 13th March 1815, declaring that “ no alleged irregularity in the assessment or in the process or otherwise, shall be construed or taken to affect the title of the purchaser, but the same shall be declared to be good and legal.” There was but one particular in which the judge deemed the book deficient, and this he properly submitted to the jury, to wit: the time when the assessment in the commissioners’ book was made. There was no evidence whatever on the face of the book of the precise time of making the assessment, or of making the entry in the book, and none appeared in the minutes of the commissioners. The fact was, therefore, necessarily submitted to the jury on the evidence, and with the distinct instruction of the court, that presumptively the assessment was made in the year 1864, a presumption most favorable to the plaintiff; otherwise the evidence itself left the jury pretty much at sea, without star or compass.</p>

But this entry does not stand alone, and is followed by subsequent entries on the minutes, tending to show that the assessment was not complete on the 3d of February 1864, and that the sum stated was only the intended rate for all county taxes, on seated as w’ell as unseated lands. The entry on the minutes, March 25th 1864, that a full board of commissioners met and signed the assessment-books, shows that the general assessment was not then complete. “ Books” here is in the plufal, and evidently refers to the assessment-books for the several townships, commonly called duplicates, which is strengthened by the entry on the 20th of April following, that “ the board of commissioners fix the rate of county tax at two mills on the dollar for the year 1864.” This minute of the final fixing of the rate wears a final aspect not belonging to the minute of 3d February preceding, <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>which looks more like a prospective intent. It' seems to be very evident that the general assessment of county tax for all purposes was not complete until at least the 20th of April 1864, while as to the unseated lands there is strong evidence of incompleteness even then. This uncertainty of time makes it evident that the subsequent minutes of November 20th 1865, November 30th 1865, and December 13th 1865, were not irrelevant. Taking them in connection with the mode of keeping the commissioners’ book by biennial periods, it looks very much as if the commissioners of Northumberland county were very irregular in their mode of dealing with the unseated lands, and as if they thought it quite sufficient to have the unseated-land list completed in time for the treasurer to advertise the list for sale every second year. Undoubtedly they had no authority thus to link together the years 1864 and 1865, and to change the rate for 1864, after they had duly assessed the unseated lands for that year; but such being their irregular action, we cannot say that the court erred in receiving these minutes as evidence upon the question of fact, when they actually completed the assessment for 1864. It cannot be truly said that these entries on the minutes throw no light on the question of fact, and therefore, we cannot pronounce them so irrelevant as to make their admission erroneous. The time of the actual and final assessment was important to the defendants’ case, for, if the land was seated, as the evidence tends to show, early in March 1864, before final assessment, or if the assessment was, in point of fact, not made until within a year before the time of sale, the treasurer’s sale conveyed no title.</p>
    <p id="b500-6" data-blocks='[["BL_500.6",500,[325,1553,1164,864]],["BL_501.1",501,[136,424,1178,695]]]'>' The argument is fallacious that the rate of February 3d 1864, assuming it to be the fixed determination of the rate, is to be referred to the preceding triennial assessment in 1862, and thus to constitute a complete assessment in 1864. Fixing a rate is not charging the land with a tax, though the rate is essential to the charge. The property to be taxed in the unseated list must be ascertained and individuated before it can become the subject of a charge. While the triennial assessment is the basis of the subsequent annual assessment, and the valuation then fixed will remain, unless changed by reason of alterations in the property, it does not <em>per se </em>constitute the annual assessment of the property Avith taxes. The charging of lands Avith taxes is an annual process, for the reason that neither the property itself, nor its ownership, necessarily continues for triennial periods. The commissioners Avould have no right to reject the annual returns, and falling back upon the last triennial return, make their charges upon it. The six tracts, the subject of the return in 1862, in one body, might have been disconnected by sales, or changed by improvements; part might, under different owners, become seated and not subject to sale, leaving others unseated and liable to be charged as unseated. <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>Of necessity, the charging of the lands as unseated for any year, must be the act of that year, having relation to individual properties as then existing, and cannot be made good by reference to the state of the property in the preceding triennial period. It is true in this ease, the property remained without change, but this did not affect the duty of the commissioners to charge it specially with the taxes of 1864. <em>We </em>are, therefore, brought back to the commissioners’ book and the assessment of 1864 contained in it, as the only evidence of the assessment for that year, and as there was nothing in it to exhibit the time of the assessment, there must -be a resort to indépendont or outside facts to determine the true time. This brought in, necessarily, all the acts of the commissioners found in the minutes of their proceedings relating to the unseated lands, which could throw any light on the main question, when did they complete their assessment of unseated lands for the year 1864.</p>
