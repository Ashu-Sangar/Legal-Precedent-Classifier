The precise question does not appear to have been hitherto considered by this court. If both the claimants were grandchildren of the intestate, so that they would take <em>per capita, </em>the doctrine of advancements made to them might not apply.

It is equally clear that it was not the design of the law-makers to put a grandchild upon higher ground than a child would occupy if living. It is true, the letter of the statute says, “if any child” shall have been advanced. In many eases, however, both in England and in America, it has been held that the word “ child ” may apply to, and include “ grandchild.” The English statute of 22 and 23 Car. II., ch. 10, from which our Act of April 8th 1833, <em>supra, </em>as well as all of our former acts, .relating to distribution, are derived, provides, that “if a child” shall be advanced ; yet it is there held to extend to a grandchild, the father being dead: 1 Eq. Ab. 381, B., pi. 6; 382, B., pi. 8, 9,10,11. Grandchildren and great-grandchildren are all children, and come within that to certain purposes: Wyth <em>v. </em>Blackman, 1 Ves. Sr. 196. It is allowed by all, that if no children are in being, grandchildren would come in under the word children, and may be thereby described: 2 Vern. 106; s. c. Ambler 555. So grandchildren may take under the description of “ children” in a will: Royle <em>v. </em>Hamilton, 4 Ves. 437.

It would have been better, however, if the statutes on this subject had been explicit, and not have imposed upon courts the necessity of extending by construction and equity the meaning of the word child, so as to exclude a grandchild who should come unreasonably to claim his distributive share, when he had been sufficiently settled by advancement.</p>

    <p id="b47-7" data-blocks='[["BL_47.7",47,[160,1131,1167,774]]]'>Under the Act of 1764, relating to the partition and valuation of the real estate of an intestate, providing that the eldest son or heir at law should have his election of taking the land at the valuation, yet it was held, where the eldest son had died before the intestate, that the eldest son of the deceased eldest son, had the same priority of election of taking the real estate of his intestate grandfather, that his father, if living, would have had: Walton <em>v. </em>Willis, <a href="/dall/1/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Dall. 351" data-case-ids="12147267,1408550" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0351-01,/us/1/0368-01">1 Dall. 351</a>. So under the 22d section of the Act of 19th April 1794, where one died intestate, leaving sons and daughters, and also grandchildren, the children of the eldest son of the intestate, who had died in the lifetime of his father, it was held, where the words of the statute gave the priority of choice to the “ eldest son,” and was silent in regard to grandchildren, yet that they were within the equity of the act which intended to put them in the place of their father, if he had survived the intestate; and therefore they were permitted to take the real estate of the intestate in preference to the eldest son then living: Hersha <em>v. </em>Brenneman, 6 S. &amp; R. 2.</p>

The question, however, recurs, who is a child within the meaning and spirit of the statute relating to advancements? In Hughes’ Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 179, and in other cases there cited, it is held, that in the distribution of the grandfather’s estate, the grandchildren take subject to advancements made to their father, and to such debts due by him to the intestate, as were recoverable when the estate descended. The reason given is, that they take not paramount to their father, but through him by representation. This, however, <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>must be understood as applying to the facts in those cases. That is, where the intestate shall leave descendants in different degrees of consanguinity to him, the more remote of them being the issue of a deceased child, grandchild, or other descendants, and not where he leaves grandchildren only. In the latter case they would take <em>per capita.</em>

    <p id="b48-6" data-blocks='[["BL_48.6",48,[305,661,1170,606]]]'>The clear intent and design of the statutes are to equalize the property of the intestate among his children. Where one of his several children has died during his life, leaving an only child, who the intestate has advanced after the death of his father, it seems to us the whole reason of the statute compels us to hold it an advancement. To do otherwise would work injustice to the surviving children and defeat that equal distribution which the statute was designed to secure. We believe the true exposition of the statute to be, as against a surviving child of the intestate, that Abijah takes, not only subject to advancements made to his father, and to such debts due by him to the intestate as were recoverable when the estate descended, but also subject to advances made to himself after the death of his father, and to such debts due by him to his grandfather as were recoverable when the estate descended.</p>

    <p id="b48-12" data-blocks='[["BL_48.12",48,[299,1862,1164,423]]]'>The first assignment is the refusal to permit the appellant to testify in his own behalf. His object was to relieve himself from a portion of the claim of the estate of .the intestate against him. He sought to testify to transactions which occurred during the life of the decedent. That mutuality or equality did not then exist between the parties, which is necessary to permit a party to testify in his own behalf. The parties are not within the proviso to the first section of the Act of 15th April 1869. The appellant was therefore rightfully excluded: Karns <em>v. </em>Tanner, 16 P. F. Smith 297.</p>

We cannot establish any inflexible rule. Much may depend upon the circumstances attending the settlement of the particular estate. The auditor found that the administration of <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>this estate “ appears to have been attended with the quantity of trouble, care and responsibility which the settlement of intestates’ estates ordinarily imposes.” He therefore allowed the usual commission. The court confirmed it. It is no larger than has frequently been allowed to executors and administrators. The general enhancement of values within the last twelve years must not be wholly ignored in determining the reasonableness of commissions. The auditor and the court below* with all the facts before them, having concurred in what were reasonable commissions, we discover no good reason for disturbing that conclusion.</p>
