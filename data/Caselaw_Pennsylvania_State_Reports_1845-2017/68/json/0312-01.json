The hearing had been on a commitment by a justice of the peace for threatening to kill all white men.\nAn attachment for contempt in not obeying the order of the court was issued and served on the Overseers of Davidson township. The bill for his support amounting to $504.70 was approved by the court.\nThe insanity was proved to the satisfaction of the court, and that it was unsafe for him to be at large; that he was a pauper, and that his settlement was in Davidson township, which was undoubtedly liable for his support.
