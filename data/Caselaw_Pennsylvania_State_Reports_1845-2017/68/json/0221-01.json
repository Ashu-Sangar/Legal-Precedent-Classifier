Miller, sheriff of Lehigh county, dated February 13th 1869, in the penal sum of nine thousand dollars. The learned judge charged the jury \u201c that the action pending in the Court of Common Pleas for the county of Lehigh was a bar to the present suit, and that the jury must therefore find for the defendant.\u201d\nAll this evidence was clearly admissible under the general issue: 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 498, 472; Hunt v. Cook, 19 Wendell 463. This evidence established the fact, that the property of the plaintiff in the goods, if he had any, was extinguished by the claim made by the defendant and the property-bond given to the sheriff. The property vested in the defendant, and the right of the plaintiff to the property itself was absolutely gone: Fisher v. Whoollery, 1 Casey 197.\nThe court committed no error, and the judgment is affirmed.",

A claim property bond given by the defendant extinguishes the plaintiffs property in the goods.\nMarch 21st 1871. Before Thompson,C. J., Read, Asnew and Sharswood, JJ. Williams, J., at Nisi Prius.\nError to the District Court of Philadelphia: No. 452, to January Term 1870.\nOn the 9th of February 1869, John Rockey brought an action of trover against Erwin Burkhalter, for a large number of hides alleged to belong to the plaintiff, which he averred the defendant had converted to his own use. The defendant pleaded the general issue.\nThe case was tried February 17th 1870, before Hare, P. J. On the trial, after the plaintiff had submitted his case, the defendant offered the record of an action of replevin, commenced to April Term 1869, by the plaintiff in this case against the defendant in the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh county for the same goods, in which the defendant had given a claim property bond, dated February 13th 1869, and retained the goods. The plaintiff objected to the offer, it was received by the court, and a bill of exceptions sealed. The court then charged the jury \u201cthat the action pending in the Court of Common Pleas for the county of Lehigh was a bar to the present suit, and that the jury must therefore find for the defendant.\u201d\nThe verdict was for the defendant.\nThe plaintiff removed the record to the Supreme Court and assigned for error the admission of the defendant\u2019s offer of evidence and the charge of the court.\nP. Pittman, for plaintiff in error.\nMatters which go merely to the suspension of the action, or which do not determine the merits of the controversy, must be pleaded in abatement: Boyce v.

Savvey, for defendant in error.\nBy giving the property-bond the property in the goods was changed to the defendant: Fisher v. Whoollery, 1 Casey 199; and all liability is on the bond: Taylor v. The Royal Saxon, 1 Wall. Jr., 331-2; Aurentz v. Porter, 6 P. F. Smith 115; Castor v. McShaffery, 12 Wright 437; Mather v. Trinity Church, 3 S. & R. 512; Fleming v. Bevan, 2 Barr 408; Sylvester v.

Cooper, 3 S. & R. 564.\nMarch 30th 1871,\nIn Pennsylvania replevin lies in all cases where one claims goods in the possession of another and without regard to the manner in which possession was obtained: Weaver v. Lawrence, 1 Dall. 156; Reist v. Heilbrenner, 11 S. & R. 132; Bower v. Tallman, 5 W. & S. 556; Harlan v.
