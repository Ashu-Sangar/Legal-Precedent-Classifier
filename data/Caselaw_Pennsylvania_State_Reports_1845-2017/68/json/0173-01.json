        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered,\nby Agnew, J.\nThis was an action on a bill drawn upon one party in favor of another party to a contract between five coal companies, for a sum found due in the equalization of prices under the contract. It raises a question of great importance to the citizens of this state and the state of New York, where the contract was made, and was in part to be executed, to wit: whether the contract was illegal, as being contrary to the statute of New York, or at common law, or against public policy. The instrument bears date the loth day of February 1866. The parties are five coal companies, incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania, to wit: The Fall Brook Coal Company and Morris Run Coal Company, of the Blossburg coal region; and the Barclay Coal Company, Fall Creek Bituminous Coal Company, and Towanda Coal Company, of the Barclay coal region. By the agreement the market for the bituminous coal from these two regions is divided among these parties in certain proportions. A committee of three is appointed to take charge and control of the business of all these companies, to decide all questions by a certain vote, and to appoint a general sales agent to be stationed at Watkins, New York. Provision is made for the mining and delivery of coal, their kinds, and for its sale 'through the agent, subject, however, to this important restriction, that each party shall, at its own costs and expense, deliver its proportion of the different kinds of coal in the different markets at such times and to such parties as the committee shall from time to time direct. The committee is' authorized to adjust the prices of coal in the different markets and the rates of freight, and also to enter into such an agreement with the anthracite coal companies as will promote the interest of these parties. Then comes an important provision that the companies may sell their coal themselves, but only to the extent of their proportion, and only at the prices adjusted by the committee. It is also provided that the general sales agent shall direct a suspension of shipment or deliveries of coal by any party making sales or deliveries beyond its proportion, and thereupon such party shall suspend shipments until the committee shall direct a resumption. Detailed reports of the business are to be made by the companies to the general sales agent at fixed and short intervals, and settlements are'to be made by the committee monthly, prices averaged, and payments made by the companies in excess to those in arrear; and finally, each party binds itself not to cause or permit any coal to be shipped or sold otherwise than as the same has been agreed upon, and that all rules and regulations by the executive committee in relation to the business shall be faithfully carried out.\nIn \u00bfregard to the relation these companies hold to the public, the field of their mining operations, the markets they supply, the extent of their coal-fields, and the general supply of coal, the distinguished referee, Judge Elwell, finds as follows: \u201cThe Barclay and Blossburg coal-mines are the only coal-mines furnishing the kind of coal mined and shipped by these companies, except the Cumberland coal, which latter, in order to reach the same markets, north, would have to be shipped by tidewater. There was some of the same kind of coal mined in McKean and Elk counties, in this state, but in quantities so small as that it was not considered by these companies as coming into competition with them. The coal of the Blossburg and Barclay regions is adapted to mechanical purposes and for generating steam. Wherever sold it comes into competition with anthracite coal, and also with the Cumberland coal sent by tidewater to Troy, New York, to which point both kinds of bituminous coal are shipped.\u201d\nDuring the season of 1866 these companies made sales of coal at Oswego and Buffalo to parties who shipped to Chicago, Milwaukie and other western cities. It there came into competition to some extent with Pittsburg coal. The latter is used for making gas, but the coal.of these companies cannot be used for that purpose.\nThe referee found that the statute of New York is, \u201cif two or more persons shall conspire,\u201d first, \u201cto commit any offence;\u201d second, \u201c to commit any act injurious to the public health, to public morals, or to trade or commerce, they shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d\nThe referee found, as his conclusion upon the whole case, that the contract was void by the statute, and void at common law, as against public policy. The restraint of the contract upon trade and its injury to the public is thus clearly set forth by the referee: \u201c These corporations (he says) represented almost the entire body of bituminous coal in the northern part of the state. By combination between themselves they had the power to control the entire market in that district. And they did control it by a contract not to ship and sell coal otherwise than as therein provided. And in order to destroy competition they provided for an arrangement with dealers and shippers of anthracite coal. They were thereby prohibited from selling under prices to be fixed by a committee representing each company. And they were obliged to suspend shipments upon notice from an agent that their allotted share of the market had been forwarded or sold. Instead of regulating the business by the natural laws of trade, to wit, those of demand and supply, these companies entered into a league, by which they could limit the supply below the demand in order to enhance the price. Or if the supply was greater than the demand, they could nevertheless compel the payment of the price arbitrarily fixed by the joint committee. The restraint on the trade in bituminous coal was by this contract as wide and extensive as the market for the article. It already embraced the state of New York, and was intended and no doubt did affect the market in the Western States. It is expressly stipulated that the parties to this contract shall not be considered as partners. The agreement was not entered into for the purpose of 'aggregating the capital of the several companies, nor for greater facilities for the transaction of their business, nor for the protection of themselves by a reasonable restraint, as to a limited time and space, upon others who might interfere with their business.\u201d\nThe plaintiff in error\u2019s reply to this vigorous statement of the purpose of the contract and its effect upon the public interest, alleges that its true object was to lessen expenses, to advance the quality of the coal, and to deliver it in the markets it was to supply, in the best order, to the consumer. This is denied by the defendants; hut it seems to us it is immaterial whether these positions are sustained or not. Admitting their correctness, it does not follow that these advantages redeem the contract from the obnoxious effects so strikingly presented by the referee. The important fact is that these companies control this immense coalfield ; that it is the great source of supply of bituminous coal to the state of New York and large territories westward; that by this contract they control the price of coal in this extensive market, and make it bring sums it would not command if left to the natural laws of trade; that it concerns an article of prime necessity for many uses; that its operation is general in this large region, and affects all who use coal as a fuel; and this is accomplished by a combination of all the companies engaged in this branch of business in the large region where they operate. The combination is wide in scope, general in its influence, and injurious in effects. These being its features, the contract is against public policy, illegal, and therefore void.\nThe illegality of contracts affecting public trade appears in the books under many forms. The most frequent is that of contracts between individuals to restrain one of them from performing a business or employment. The subject was elaborately discussed in the leading case of Mitchell v. Reynolds, 1 Peere Williams 181, to be found also in 1 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cases 172. The distinction is there taken which now marks the current of judicial decision everywhere; that a restraint upon a trade or employment which is general, is void, being contrary to public interest, really beneficial to neither party, and oppressive at least to one. \u201c General restraints (says Parker, J.) are all void, whether by bond, covenant or promise, with or without consideration, and whether it be of the party\u2019s own trade or not;\u201d citing Croke Jam. 596 ; 2 Buis. 186; Allen 67. To obtain, he says, the sole exercise of any known trade throughout England, is a complete monopoly, and against the policy of the law. A reason given is \u201c the great abuses these voluntary restraints are liable to, as, for instance, from corporations, who were perpetually laboring for exclusive advantages in trade, and to reduce it into as few hands as possible.\u201d In reference to a contract not to trade in any part of England, it is said, there is something more than a presumption against it, because it never can be useful to any man to restrain another from trading in all places, though it may be to restrain him from trading in some, unless he intends a monopoly, which is a crime. These principles have been sustained in many cases which need not be cited, as most of them will be found in Mr. Smith\u2019s note to the leading case. The result of those in which particular restraints upon trade have been held to be valid between individuals is, that the restraint must be partial only, the consideration adequate and not colorable, and the restriction reasonable. Upon the last requisite, Tindal, C. J., remarks in Horner v. Graves, 7 Bing. 743:\u2014 \u201cWe do not see how a better test can be applied to the question whether reasonable or not than by considering whether the restraint is such only as to, afford a fair protection as to the interests of the party in favor of whom it is given, and not so large as to interfere with the interests of the public. Whatsoever restraint is larger than the necessary protection of the party can be of no benefit to either; it can only be oppressive, and if oppressive, it is in the eye of the law unreasonable. What is injurious to the public interest is void on the ground of public policy.\u201d\nMany cases have been decided as to what is a reasonable restriction and what is not, and is therefore void, but two only may be referred to as illustrations. In Mallan v. May, 11 M. & W. 653, a covenant not to practise as a dentist in London, or in any of the places in England or Scotland, where the plaintiff might have been practising before the expiration of the term of service with them was held to be reasonable as to the limit of London, but unreasonable and void as to the remainder of the restriction. So in Green v. Price, 13 M. & W. 695, a covenant not to follow the perfumery business in the cities of London and Westminster, or within the distance of 600 miles therefrom, was good as to the cities and void as to the limit of 600 miles. See also Pierce v. Fuller, 8 Mass. 223, and Chappel v. Brockway, 21 Wend. 158. An important principle stated in these cases is that as to contracts for a limited restraint the courts start with a presumption that they are illegal unless shown to have been made upon adequate consideration, and upon circumstances both reasonable and useful. This presumption is a necessary consequence of the general principle, that the public interest is superior to private, and that all restraints on trade are injurious to the public in some degree. The general rule (said Woodward, O. J.) is that all restraints of trade, if nothing more appear, are had: Keeler v. Taylor, 3 P. F. Smith 468. That ease may be instanced as a strong illustration of the rule as to what is not a reasonable restriction; and the principles I have been stating are recognised iri the opinion. Keeler agreed to instruct Taylor in the art of making platform scales, and to employ him in that business at $1.75 per day. Taylor engaged to pay Keeler or his legal representatives $50 for each and every scale he should thereafter make for any other person than Keeler, or which should be made by imparting his information to others. This was held to be an. unreasonable restriction upon Taylor\u2019s labor, and therefore void, as in restraint of trade. Testing the present contracts by these principles, the restrictions laid upon the production and price of coal cannot be sanctioned as reasonable, in view of their intimate relation to the public interests. The field of operation is too wide and the influence too general.\nThe effects produced on the public interests lead to the consideration of another feature of great weight in determining the illegality of the contract, to wit: the combination resorted to by these five companies. Singly each might have suspended deliveries and sales of coal to suit its own interests, and might have raised the price, even though'this might have been detrimental to the public interest. There is a certain freedom which must be allowed to every one in the management of his own affairs. When competition is left free, individual error or folly will generally find a correction in the conduct of others. But here is a combination of all the companies operating in the Blossburg and Barclay mining regions, and controlling their entire productions. They have combined together, to govern the supply and the price of coal in all the markets from the Hudson to the Mississippi rivers, and from Pennsylvania to the lakes. This combination has a power in its confederated form which no individual action can confer. The public interest must succumb to it, for it has left-no competition free to correct its baleful influence. When the supply of coal is suspended, the demand for it becomes importunate, and prices .must rise. Or if the supply goes forward, the price fixed by the confederates must accompany it. The domestic hearth, the furnaces of the iron master, and the fires of the manufacturer, all feel the restraint, while many dependent hands are paralyzed, and hungry mouths are stinted. The influence of a lack of supply or a rise in the price of an article of such prime necessity, cannot be measured. It permeates the entire mass of community, and leaves few of its members untouched by its withering blight. Such a combination is more than a contract, it is an offence. \u201c I take it,\u201d said Gibson, J., \u201c a combination is criminal whenever the act to he done has a necessary tendency to prejudice the public or to oppress individuals, by unjustly subjecting them to the power of the confederates, and giving effect to the purpose of the latter, whether of extortion or of mischief Commonwealth v. Carlisle, Brightly\u2019s Rep. 40. In all such combinations where the purpose is injurious or unlawful, the gist of the offence is the conspiracy. Men can often do by the combination of many, what severally no one could accomplish, and even what when done by one would be innocent. It was held, in The Commonwealth v. Eberle, 3 S. & R. 9, that it was an indictable conspiracy for a portion of a German Lutheran congregation to combine and agree together to prevent another portion of the congregation, by force of arms, from using the English language in the worship of God among the congregation. So a confederacy to assist a female infant to escape from her father\u2019s control with a view to marry her against his will, is indictable as a conspiracy at common law, while it would have been no criminal offence if one alone had induced her to elope with and marry him : Mifflin v. Commonwealth, 5 W. & S. 461. One man or many may hiss an actor; but if they conspire to do it they may he punished: per Gibson, C. J., Hood v. Palm, 8 Barr 238; 2 Russel on Crimes 556. And an action for a conspiracy to defame will be supported though the words he not actionable, if spoken by one: Hood v. Palm, supra. \u201cDefamation by the outcry of numbers,\u201d says Gibson, C. J., \u201cis as resistless as defamation by the written act of an individual.\u201d And says Coulter, J., \u201c The concentrated energy of several combined wills, operating simultaneously and by concert upon one individual, is dangerous even to the cautious and circumspect, but when brought to bear upon the unwary and unsuspecting, it is fatal:\u201d Twitchell v. Commonwealth, 9 Barr 211, There is a potency in numbers when combined, which the law cannot overlook, where injury is the consequence. If the conspiracy be to commit a crime or an unlawful act, it is easy to determine its indictable character. It is more difficult when the act to be done or purpose to be accomplished is innocent in itself.' Then the offence takes its hue from the motives, the means or the consequences. If the motives'of the confederates be to oppress, the \u2022means they use unlawful, or the consequences to others injurious, their confederation will become a conspiracy. Instances are given in The Commonwealth v. Carlisle, Bright. R. 40. Among those mentioned as Criminal is a combination of employers to depress the wages of journeymen below what they would be, if there were no resort to artificial means; and a combination of the bakers of a town to hold up the article of bread, and by means of the scarcity thus produced to extort an exorbitant price for it. The latter instance is precisely parallel with the present case. It is the effect of the act .upon the public which gives that case and this its evil aspect as the result of confederation; for any baker might choose to hold up his own bread, or coal operator his coal, rather than to sell at ruling prices; but when he destroys competition by a combination with others, the public can buy of no one.\nIn Rex v. De Berenquetal, 3 M. & S. 67, it was held to he a conspiracy to combine to raise the public funds on a particular day by false rumors. The purpose itself, said Lord Ellenborough, is mischievous \u2014 it strikes at the price of a valuable commodity in the market, and if it gives a fictitious price by means of false rumors, it is a fraud levelled against the public, for it is against all such as may possibly have anything to do with the funds on that particular day. Every \u201c corner,\u201d in the language of the day, whether it be to affect the price of articles of commerce, such as breadstuff's, or the price of vendible stocks, when accomplished by confederation to raise or depress the price and operate on the markets, is a conspiracy. The ruin often spread abroad by these heartless conspiracies is .indescribable, frequently filling the land with starvation, poverty and woe.. Every association is criminal whose object is to raise or depress the price of labor beyond what it would bring if it were left without artificial aid or stimulus: Rex v. Byerdike, 1 M. & S. 179. In the case of such associations the illegality consists most frequently in the means employed to carry out the object. To fix a standard of prices among men in the same employment, as a fee bill, is not in itself criminal, but may become so when the parties resort to coercion, restraint or penalties upon the employed or employers, or what is worse, to force of arms. If the means be unlawful the combination is indictable: Commonwealth v. Hunt, 4 Metc. 111. A conspiracy of journeymen of any trade or handicraft to raise the wages by entering into combination to coerce journeymen and master workmen employed in the same branch of industry to conform to rules adopted by such combination for the purpose of regulating the price of labor, and carrying such, rules into effect by overt acts, is indictable as a misdemeanor: 3 Whart. C. L., citing The People v. Fishbee, 14 Wend. 9. Without multiplying examples, these are sufficient to illustrate the true aspect of the case before us, and to show that a combination such as these companies entered into to control the supply and price of the Blossburg and Barclay regions is illegal, and the contract therefore void.\nA second question is, whether the bill drawn' in this case by the general sales agent on the Barclay Coal Company in favor of the Morris Coal Company to equalize prices upon a settlement under the contract, is such an independent cause of action as will support the suit. When a bill, note or bond is but an instrument to execute an illegal contract, it is tainted by the illegality and cannot be recovered. The illegal consideration enters directly into the instrument, and is followed up because the law will not permit itself to be violated by mere indirection. This is the principle mentioned in the cases of Stears v. Lashley, 6 Term Rep. 61; Swan v. Scott, 11 S. & R. 164; Stanton v. Allen, 5 Denio 434; Fisher v. Bridges, 3 E. & B. 642 ; Lestapies v. Ingraham, 5 Barr 82. In the last case, Gibson, O. J., says: \u201c The solemnity of.the security would riot preclude an inquiry into the consideration of it had it been illegal;\u201d and in Swan v. Scott, Duncan, J., said of a bond, the consideration of which grew out of an illegal transaction, \u201c there the illegal consideration is the sole basis of the bond, and there can be no recovery.\u201d In the present case the bill itself refers directly to the equalization account, and was given in immediate execution of the contract. This being the case, it is distinguishable from Eackney v. Reynous, 4 Burrows 2065; Petrie v. Hannay, 3 Term R. 418; Warner v. Russell, 1 Bos. & Pul. 295; Lestapies v. Ingraham, supra; Thomas v. Bracey, 10 Barr 164 \u2014 cases where the action was not upon the illegal contract, or upon ' an instrument in execution of it, hut was founded upon a new consideration. The distinction is well stated by Judge Washington, in Toler v. Armstrong, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 297, affirmed in the Supreme Court U. S., 11 Wheat. 258. The present case is free of difficulty, the money represented by the bill arising directly upon the contract to be paid by one party to another party to the contract in execution of its terms. The bill itself is therefore tainted by the illegality, and no recovery can be had upon it.\nThe judgment is therefore affirmed.",

Five coal corporations of Pennsylvania entered into an agreement in New York to divide two coal regions of which they had the control; to appoint a committee to take charge of their interests, which was to decide all questions and appoint a general agent at Watkins, New York; the coal mined to be delivered through him, each corporation to deliver its proportion at its own cost in the different markets at such time and to such persons as the committee might direct; the committee to adjust the prices, rates of freight, &c., enter into agreements with anthracite companies ; the five companies might sell their coal themselves only to the extent of their proportion and at prices adjusted by the committee; the agent to suspend shipments by either beyond their proportion; frequent detailed reports to be made by companies, and settlements monthly by the committee, prices to be averaged and payments made to those in arrear by those in excess, neither to sell coal otherwise than as agreed upon, and the regulations of the committee to be carried out faithfully. A statute of New York makes it a misdemeanor for \u201c persons to conspire to commit any act injurious to trade or commerce.\u201d Held, that their agreement was in contravention of the statute and also against public policy and therefore illegal and void.\n2.

L. 85, Purd. 1592.\nThe facts of the case and the principles of law raised will be found in the following statement from the referee\u2019s report:\u2014\n\u201c Conclusions of fact. \u2014 Both the plaintiff and defendant are corporations, chartered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania before the 15th February 1866, and have still existence under the authority conferred by their respective acts of incorporation.\n\u201c On the 2th October 1866, a draft was drawn upon the Barclay Coal Company, the defendant, in favor of the Morris Run Coal Company, the plaintiff, as follows: \u2014 \u25a0\n\u201c02466.99 Watkins, N. Y., October 9th 1866.\nPay to the order of Morris Run Coal Co., Two thousand four hundred and sixty-six 99-100 dollars, in current rate of exchange on New York, value received, and charge the same to account of equalization contract.\nTo J. M. Ward, (Signed) Geo. J. Magee,\nSupt. Barclay Coal Co. Geni. Sales Agent.\nWhich draft was accepted by J. M. Ward, who was at the time general superintendent and agent of the defendant, in these words, endorsed thereon:\u2014\n\u201cAccepted, payable six months from date at the Banking House of B. S. Russel & Co., Towanda, Pa.\n(Signed) J. M. Ward,\nSupt. Barclay Coal Co. \u2018\n\u201c This draft was accepted at Towanda, Pa. It was presented at maturity at the banking-house of B. S. Russel & Co., in Towanda, and payment was refused. At that time the current rate of exchange on New York was one-fourth of one per cent.\n\u201c The plaintiff having on the hearing of this case before the referee established the foregoing facts rested its case. * * * .\n\u201c Thereupon evidence was given which established the following, which I find to be the facts of the case, to wit :\u2014\n\u201c On the 15th February 1866, the several coal companies mentioned in the contract below, were bodies corporate, chartered under the laws pf this Commonwealth, engaged in the mining and shipping of bituminous coal from the coal-fields of Bradford and Tioga counties, known and designated in said contract as the Blossburg and Barclay coal regions, in this state. The sales made under the agreement were almost exclusively in the state of New York.\n\u201c The contract was entered into the 15th day of February, A. D. 1866, between The Fall Brook Coal Company, party of the first part, the Morris Run Coal Company, party of the second part, of the Blossburg Coal region, the Barclay Coal Company, party of the third part, the Fall Creek Bituminous Coal Company, party of the fourth part, and the Towanda Coal Company, party of the fifth part, of the Barclay Coal region, as follows, to wit:\n\u201c The said coal companies do severally agree with each other that the market for bituminous coal from the Blossburg and from the Barclay regions (except as' hereinafter mentioned), shall be divided between the two coal regions, so that the Blossburg region shall have the right and privilege of supplying, by the said two companies above mentioned, 70 per cent, of the whole quantity of coal sent to market, and the Barclay region 30 per cent.; and that the shares of each region shall be subdivided between the coal companies of each region as they may agree among themselves/\u2019 * * *\nThen follows the proportion in which the division shall be made between the respective companies.\n\u201c It is understood that all coal mined and sold by the Morris Run Coal Company to the Salt Company of Onondaga, under their lease of the said Salt Company mines, and used for the manufacture of salt on the Onondaga Salt Reservation, shall not be counted as a part of said Morris Run Coal Company\u2019s portion of the market, and said coal shall not be considered as included in this agreement in any way whatever, but the same is expressly excepted herefrom.\n\u201c It is understood that this agreement shall take effect on the opening of the Erie Canal next spring, and continue for one year, and shall embrace all the coal which the respective parties shall have afloat on boats, or on hand at Watkins, Coal Point, or any place in the state of New York, or which they during its operation shall cause to be transported north of the Pennsylvania state line; excepting therefrom salt coal, as herein stated, and coal used by the respective parties in their own transportation.\n\u201c The business contemplated by this agreement shall be under the control of an executive committee of three persons, one to be appointed by the party of the first part, one by the party of the second part, and one by the parties of the third, fourth and fifth parts, jointly, and until otherwise ordered by the parties respectively, the members of the committee shall consist of, &c. * * *\n\u2022 \u201c In the decision by the said committee of all questions of general interest of the parties hereto, the members of the committee from the Blossburg region shall have two votes, and the member from the Barclay region one vote; but in the decision of questions of adverse interests between the two coal regions, the member of the committee from the Barclay region shall have equal power with the Blossburg members;\u201d with provision for an umpire in case of a tie vote.\n* * * \u201c The committee shall appoint a general sales agent, and such other agents and assistants,\u201d &c., to * * * \u201cbe paid by the several parties hereto in proportion to the respective portion of th\u00e9 market supplied by them.\n\u201c George J. Magee shall be the general sales ag.ent for the time being and until otherwise ordered by the committee, and the oflice of said general sales agent shall be at Watkins.\u201d\n\u201cIn order more fully to define the respective rights of the parties hereto, the following further provisions are agreed upon, to wit: * * * .\n3. \u201c Each party shall at its own cost and expense deliver its proportion of the different kinds of coal in the different markets, at such times and to such parties as the committee shall from time to time through the general sales agent or otherwise direct.\n4. \u201c Inasmuch as it may not be practicable for each party' to deliver in each of the markets precisely their proportion of coal, it is agreed that a general average of the sales of all the parties shall be made and the same shall be adjusted monthly so that each party will receive the same average price per ton for their coal at a common point.\n\u201c 5. Watkins, including Coal Point, is agreed upon as the common point of average.\n\u201c 6. The average price received for coal will be arrived at in the following manner, to wit, &c. * * *\n\u201c7. The committee will from time to time adjust the prices of coal for the different markets, and the conditions of the sale thereof.\n\u201c 8. The committee will from time to time adjust and fix the rates of freight from Watkins, and such matters as pertain thereto. * * *\n\u201c10. The committee are authorized to enter into such an agreement with the anthracite coal companies in regard to the sale of coal as they shall deem best for the interest of the parties hereto.\n\u201c11. Under the control and direction of the committee each of the parties hereto may act as agents in the sale of coal, but only to the extent of their proportion, and only at the prices adjusted by the committee; and the collections for the same shall be at the risk of the party making the sale and furnishing the coal, and only in case all the rules and regulations of the committee are carried out. But all losses on sales made by the general sales agent, or by order of the committee, shall be borne by all the parties hereto pro raid in proportion to the quantity of coal furnished by each company.\n\u201c It being understood and agreed by said parties that all sales, shipments and deliveries by or for either or any of said parties, except as herein specifically excluded from the terms of this agreement, shall as between these parties and for the purposes of this agreement be deemed to be made by said committee through such general sales agent in the name and for the account of the party furnishing the coal, and that each of said parties shall, unless said committee shall otherwise direct or provide, refer and send at once all orders or propositions received by them respectively, relating to the sale of coal, to said general sales agent prior to any action by themselves thereon, and said general sales agent shall advise said parties from time to time of the whole amount of coal shipped by all the parties, and shall direct a suspension of shipments or deliveries by either party making such sales or deliveries beyond its proportion, and thereupon such party shall suspend shipments until the executive committee shall direct their resumption.\n\u201c 12. It is understood and agreed between the parties hereto that this agreement shall not be taken, held or construed to constitute a partnership between said parties, or so as to make any one of the parties hereto responsible for the default or failure of any other party, and in all sales of coa.l made by said general sales agent or otherwise, in pursuance of this agreement, the bills shall be made out in the name of the party furnishing the coal, and all contracts which may be made for the sale and delivery of coal shall be in the name of the party who is to furnish the coal to fill the contract, so that no other party shall be in anywise responsible for the fulfilment of the same.\n\u201c 13. It shall be the duty of each party to furnish to the general sales agent detailed reports ending on the 10th, 20th and last day of each month, and at such other times and for such periods as he shall direct, of all coal of each kind shipped and sold, or agreed to be shipped and sold by them, &e.; * * and such other detail as may be required by the committee or general sales agent, &c.\n\u201c 14. On or before the 10th of each month the general sales agent shall furnish to each member of said committee a statement showing the whole quantity sold and shipped during the preceding month, &c. * * *\n\u201c15. The said committee shall meet monthly to receive the statements of the general sales agent and settle the accounts of the preceding month, it being understood and agreed that as far as possible all matters and things between the parties hereto under this agreement shall be settled monthly, all which settlements shall be predicated of the principle that each party is entitled to the average price per ton that each kind of coal was sold for at each place of sale during the preceding month, subject to the payment of the expenses aforesaid, and thereupon the proper payments between the parties shall be made \u2014 that is to say, the parties having received more than the average price for each or either kind of coal shall pay to the parties having received less than such average so as to produce that result.\n\u201c 16. Each party shall furnish its appropriate proportion of the several kinds of coal; * * * and failures to comply with this provision shall be adjusted equitably between the parties by the executive committee. * * *\n\u201c 18. Any of the parties desiring to do so, may have their sales collected by the general sales agent.\n\u201c 19. The two regions, Blossburg and Barclay, may each have one party in Buffalo and one in Oswego, to purchase and sell their coals in those markets, to be selected by the members of the committee from each region respectively.\n\u201c 20. Each party hereto agrees that they will not cause or permit any coal to be shipped or sold otherwise than as the same has been herein agreed upon, and that all rules and regulations of said executive committee in relation to the business provided for in this agreement shall be truly and faithfully carried out.\u201d\n\u201c This contract was signed by the parties as it purports to have been at Elmira in the state of New York, on the day of its date.\n\u201cThe Barclay and Blossburg coal-mines are the only mines furnishing the kind of coal mined and shipped by these companies, except the Cumberland coal, which latter in order to reach the same markets north would have to be shipped by tide-water. There was some of the same kind of coal mined in McKean and Elk counties in this state, but in quantities so small as that it was not considered by these companies as coming in competition with them. The coal of the Blossburg and Barclay regions is adapted to mechanical purposes and for generating steam. Wherever sold it comes in competition with anthracite coal, and also with the Cumberland coal sent by tide-water to Troy, New York, to which point both kinds of bituminous coal are shipped.\n\u201c During the season of 1866 these companies made sales of coal at Oswego and Buffalo to parties who shipped to Chicago, Milwaukie and other western cities. It then came in competition to some extent with the Pittsburg coal. The latter is used for making gas, but the coal of these companies cannot be used for that purpose.\n\u201c Under the provisions of the contract the executive committee therein provided for and representing the several companies met monthly and fixed the prices of coal. They did not make adjustments and equalization every month, but let it run sometimes two and sometimes three months between adjustments. When they did make adjustments the business of each month was separately calculated, and the result put down upon a book which was kept by them as a record of their proceedings. * * *\n\u201c The equalization of the accounts as aforesaid for the months of August and September 1866, as shown on page 21 of said book, exhibits the following summary:\u2014\n\u201c Fall Brook Coal Company, . $365 54\nMorris Run Coal Company, 12,829 79\nDr.\nBarclay Coal Company, $2,832 53\nFall Creek Coal Company, 1,150 89\nTowanda Coal Company, 9,216 11\n$13,199 53 $13,195 33\nDifference, 4 20\n\u201cOn the 9th of October 1866, the executive committee met at Towanda and made the adjustment and equalization for the months of August and September as above stated, which was satisfactory to all parties. They directed the general sales agent to make drafts on parties having received more than the average price for their coal, in favor of parties that have received less than the average price. * * *\n\u201c The draft in suit was drawn for the balance found against the Barclay Coal Company $2832.53, less the $365.54 due the Fall Brook Company, for which last sum a draft was probably drawn, so that under the adjustment there remained due from the Barclay Coal Company the sum of $2466.99, for which the draft was drawn. * * *\n\u201c The bulk of shipments made by the Barclay Coal Company was made before the settlement of October 1866. For the subsequent shipments a computation was made on the 20th January 1867, and there was found due under the contract to the Barclay Coal Co. on the business subsequent to that adjusted in October the sum of $49.26, for which a draft was drawn in its favor on the Towanda Coal Company which it still holds, not having presented it.\n\u201c The tonnage of the Barclay Company for the ten months that the contract was in force, was its full proportion under the contract and 528 tons over.\n\u201c There was no disagreement between the parties as to correctness of the calculations which produced the results as to amounts in the summaries before stated ; but after the acceptance of the draft in suit the Barclay Company insisted that the business of the whole year should be brought into a mass instead of adjusting it month by month separately.\n\u201c The statutes of New York were produced before the referee by the counsel for the defendant, by which it appears that \u2018 If two or more persons shall conspire 1, \u201c To commit any offence \u2014or 2, To commit any act injurious to the public health, to public morals, or to trade or commerce\u201d \u2014 they shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.\u2019\n\u201c It also appeared that the location of the general sales agent was to be at Watkins, in the state of New York, the point of average was in that state, and the business of the companies in making sales was more extensive in that state than elsewhere.\n\u201c On the hearing there was no dispute in regard to the facts.\u201d * * *\n\u201c The plaintiff\u2019s points were :\u2014\n\u201c I. That the agreement dated 15th February 1866, is founded upon sufficient consideration to make it binding upon the parties thereto.\n\u201c2. That said contract is not contrary to public policy at common law, nor void under the statute.\n\u201c 3. That if said contract was void, yet the acceptance of the draft in question, by the defendant in the state of Pennsylvania, created a new and valid contract, founded upon a sufficient consideration to enable the plaintiff to recover.\n\u201c The defendant\u2019s points were:\u2014\n\u201c 1. That the agreement, dated February 15th 1866, and the rights of the parties under said contract, are to be determined and decided by the laws of the state of New York, and under the laws of said state the said contract is null and void.\nMay 8th 1871,\n\u201c 2. That the draft in suit is without legal consideration, and that the plaintiff cannot recover thereon.\n\u201c Conclusions of law:\u2014\n\u201c 1. The contract of 15th February 1866, having been entered into in the state of New York, where it was to be mainly executed, was void by the statute of that state, which makes it a misdemeanor for two or more persons to conspire to commit any act injurious to trade or commerce.\n\u201c 2. It was void by the common law as against public policy.\nu 8. It was not so far executed as to prevent the defendant from setting up between the parties to the transaction the illegality of the consideration of the draft in question.\n\u201c4. And, therefore, under all the evidence in the cause, the defendant is entitled to judgment.\u201d * * *\nThe plaintiffs took out a writ of error, and assigned for error,\u2014\nI, 3. Refusing to affirm the plaintiffs\u2019 points.\n4. His four conclusions of law.\nU. Mercur (with whom was B. Overton, Jr.), for plaintiffs in error.\nThe agreement was but for a year, and to operate in but a limited portion of the state of New York ; it was not a general restraint of trade, and therefore was good: Chitty on Contracts 591, 597, 599. The restraint is valid, unless plainly beyond what the party\u2019s interests require: Wickens v. Evans, 3 Y. & J. 318.\nThe action is on the draft, and the contract was not needed to establish it: Swan v. Scott, 11 S. & R. 164; Thomas v. Brady, 10 Barr 164; Scott v. Duffy, 2 Harris 20. The contract was executed: Lestapies v. Ingram, 5 Barr 71; Fox v. Cash, 1 Jones 207. The defendants\u2019 acceptance was on .a new consideration: Tabor v. Armstrong, 4 W. C. C. R. 299.\nJ. Be Witt, for defendant in error."
