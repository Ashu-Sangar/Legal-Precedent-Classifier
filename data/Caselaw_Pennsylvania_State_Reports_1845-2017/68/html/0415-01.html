    <p class="summary" id="b418-7" data-blocks='[["BL_418.6",418,[302,608,1152,514]]]'>“These parties were partners in the purchase and sale of cattle and sheep. In the fall of 1863 they bought a drove of cattle and one of sheep in Franklin county, Sprecher paying for and taking charge of the cattle, and Knox paying for and taking charge of the sheep; they brought them to this county for sale, and met at Witmer’s bridge. Knox sold out the sheep and Sprecher the cattle. The respective droves were held in partnership, but the business of selling as of buying was conducted by the several partners separately, Knox selling all the sheep and Sprecher all the cattle. The only exception was two head of cattle which Mr. Knox sold as he states for Lewis Sprecher, and paid over to him the price received for them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b418-8" data-blocks='[["BL_418.7",418,[303,1120,1159,1283]],["BL_419.2",419,[202,398,1154,943]]]'>“ When all the sales were made the parties met together at L. Sprecher’s tavern in this city, and from their pass-books, settled and divided the profits, amounting, as S. Knox remembers, to a little more than $400. Among the sales of cattle was one of $713 to Milton Seldomridge, for which Lewis Sprecher received his note drawn to his order. This note was at the settlement treated as part of the partnership funds in estimating the profits, and was left in the hands of Lewis Sprecher. It has not been collected; Milton Seldomridge became insolvent and died. It was discounted by Mr. Sprecher at the Lancaster County Bank, and renewed after some $75 paid upon it by Seldomridge, and subsequently remained in the bank with payment guarantied by Mr. Sprecher for two years, when he paid the amount which he had drawn from the bank, and received the note from the bank. It is this note which is the matter of controversy in the present suit. Lewis Sprecher demands the one-half of its amount from Samuel Knox, as his contribution to the loss sustained by reason of Milton Seldom-ridge’s insolvency and failure to pay the same. Mr. Knox defends the suit on the ground that the settlement between him and Mr. Seldomridge was final and complete, and that this note was taken by Mr. Sprecher as his portion or a part of his share in the partnership effects. As no one was present at the settlement besides the parties, their statements here (on the witness stand) are the only direct evidence you have of that transaction. Whatever the agreement was, on that settlement with respect to the disposition of this note, should bind them. If there was no agreement (which if made would be the law of the ease made by themselves) the matter would fall within the law of partnership, which shares the loss as well as the profits of partnership adventures. What the agreement was, or whether there was any, you will have to decide <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>according to all the testimony before you. Samuel Knox affirms that the settlement was full and square, and that nothing was said or agreed about the note, if the money was not collected from Milton Seldomridge. Lewis Sprecher affirms that there was an understanding and agreement when they settled that any losses that might occur from the business or this note were to be shared between them. [If you find there was no agreement, and that the note was treated as partnership funds in the ascertainment of the profits, without any stipulation to the effect that Lewis Sprecher would not have recourse to his copartnership in case he could not collect it, and it was not collected only through his gross neglect, your verdict should be in his favor for such amount as the defendant ought to contribute to the loss ; that is, one-half; but if it was agreed at the settlement that Lewis Sprecher should take or retain this note as a part of his share of the partnership effects, if he retained the same with that understanding as his own, and treated it afterward as his own, and either failed in dué diligence to press the collection, or to make or to intimate to Samuel Knox that he was to be accountable for his share óf the loss, if any should happen — facts which, if shown, might be regarded as evidence of what the agreement was — your verdict should be for the defendant.”]</p>

They may all be considered together. The plaintiff and defendant were drovers and had been partners in the purchase and sale of two lots of certain cattle and sheep. Sprecher paid for and took charge of the cattle, and Knox of the sheep. When after the stock was all sold they came togethef to make a settlement and division of the profits, the note of a man named Seldomridge, which Sprecher had taken for cattle sold, was left in his hands. It turned out that Seldomridge was either insolvent at the time or proved to be so subsequently. It is to recover from Knox contribution to this loss that Sprecher instituted this action of assumpsit. Both parties were examined as witnesses, and differed very materially in their account of the agreement and understanding between them about this note at the time of the settlement. Knox asserted that it was understood that the settlement was final and absolute, and that Sprecher took the note as so much eash. Sprecher denied this and insisted that when they settled they agreed that the money that was lost each was to lose one-half. This certainly presented a square issue of fact for the decision of the jury. When partners on a settlement make a division of assets consisting of choses in action as notes or other evidences of indebtedness belonging to the firm, unless it is otherwise expressly agreed, they remain liable respectively for whatever loss may subsequently appear from the insolvency of the debtors or other causes not attributed to negligence in either. The division primá, facie is for the convenience of collection, only throwing upon the partner who receives the assets the obligations of good faith and reasonable diligence. If Sprecher was to be believed, Knox recognised his continuing interest in the note after the settlement; for after he had procured the note to be discounted, he consulted Knox as to paying it. He testified: <em>“ </em>Then I said, Supposing I go and pay the note, and you and me will make it some other time. And he agreed to that. He thought it would be better, and I paid the note.” Knox, it is true, denied this statement, but after such evidence it can hardly be pretended that it was not a question for the jury whether Sprecher had acted fairly and with reasonable diligence.</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[284,2063,1154,429]],["BL_421.1",421,[220,400,1156,761]]]'>The case of Kelly <em>v. </em>Kauffman, 6 Harris 351, was in all its circumstances, a case very much resembling this. The principles there enunciated sustain the instructions of the learned judge below on the principal matter of contention here. That was a partnership between cattle drovers who had made a settlement and division of assets including a note to the firm, which the maker afterwards failed to pay. It was endorsed in the name of the firm to one of the partners who procured it to be discounted by a bank, but on failure of the debtor had paid it himself to the bank. “ The contract of partnership,” said Lewis, J., <em>“ </em>is essen<a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>tially an agreement to participate in the profits and losses. A settlement of the accounts and division of the partnership assets, does not discharge the parties from their mutual obligations to contribute to losses, which may subsequently arise from circumstances not anticipated at the time of the settlement. Nothing short of an agreement mutually releasing each other from such liability will produce that effect.” The judgment in that case was reversed because it was thought that there was <em>no </em>evidence of such an agreement, which ought to have gone to the jury. It can surely make no difference that the note here was originally drawn in favor of the partner to whom it was handed over, or that he procured it to be discounted and subsequently renewed. There may have been circumstances bearing upon the principal questions of fact: Was the note accepted by Sprecher as so much cash ? and if not, did he act fairly and use reasonable diligence in pursuing the claim upon it ? — but these were questions rightly submitted to the jury, and we think with proper instructions upon the law.</p>
