As the mode of sale which the complainant alleges was contemplated by the agreement, and which he asks to be allowed to prove was the one intended by the parties, is peculiar to this city, it is proper it should be explained. An owner of vacant land arranges with his intended purchaser, the size and character of the buildings that the neighborhood will justify, and the dimensions of the lots suitable for them. The lot has a price put upon it and the cost of the proposed buildings ascertained. The owner then agrees to advance one-half, or more or less, as the case may be, of the respective cost, and the purchaser mortgages to him the lot for its price and the proportion of the cost of building which has been agreed upon. The purchaser, who in. most cases is a builder, agrees to furnish the balance of the cost of the buildings. This is the mode in which owners of large lots in this city realize their value.”</p>

It shows by its terms that Drexel became the owner thereof, with a full power of sale upon his own terms, and consequently without any trust in the title for Marvine. But though Drexel held the property exempt from any trust in the title for Marvine, the agreement contemplated conversion by sale for their joint benefit. Marvine was to have one-fourth of the net profits, and was bound to pay directly or indirectly by account one-fourth of the interest of the purchase-money ($112,000), and one-fourth of the taxes and municipal charges against the premises. The effect of this arrangement was to give to Marvine such an interest in the sales and conversion of the property as would prevent Drexel from exercising his discretionary power of sale in an unfair or prejudicial manner. For though Drexel was the owner with a power of sale on his own terms, and had paid the purchase-money, it is evident he had obtained the title at a low price by Marvine’s instrumentality, and was to be protected by him as to the one-fourth of the property by payment of the interest and taxes and charges on that one-fourth. It is also clear that Marvine took the right to the one-fourth of the net profits in compensation for his relinquishment of title, and ,his covenant to pay Drexel the one-fourth of the interest, taxes and charges. Hence in equity Drexel’s power of sale was not arbitrary, but was limited by a sound discretion to be exercised for the benefit of Marvine as well as of himself. It therefore did not pass by his will to his executors in an absolute form, but as a power to be exercised according to the spirit and intent of the agreement. The argument is unsound which insists on the possession of an absolute power of sale in the executors, in order to perform their legal duties as executors, for that unqualified power of disposition did not reside in Drexel in his lifetime— it was not despotic in him. But while this is the true effect of the agreement, we discover no binding obligation that Drexel should make <em>advances </em>to build up the property as the <em>contract mode </em>of making the sales. Doubtless he so intended to do, and Marvine <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>believed he would, hut we find no sufficient evidence of a contract to do it. Such an understanding might have been fairly the subject of an independent parol agreement not contradictory of the writing, and therefore the masters properly received the evidence to establish it; yet we cannot say that the evidence plainly did prove it, while the entire omission from the writing of a matter so vital to Marvine’s interests is strongly persuasive evidence that it was left to the determination of Drexel himself. The expectation, well founded it is probable, that he would sell the property in this mode, which was disappointed only by the death of Drexel, constituted no contract, and had the executors made advances to build up the property it would have been at their own peril. But while this left the executors to make the sale otherwise, they could not make it to the prejudice of Marvine’s right if a better mode than the one they proposed was reasonably practicable. Hence in determining to sell regardless of his interests and wishes in a manner ruinous, as the masters characterize it, of these interests they were properly enjoined; and equity having taken possession of the ease, will direct the sale to be made in such a manner as to serve the joint interests of the parties.

This can be best done under the order of the court and through the instrumentality of its officer. The executors looking to the special interests of the estate they are to administer, and a speedy settlement of its affairs, occupy a position to some extent adverse to the interests of Marvine, while a master or receiver would hold a middle position. We have therefore made the following decree, to wit:—</p>
    <blockquote id="b368-6" data-blocks='[["BL_368.5",368,[454,1692,979,385]]]'>And now, this-27th day of February, A. D. 1871, it is ordered and decreed by this court that all and singular the property, estates and interests mentioned and referred to in the agreement between Francis M. Drexel and Edward E. Marvine, dated May 18th 1861, shall be sold by a receiver, to be agreed upon and chosen by the parties to this bill, and approved by the court, or if they cannot agree, to be appointed by the court.</blockquote>

That such sales shall be made from <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>time to time upon mortgages, ground-rents or for cash or partly in any or all said modes; all such sales being made subject to the approval of the court, or a judge thereof sitting at Nisi Prius, either party being at liberty to except to the confirmation thereof.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b369-6" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[374,582,975,215]]]'>That the parties, plaintiff and defendants, have leave to purchase as if they were strangers, and to obtain a credit for the purchase-money to a sum not exceeding the amount such party shall be entitled to receive out of the proceeds of said sales.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b369-7" data-blocks='[["BL_369.6",369,[375,797,975,212]]]'>That before the receiver shall proceed to make such sales, the defendants shall furnish to him a full and true statement and account of the sums chargeable against said property on part of the said Francis M. Drexel, deceased.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b369-10" data-blocks='[["BL_369.9",369,[375,1827,975,247]]]'>The receiver shall give a bond with sufficient sureties to be approved of by the court or a judge at Nisi Prius, in the sum of $20,000 for the faithful discharge of his duties, and accounting for and paying over all moneys which shall come into his hands from the said sales.</blockquote>
