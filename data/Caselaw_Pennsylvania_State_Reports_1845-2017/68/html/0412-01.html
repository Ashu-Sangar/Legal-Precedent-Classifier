On the 16th of June 1870, the balance on the account not having been distributed, persons interested residing in another county, asked for a review, setting out that the executrix had not produced to the appraisers, nor introduced into her account, a large amount of assets of the estate. The petitioners averred that they did not know of the settlement till after the confirmation and therefore had no opportunity to object. The Orphans’ Court dismissed the petition, as not showing error in law, matter since the decree or new proof. The Supreme Court reversed the decree and ordered a review.</p>

The petition for review is rested simply on the ground of the petitioners’ ignorance of the account or decree. But the cases have definitely settled the law upon this subject, and it is clearly stated by Mr. Justice Strong, in Hartman’s Appeal, 12 Casey 75, in the following language: ‘ A petition of review must aver error of law appearing in the body of the decree sought to be reviewed, or new matter which has arisen since the decree, or that new proof has been discovered which could not possibly have been used at the time when the decree was made.’ Unless the petition is supported by one of these conditions it cannot be maintained, either on the score of right or as a matter of grace, appealing to the discretion of the court, but must be dismissed. This petition is deficient in the three essentials, as neither showing error in law, nor matter arisen since the decree, nor any new proof which might not have been used when the decree was passed.”</p>
