That at the time of the passage of the Act of Assembly incorporating the Nippenose Manufacturing Company, he had been for many years previous thereto engaged in the manufacture of woollen goods, and had acquired much experience in that business. That soon after the passage of said act he was solicited by G. W. Youngman, one of the commissioners named in the act, to subscribe to the capital stock of said company; that the defendant declined to subscribe, alleging as a reason therefor that he had no money to invest in that way. That said Youngman then urged him to take stock, and assured him that if he would subscribe he would not be required to pay any money, but that as soon as the company was organized and ready to commence operations, defendant would be employed as general superintendent, and could pay for his stock in that way. That defendant, relying upon said representations and promise, and believing that said Youngman had authority to receive such conditional subscription, was induced to subscribe for 80 shares of the capital stock of said company. That as soon as the company was fully organized, defendant was employed as general superintendent, in accordance with the condition upon which his subscription was made; that he superintended the location and erection of the buildings, and after the factory went into operation he had a general oversight of the establishment, and so continued until about the 4th’December 1869, when he was discharged by plaintiff without any sufficient reason. That during part of the time he was employed as superintendent he travelled from place to place, in and out of the state, making purchases of wool, &amp;c., for tbe supply of said manufactory, expended large sums of money for travelling expenses whilst thus engaged in the service of the plaintiffs. That for these services he- became entitled to a credit upon his subscription of stock to the amount of about $1000, that being the amount of his account against the plaintiff. That plaintiff never at any time demanded from defendant the payment of his stock or any part of it in money, nor did defendant at any time demand payment of any <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>part of his account, but that up to the time that defendant was discharged from service both parties acted in accordance with the arrangement with Mr. Youngman. That when the subscription was made, defendant suggested to Mr. Youngman that the condition had better be written on the face of the book, to which Mr. Youngman replied that there was not room to write it out, but that it was all right, and that he had authority to receive such subscriptions. Defendant, trusting to the correctness of these representations, said nothing further at that time; but a short time afterwards, taking with him another for the purpose of bearing witness of the arrangement under which the subscription was made, that defendant then proceeded to relate what had been said at the time of the subscription, to which Mr. Youngman replied, “ that is all right, and I would have admitted that at any time, and it has been my understanding from the beginning,” or words to that effect. That before taking said witness with him, defendant asked Mr. Youngman if he had any objection to- his doing so, to which Mr. Youngman replied that he was willing if defendant was not satisfied as the matter then stood.</p>

Rep. 426, that a promise made by a commissioner appointed to receive subscriptions for the stock of a proposed corporation to a person offering to subscribe that he might pay in work was binding on the corporation, at least so far as to prevent it from recovering from the subscriber contrary to the terms of the agreement. It appears to have been merely considered as a question whether parol evidence could be received of what had occurred at the time to vary the terms of the contract. Hill <em>v. </em>Ely, 5 S. &amp; R. 363, and Miller <em>v. </em>Henderson, 10 Id. 290, are referred to as authorities to sustain the judgment, and these are cases on the subject of the admission of parol evidence to vary writings. McConahy <em>v. </em>The Turnpike has been sinee regarded as falling within that category: Kennedy <em>v. </em>Erie and Wattsburg Plank Road Co., 1 Casey 226. Back of this question of the admissibility of parol evidence, however, lay the more pertinent question which seems to have been overlooked, of the power of the commissioner to change the terms of the contract which he was authorized to make, or to accept in other words a conditional subscription — any other than one providing for the payment of money. He was an agent appointed by the law with a special power of attorney. All who dealt with him must look to the source of his authority. It may possibly be that if a condition in writing were attached to the subscription, the subscription itself would be void, unless perhaps it should be assumed and ratified by the corporation after organization. When, however, it is on its face absolute and unconditional, the charter is granted and the company organized on the faith of it, and in such case, therefore, not the subscription but the condition is void. This is clearly the result of the opinions and judgments in Irvin <em>v. </em>The Turnpike Co., 2 Penna. Rep. 466; Pittsburg and Steubenville Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Biggar, 10 Casey 455; Pittsburg and Connellsville Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Stewart, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%2054" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Wright 54">5 Wright 54</a>, and Bedford Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Bowser, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%2029" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="12 Wright 29">12 Wright 29</a>. McConahy <em>v. </em>The Turnpike Road Co., therefore, so far as the point for which it is relied on by the plaintiff in error is concerned, may be considered as an overruled case.</p>

The offer did not state what office Youngman held at the time, nor that he had authority from the corporation. The other offers upon the rejection of which errors are assigned were clearly immaterial.</p>
