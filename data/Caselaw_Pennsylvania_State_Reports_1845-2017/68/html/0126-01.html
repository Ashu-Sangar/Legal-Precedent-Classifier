The land was sold under a subsequent mortgage given by husband and wife. In distributing the balance of the proceeds, there being no clear evidence that the property had been purchased with the separate funds of the wife, it was to be treated as the husband's property.

In Gamber <em>v. </em>Gamber, 6 Harris 366, it was said that where property is claimed by a married woman she must show by evidence that does not admit of reasonable doubt, either that she owned it at the time of her marriage, or else acquired it by gift, bequest or purchase. Raybold <em>v. </em>Raybold, 8 Harris 311, held that property purchased by a wife, paid for in her earnings and savings, is her husband’s. He was there said to be entitled to the person and labor of the wife, and the benefits’of her industry and economy. In Gault <em>v. </em>Saffin and Wife, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20307" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Wright 307">8 Wright 307</a>, <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>Judge Read said: ‘It is now settled law that evidence that the wife purchased real or personal estate amounts to nothing unless it he accompanied by clear and full proof that she paid for it with her own separate funds; not that she had the means of paying, but that she in fact thus paid. This is a definite, precise and just rule.’ And this rule disposes of the evidence of Mr. Mengle, who proves the receipt of some money by Caroline Bower, but states nothing to indicate its appropriation. In Baringer <em>v. </em>Stiver, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%20129" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Wright 129">13 Wright 129</a>, the property of a married woman, acquired after marriage, was held to be protected from her husband’s creditors only where clearly shown to have been paid for by her out of her own separate estate. And Curry <em>v. </em>Bott, 3 P. E. Smith 400, was a case where a vendor conveyed to a wife for the consideration of $300, for which he took her note; he received about $80 on the note and gave it up to her. This was declared to be a purchase and not a gift of the land, and it became the property of the husband without clear and satisfactory evidence of a separate estate in the wife, which was applied to the payment of the consideration. It was held that her note, without a separate estate devoted to its payment, was not sufficient to give her the title; and that the presumption was, that the consideration was to be paid by the husband. Under these cases it seems too clear for doubt that the fund in controversy is to be treated precisely as if it had arisen from a sale of land bought by and conveyed to Joseph Bower.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b128-6" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[330,1456,1153,984]],["BL_129.1",129,[195,398,1158,602]]]'>“ The remaining question is involved in the claim asserted on behalf of Elizabeth Bower’s judgment against Joseph Bower’s demand of exemption. Having executed a mortgage to Jane Riffert, against which he could not ask exemption, it is insisted that the right of Bower as against all the liens has been surrendered. Undoubtedly an express waiver in favor of a junior lien deprives the debtor of all power to participate in the distribution of a fund, and leaves it to be apportioned amongst creditors precisely as if the Exemption Law did not exist. But it would be a straining of this principle to enforce its application to the distribution of an entire fund in consequence of the implied waiver resulting from the execution of a mortgage. As against a mortgagee, the rights of a debtor are gone. But the execution of a mortgage does not amount to a waiver of all claims to exemption as against general judgment-creditors. This would seem to be settled by numerous authorities bearing not only on analogous questions, but on the very point in issue. Thus it has been held that where a defendant is indebted in a judgment for purchase-money, while exemption against that cannot be claimed, it may be asserted against other liens. And so, where of several judgments against a debtor one was executed before the Act of 1849, this fact will not preclude his claim against the others. And in Hill <em>v. </em>Johnston &amp; Parker, 5 Casey 362, it was decided that <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>where a debtor’s real estate is sold .under a judgment on a mort gage given for the balance of purchase-money, he is entitled to the balance of the proceeds after the payment of the mortgage-debt and costs, it being less than $300, in preference to judgments obtained for debts contracted since July 4th 1849. The law was differently held by the District Court of Philadelphia, in Saving Fund <em>v. </em>Creighton, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Phila.%2058" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Phila. 58">3 Phila. 58</a>, and in Dorman <em>v. </em>McAuley, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Phila.%20324" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Phila. 324">3 Phila. 324</a>. But the rule of Hill <em>v. </em>Johnston &amp; Parker was recognised in Shelly’s Appeal, 12 Casey 373, where it was said that a debtor, although he cannot claim the benefit of the Exemption Law as ag'ainst a mortgage-creditor, may nevertheless come in upon the fund, and claim $300 as against judgment-creditors. And in McAuley’s Appeal, 11 Casey 209, the authority of Hill <em>v. </em>Johnston &amp; Parker was also recognised.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b129-6" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[195,1000,1157,551]]]'>“It was agreed on the argument that the demand by Joseph Bower for exemption was made in due time and form. In the judgment of the court, his claim should be allowed. The mortgage of Ernst, being the first lien, was not divested by the sale. The fund is to go, first, to the mortgage of Jane Riffert, for the use of Charles Q. Korte, under which the sale was made; secondly, to Joseph Bower, in satisfaction of the exemption-claim; and, thirdly, to John S. Richards, the plaintiff in the first judgment-lien. An accurate calculation has not been furnished to the court, although it is supposed these appropriations will exhaust the fund. If any balance remains after the payment of the Richards judgment, it should be applied on accóunt of the judgment in favor of Elizabeth Bower’s estate.</p>

It affirms the right on the several authorities cited by him. We therefore affirm the distribution made, excepting in a single almost immaterial respect, to which the attention of the court below was evidently not called, as seems to be admitted by the appellant; nor is it properly assigned for error here, although we think it is nevertheless error, namely: As Richards’s judgment and Elizabeth Bower’s judgment against Joseph Bower, the debtor, bear date the same day, any money applicable to either, ought to have been applied <em>pro raid </em>to each.
