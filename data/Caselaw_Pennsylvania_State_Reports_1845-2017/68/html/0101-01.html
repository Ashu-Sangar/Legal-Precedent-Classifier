If the power of right exists it may of right be exercised at any moment. The trustee appointed to-day, no matter how unexceptionable he may be, can be removed to-morrow on the mere petition of the cestui que trust, and so on from day to day, and week to week, and year to year.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Who is to be the master of the situation ? What is to become of the trust estate ?

One trustee must follow another, it may be in such rapid succession that the investments of a trust estate will hardly be known to one before his successor will be appointed; account after account-must be filed, thus opening the door to prejudicial litigation, with its inevitable cost. It is our duty to rescue this Act of Assembly from a construction which will produce such chaos as this. Fortunately we can do so by holding the act to be so far directory as to permit us to judge of the existence of some cause <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>of removal.
