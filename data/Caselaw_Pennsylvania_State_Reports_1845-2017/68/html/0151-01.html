We do not think the position a correct one, that because executors are subject to the Orphans’ Court as to any of the assets, they become so as to all. This would be to confound jurisdiction, and would inevitably result in a conflict of authority, which for every reason of order, in the settlement of an estate, and of safety to the person charged with the performance of such a trust, should be avoided. It is an argument which answers and defeats itself, of which the case before us is a clear illustration. The testator died possessed of property situate in five different states. If the principle contended for by the petitioner is a sound one, it follows that we have as many separate jurisdictions, each having control over a part of the assets of the estate, and by reason of such control, drawing to itself all the remaining portions, and as to the whole making separate and possibly conflicting decrees, both as to settlement and distribution. There are already two accounts filed by these executors upon compulsion, at the instance of heirs and legatees in New Jersey, as well as in Penn<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>sylvania; the former of these accounts has been audited and stated by the surrogate of Burlington county, notice of which has been given by publication, and no objection having been made to them, a decree has been entered allowing the same as reported. The respondents say they are advised by counsel learned in the law in New Jersey, that said decrees are in accordance with the regular practice of the Orphans’ Court of that state, preliminary orders, that they are judicial determinations, that all the items with which the accountants charged themselves, as well as all of the items for which they have claimed credit, and also that the balance resulting therefrom, are correct, and allowed to remain as stated, but that said decrees are neither final nor distributive.</p>

But it is a sufficient answer to this suggestion that the petitioner had legal notice of the proceedings in the courts of New Jersey, and that she has allowed the decrees of settlement to go without objection, and that if any injury is to follow from the preliminary decrees, as they now stand, it is not too late to apply to the Orphans’ Court of Burlington county for relief, as against the orders and determination of the surrogate. Nor is the principle, which we believe to be the true one in a case of this kind, without authority for its support. The cases cited by the counsel for the respondents are in affirmance of it.

There was no attempt or pretence to distribute the New Jersey assets in this state.</p>
    <p id="b157-7" data-blocks='[["BL_157.6",157,[182,1492,1150,303]]]'>On the 15th April 1870, Mrs. Marcia R. Freeman, a daughter and legatee of the testator, presented her petition to the Orphans’ Court, praying a decree should be made, ordering the executors to pay her her share of all the assets of the estate for distribution, including the New Jersey assets, over which the court never had assumed jurisdiction, as well as the Pennsylvania assets, over which they had plenary power which they had exercised.</p>

The reasoning in Parker’s Appeal, which shows the ancillary administration should <em>not </em>transmit its assets to the principal administration, <em>á fortiori </em>shows the principal administration cannot be called upon to transmit its assets to the ancillary administration. Upon general principles no such decree could be made by the Orphans’ Court, nor is any such power given to it by the language of the Act of Assembly: Lewis <em>v. </em>County of Chester, 10 P. F. Smith 325. The original will was proved in New Jersey, and remains of record there, and a copy of it duly authenticated was produced for probate to the register here, and letters testamentary were issued to the executors under the 12th <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>section of the Act of 15th March 1832. The 16th section of that act, prescribing the form of bond to be given by a non-resident executor, shows exactly the power of these executors under the letters testamentary issued here: <em>a </em>shall make a true and perfect inventory of all and singular the goods, chattels and credits of the said deceased being within this Commonwealth.”</p>
    <p id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.5",158,[320,646,1154,245]]]'>The domicil of the testator governs the form and construction of his will as to personal estate and as to its distribution, which is made by the appropriate tribunal in each state. It seems therefore to involve an absurdity to ask that the assets of the principal administration .should be transferred to the ancillary ' administration.</p>
