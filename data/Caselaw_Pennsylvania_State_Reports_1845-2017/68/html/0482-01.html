Not certain if he was physically able to write his name or not. He died in a few days after the will was written. Mathias Anstadt and Stephen Yoder were called as witnesses. The signing of the will was done in the presence of the witnesses and acknowledged before them. Anstadt and Yoder the witnesses are both dead. I was present when the will was admitted to probate, Anstadt and Yoder were present as witnesses in the register’s office — think they were sworn as witnesses to the will. I saw Anstadt and Yoder, the witnesses, sign their names to the will. I * do not recollect any particular words, but I am satisfied that the testator directed me to write his name to the will, as I have always been very particular in executing wills. I do not recollect anything said by him particularly, but am satisfied that I would not have done so unless requested — it was not my custom to write a man’s name, unless specially requested.

The distribution of the proceeds was referred to an auditor, and before this auditor the will was impugned as imperfectly executed, so held to be by him, and his report confirmed by the court. We think this was an error. <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>After a probate of a will, which is primá facie sufficient evidence of the due execution of it even as to real estate, and no contest has taken place upon it for more than twenty-one years, and a title founded upon it in the mean time, nothing less than clear and satisfactory evidence of a strong character should be permitted to rebut the <em>prima facie </em>effect of the probate. Clearly there was nothing in the testimony of Peter Levy so clear and satisfactory as to rebut the strong presumption in favor of the will. But this question becomes of no importance under the provisions of the 7th section of the Act of 22d April 1856, declaring that the probate shall be <em>conclusive </em>as to real estate unless <em>within five years </em>from the date of such probate those interested to controvert it, shall, by <em>caveat and action at law duly pursued, </em>contest the validity of such will as to such realty.

F. Smith 382, where the question directly arose, it was held that the Act of 1856 makes no exception in favor of <em>minors </em>and <em>femes covert, </em>and that the exceptions in the Act of 1785 could not be applied. “ We hold, therefore (said Strong, J.), that the probate by the register of the proper county of any will devising real estate is conclusive upon all persons, whether infants, <em>femes covert, non compotes mentis </em>or not, unless within five years from the date of such probate the validity of the will shall be contested in the manner pointed out by the 7th section of the Act of 1856.”</p>
