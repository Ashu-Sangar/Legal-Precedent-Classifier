Wilson, Esq., the place designated in the rule for taking the depositions, who stated to the deponent that he was attorney for the plaintiff in the above-stated case, and that depositions had been taken in the case, on a rule, that evening. Your deponent then notified him that he .appeared for the defendant, and- demanded the privilege of a cross-examination. Mr. Wilson replied that the witnesses had returned to their homes, and it would be impossible for him to produce them for cross-examination at that late hour of the day. The deponent further states that the witnesses were not produced, and therefore no cross-examination was had. ”</p>

In doing this, “ we rely greatly,” as my brother Agnew said, in Fleming <em>v. </em>Beck, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20309" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Wright 309">12 Wright 309</a>, “ upon the interpretation of the court 'below of its own rules.”</p>

The time fixed for taking the testimony was between the hours of 8 o’clock A. M. and 11 o’clock p. M., and the justice, in certifying to the execution of the rule, states that the depositions were closed at half past 8 o’clock P. M., of the day fixed, and no one appearing up to that time to cross-examine, “ the witnesses and myself retired from the place of examination, and I did not go back that night.”</p>
    <p id="b320-7" data-blocks='[["BL_320.6",320,[300,1038,1163,510]]]'>The learned judge exercised his judgment that this afforded ample time to the opposite party to appear and cross-examine, if ■he meant to do so. And certainly it was, on any reasonable calculation. A reasonable time must always be given the opposite party for that purpose. If not, the testimony should be rejected, if the party appeared in such reasonable time and found the depositions closed and the party and his witnesses gone. But this was not the case here. There was therefore no error in admitting the testimony taken on the rule. As to the special exceptions to the reading of certain portions of the depositions of the witnesses, we regard the portions objected to as entirely immaterial to the issue, and we need not further discuss them.</p>
