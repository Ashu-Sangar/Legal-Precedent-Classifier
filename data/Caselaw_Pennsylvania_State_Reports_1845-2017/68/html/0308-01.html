Mitchell, upon the execution issued against him by Roberts, and also upon fi. fa. issued by Ehrisman, and that the goods were appraised and set apart to him by the sheriff, that a subsequent sale by him of those goods to Ehrisman, even if such a sale was a fraud in law, would nevertheless give to Ehrisman a good title to the property.</p>

But Mr. Ehrisman exercised no acts of ownership upon the premises nor over the property, and the employees had no other intercourse or acquaintance with him than the introduction; he left the next day and was not there afterwards. The employees continued under their engagements previously existing with Mitchell; paid over to Mitchell the proceeds of the bar as before; Mitchell remained in charge of the business. No change of name, sign, persons in charge or manner of conducting the business took place. Nothing indicated any change of ownership, save only the declarations of Mr. Mitchell. There is no evidence that any account of the proceeds of the hotel was ever rendered to Mr. Ehrisman, or to his agent, Mr. Wood.]</p>

On the 17th of March a sale was made to John Casselberry for $1500, all to be paid within sixty days. The schedule of property sold to Casselberry includes many articles not contained in the appraisement schedule, such as eighty gallons of wine, &amp;c. * * * And it appears from the evidence that the lease and good-will of the establishment passed by the sale to Casselberry. We have no other evidence of the value of these articles than the inference to be drawn from the relative valuations placed upon the two schedules. The appraisement schedule was valued at $217.75. The schedule to Casselberry at $1500. $111 of this purchase-money has been appropriated to the payment of a debt of Mitchell by the order of Ehrisman, and only $143 of it ever paid to Ehrisman. $650 of that purchase-money constitutes the fund in court, brought in upon an attachment execution issued by Roberts in his judgment.</p>
