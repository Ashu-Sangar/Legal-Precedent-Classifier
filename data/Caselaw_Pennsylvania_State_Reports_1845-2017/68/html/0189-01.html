The plaintiff cannot and does not controvert the regularity of this chain of title from the Commonwealth to the defendants. But he claims title under the Statute of Limitations, and this is the leading question in the cause. The trust deed made John B. Quick a cestui que trust of Frost and Loring; and, to enable him to acquire title by the Statute of Limitations against his trustees and co-tenants, he must oust them from the possession and hold the actual, visible, notorious, hostile, continuous and uninterrupted possession for twenty-one years. The trustees and co-tenants, in order to be affected, must have had notice of the intention of John B. Quick to change the character of the possession — in other words, notice that he claimed to hold in hostility to them. [But an ouster need not necessarily be proven by direct and positive notice of an intention to exclude the trustees and co-tenants. Ouster and adverse possession may be presumed by the jury, from ‘ open, notorious and uninterrupted possession of the whole by a tenant in common for twenty-one years, claiming the whole land as his own, and taking the whole profits exclusively to himself.’ These facts do not constitute a legal presumption of ouster — they are facts from which a jury may infer ouster and adverse possession ; if the evidence satisfies their minds, the fiduciary character of the relation has been determined and notice of such determination has been brought home to the parties to be affected.] [If the jury shall be satisfied from the evidence that John B. Quick and Peter A. L. Quick, by themselves and by tenants, held actual, visible, notorious, hostile, continuous and uninterrupted possession of this land, or any portion of it, for twenty-one years prior to 1856, and that the trustees and co-tenants had notice of such adverse and hostile holding, the plaintiff may recover to the extent of such possession.]” The court here referred the jury in general terms to the evidence on both sides relating to the possession, and proceeded : “It has been already said, the possession necessary to give title under the statute must be continuous and uninterrupted. There must be no break in the continuity of the possession. An entry by the owner or an action of ejectment prosecuted to 'judgment will suspend the statute — as it is termed, will toll the statute. [A vacancy in the possession caused by a tenant’s going out a few weeks, or even a few months, before another tenant comes in, does not break the continuity of the possession, if the <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>landlord have his title upon record, and does not intend to relinquish his possession, and puts another tenant in before his possession is disturbed by another claimant. Peter A. L. Quick had his title upon record in 1844; but John B. Quick, who claims to have been in possession by his tenants up to that time, had no record title; and a vacancy of one day prior to 1844, caused by one tenant’s going out before another came in, would have broken the continuity of the possession. If the jury find from the evidence any such break in the possession, the previous possession goes for nothing, and the plaintiff must begin his possession anew.]</p>

Quick was in possession of the Miner lot by lease, or otherwise, this ejectment prosecuted to judgment tolled the statute, and, the statute not having run at that time, the plaintiff cannot recover. Or if you believe from the evidence that Peter A. L. Quick employed counsel to defend that suit, the plaintiff cannot recover, even though Jacob R. Quick was in possession only of the David lot under his deed.</p>

On the 8 th of May 1826, John B. Quick deeded one undivided fourth of lot 42, and of the Daniel David lot, to George Biddis. On the 9th of May he conveyed one undivided fourth of the Lewis lot to George Biddis. On the 16th of September 1830 the executor of George Biddis conveyed this title to Francis A. L. Smith. In 1841 Smith conveyed to Thomas Clark. This title is now vested in the defendants. It is claimed by the plaintiff that these deeds to Biddis were given to secure the repayment of a loan of money; and that the money has been <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>repaid. A deed absolute upon its face may be shown by parol, if the evidence is clear and explicit, to be security for money loaned, and only a mortgage. [It is further claimed by the plaintiff that Smith and Clark had actual notice and full knowledge of the character of this deed. And it is further claimed that when the defendants and the grantees of Clark’s executors acquired title, John B. Quick was in the actual possession of the property. If you find all these facts as claimed by the plaintiff, the defendants cannot hold the one undivided fourth of the land under this Biddis title. If the deed was given to secure the repayment of a loan and has been paid, and Smith and Clark both had actual notice of this fact; and at the time Clark’s executors conveyed to John C. Phelps, John B. Quick and those claiming under him were in the actual, visible and notorious possession of the land, and continued such possession down to 1856, such possession was constructive notice of the character of this Biddis title, and the defendants will not be protected by it.] If you find any of the facts just stated against the plaintiff, the defendants will be entitled to hold this undivided one-fourth, and this right is in no way affected by the Statute of Limitations.</p>

The court charged that <em>“ </em>a vacancy in the possession caused by a tenant’s going out even for a few months, before another tenant comes in, does not break the continuity of the possession, if the landlord have his title upon record, and does not intend to relinquish his possession and put another tenant in before his possession is disturbed by another claimant. Peter A. L. Quick had his title upon record in 1844; but John B. Quick, who claims to have been in possession by his tenants up to that time, had no title; and a vacancy of one day prior to 1844, caused by the tenant’s going out before another came in, would have broken the continuity of the possession.” As an unqualified instruction upon the doctrine of the Statute of Limitations, this portion of the charge is erroneous. The distinction between a trespasser without, and one with title on record, in its effect upon the continuity of possession, has no place in the law. The deed from John B. to Peter A. L. Quick, which the learned judge calls title, is nothing but the link connecting together the possession of these two persons, whose possession otherwise would be independent and distinct trespasses. Where the question is upon the éxtent of possession, of one without title, the deed, warrant, survey or other evidence of supposed title may give color to and extend the possession by presumption beyond his actual enclosure or cultivation; but it can have no possible effect upon the fact whether he has continued in the possession or left it. In view <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>of the circumstances of this case, the latitude of time allowed by the judge to preserve the continuity of possession, is important. A few months, because of the favor shown to the man with a deed or record, might be six, eight or ten. Now, clearly, it is not the law that possession can actually be abandoned for so many months, even though the trespasser intend to return. There is no resemblance in this respect between the case of a trespasser on the title of another, and a settler by improvement on vacant land. The <em>animus revertendi, </em>which evinces the intention of the settler to gain a rightful title under the authority of the state, cannot, in the case of a trespasser, supply the place of an actual possession to obtain a title by wrong. As a circumstance of evidence, the <em>animus revertendi </em>may, with other <em>indicia, </em>tend to show that the actual possession has not been abandoned, as where the party leaves crops in the ground, and large improvements, or cattle grazing in the fields. Even non-residence will not toll the statute where the party keeps up his possession by cultivation. It is well settled that actual possession may be either by residence or by cultivation, and need not be by both. Had the court qualified this portion of the charge, so as to give the jury to understand that they meant only a suspension of residence and not a vacancy in possession, there would have been no error. But the language was “a vacancy of possession for a few months.” In this case it was important that the instruction to the jury should be carefully guarded, for the improvements on some of the tracts were very insignificant, while the occupancy consisted partly in mining coal at intervals; the tenants were numerous, their removals frequent, and altogether the possession bordered closely on the loose and roving. The case of Cunningham <em>v. </em>Patton, 6 Barr 355, has been cited to show that an interval of four months will not destroy the continuity of possession. The facts of this case are very briefly reported, and it is evident the language of Coulter, J., has reference to features not presented clearly. The judge in the court below charged <em>“ </em>that there was no suspension of the possession by reason of Duval having left it for a short time under the circumstances.” What these circumstances were, is the defect in the report, but the only point made in the argument of the counsel for the defendant in error was, that residence is not necessary to make an adverse possession; while Coulter, J., remarked, <em>“ </em>that during these four months the trespasser could not have returned the land unseated” — “there were the house and barn, and the land cleared to 'warn him to inquire after the settler” — “his absence was during the period when the farmer does not bestow his labor on the soil, it was neither seed-time nor harvest.” It seems to be a case not of a suspension or abandonment of possession, but of residence, where there were <em>indicia </em>to show that the possession was otherwise kept up, and in view of this the <em>animus </em>
      <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>
      <em>revertendi </em>was a circumstance in the evidence, leading the Justice to resemble it to the case of a settler. If the case were not of this character it cannot be sustained; and the analogy to the case of a settler would well deserve the strong criticism of Gibson, J., in Stephens <em>v. </em>Leach, 7 Harris 262. In the last case the correct principles of the statute were stated by the former Chief Justice. “ Adverse possession,” he says, “ professing as it does to be founded not on title but on trespass, is essentially aggressive, and the stamp of its character must always be preserved by acts on the premises. A man does not discontinue his possession by locking up his bouse in town, or suspending his cultivation in the country, provided he do not suffer the buildings in the one ease, or the fields in the other, to be thrown open; but he is bound to continue a positive appearance of ownership, by treating the property as his own, and holding it within his exclusive control. An intention to resume a suspended intrusion of which the owner of the title may know nothing, is short of the requirement of the statute. The question is not, what did the outgoing occupant intend, but what did he do ? Did he keep his flag flying and present a hostile front to adverse pretensions ? An adverse possession ought to be such as to challenge the right of all the world; but when an occupant has evacuated the place and suffered it to go to wreck, he hauls down his colors and his challenge is withdrawn.” The language is perhaps too figurative to be entirely plain, but the scope and purpose of it is to show, that when one leaves the ground personally, he must leave it under circumstances indicating that he has not left the possession, but still holds it. There must be that in the condition and appearance of the premises themselves that show to the world that there is still a person in possession. The unqualified language of the judge below, in the present case, would scarcely lead the jury to distinguish between a mere interval in the occupancy by personal residence, and an interval of actual possession, which would break the continuity of possession; and the obscurity was not diminished when he referred to the continuity being broken by a single day’s vacancy of possession, where the title was not on record. He must have meant the same kind of vacancy of possession when referring to that of a single day and to that of a few months; and if not, then his charge was contradictory. This part of the charge was therefore erroneous, for it left the jury without a consistent rule to guide them in this complicated case, upon its facts.</p>

In a case of such numerous facts and complication of detail, it is not easy to pronounce upon every exception. We may say, however, we are not clear that the rejected evidence referred to in the 10th assignment of error was irrelevant. Phillips being found in possession <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>of a part of tbe property, it would seem to us that her account while in possession of the manner she came there would be competent to show under whom she was living there, and this whether she was a married woman or not. The character of the possession of a party as stated by himself while in possession is part of the <em>res gestee. </em>It was not offered to affect the rights of her husband or of his landlord, if he had any, for so far as we understand the evidence (in which indeed we may err), there was no possession of the husband or lease to him; but the offer seems to relate to an independent possession by Mrs. Phillips herself, which it was the right of the party to have referred to the jury.</p>

We shall, however, not refer to the bills of exception in detail further than to say that some are not sustained, others were saved by the introduction afterwards of the deeds and other writings notin evidence when the objections were made; and others are not sufficiently before us to decide them. Among the last class is the exemplification of the record from Pike county, of the case of George Biddis <em>v. </em>John B. Quick. The certificate of the prothonotary is not printed for us, or it may be there was no general certificate attached to the exemplification. It would seem from the statement in the bill of exception, that the record consisted of loose and detached parts. If that be the fact, there was error in receiving the detached papers. The record must be made up and certified as a whole. This error, if it be one, can be corrected by making up a proper record and certificate.</p>
