Lowry held a judgment against James McKinney for $412.81; this judgment was a lien on two pieces of land belonging to the defendant, one containing 80 acres and the other 10 acres. On that day the defendant agreed to sell the 10 acre lot to W. W. Ballard. On the 27th of February 1865, Ballard paid $6000, half the purchase-money on the contract, and had it recorded. On the 8th of June Ballard made a deed for the 10 acres to “ The Great National Petroleum Company;” this deed was recorded June 26th. July 11th 1865, the plaintiff issued a scire facias on his judgment, which was served on the defendant, but on neither Ballard nor The Petroleum Company. September 27th, judgment was taken against the defendant for want of an affidavit of defence.</p>

McKinney, on the above-stated judgment against James McKinney. The 10 acre tract having been levied on and being advertised to be sold under this execution, on the application of the Petroleum company, the court ordered “ the further execution of this writ stayed as to the 10 acres advertised, until the question is determined whether the same is a lien upon and should be collected from the real estate sold by the defendant to the Great National Petroleum Company.” The foregoing facts, it was agreed, should be submitted to the court on case stated, and “ if upon the facts the court are of the opinion that the Great National Petroleum Company are entitled to have the execution on this judgment restrained as to the 10 acres herein named, then the court to make an order perpetually restraining the same; but if not, then the rule to be discharged.” Johnson, P.

      <em>“ </em>These facts present two questions: First, whether the revival of the judgment in 1865, without service of the sci. fa. on the purchasers as terre-tenants, continued the lien of the judgment as to them; and second, whether under the circumstances the 10 acre lot, purchased by Ballard, is still held by the lien of Lowry’s judgment and liable to be sold for its payment even if the service of the sci. fa. would otherwise be sufficient to continue the lien. As all that is material in our view will properly come in under our decision of the last question, we will give our attention exclusively to that.</p>

Ballard’s land then sustained the relation of surety to the debt of Lowry and its purchaser, and upon payment of it would be entitled to subrogation to its lien on the debtor’s other land. Of this fact the creditor with knowledge was bound to take notice. He could not, therefore, release any of the primary securities and expect to hold to the secondary. As Ballard had the right to demand that McKinney’s other land should first be sold, the release of the <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>other land by the creditor, discharged his land from the lien by the same rule that the release of the principal discharges the surety. If, therefore, Lowry released his lien on the 83 acres in 1866, with Ballard’s purchase of his 10 acres on record, he discharged the 10 acres from liabilities to sale by depriving Ballard of his security against the lien.</p>

McKinney, dated March 20th 1866, does not amount to a release of the lien, then the 83 acres purchased by John, on the 26th of the same month, is primarily liable to the lien and must be first sold, and it is agreed that it is sufficient to pay the debt. But John having bought both land and judgment, the latter is merged and the debt paid.</p>

McKinney, who now controls the execution, is entitled to no favor the law would not have yielded to Lowry. He had actual as well as constructive knowledge that his father had sold this 10 acre piece to Ballard. With that knowledge he procured the release of the 83 acres he wanted to purchase, from the lien of Lowry’s judgment, with a view probably of throwing it on to Ballard’s lot. This the law will not permit. If he says the Lowry letter is not a release then this judgment is still a lien and that land must pay the debt. But he has since purchased the lien himself, which by operation of law extinguishes it, inasmuch as it is made part of the case stated, that the 83 acres is amply sufficient to pay it.</p>
