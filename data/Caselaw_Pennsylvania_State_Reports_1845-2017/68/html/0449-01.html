Keller and Jacob Keller, by which the partnership was dissolved, and by which he sold and contracted to convey in fee to the Kellers for $9000, the foundry buildings and improvements in Littleston, Adams county, theretofore occupied by the firm: the legal title was not conveyed to either of the Kellers. Moses Keller continued to carry on the business, and remained in possession of the foundry and other real estate. On the 22d of December 1868, Keller purchased from the plaintiffs a boiler and fixtures for his foundry, amounting to $1333.75; and on the 25th of January 1869, the plaintiffs furnished him other materials, &amp;c., for his'foundry, amounting to $63.15. On the 12th of February, he made an assignment to Levi D. Maus and others, for the benefit of creditors. On the 1st of March, one of his creditors filed a petition in the District Court, praying that he might be declared a bankrupt. On the 9th of March, the plaintiffs filed their lien for $1396.90, for the above-mentioned materials, attaching a bill of items. The buildings, &amp;c., mentioned in the claim were particularly described as a foundry and machine shops, main building, two stories, &amp;c., “ and boiler building attached thereto of one story and a half, ” &amp;c., and Keller was averred to be the owner or reputed owner. On the 17th of March, Moses A. Keller was adjudged a bankrupt, and William McSherry, Esq., appointed his assignee in bankruptcy.</p>

He never;paid the whole purchase-money, but we think the lien attached to his equitable interest. The decision in Hold-ship <em>v. </em>Abercrombie, <a href="/watts/9/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts 52" data-case-ids="1849973" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0052-01">9 Watts 52</a>, led to the enactment by the legislature of the provisions of the statute of the 28th of April 1840. By that act it was provided that the lien created by the Act of the 16th of June 1836, should not be construed to extend to any other or greater estate in the ground on which the building might be erected, than that of the person in possession at the time of commencing the building, and at whose instance the same was erected. In Lyon <em>v. </em>McGruffey, 4 Barr 126, it is said that the legislature in passing this act did not intend to deprive the creditors by mechanics’ lien of any of the advantages of a judgment; <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>they merely intend to prevent his lien from operating beyond the sphere in which a judgment would be effectual. The whole case goes upon the ground that a mechanics’ lien has the same effect as a judgment, and binds every interest that a judgment would or could bind. It is too well settled that a judgment binds the equitable interest of a vendee who has paid part of the purchase-money but has not obtained the legal title, to require the citation of authorities to prove it. If a judgment binds an equitable interest, such as Moses A. Keller had in the premises, it follows from the case of Lyon <em>v. </em>McGuffey, that a mechanics’ lien must bind the equitable estate which Moses A. Keller had in the premises when the boiler and its fixtures, the subject of this dispute, was furnished on the credit of the building. We therefore think there is nothing in this reserved point which would prevent us rendering a judgment on the verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>

The lien is filed against the building, and he alone is mentioned as the owner or reputed owner of the building. Jacob Keller makes no defence to this claim; in fact he is not a party to this issue. The defence seems to be made by the assignees in bankruptcy, and by Moses A. Keller, the bankrupt.</p>

      <em>“ </em>If it is the law that a mechanics’ lien stands on the footing of a judgment, I can see no good reason why a lien could not be filed against Moses A. Keller as owner or reputed owner of the building, which would bind his interest, whatever it might have been, when the boiler was furnished. The Act of the 28th of April 1840, § 24, Brightly’s Purd. 1862, p. 714, plac. 40., limits the lien to the estate of the person who was in possession at the time the building was commenced. In Sill’s Appeal, 1 Grant’s Cases 285, Lowrie, J., said, in substance, the plaintiff’s recovery does not depend upon the quantity of the defendant’s interest in the land. He claims a lien on defendant’s interest, whatever it is, and he can enforce it when obtained against nothing else. The defendants rely upon the case of Carey <em>v. </em>Wintersteen, 10 P. F. Smith 395, to support the position taken by them, ‘ that as the lien <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>is entered only against Moses A. Keller, who held an equitable title as a tenant in common with Jacob Keller, the lien is fatally defective.’ But we think the facts of the case do not support the position. In the present case the lien is filed alone against Moses A. Keller, the person in possession, and the contracting party. In the case cited, the lien was filed against the owners of the fee, who did not contract, and the tenant in possession, who did contract. Upon this state of the ease the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff could not recover in the manner he had filed his lien. In the present case, we think the lien is filed against the only person plaintiffs could file it against, and that it binds the defendant’s interest in the land, whatever it may be, and therefore the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment upon the verdict.”</p>

The lien of the mechanic was perfectly given by statute, at the time the defendant was declared a bankrupt, although not entered, and it continued so afterwards by being entered on the records of the court, which was within the prescribed period of six months from the commencement of the building and materials furnished. That there is a saving of liens in the Bankrupt Act is apparent in several sections. Sections 27 and 42 imply this so distinctly as not to permit it to be doubted. See notes to these sections, Bright. Dig. of Bankrupt Law, pp. 39 and 47. This court has decided within a year (Biddle’s Appeal, antea, p. 13<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>) that a state court can proceed by process to enforce its liens obtained before an adjudication of bankruptcy, and that the remedy is not in the United States courts.
