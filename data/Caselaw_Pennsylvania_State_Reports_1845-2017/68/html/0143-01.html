The first of these, the <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Edw.%20Ch.%201" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Edw.

It is a necessary incident to the jurisdiction to decree a divorce. So all the interlocutory orders as well for the payment of costs and expenses as of <em>interim </em>maintenance pending the libel, have been, regarded as well in the ecclesiastical courts in England as in-common law courts specially vested with the jurisdiction in this country: Melizet <em>v. </em>Melizet, 1 Parsons’ Sel. Cas. 78; Graves <em>v. </em>Cole, 7 Harris 173; Breinig <em>v. </em>Breinig, 2 Casey 161.. It certainly, however, is not a judgment upon which an execution, could issue, and it has not been pretended that there is any statute which expressly confers upon it the privilege of a lien. The Act of Assembly of April 15th 1845, Pamph. L. 455, gives, the incidents of lien and execution to the allowance of alimony made upon a decree of divorce <em>a mensd et </em>thoro, but no possible construction can extend its provisions so .as to embrace any interlocutory order the court may make. It is probable, however,, that the court below considered that the act entitled, <em>“ </em>An Act to make decrees for the payment of money in equity proceedings liens upon real estate, with the right to revive or continue the liens of the same by writ of scire facias,” passed March 29th 1859, Pamph. L. 289, reached the case. But the order now in <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>question cannot, we think, be construed to be “ a decree in equity for the payment of money.” That act is confined to decrees in equity — or as they are termed in the title, in equity proceedings —in the proper technical sense; and this is manifest from the language used that the lien shall be “ with the same force and effect as the lien of judgments rendered by and in the common-law courts of this Commonwealth.” Decrees by courts in equity, are put on the same footing as judgments in the common-law courts. The construction which would extend these words further would comprehend every order made by a court of common law for the payment of money in the exercise of its original functions, or those superadded by statute; as for example on an attorney to pay over money to his client, or upon its own officer to pay money in court to a suitor. The legislature have not so said and did not so intend.</p>
