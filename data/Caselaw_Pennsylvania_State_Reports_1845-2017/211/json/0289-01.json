Nisly, 2 S. & R. 507.\nThe learned judge .of the court below reached the same result by holding, on the authority of Henninger v. Henninger, 202 Pa. 207, that the measure of her enjoyment of the estate, was, under the devise, as full as if testator had attempted no restriction. It matters not on which theory the result is reached, the judgment is right, and is, therefore, affirmed.",
