At this place an alley seven feet wide opened into the street but did not cross it; crossing stones were laid from the end of the alley to the other side of the street. Plaintiff looked as he stepped in the street and saw a car within 150 or 200 feet of him. He did not look again. When near the west rail he met two men crossing in the opposite direction and stepped from the crossing stones south in the direction of the car. He was struck as he was stepping from the east rail. If he had looked at the point of danger, he would have seen that the car was so near that in attempting to cross he was placing himself in a position of imminent danger. Held, that a verdict was properly directed for defendant not only because of the contributory negligence of plaintiff, but also on account of the failure to prove negligence of the motorman.\nArgued March 22, 1905.\nAppeal, No. 367, Jan. T., 1904, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 5, Phila. Co., June T., 1902, No. 2846, on verdict for defendant in case of James H. Boring v. Union Traction Company.\nBefore Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter and Elkin, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before Davis, J.\nThe facts are stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nThe court gave binding instructions for defendant.\nVerdict and judgment for defendant.
