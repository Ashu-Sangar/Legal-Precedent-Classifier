The money in the hands of the corporation treasurer belonged to the corporation, this plaintiff; except under the charter and by-laws of the corporation it could not lawfully be drawn therefrom. The method by which defendant and his colleagues obtained it is wholly unlawful.\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.",
