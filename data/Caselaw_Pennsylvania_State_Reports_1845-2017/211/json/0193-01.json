        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Brown,\nFive of the six assignments of error in this case relate to the admission of testimony. The first complaint of the appellant is that the court ought not to have permitted the plaintiff to testify that when he was injured he was on his way to Eighth street and Montgomery avenue, \u201c to get a job tending bar, with the intention of buying the place.\u201d This was in reply to the question, \u201c What were you going there for? \u201d The purpose of this question was not asked, and the answer was admitted under a general objection. From all that appears from the record, no error was committed in admitting the testimony at the time it was received; but it is now argued on this appeal that it was improperly admitted, because, in the general charge to the jury, the court instructed them that, in estimating the plaintiff\u2019s loss of earning power, they could take into consideration his testimony that he was on his way to a saloon, with the intention of trying to get employment as a barkeeper and of ultimately becoming the proprietor by buying it. The only error, if any, in connection with this testimony is in that part of the charge of the court relating to the same, but neither that portion of it nor any other part of it has been assigned as error. The first assignment must, there-, fore, be dismissed, for we can correct only such errors as are assigned.\nThe purpose of the testimony which is the subject of the fourth assignment was to show the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s earning power as a bartender, which had been his occupation and which he could no longer follow by reason of his injuries. His testimony on this point was clearly proper, and the assignment relating to it is without merit. There is nothing in the testimony of the plaintiff, the admission of which is assigned as error in the second and third assignments, nor in that of Eagan, the gateman, the subject of the fifth assignment, which ought to. have been excluded. The plaintiff was standing on the rear step of the wagon and the gateman -was at the crossing. Each testified to just what had occurred and what the situation was at the time the driver of the ice wagon started to cross over the tracks and got upon them, and the testimony of each, which was objected to, had a very proper place in the proofs.\nThe remaining assignment is that the court erred in refusing the request of the defendant to direct a verdict in its favor. Its negligence was conceded on the trial, and the ground of the refused request was the alleged contributory negligence' of the plaintiff. The defendant submitted no evidence, and the learned judge, in the light of that offered by the plaintiff, refused to take from the jury the question of his contributory negligence and to judicially declare that it was a bar to his right to recover.\nThe ice wagon, when near the railroad crossing, was stopped by a trolley car in front of it, which had been stopped by the lowering of the gates. The plaintiff was standing on the step at the rear of the wagon. A man named Moore was standing on it beside him, to the right, with his left arm around plaintiff\u2019s body, holding on to a strap with his left hand. The trolley flagman was on the tracks, and, after a north-bound train had passed and the gates been raised, he signaled to the motorman of the traction car to come on. It moved towards and crossed the tracks, followed by the ice wagon. According to one witness, when the horses\u2019 heads were at the gates the driver stopped, and, according to another, he was about to stop. Be this as it may, the plaintiff says he was looking and listening, though his view to the south was obstructed by cars standing on the siding. Apprehensive that there might be danger, he called to the driver, \u201c you had better stop and take another look.\u201d The driver then asked the gateman, \u201c How is it, John ? \u201d and the reply of the gateman, as he beckoned them on, was, \u201c All right, come on.\u201d The plaintiff and the witness Hones, seated in the front of the wagon, not only heard Eagan, but saw him when he signaled the driver of the wagon to come on. Moore, who saw the approaching train when it was within a few feet of him, jumped from the wagon step and escaped. Under the foregoing state of facts, the court could not have pronounced the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence, for it was the exclusive province of the jury to say whether he had or had not, under the circumstances, done all that was required of a prudent man. Approaching a grade railroad crossing, with his own view to the south cut off, up to the very point of crossing, he was on the lookout for danger, apprehensive that he might be in its path, and, but for the conduct of the gateman, it might be that he ought to have exercised a higher degree of care; but, whether he did exercise the proper degree was, under the circumstances detailed, for the jury. On the alert, looking as best he could for danger in the direction from which it came, he heard from the defendant\u2019s employee, whose duty it was to guard against peril at the crossing, the assurance that the way was clear, and he saw the beckon to come over as the gateman said \u201c All right; come on.\u201d Of our many cases which sustain the court in its refusal to direct a verdict for the defendant, on the ground of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, reference need be made only to Fennell v. Harris et al., Receivers of the Philadelphia & Reading R. R. Co., 184 Pa. 578. We there said, under conditions to which our words were no more applicable than to those in. this case : \u201c It is a question of fact, as it seems to us, whether, in view of all the circumstances, the open gate, the repeated signals of the flagman, the absence of a warning by the train of its approach and the impossibility of seeing down the tracks until fairly upon them, the plaintiff omitted any precaution that a prudent man should have taken to secure his safety from danger. He was responsible for none of the circumstances to which we have referred. He had the assurance of the defendant company by the open gate and by the positive intimation of the flagman, that there was no train approaching within such a distance as could threaten his safety in crossing the tracks, and there was nothing to counteract this assurance or put him on notice of danger. He knew that his view of the tracks was obstructed, but one who had superior knowledge of the moving trains allayed his apprehensions by signaling him that it was safe to cross at that time, and that he should proceed to do so. In view of all these considerations and his own testimony the question of contributory negligence was surely not a question of law. It depended upon the plaintiff\u2019s credibility, upon the situation of the obstruction to his view down the railroad, upon the opportunity to escape after he saw the train, upon the want of any warning of its approach by the train, and upon the conduct of the flagman.\u201d\nMoore, who was standing on the step, to the right of the plaintiff, with an arm around him, and obstructing his view, was able to see the approaching train when within a few feet of the wagon, and made a hairbreadth escape from danger by jumping. That he was able to do so, because he could see the danger when it was almost upon him, is no reason, as a matter of law, why McCarthy, who may not have been able to see it, ought also to have saved himself from it by jumping.\nJudgment affirmed.",

The wagon when near a railroad crossing was stopped by a trolley car in front of it, which had been stopped by the lowering of the gates. Another man was standing on the step of the wagon beside plaintiff, to the right, with his left arm around plaintiff\u2019s body, holding on to a strap with his left hand. The flagman was on the track, and after a north-bound train had passed, and the gates been raised, he signaled to the motorman of the traction car to come on. The car moved toward and across the tracks, followed by the ice wagon. When the wagon approached the gates the driver either stopped or was about to stop. Plaintiff testified that he himself looked and listened, although his view to the south was obstructed by standing cars. Apprehensive that there might be danger, he called to the driver, \u201cyou had better stop and take another look.\u201d The driver then asked the gateman, \u201cHow is it?\u201d and the reply of the gateman, as he beokoned them on, was \u201cAll right, come on.\u201d The wagon then proceeded and was struck by a train from the south, and the plaintiff was injured. The man who was standing on the step beside the plaintiff, having a better view, saw the approaching train, and jumped and escaped.

T., 1904, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 4, Pbila. Co., March T., 1902, No. 1213, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Cornelius McCarthy v. Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company.\nBefore Dean, Fell, Blown, Mestlezat, Pottel and Elkin, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before Call, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that plaintiff, whose occupation was that of a bartender, was riding at the time of the accident on the back step of an ice wagon. As the wagon crossed one of defendant\u2019s tracks it was struck by a train and plaintiff was injured. The circumstances of the accident are detailed in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nWhen the plaintiff was on the stand he was asked this question : \u201c Q. Where were you going from Eleventh and Berks ? A. To Eighth and Montgomery avenue. Q. What were you going there for ? \u201d\nMr. Hart: That is objected to.\nObjection overruled. Exception noted for defendant. [1]\n\u201c Q. What were you going there for ? A. I was going there to get a job tending bar, with the intention of buying the place.\u201d ********\n\u201c Q. Where did you stop ? A. Back of the trolley car. As the train passed up we stood there for a minute or two minutes, probably three minutes, and when the train passed up the railroad watchman lifted the gates for the car to pass, the trolley watchman blew his whistle, and the car came on. The car went ahead, and we went after the car. When we got to the gates, I could not see up or down the track, because there were coal cars on both sides, and I put my head in the wagon, and I told Derr \u201d-\nMr. Hart: I object to any conversation between the witness and anybody that is not sought to be charged with negligence as immaterial.\nThe Court: \u201c Q. Who were you going to have the conversation with ? A. The driver of the wagon.\u201d\nMr. Scarborough: I offer to show that this witness, as the team was being driven through the gates, stuck his head in the wagon and called to the driver, Derr, \u201c You had better stop and look again,\u201d this being but about a half minute or half a second before the accident happened, and while the ice wagon was in the very act of crossing the railroad.\nObjected to. Objection overruled. Exception noted for defendant. [2]\nThe Court: \u201c Q. What did you say to the driver ? Could you see him? A. I could not see him. Q. How was the hood you were standing under, down or up ? A. Down. I hallooed into the wagon to Derr, \u2018 You had better stop and take another look.\u2019 \u201d\n********\n\u201c Q. Who raised the gates ? A. The railroad watchman, Mr. Eagan. Q. What did he do while you were crossing over ? A. When we got to the gates Derr said to him, \u2018 John, how is it?\u2019\u201d\nMr. Hart: I object to this.\nMr. Scarborough: I offer to show by this witness that as the horses came between the raised gates the driver of the ice wagon, Mr. Derr, went to the railroad\u2019s gate tender and said, \u201c Jack, how is it ? \u201d and that the railroad\u2019s gate tender called back and said, \u201c All right; go ahead.\u201d\nMr. Hart: That is objected to.\nObjection overruled. Exception noted for defendant. [8]\nThe Court: \u201c Q. Could you see Eagan from where you were ? A.

The northwest corner.\u201d\nMr. Hart: I object to this conversation.\nThe Court: I understand the witness is able to say the conversation with Eagan. There is no proof as to who was driving this wagon, and this man could not see who was driving because he could not see through the board at the back of the seat.\nMr. Scarborough: I desire to amend my offer and supplement it by showing that as the gatekeeper spoke these words, he beckoned to the occupants of the wagon to drive ahead by beckoning this way with his hands. (Indicating.)\nMr. Hart: That is objected to.\nThe Court: Do you mean he beckoned to the men on the back part of the wagon ?\nMr. Scarborough: He beckoned to the men on the driver\u2019s seat of the wagon, and including the driver and the helper.\nMr. Hart: I object.\n\u201c Q. Now was this wagon being taken across there ? A. Mr. Derr and Mr. Hones were on the seat of the wagon; they were driving.\u201d\nThe Court: \u201c Q. Who was driving ? A. I cannot say who was driving the wagon. Q. You do not know whether Derr or the other man? A. No.\u201d\nMr. Scarborough : \u201c Do you know who occupied the position known as driver of the wagon? A. No; I could not say.\u201d\nMr. Hart: I object.\n\u201c Q. How long did this conversation between Mr. Derr and Mr. Eagan take place before the collision ? A. I guess about half a minute. Q. How fast were the horses traveling while crossing the railroad ? A. They were going at a smart walk, just prior to getting into a trot, after starting to get over the tracks.\u201d\nMr. Scarborough: I propose to follow up this offer by showing that Derr was actually holding the lines and driving the horses at the time he called to this gentleman, Eagan, to inquire, and when Eagan beckoned him on.\nThe Court: The offer is admitted with that understanding.\nException noted for the defendant.\n\u201c Q. Go ahead and give that conversation; state what was said by Derr, or by Eagan, while the wagon was being driven through. A. When the wagon got to the gate, Derr says to Eagan, 4 Jack, how is it ? \u2019 and he says, \u2018 All right; come on,\u2019 and he beckoned with his hand. I was looking out on the north side of the wagon' at that time, and I took my head back as we got up to the gates and looked north and south, and could not see anything with the house at the north side with the coal cars at the south side\u2014the watchman\u2019s house on the north side. Q. What had you earned as a bartender for your brother between November, 1891, and November, 1895 ? \u201d\nMr. Hart: That is objected to.\nThe Court: Your object is to show that he had skill as a bartender, and by reason of the accident, he could not follow it any longer ?\nMr. Scarborough: Yes.\nThe Court: The objection is overruled.\nException noted for defendant. [4]\n\u201c A. I had $15.00 a week and my board and lodging and my keep and my chances besides, which amounted to about $25.00 a week. Q. What do you mean by your chances ? A. Customers that we deal with, and in order to stand in with the bartender, they always tip them off. Q. What we ordinarily know in life as 4 tips \u2019 ? A. Yes.\u201d\n* * * -* * * *\nJohn J. Eagan, the gateman, was asked this question :\n44 Q. Who was driving? A. His helper was driving. Q. What is his name? A. Hones, I believe. He came out and threw up his hand. When I went out he threw up his hand and he says to me, \u2018 Hello, Jack \u2014\u2019 \u201d\nMr. Hart: I object.\n\u201c Q. Which side of the wagon was he seated on ? A. He was seated on the left side of the wagon. Q. By you? A. Yes.\u201d\nMr. Hart: I object to any conversation which took place between the witness and some person other than the plaintiff.\nObjection overruled. Exception noted for defendant. [5]\n\u201c Q. He was seated on the front seat ? A. Yes. Q. He was right by Hones? A. Yes. Q. Hones had the reins, as I understand it? A. Yes ; Hones was driving, as near as I recollect. Q.
