I am equally anxious with yourself that the property should not be lost, but I think it much better for all concerned that we have a definite understanding as to our positions before going ahead.

It is as follows, to wit: first, you to give me in return for my services fifty per cent, of the property recovered, provided said fifty per cent, shall not exceed 16,000. Second, you are to advance the necessary funds for costs and expenses, and in the event of loss of suit, to pay the same, but <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>iii the event of our recovery and inability of the other side to pay them, then I to reimburse you to the extent of one-half of same. Third, you are to have the right to discontinue at any time, but in case you exercise that right, then you are to pay all costs and expenses including a reasonable attorney’s fee for services up to the time of discontinuance. These terms are, as I have said, entirely reasonable and proper for you to accept, and it is only just that I should understand distinctly how I stand when acting for the estate. I cannot assume any personal liability for the costs and expenses other than as above. I shall, of course, be responsible for the faithful application of any money you may place in my hands for the purposes of the case, but the case is yours; you are to share the probable benefits equally with me, viz, I risk my time and <em>labor; </em>you ought certainly to be willing to put up a much smaller stake, viz, the expenses necessary to realize. By suggestion which you mention, as to the probable action of the defendants, is of course merely conjectural. If I should turn out to be correct, so much the better for both of us.</p>

A week later I had an interview, and rather a lively one it was, with the parties in possession of two of the tracts named McGough, two of them, and one named McConnell, and on the third trip last week I brought down the game by obtaining from them a release and surrender of possession of the two tracts then in their possession.

I am very busy here just now and will not be able for some time to do anything further for two or three weeks, but so soon as I can I will go ahead and advise you of the result. I have instructed a man named Nepper, who I am informed is a reliable man, to take and hold possession in your name as soon as the McGoughs get their trifling effects off the ground, which they promise this week.
