L. 315, which provides : “ If any child of an intestate shall have any estate by settlement of such intestate or shall have been advanced by him in his lifetime, either in real or personal estate to an amount or value equal to the share which shall be allotted to each of the other children of such intestate, such child shall have no share of the real or personal estate of such intestate, and if such settlement or advancement be to an amount or value less than the share to which he would otherwise be entitled, if no such advancement had been made, then so much only of the real and personal estate of such intestate shall be allotted to such child, as shall make the estate of all the children to be equal as near as can be estimated.” The learned court below was of opinion “ that the moneys received by Henry C. Ogden under the provisions of his mother’s will are to be regarded as an ‘ estate by settlement of an intestate ’ in the distribution of that part of her estate of which she died intestate.”</p>
    <p id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.5",282,[282,1367,1178,344]]]'>The testatrix died intestate as to such portion of her estate as remained in the hands of the trustee at the time of the death of her husband, who survived the two sons. In the language of the court below: “ There was no disposition of the principal, except so far as it might be advanced by the trustee under his discretionary power, and her estate, as to any excess, passed under the intestate laws to her husband and children.</p>
    <p id="b282-6" data-blocks='[["BL_282.6",282,[282,1729,1177,601]]]'>The meaning of the directions given by the testatrix to the trustee is unmistakable. It is that the trustee, in his sole and absolute discretion, was authorized to give a portion, or all, of one third of the principal to the father or either of the sons while the three lived. Upon the death of one, the authority was to give, in the exercise of such discretion, one half of the principal to either of the two surviving, and upon the death of one of them, there was authority to pay the survivor the whole of what remained. The testatrix was not contemplating equality by her will, which is the purpose of the act of 1833, under which the appellant was charged with what had been paid to her father.</p>
    <p id="b282-7" data-blocks='[["BL_282.7",282,[327,2348,1130,43]],["BL_283.1",283,[201,348,1181,1703]]]'>When, in pursuance of the explicit directions to and the <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>clearly defined power of the trustee, lie paid Henry Corbit Ogden moneys from bis mother’s estate, what was the latter receiving ? It is admitted that the payments were not advancements, for, under the statute, they must be made in the lifetime of the intestate; but it is contended that they were settlements contemplated by the act. In answer to this the appellant replies that under the literal meaning of the language of the act of 1833, settlements with which a child can be charged must also be made by the intestate in his lifetime. Which of these positions is correct is not important, if what the son received from his mother’s estate was a testamentary gift to him, for the act of 1833 applies only to intestacy. She did not name any specific sum that should be paid to him by the trustee, but in the latter’s discretion he was authorized to pay the son the whole of one third of the estate during’ the lifetime of the father and the brother, Middleton; one half upon the death of Middleton, who died first, and to the father all that remained after the death of the two sons. When the trustee paid the son he paid what he had been directed by the will to pay, and he paid it as he would have paid a legacy of a certain sum, if the payment of the same had been contingent upon the exercise of a discretion given him by the will. What the son received must, therefore, he regarded as a gift to him by his mother under her will, and in effect it is the same as if there had been a specific sum named by the testatrix which she authorized the trustee to pay in his discretion. This being so, and she having died intestate as to that portion of her estate remaining in the hands of the trustee at the death of her husband, the appellant, claiming through her son, Henry Corbit, cannot be charged with the gift to him on the distribution of the estate as to which she died intestate. In addition to the gift to her father, she, as his child is entitled to a full distributive share of the estate of her grandmother distributed under the intestate laws.</p>

It means, not a person making no will, but a person dying intestate as to the subject to be distributed by the statute. There is no instance of real estate, given to a younger child, or a particular part of the personal estate, given to any child, by the testator, and where executors have been held trustees of the residue, which therefore as undisposed of, was to go under the statute, where in the division of that residue this court ever brought into hotch-pot what the particular child took under the will of that person, dying partly testate, partly intestate: ” Twisden v.
