The law gave her the option of qualified or absolute divorce, and having chosen the latter she would voluntarily have relinquished her whole interest in his estate. The statute of divorce prescribes that upon the dissolution of marriage, “ all and every the duties, rights and claims accruing to either of the parties at any time theretofore in pursuance of said marriage shall cease and determine ” and to this extent is part of the law of distribution. And why not apply this broad principle to wills ? Because, says counsel, there can be no implied revocation without statutory prescription; and divorce is not prescribed. But it is fully established that change of circumstances raises a presumption of change of intention and works a revocation of a will; and this presumption is said to be so strong that it may not be rebutted by parol evidence, on the ground that this would be productive of the evils which were intended to be averted by the statute of fraud: Marshall v. Marshall, <a href="/pa/11/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="11 Pa. 430" data-case-ids="404605" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0430-01">11 Pa. 430</a>. There are subordinate reasons everywhere, said the court in Young’s App., <a href="/pa/39/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="39 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="996219" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0115-01">39 Pa. 115</a>, varying the rule according to the laws of descent. The positive rules are given sometimes by statute, and sometimes by judicial decision; and the most positive of them are sometimes changed merely incidentally by a change in the laws of descent. For the law does not do or require vain things. It has accordingly been held again and again that testator’s sale of a thing specifically given is an implied revocation pro tanto notwithstanding the absence of statutory prescription : 1 Williams on Executors, 242. So it was held in Carey’s App., <a href="/pa/75/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="75 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1036676" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0201-01">75 Pa. 201</a>, that revocation may be implied from change of domicil. No one can doubt that refusal to accept a legacy will work revocation pro tanto : Bryce’s Est., <a href="/pa/194/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="194 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="912396" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0135-01">194 Pa. 135</a>. And so in Lee’s Est., <a href="/pa/207/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="207 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="933556" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0218-01">207 Pa. 218</a>, it was held that a decree of divorce implied the revocation of a coverture trust, upon the ground that “ the law has severed the matrimonial bond as effectually as death could have done.” If this claimant had died before Mr. Jones there can be no doubt that the gift must have failed for she would not have been within the statute of lapse; and divorce is the equivalent of death. If divorce be the equivalent of death in such will, Flory v. Becker, <a href="/pa/2/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="2 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="951120" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0470-01">2 Pa. 470</a>, it must be so in every will in which marital rights <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>are involved. “ Implied revocations,” said Chancellor Kent (4 Comm. 521), “are founded upon the reasonable presumption of an alteration of the testator’s mind arising from conditions since the making of the will, producing a change in his previous obligations and duties. . . . There is not, perhaps, any code of civilized jurisprudence in which this doctrine of implied revocation does not exist, and applied when the occurrence of new social relations and moral duties raise a necessary presumption of a change of intention in the testator.” It is immaterial, said the court in Young’s App., <a href="/pa/39/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="39 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="996219" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0115-01">39 Pa. 115</a>, “whether this principle of the common law was derived from the Roman law, or from our instincts of justice, certainly it is now a legitimate element of our common law, and we would not have received it but for those instincts. The Romans received it before us, because they were before us and because they too were human.” It seems clear, therefore, that there may be implied revocation of wills outside of statutory prescription.</p>

If the gift was made because of the existence of the marital relation, divorce would certainly take away the reason for it; and without the reason which inspired, the legatee could have no equity to claim it. It is immaterial whether her husband made a will or not; for her application having been a voluntary and absolute renunciation of “all and every the duties, rights and claims accruing .... in pursuance of the marriage,” she took the risk and should abide the consequence. It is safe to assume that the gift would not have been made if the beneficiary had not stood in the relation of wife. It may be that Mr. Jones’s misconduct was so gross as to justify his wife leaving him, and that under the spur of remorse he made the will as a peace offering; but it would be asking too much of human nature to expect the husband to make such a gift in anticipation of his wife’s application for divorce and remarriage. “The natural presumption arising from these changed relations,” said the court <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>in Lansing v. Haynes, 95 Midi. 16 (54 N. W. Repr. 699), “ is the reasonable one, and the one from which the law implies a revocation. The question is not to be determined by a possible presumption, but by the reasonable presumption. The possibility, therefore, that the deceased might have desired that the remainder of his property should go to his divorced wife, cannot be considered in determining the question of implied revocation in this case. Such disposition of his property would be unusual, and contrary to common experience,” and the grounds of divorce may be such as to make her claim “ repugnant to that common sense and reason upon which the law is based.”</p>

Irrespective of technical rules no one would hesitate to infer that the first was descriptive of the marital relation and imported on its face that the gift was made because of that relation; and that the latter was descriptive of the individual and imported an absolute gift. The difference of description would imply difference in purpose. So there is a material difference between a gift to testator’s wife and a gift to the wife of another in this that the former necessarily implies recognition of a marital duty and is therefore dependent on its continued existence; while the latter implies no more than a purpose of identification of the object of bounty. The question in this case is not who was intended to take—for Mr. Jones cannot be supposed to have had in contemplation a future wife—but the character in which this legatee was. intended to take, whether because of her marital relation to testator, or simply as an individual. If given because of the marital relation as the description imports, she can take it in no other character than as widow. It is suggested that to produce this effect an express condition of continuance of the marriage relation must have been attached to the gift; but there is no apparent reason why an implied condition should not be just as effective and the form of this gift implies continuance. Not only does the description of the legatee import on its face a conditional gift, but the quantity of the gift implies that testator had in view the intestate law and therefore marital right as the reason. There <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>is a well-settled, principle that a widow will be presumed to take under the intestate law rather than under her husband’s will where her interest is the same in either event: Davison’s App., <a href="/pa/95/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="95 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="492893" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0394-01">95 Pa. 394</a>; the statute furnishes the general rule of distribution and the will is simply declarative, and therefore no election is necessary; and conversely the testator must be presumed to have given in the same right in which this interest is taken by his widow, and therefore because of relationship to his widow as such. While it is said that this estate consisted in part of realty, the natural inference is that the gift of “one-third ” of the estate, which consisted largely of personalty, was suggested by the intestate law, and that consequently Mr. Jones had in view his wife’s marital right under that law as distinguished from her individual right. It was also upon this principle of implied conformity to the intestate law that bequests to a mother and her children gave the mother but a life estate : Plague v. Hague, <a href="/pa/161/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="161 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="854216" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0643-01">161 Pa. 643</a> ; and a legacy by a father to a child is understood as a portion, because it is a provision by a parent for his child: Miner v. Atherton, <a href="/pa/35/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="35 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="990468" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0528-01">35 Pa. 528</a>. And it is upon a similar principle that a legacy is considered to have been given in satisfaction of a debt rather than as an independent gift where there is identity in amount.</p>

If the divorce worked a revocation, it could not be republished in any manner other than that prescribed by the statute of wills.

Why Mr. Jones did not do what he was not required to do, the evidence fails to show.

      <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>It may be conceded that there are English cases inconsistent with this view—some of them arising on marriage articles and some on wills; but the cases even there were not harmonious. Vice Chancellor Malins said of Boreham v. Bignall, 8 Hare, 131, the leading case, that the court evidently thought from the peculiar language used, that there was an intention to benefit the particular wife of his nephew, then living, and that the court might well have come to a different conclusion. In Garratt v. Niblock, 1 Russ. &amp; My. 629, it was held that by the expression “ my beloved wife ” testator must have meant a particular wife; and so in Bryan’s Trust, 2 Sim. (N. S.) 103, the language of the gift was held to point out a particular husband: Lyne's Trust, L. R., 8 Eq. 65. On the other hand, where there was a devise to testator’s nephew for life, with remainder to the nephew’s wife for life with remainder to children of his nephew by said wife, it was held to extend to the nephew’s second wife: Peppin v. Bickford, 3 Ves. 570. In a somewhat similar case Vice Chancellor Malins reached the same conclusion. Attention is called to the fact that Sir George Jessel, master of the rolls, in a subsequent case disapproved of this decision; but he was noted for his disregard of precedent and his dictum might not stand against the ruling of a court of superior jurisdiction. Two cases were also cited on behalf of claimant from Supreme Court Reports in this country against implied revocation by divorce; but an examination of these cases will show that they are not applicable here. In the first (Bullock v. Zilley, <a href="/nj-eq/1/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="1 N.J. Eq. 489" data-case-ids="12165064" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/1/0489-01">1 N. J. Eq. 489</a>) the bequest was, not to the testor’s wife, but to his son “ Thomas Bullock and Rebecca his wife,” and the decision was rested upon four grounds suggested by the peculiar language of the will as showing testamentary intent to make an absolute gift. No authorities were cited. In the other case (Charlton v. Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Ohio%20298" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="27 Ohio 298">27 Ohio, 298</a>) the bequest was made in contemplation of marriage, and the court very properly held that it did not depend on marriage and could not therefore be lost by divorce. Even those cases which deny implied revocation by divorce, concede that a slight indication of a different intent will prevail, and are therefore distinguishable from the present case on this ground.</p>

W. Repr. 699), cited for the estate, is a strong authority in support of the doctrine of implied revocation by divorce. Mr. Lansing and wife executed mutual wills of their respective estates, and were afterward divorced. Pending the suit in divorce they entered into an agreement of division and release of their property, but no reference was made therein to their wills ; and on Mr. Lansing’s death an issue was raised of implied revocation on Mrs. Lansing’s presentation of the will. In a very able opinion by Mr. Justice Grant the court held that because of the absence of any reference to the will, the agreement did not amount to an express revocation under their statute ,\ but that an implied revocation arose from the divorce. “ By the decree of divorce in this case,” said the court, “the parties became as strangers to each other, and neither owed to the other any obligation or duty thereafter. There was therefore a complete change in their relations,” and the case fell within the principle laid down by Chancellor Kent, as above quoted. No Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision has been found in conflict with this view. The case of Brown v. Grand Lodge, <a href="/pa/208/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="208 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="998167" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0101-01">208 Pa. 101</a> cited on behalf of claimant, is, as already suggested, distinguishable from this by the fact that the right of the beneficiary had been fixed by contract subject to a new designation on the part of tbe assured which was never made, whereas revocation here arose by implication of law, and there was no rejoublication as prescribed by statute. The case may, therefore, to use the language of the court in Lansing v.

A husband as such may show the greatest generosity in testamentary disposition; but it is not in human nature to give to her who has held his domestic faults up to public gaze as a means of dissolving marriage. Who would for a moment believe that if Mr. Jones were living to-day he would give Mrs. <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>Speer “ one-third ” of his estate? To ask is to answer the question. Independent of the personal question, consideration for his son’s interest would have a deterrent effect; the divorce caused such change in circumstances that his son became presumptively the sole object of testamentary obligation. And on the other hand, it is impossible to understand how, in view of Mrs. Speer’s renunciation, she can consistently claim what without the existence of the marital relation would never have been given.

The person named as legatee did not die in the lifetime of the testator, nor did any other event occur in the lifetime of the testator, which under the language of the will, would render the testamentary gift inoperative. The donee survived the tegtator and is alive, and has both capacity and willingness to take under the will. But it is suggested in the argument, that while not physically dead, the <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>donee by her own act in obtaining the decree of divorce, ended the marital relation, as absolutely as death would have done. This consequence did follow the divorce, in so far as the duties, rights and claims accruing to her by reason of the marriage are concerned. With respect to the determination of these rights, and these alone, is divorce the equivalent of death. The decree in divorce took away only what the law gave to her when the marriage was contracted. This was the right to support, and to dower in his estate if she survived him. After the entry of the decree, the testator was no longer bound to provide for her, and she had no further claim upon his estate. What the law gave, it took away; nothing more.</p>

She is here only as a legatee, and is asking for that only which the testator gave to her of his free grace, and as a matter of bounty. That which he gave to her in his will, was his own, to give or to withhold as he saw fit. A bequest needs no consideration to support it. As a legatee she stands upon the same footing as any other individual, and her relation to the testator has nothing to do with the case, unless he chose to make it an element, in the bestowal of the gift. Did he do so ? The provision in the will is as follows : “ I direct that my funeral expenses and all debts be promptly paid, and that my estate be divided as follows: One third to my wife, Mary Brown Jones, and the balance to my son, Thomas Mifflin Jones.” The will was dated April 24,1899, and Mary Brown Jones was then the wife of the testator. On February 6,1900, the said Mary Brown Jones began proceedings in divorce, and the decree was granted to her on September 19, 1900. Thomas M. Jones, Jr., the testator, lived about one year and eight months after the divorce was granted, and died on May 17, 1902. Mary Brown Jones did not remarry during the lifetime of the said Thomas M. Jones, Jr., but she did marry about six months after his death. It will be noticed that the gift was to “My wife, Mary Brown Jones,” without any conditions or limitations. The testator gives the one third of his estate to a particular person, naming her, and further identifying her by the statement that she is his wife that is in substance wbat he says. He makes no stipulation that she shall remain his wife, or be such at the time of his death. We are clear that <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>such use of the word “ wife ” as is here made, is descriptive only, and does not imply any continuing condition.</p>

W. the husband of my said daughter,” the word “ husband ” was held to be a description of the person and not of the character in which he was to take. The reasoning of Judge Penbose fits accurately this case. He said : “We may conjecture, but we cannot be certain, that the inducing cause of the provision for Thomas Waller was that he was the husband of the testator’s daughter. The relationship, however, could not have been the sole motive since the gift is to the individual by name, and not to him simply as husband, nor is there, as in Bell v. Smalley, 18 Atlantic Repr. 70, the evidence offered by the restriction of the bounty to the time during which the beneficiary remains unmarried. We have no right to say that the gift was subject to the condition that the donee should at the time it took effect be the husband of the daughter.”</p>

Under the requirements of that act, it is “ with reference to anjr real or personal estate embraced in it ” that every will shall speak as of the testator’s death. In Robeno v. Marlatt, <a href="/pa/136/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="136 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="820015" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0035-01">136 Pa. 35</a>, the court below said, on page 37:' “It is claimed, however, that the act of June 4, 1879, bars their (after-born children) right.

No authority has been cited in support of the proposition that divorce in itself is sufficient to work a revocation of a will, and we are not aware that any exists. The only case which has been cited by counsel as sustaining this position is Lansing v. Haynes, <a href="/mich/95/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="95 Mich. 16" data-case-ids="1533249" data-case-paths="/mich/95/0016-01">95 Mich. 16</a>. But examination shows that the Michigan statute allows the court to .determine whether the subsequent changes in the condition or circumstances of the testator, are sufficient to work an implied revocation of the will. And the decision in that case rested also upon the fact, that pending the divorce proceeding there was a settlement of the property rights of the parties. A division of the real estate was <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>made, each deeding to the other. An agreement was also made by which the husband conveyed to the wife certain personal property, and she agreed to release him from all demands of every kind or nature. The agreement stated that it, and the deeds executed by them, were intended as a property settlement between them. This was a practical satisfaction of the bequest, and amounted to an ademption.</p>
    <p id="b416-5" data-blocks='[["BL_416.5",416,[277,726,1184,1696]],["BL_417.1",417,[143,353,1177,147]]]'>As we read this decision, it was controlled by the fact of the settlement of property rights between the parties and not by the divorce itself. At common law, the doctrine of implied revocation of a will from change of circumstances, did not include divorce. In fact the instances were few, under the common law, in which an alteration of circumstances was held sufficient to justify an implied revocation. Both at common law and under the statutes of most of the states, it is only certain definite changes in the condition or family relations of the testator which impliedly revoke a will, executed before such changes. The great weight of authority is that no changes beyond the few which have been many times specifically enumerated and recognized as sufficient for the purpose, can have this effect: Page on Wills, sec. 280. A will maybe so easily revoked by the testator in his lifetime that the courts have been slow in permitting changes in circumstances to do, by implication, what the testator may so readily do for himself. In Wogan v. Small, 11 S. &amp; R. 141, Tilghman, C. J., said: “ There is one case, and only one, in which it has hitherto been thought proper to decide, that the revocation of a will might be implied from an alteration of circumstances, and that is, when the testator married and had a child, subsequently to the making, of his will; but both circumstances must concur; .... The danger of this principle of implied revocation is very great, and that is the reason why, although very strong eases of hardship have occurred, the judges have never ventured to advance beyond that one step. We have the less reason to resort to implied revocation, as our legislation has provided for the case of subsequent marriage or children by the Act of April 19, 1794, 3 Sm. L. 148. . . . Once establish the judicial habit of examining the situation of a man’s fortune or family, and revoking his will, because he has made an absurd or an inhuman disposition of his property, or because we merely <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>suppose he was ignorant of the state of his affairs, or of the law, and no man’s will is safe.” These words were weighty then, they should be equally so now.</p>

That subject was not before the court. The testator in that case, after devising one tract of land to one son and another tract of land to another son, subsequently sold the first tract. It was urged that this would work a revocation of the whole will. But the court decided that the sale affected only the devise of the tract in question, and the residue of the wil] remained in full force. It was a case of ademption, which applies only to the subject-matter of testamentary disposition. When the subject-matter bequeathed is sold, or disposed of, it is thereby completely extinguished, and nothing remains to which the words of the will can apply. The principle of ademption is entirely distinct from that of an implied revocation of the terms of the will. Ademption has to do with the subject-matter of the bequests, while the doctrine of implied revocation is founded upon a presumed neglect of duty, upon the part of the testator, or upon a change in his family relations. Ademption involves action upon the part of the testator; the doing of some act with regard to the subject-matter, which interferes with the operation of the words of the will. That is he anticipates the gift there made, by bestowing it during his lifetime upon the legatee, or disposes of the subject-matter in some way which puts it out of the question to follow his directions as set forth in the will. Nothing of that kind has been done in the present case. The testator has not interfered with his estate in any way inconsistent with the terms of his will.</p>

The effect of these provisions is to do away with the doctrine of implied revocation, which was for so many years a subject of controversy in the English courts, and which, in many of the states of this country, is still permitted under a clause in their statutes, authorizing a revocation to be ‘ implied by law for subsequent changes in the condition of the testator.’ ” And in Davis v. Fogle, <a href="/ind/124/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="124 Ind. 41" data-case-ids="1382511" data-case-paths="/ind/124/0041-01">124 Ind. 41</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">†</a> “It is manifest that no act, thing or deed will revoke a will once duly executed, unless it comes within the provisions of the statute providing for the revocation of wills.” In Noyes v. Southworth, <a href="/mich/55/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="55 Mich. 173" data-case-ids="1432491" data-case-paths="/mich/55/0173-01">55 Mich.</a><a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">‡</a><a href="/mich/55/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="55 Mich. 173" data-case-ids="1432491" data-case-paths="/mich/55/0173-01"> 173</a>, the court says: “ There is no sound reason that we can perceive why, in the absence of statutes, implied revocation should be extended.” And in Schouler on Wills, sec. 427, it is said: “ In short, revocation of a particular will by mere inference of law or presumption, is limited to a very few instances in our modern practice. Modern legislation itself repudiates in England and some of our states, the old theory of implied intention to revoke on the ground of alteration of circumstances, <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>and what is left of that theory aside from such statutes it would be very difficult to say.”</p>
    <p id="b419-5" data-blocks='[["BL_419.5",419,[127,477,1178,603]]]'>A case much like the present, is Card v. Alexander, <a href="/conn/48/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="48 Conn. 492" data-case-ids="780871" data-case-paths="/conn/48/0492-01">48 Conn. 492</a>. There the bequest was to “ my wife Amelia.” A year and a half after the execution of the will, the testator obtained a divorce from his wife, for her misconduct, and four years afterwards died, without changing his will. It was held that the bequest was not to be regarded as conditioned upon the wife continuing to be such until his death; and that the divorce did not as matter of law impliedly revoke the will. The circumstances of the divorce in that case spoke more strongly against the claimant than here. In the present case, it was the misconduct of the testator which caused the divorce.</p>
    <p id="b419-6" data-blocks='[["BL_419.6",419,[122,1100,1181,809]]]'>We can see nothing in the facts of this case, which would justify any extension of the doctrine of implied revocation. The reason which lies behind the doctrine as defined both in the common law and by the statutes, is that some obvious injustice may be prevented. That some moral duty, which has been overlookéd, it is presumed, by the testator, may be discharged. What would be the result of holding in this case, that the change in circumstances worked a revocation ? Only this : the whole estate of testator would go to his son, to the entire exclusion therefrom of his former wife and the mother of his child. Can it be said that the obtaining by the wife of a divorce, by reason of the misconduct of the testator, entailed upon him any moral duty to destroy the provision, which he had made in his will, for the woman who was for years his faithful wife, in order to pile up far more than a competency for their child.</p>
    <p id="b419-7" data-blocks='[["BL_419.7",419,[121,1928,1180,508]]]'>The only inference which can be drawn from the record in this case, is that the testator, and he alone, was responsible for the rupture of the marital ties. It may well be, then, that by the provision in his will he intended to make some reparation for the sorrow and distress he brought upon his wife. To impute to him such intention would be more kind, than to presume, as is urged in the argument, that he was filled with resentment, and became possessed by an ignoble purpose which he failed to carry out. He must have known that he could change or destroy his will at any time, yet he did not do so.</p>
