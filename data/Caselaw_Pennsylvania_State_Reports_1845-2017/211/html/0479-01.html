The reasonableness of the fee rests in the first instance with the city councils, and unless the charge is obviously unreasonable courts will not interfere. In cases of this class the reasonableness of the fee must not be measured by the length or value of the company’s track or electric system, nor by the volume of its business. The elements to be considered are the expense incident to the issuing of a license and the probable expense to the municipal authorities in regulating, inspecting and affording police surveillance of the maintenance and operation of the corporation’s lines. It being the duty of the municipality to protect its citizens by seeing that the works of quasi public corporations are properly maintained, the license fee usually exacted from such corporations is intended to meet that expense and is not imposed for revenue purposes. The amount of the assessment imposed under the ordinances of <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>October 20, 1903, and February 27, 1904, is $219,265.25, which, in our opinion, is largely in excess of any annual expense the city may reasonably incur in regulating and inspecting the tracks and transportation facilities of plaintiff. That amount is sufficient to employ for one year more than 200 competent men. That such a sum of money is necessary, or that so large an army of men will be required for that purpose does not appear from the pleadings or the testimony. If this charge is a license fee we are clearly of the opinion that it is so obviously excessive as to be clearly unreasonable and therefore invalid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[275,918,1178,1076]]]'>The charge is objectionable as a license fee, also, because the fee is not uniform upon all street railways. While possibly license fees need not in all cases be uniform, yet when such intention can fairly be inferred from the statute allowing such fees they should be made uniform. That such appears to have been the legislature’s intention in this case may be inferred from the fact that by paragraphs four and twenty-two of the act of 1901, street railway companies are classified with auctioneers, bill posters, pawnbrokers, peddlers, etc., and that by ordinances of the city councils based upon that act or similar statutes, all bill posters are required to pay annually a uniform license fee, also all pawnbrokers, and all peddlers, etc. Operas and circuses are also charged a uniform fee, all of these fees being fixed in the ordinance without regard to the amount of property used, or volume of business done. If the city'- councils interpreted the legislative intent to be that all other objects mentioned in these paragraphs and made subject to the payment of a license tax should be uniform why provide an irregular and fluctuating fee from railway companies ? It seems reasonable that the paragraphs should apply in the same manner to all subjects mentioned therein.</p>

It cannot be imposed under the first clause of section three above quoted, because neither the real nor personal property of street railway companies is taxable for county purposes. The authority of the city to assess as a tax, if it exists at all, must therefore be found in the fourth and twenty-second clauses of section 3 of the act of 1901. The act provides that the charge shall be <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>levied for general revenue purposes, shall be fixed by ordinance, and shall be upon “ street railways, hack drivers, auctioneers and all and every corporation, company or individual doing business in said city.” As an authority delegated by the state to impose and collect a tax, the clause is quite indefinite.</p>

If not, how can it be said to authorize a tax upon either the personal property of an individual or upon the tracks of other tangible property of a street railway company ? . If the clause authorizes a tax at all, it is more likely a tax on business than on property. It has been the law in this state for many years that property necessary to carry out the purposes of a quasi public corporation is not taxable for local purposes where such property is included in the capital stock which pays a state tax. In the city of Pittsburg, however, by the act of June 4, 1859, the real estate of railway companies is made subject to taxation for city purposes the same as other real estate, but nowhere do we find any law directly subjecting their tracks to assessment. The act of 1901 authorizes a “license tax” upon street railways “ doing business ” in the city; that language, it seems to us, if it authorizes a tax at all, authorizes it either upon the company itself or upon its business, and does not empower an assessment upon a portion only of the corporation’s property. Therefore, if the ordinances impose the charge upon the tracks, and the language used, viz., “ 25 cents per foot for each lineal foot of track, laid, maintained or operated,” seem to us to do so, the assessment is not authorized by any law and is accordingly void. The fact that the corporation must pay the assessment does not change its nature. That it is a tax is strengthened by the fact that the money realized from the corporation is paid into the city treasury and becomes part of the general fund of the municipality and is applicable to all its expenses. While we have not been referred to any case in which our appellate courts have passed upon the nature of an assessment similar to the one involved here, the Supreme Court of Ohio in Railway Co. v. The State, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20Ohio%20189" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="49 Ohio 189">49 Ohio, 189</a> (30 N. E.

Railroad Corporations, 4 South Carolina 376, the Supreme Court of that state in passing upon a statute enacting <em>“ </em>a general license law,” which provided, inter alia, that every railroad company or corporation, the length of whose main track and branches together is gieater than 250 miles, shall pay a license fee of $1,250, held, that the statute imposed a tax upon property.</p>

    <p id="b519-3" data-blocks='[["BL_519.6",519,[208,400,1176,305]]]'>Tlie decree in this case might well be affirmed on the opinion of the learned president judge of the court below. We shall not, therefore, attempt to add anything to what he has said, but very briefly emphasize his view that the city of Pittsburgh is attempting to levy and collect a property tax from the appellee without statutory authority to do so.</p>
    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.7",519,[207,711,1178,1547]]]'>The ordinances under which the city has imposed the tax provide that there shall be established and levied as an annual “ license ” tax “ upon each and every street railway company or corporation the sum of twenty-five (25) cents per foot for each lineal foot of track laid, maintained or operated by such company or corporation within the limits of the city of Pittsburgh, exclusive of such track as may be in the yards or buildings of such company or corporation.” As authority for the passage of these ordinances and the collection of the tax imposed by them, the city relies upon paragraphs IY and XXII of the third section of art. 19 of the Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20. Those paragraphs are: “IV. Every city of the second class shall have power, for general revenue purposes, to levy and collect a license tax, to be fixed by ordinance, upon street railways, hack drivers, auctioneers, and all and every corporation, company or individual doing business in said city, payable annually, and to regulate the collection of the same.” “ XXII. And every city of the second class shall have power, for general revenue purposes, to levy and collect license taxes or fees, to be fixed by. ordinance, upon street railways, hack drivers, auctioneers, bill posters, public balls or dances, night soilers, garbage collectors, railroad switches, pawn brokers, peddlers; venders of any kind of merchandise whatever, using the streets, lanes, highways, wharves, or public squares or grounds, for the purposes of vending the same; all theatrical exhibitions, whether permanent or transient (including circuses), vehicles, bicydes, tricycles, automobiles, dogs, ball games or ball parks, and all other matters and things of a like nature, and to regulate the collection of the same and to provide penalties for default therein.”</p>

They term the tax assessed against the appellee a “ license ” <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>tax; but no matter what the municipal authorities call it, the question is, what is it ? The tax is twenty-five cents per foot “ for each lineal foot of track laid, maintained or operated ” by the appellee within the city of Pittsburgh, exclusive of such tracks as may be in its yards or buildings. The tracks of a street railway company are as much its property as are its power houses, car barns or repair shops; and, if so, could it be seriously argued that an annual tax of twenty-five cents per lineal foot on a car barn would not be a tax on the property, no matter by what name called, especially if to be collected for the general revenue purposes of the municipality ? Manifestly it would be such a tax, and such is the character of the tax which the appellant would impose on the tracks of the appellee. <em>We </em>are told that this question has not been decided in this state. We can recall no case in which it was raised, but in other jurisdictions the view just expressed lias been entertained. By a statute of the state of Ohio $1.00 per annum was imposed upon each mile of railroad track within the state, the statute calling it a fee. Of it the supreme court of that state said, in Railway Co. v. State of Ohio, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20Ohio%20189" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="49 Ohio 189">49 Ohio, 189</a>: <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> “ Its nature is not affected by the name that may be assigned to it. It is an exaction levied upon railroad tracks and railroad tracks are property. It does not differ in principle from a fixed sum levied upon all farmers of the state for each acre of land of which they may be seized, or each head of horses or other live stock that they may own. In both instances the tax is levied upon property.” In State v. South Carolina Railroad Co., <a href="/sc/4/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="4 S.C. 376" data-case-ids="351745" data-case-paths="/sc/4/0376-01">4 So. Car. 376</a>, it was held that a sum of money which an act of' the legislature required to be paid to the state treasurer for the use of the state by every railroad company, to be determined by the length of its road, was a tax upon property.</p>

The attempt is to collect a property tax which is not authorized by either of the paragraphs and the decree is affirmed at appellant’s costs.</p>
