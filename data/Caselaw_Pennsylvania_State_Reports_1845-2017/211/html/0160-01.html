We all may understand that sometimes it is usual for the same engine to pull the same train, but there is nothing of that character before us. I cannot assume that the railroad company uses the same engine for pulling the same train that passes daily at a particular point. Until that is established I cannot admit the testimony.

It is stated in the declaration that the engine that caused the fire was one that drew a freight train on the south bound track between the hours of nine and ten o’clock p. M. on May 28, 1903. This train was identified by six of the plaintiff’s witnesses as a regular freight train, known as the New York milk train, that passed the station near the plaintiff’s buildings a few minutes before ten o’clock. These witnesses saw the train pass and noticed the throwing of sparks and coals by the engine. No other train going south passed near the time of the fire nor within two hours of it. There was an offer by the plaintiff to prove that the engine on several previous nights <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>within two weeks of the fire and on the night after it threw out coals of an unusual size.

This rule obtains also where there is uncertainty as to the engine that caused the fire and it cannot be shown that the fire proceeded from a particular engine. This class of testimony is admissible because of the failure of direct proof and of the necessity of resorting to the proof of circumstances as the best evidence and the only evidence of which the case admits.

The identification is not to distinguish it from other engines generally but to point it out as the engine that caused the injury. In this sense its identification was as complete as if its number had been known to the witnesses. They saw it pass, they knew it drew a train that passed nightly on a fixed schedule, they saw what it did, and that it was the only engine to which the fire could by any possibility be traced.</p>
