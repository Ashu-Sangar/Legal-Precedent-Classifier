By clause 4 she gave the residue to eight persons to be divided equally among them, and directed that if any of such persons should not be living at her death, “let the sum named be returned to the estate and an equal division be made among those living together with Friends’ Boarding House.” By clause 5 she directed that her household goods and wardrobe should not be sold but should be distributed among a number of persons named. Four of these persons died before the testatrix, but only one of them, a niece, was a residuary legatee under clause 4. By two codicils she added three other persons as residuary legatees, and by a third codicil, after reciting the death of the four persons to whom articles had been bequeathed by clause 5, she directed that the names of five persons should be “put in place of them.” One of the persons mentioned as having died, was in clause 3 of the will, and the others including the niece named in clause 4 as a residuary legatee were also in clause 5, as legatees of specific articles. <em>Held </em>(1), that it was the intention of the testatrix to substitute the five persons named in codicil 3 in place of the four deceased wherever bequests had been made to them; (2) that the five substituted legatees took collectively the share or bequests which were devised to each of the deceased legatees; (3) that the “Friends’ Boarding House” was not entitled to any part of the residuary estate since the testatrix had substituted for the1 deceased niece, the five persons mentioned in codicil number '3.</p>

It must be borne in mind that she had made devises to a great many people, all of about the same degree of relationship, namely, nephew, nieces, grandnephews and grandnieces, showing that she had in mind the effect of the death of John W. Coleman, Julia M. Coleman, George H. Sellers and Martha Sellers, and that she desired to substitute Edward L. Pearson, George Pearson, Nelson C. Wilson, Elizabeth P.

That is, the bequest of Martha Sellers in clause No. 3 was to be divided equally between the five substituted legatees, and the share of the residuary estate devised to Julia M. Coleman was to be divided equally between the five substituted legatees. And the furniture distributed under clause No. 5 was to be-divided among the same persons.</p>
