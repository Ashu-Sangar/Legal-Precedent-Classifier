    <p class="syllabus" id="b626-9" data-blocks='[["BL_626.8",626,[280,1224,1175,608]]]'>In an action against a street railway company to recover damages for personal injuries it appeared that at night plaintiff left the west sidewalk of a street at the middle of a block to cross to the east. At this place an alley seven feet wide opened into the street but did not cross it; crossing stones were laid from the end of the alley to the other side of the street. Plaintiff looked as he stepped in the street and saw a car within 150 or 200 feet of him. He did not look again. When near the west rail he met two men crossing in the opposite direction and stepped from the crossing stones south in the direction of the car. He was struck as he was stepping from the east rail. If he had looked at the point of danger, he would have seen that the car was so near that in attempting to cross he was placing himself in a position of imminent danger. <em>Held, </em>that a verdict was properly directed for defendant not only because of the contributory negligence of plaintiff, but also on account of the failure to prove negligence of the motorman.</p>
