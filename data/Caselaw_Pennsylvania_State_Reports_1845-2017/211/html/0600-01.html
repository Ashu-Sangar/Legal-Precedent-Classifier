The defendants, had for four or five years bought cotton through the plaintiff. During the year 1900 the defendants gave plaintiff orders to buy many thousand bales of cotton! These orders were filled and subsequently on a marked decline on the price of cotton, and on the failure of defendants to furnish sufficient margin the cotton was sold, resulting in a loss, for which this suit was brought.

E. J. Morris, on the contrary, testified that the dealings in futures were gambling transactions pure and simple, although on cross-examination <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>lie seemed reluctant to repeat this and very much modified it.</p>

Ct. Repr. 845), and the onus of proving they were so was upon the defendants. This they sought to do from the plaintiff’s statements of account of futures rendered them ; the significance of these is only developed when compared with the plaintiff’s bills for cotton that was delivered. In all such bills the cotton was either designated by marks and the weight of each bale, or of the entire amount sold; so many bales a month were to be delivered at the defendants’ mills and the terms for which the note in payment was to be given were specified and subsequently the cotton sent each month was weighed at the mill and the plaintiff advised of this in detail.</p>

The presumption of legality was in this manner rebutted by evidence, and it thereupon fell to the lot of the plaintiff to establish by further evidence, if practicable, the legality of the contracts with the defendants. This was undertaken by the letters which in each case he wrote to the defendants stipulating that in such transaction actual delivery was understood and intended and by his testimony that he tendered the cotton to the defendants and that they assured him they were buying <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>to load up with cheap cotton to protect themselves from an expected trust combination.</p>

But each knew doubtless that dealings in mere differences were wagers and illegal, and knowing this each might naturally choose to cover the illegality by a seeming legal contract. Passing that as of no great moment, however, it is clear that notwithstanding the plain written assertion that actual delivery was intended, such intention might be given up for another, and that it was abandoned by the course of dealing is shown by the difference between bills rendered for cotton bought and delivered and statements of cotton futures before pointed out. Although the testimony of the plaintiff that he always tendered to defendants the cotton he bought for their account was denied by no more than an inference from E. J. Morris’ testimony, yet the statement itself was insufficient to establish an offer to deliver so many bales of cotton, inasmuch as it failed to show that plaintiff had the control of and could have made actual delivery of the cotton tendered, in failing to designate the locality of such cotton or the production of the books of the warehouse, in which it was, or airy explanation why this was not done. It is determined, therefore, that whatever the plaintiff meant by the assertion that he tendered the cotton, it did not establish the fact that he controlled it so that he could actually deliver. Finally that part of the plaintiff’s testimony to the effect that the parties intended actual delivery because defendants wanted to load up with cheap cotton seems plainly inconsistent with the established fact that the defendants required or permitted the plaintiff to sell all that he bought and to do so within a few weeks or months of each purchase. The testimony intended to re-establish or to maintain the presumption in favor of legality failed of its purpose ; and this it is thought becomes further evident by a comparison of these dealings with the more common but analogous ones in stock. As is generally known, when stocks are bought upon margins, and the purchasing broker carries the stock, he actually buys for his customer the shares, takes them to a bank or trust company, there pledges them to obtain the greater part of the funds with which to pay their cost. With respect to margin transac<a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>tions in merchandise (where they are not mere settlement of differences between the contract and. the market price) the broker buys for his customers’ account the grain or cotton, generally stored in a warehouse, obtains a negotiable warehouse receipt, pledges it with a bank or company having money to loan, and so gets the. greater part of the money with which to pay the price of the merchandise. In such, or some similar way, the plaintiff would have had control of cotton if he had, in fact, purchased bales for the defendants’ account, and in such case could readily have established in this suit that he had the means to perfect the tender of cotton which he said he had made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[258,972,1177,456]]]'>It was urged that the defendants under the writing with respect to actual delivery could have legally compelled it, that therefore the plaintiff has a similar right with regard to them. If one might do so, the other certainly could. But had the defendants sought by suit to compel delivery, the plaintiff had it in his power successfully to defend, on the ground of illegality of contract (if a sense of business adherence to a contract did not prevent), and yielding in such a suit would have been a voluntary and not a compulsory act.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b636-6" data-blocks='[["BL_636.6",636,[252,1437,1179,922]]]'>It remains to consider the persuasive, the potent, appeal of the attorneys for the plaintiff that E. J. Morris, having admitted that his firm received from the plaintiff large profits in dealings in 1899, exactly analogous to those which he characterized as gambling in this suit in order to escape the payment of losses, and the evidence having demonstrated that if the plaintiff had declined to stand by an agreement with the defendants, as they were now doing with him, he would have saved himself the loss of over 18,000, it would be in a high degree unjust to allow the defense to prevail, and that the testimony of E. J. Morris was evasive, at times contradictory, at others incredible, and that his manner of giving it was suggestive of withholding that which he knew, and therefore every intendment should be made against him. If the decision which has been reached depended upon his testimony, a critical review of it would be proper. But as has appeared the conclusion arrived at depends upon the evidence alone of the course of dealing of the parties.</p>

Whatever might have been his right in this behalf had such indebtedness been the result of legal dealings, he had not the right to use the proceeds of these notes with regard to an indebtedness resulting from the mere settlement of differences, and accordingly -from the misappropriation he is indebted to the defendants in $5,932.15, with interest from July 24, 1900, to the date of this report.</p>
