The agreement provided that the lessee company would not sublet, dispose of, or remove from Philadelphia county the boilers without the consent of the lessors; .that it would surrender up said property at the expiration of the lease, and that if it failed to comply with any of the provisions of the lease, the lessors should have the right to declare the lease void and to resume possession of the boilers, and in any proceeding for such purpose, with or without recourse to law, the lessee waived the right to bring any action against the lessors.

The boilers were attached to the freehold by the paper company and are, therefore, fixtures and a part of the real estate, unless they retain their character of personalty by virtue of the agreement or lease between the plaintiffs and the paper company. Gallagher, the registered owner of the real estate, is now in possession of it and also of the boilers, and claims the latter as fixtures. It is averred in the bill, however, that S. Arthur Love, or his wife, is the real owner of the premises and that the title was placed in Gallagher for the purpose of defrauding Love’s creditors. It is also alleged that Love was the treasurer of the paper company and conducted all the negotiations with the plaintiffs which terminated in the lease of the boilers to that company, and that the detention of the boilers by Gallagher is in pursuance of an agreement between him and the Loves for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiffs of their property rights in the boilers. It, therefore, may be material to the plaintiffs in asserting their claim to the property to ascertain and have determined whether Gallagher or Love <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>is the real owner of the premises on which the boilers were installed. If Love is the owner his knowledge of and acquiescence in the lease may prevent him from denying the character of the boilers as personal property. It is not alleged that Gallagher had knowledge of the plaintiffs’ lease, or of any of its stipulations, but we need not now determine his rights to the boilers as against the plaintiffs. It is apparent, therefore, that the plaintiffs, in enforcing their claim, need equitable relief to enable them to have determined Love’s ownership of the premises on which the boilers were placed by the paper company.</p>

Generally speaking, it lies wherever one person claims personal property in the possession of another, provided the claimant has the right of possession ; and there is no doubt that it will lie for property held by the defendant under a contract of bailment. The Act of April 19, 1901, P. L. 88, has made the remedy by replevin more speedy and effective than under the former practice in such actions. The bond required of the plaintiff and the defendant, and the counter-bond by an intervenor under the act of 1901, would afford complete protection to all parties interested in the property in controversy if it was detached from the real estate. But notwithstanding its efficiency in reaching personal property, the action of replevin would fail to meet the requirements of this case. The Downing Paper Company, the lessee, is not in possession of the boilers, nor have they passed to, or are they held by, another as personal property. They are now held by Gallagher, the lessor of the real estate, on which they were placed by the lessee, and lie proposes to hold the boilers as part of the real estate. For the same reason, the mortgagee of the real estate denies the right of the plaintiffs to repossess themselves of the property. The facts of this case, therefore, show that the remedy would be inadequate and ineffective in the enforcement of the plaintiffs’ claim.</p>
