    <p class="summary" id="b491-10" data-blocks='[["BL_491.15",491,[209,2390,1132,42]],["BL_492.1",492,[274,366,1179,1788]]]'>The line upon which these exceptions proceed is a very nar<a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>row one. The testator directed that out of his estate, $25,000 should be given by his executors to “ such charitable institutions or associations, excepting all missionary societies, as they, my said executors, may select as suitable recipients of the same; and it is my desire that the same shall be divided between as large a number of said associations as my said executors may think best calculated to secure the greatest amount of good from this donation.” All of the executors named in the will have died. It was objected that the intent of the testator was not helped by the Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 328, providing that no disposition of property thereafter made “ for any religious, charitable, literary or scientific use, should fail for want of a trustee, or by reason of the objects being indefinite, uncertain or dependent upon the discretion of a last trustee; ” and providing further that the court should supply a trustee and carry into effect the intent of the donor “ so far as the same can be ascertained and carried into effect, consistently with law or equity.” The argument in support of the exceptions was that the testator conferred the discretion on his executors as individuals and not as a class, and gave no indication in his will which would guide the court or its trustee by appointment in the selectioxi of a beneficiary. Neither position is, we think, tenable. The sole ground for the assertion that the choice was confided to the executors individually was the use by the testator of the phrase “ the executors hereinafter named,” and his subsequent references to “my said executors.” Exactly the same designation occurs in countless wills where no duties outside of those which belong to routine are cast upon executors. It may be added that if the testator had intended to intrust the power of choice to individuals, he would have provided for the possible death of one or more of their number, because a power of selection given to three persons by name would not necessarily survive to two or one. The reverse is true of a power committed to executors as a class.</p>

His sole desire appar<a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>ently was to benefit as many recipients, as in tbe judgment of bis executors could be wisely embraced in the division of the fund, and he placed upon the same footing, as subjects for that judgment, charities of the most dissimilar aims.</p>
