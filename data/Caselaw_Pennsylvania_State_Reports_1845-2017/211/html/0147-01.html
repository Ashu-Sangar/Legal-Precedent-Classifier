The pavement along the north side of Chestnut street in front of this property was made of flagstones, which extended from the curb-line northward eighteen feet to a line approximately six feet north of what was the original north line of the street. Where the flagging ended there extended across the front of the lot from Fifteenth street to the west boundary a low, but massive, coping of granite. The surface of the lot to the north of this coping was elevated three feet or more above the level of the footwalk on Chestnut street, and was flush with the top of the coping. Access to the churchyard was afforded by steps leading up from the Chestnut street sidewalk, but not projecting beyond the line of the coping.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b181-6" data-blocks='[["BL_181.6",181,[169,1873,1180,498]]]'>Prior to April, 1881, this lot of ground was inclosed by a high brick wall, which, along its Chestnut street front, was built upon the original north line of that street. The wall projected into Chestnut street beyond the line upon which the front walls of all the buildings on the north side of Chestnut street between Fifteenth and Sixteenth streets were set. Most, if not all, of the lots lying to the west of the property were subject to a restriction which prevented the erection' of any structure thereon within six feet of the original north line of the street.</p>

From these expectations, however, it seemed that the properties on the north side of Chestnut street between Fifteenth and Sixteenth streets must be excluded. The projection of the churchyard beyond the- fronts of the houses to the west of it threw those structures into the background, while the narrow footwalk in front of the church property and the unattractive expanse of brick wall which it presented to passersby discouraged all hopes- of their development for business purposes.</p>

Whether or not that corporation shared in the wishes of its neighbors for the adaptation of the vicinity to business purposes with a view to an advantageous sale of its property such as was subsequently effected, it appears to have been willing to remove what everybody then regarded as the drawbacks of the neighborhood. It certainly had the widening of the street in front of the church in contemplation as early as October, 1880, for, on the twelfth of that month, its vestry authorized its warden and secretary to agree “ to restrict the front line of the church ” to that of the other properties in the block, provided that the neighbors would contribute -$250 toward the cost of setting back the wall. The agreement thus authorized, however, was not entered into owing to the unexpected cost of moving that wall and paving the footway.</p>

On April 19, 1881, the vestry <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>of the Church of the Epiphany appointed a committee to take charge of the resetting of the front line of the church, provided that a certain sum should be contributed therefor by the owners west of the church. Four days later this committee let the contract for the removal of the front wall of the church, the flagging of the Chestnut street sidewalk, and the erection of a granite coping upon the line of the fronts of the buildings to the west, and reported to the vestry one month- subsequent that certain moneys had been subscribed by the neighboring owners forgetting back the front line of the church. On July 27,1881, the work contracted for was completed, and on January 8,1882, the committee in charge of it reported to the vestry that the-old wall and railing had been replaced by a new granite coping on the new building line, and that, owing to the.energy of Mr. George M. Connarroe, to whom was largely due the passage of the ordinance establishing the new building line: on the. north side of Chestnut street from Fifteenth street to Sixteenth street, the neighboring property owners had contrib-.uted to cover the expense, because they believed themselves benefited by the improvement and widening.</p>

The courts have never held that where the physical opening to use by the public can be explained on the ground of the owner’s private convenience or advantage his purpose to dedicate to the public may not be established by other evidence, as, for example, by his deed or by his contemporaneous declarations. To put a concrete illustration of our meaning, we apprehend that if the owner of a lot builds back from the street line saying that he throws the space between that line and his house front into the street for public use, it is impossible to escape from the conclusion that he intends to make a dedication of the strip, even though it may be that without such a recession the construction of his front steps would be impossible, in view of municipal regulations forbidding their protrusion beyond the established building line. In Bornot v. Bonschur, <a href="/pa/202/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="202 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="992358" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0463-01">202 Pa. 463</a>, a “ throwing out ” of land under such circumstances was treated by the Supreme Court as a dedication of the excluded area to public use as part of Chestnut street.</p>

Doubtless its members regarded the ordinance passed in that year as effective to widen Chestnut street to the line of the houses west of the church property, and they made haste to comply with its provisions. It would be difficult to account for the practical coincidence of the enactment of that ordinance and the letting of the contract for setting back the boundary wall to “ the new building line ” on any other theory. It is of no consequence that they may have been in error as to the effect of the ordinance. They waived the supposed right of the church to compensation for the land they threw out into the street, in view of the contributions of the neighbors toward the cost of the coping and flagging; and they abandoned the land to public use with no intention ever to resume possession of it.</p>

Daring the whole of that period the church property was exempt from taxation, so that the accuracy of its description for assessment purposes and the correctness of its assessed valuation were matters of no importance whatever to the corporation ; and it is entirely unlikely that any of its officers knew just how the property was entered on the tax books. With the acts or omissions of subsequent owners in relation to this matter we are not concerned.
