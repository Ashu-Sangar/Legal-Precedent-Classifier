    <p class="summary" id="b611-14" data-blocks='[["BL_611.22",611,[164,2084,1177,354]]]'>The only reason for a new trial which requires any attention is that in which it is claimed we erred in admitting the testimony of W. S. Diehl, Esq., called as a witness by the defendant. It is claimed that Mr. Diehl was the attorney for the plaintiff at the time he had the conversation with him which he was allowed to testify to, and that, therefore, it was a privileged communication, and as such inadmissible.</p>

      <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>A careful examination of Mr. Diehl’s testimony fails to convince us that it was a privileged communication between attorney and client which Mr Diehl testified to. True, Mr. Diehl was the attorney for Mr. Brown at the time, in a limited and technical sense, but under all of the circumstances it seems clear that he was acting in his capacity as attorney for the defendant and that the plaintiff knew it when they had the talk about the settlement of the case. Or, if not acting exclusively for the defendant, then it is certainly clear that he acted in behalf of both, in making settlement with the common adversary, Mr. Stanton. The general rule is that when two or more persons employ the same attorney in the same business, communications made by them in relation to such business, while privileged as to their common adversary, are not privileged inter sese: Probst’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/163/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="163 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="859091" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0423-01">163 Pa., 423</a>; Jackson v.

So the objection to the offer was properly overruled, and if the testimony of the witness subsequently disclosed that it was incompetent it was the duty of counsel to move to strike it out, and not for the trial judge to order it stricken out on his own motion : Aitkin v.
