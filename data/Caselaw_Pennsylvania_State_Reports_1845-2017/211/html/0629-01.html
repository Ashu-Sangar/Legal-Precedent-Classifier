The answer sets up an account stated, and thus is raised the only question for present decision. “ It is a preliminary question which requires disposition prior to any hearing on the merits : ” Dampf s Ápp., <a href="/pa/106/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="106 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="455573" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0072-01">106 Pa. 72</a>; Randolph’s App., <a href="/pa/66/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="66 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="432433" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0178-01">66 Pa. 178</a>. An account stated is defined by a high authority to be “ an account in writing, examined and accepted by both parties. And this acceptance need not be express, but may be implied from circumstances : ” Story’s Eq. Jur. sec. 526. Tested by this definition is the account set up • by the defendants an account stated ? In determining this question all evidence tending to prove errors in the account must be brushed aside as being in contravention of the rule above cited which forbids all inquiry into the merits at this stage of the proceedings—a most excellent rule as -our experience in the. present case abundantly testifies.</p>

When completed a copy of the account was handed to each of the parties. A meeting of the parties was then held at Mr. Leinbach’s request, followed by others, at all of which the account was under investigation. After some changes had been made the account in its present form was finally accepted as correct at the last meeting by both Mr. Wolle and Mr. Kemerer. Mr. Leinbach claims that he did not expressly accept-the account. In this he is flatly contradicted-not only by Mr. Wolle and Mr. Kemerer, but by the expert. - But let It be conceded that he did not expressly ac<a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>cept the account. He admits that he made no objection to it, and his silence under the circumstances must be construed as the equivalent of consent. Beyond doubt, therefore, the account in question is a stated account and I so find.</p>
