    <p class="summary" id="b623-9" data-blocks='[["BL_623.15",623,[169,1878,1181,353]]]'>The railroad, in passing through Danville, crosses Mill street at grade. This street is the principal business street of the borough and a large number of vehicles and pedestrians pass hourly where the railroad crosses the street. Over and across this street eight regular passenger trains and six regular freight trains pass daily, beside extra trains. The street is about thirty-six feet in width between the curb lines.</p>

A watchman is kept at this point, who lowers the gates at the crossing upon the approach of trains. A person standing in the middle of the crossing can see trains at a distance of 588 feet looking eastwardly, and at a distance of 680 feet looking westwardly. A short distance east of the crossing at Mill street is a switch operated by said railroad company, frequently used, which requires a large amount of shifting across the street.</p>
