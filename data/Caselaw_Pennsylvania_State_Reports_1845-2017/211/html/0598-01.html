    <p class="syllabus" id="b630-6" data-blocks='[["BL_630.6",630,[306,691,1181,531]]]'>In an action against a city to recover damages for personal injuries caused by a fall, it appeared that plaintiff’s fall was caused by striking his foot against the edge of an asphalt pavement which at the line of the house steps was on the same level with the brick pavement which it adjoined, but was two or three inches above it at the curb. The accident happened before sunset on a clear day in June when the plaintiff could have seen the inequality in the pavement if he looked. He testified that he did not look at the pavement at all. He was familiar with the locality; he had walked on this pavement almost daily for fourteen months and had not observed any defect in it. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was negligent in not looking where he was going, and that if the defect was of such a nature as to have escaped his observation in his continual use of the pavement, it was not such as would warrant the imputation of notice to the city.</p>
