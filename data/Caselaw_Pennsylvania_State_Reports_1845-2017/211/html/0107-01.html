The action was to recover damages for injuries caused by being struck by the defendant’s motor car. The plaintiff called as his witness the chauffeur who at the time of the accident was operating the ear, and examined him at length to show that at that time he was in the employ of the defend<a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>ant, and to identify the car by proof of its number, size, equipments and general appearance. On cross-examination this witness was asked whether at the time of the accident he was not using the car for his own purposes and in violation of the orders of the defendant. He answered under objection: “ I was operating the machine for my own personal use on an errand for myself. Mr. Thompson did n’t know anything about it whatever. I had no orders from him. I took it out, breaking one of the rules, which I had no business to do.”</p>
    <p id="b141-5" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[193,834,1178,1080]]]'>While the general principles applicable to the subject are clearly defined, it is in practice often difficult to determine the exact limits of proper cross-examination. Its range must of necessity rest largely in the discretion of the trial judge. Cross-examination must be confined to matters stated in the examination in chief and independent matters of defense must not be introduced by it. Where matters of defense have been brought out by an improper cross-examination they should be considered as having been introduced by the defendant, and they cannot be considered by the court as ground for a compulsory nonsuit: Hughes v. Westmoreland Coal Co., <a href="/pa/104/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="104 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="452181" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0207-01">104 Pa. 207</a> ; Sullivan v.
