In addition to the word “trustee” after the name of the grantee in the deed, the attorney gave to the grantor an unacknowledged declaration of trust. The attorney took the deed to a trust company and stated that he was the owner of the premises, and requested a loan on a mortgage. He was told that no money could- be loaned to him individually on account of the word “trustee” in the deed. He thereupon took the deed, erased the word “trustee” filling in the blank space with a red line. The erasure was visible on the face of the deed. Subsequently he made a second application to the trust company for a loan on a mortgage, and was this time successful. The trust company placed the deed on record, and insured the title for a building association which made to the attorney a loan on a second mortgage on the same premises. Thereafter the attorney conveyed the reversion to a third party for a small consideration. The bill in equity was filed against the trust company, the building association, and the person to whom the reversion had been conveyed. <em>Held </em>(1), that the trust company was visited with notice that the attorney was a mere trustee; (2) that the word “trustee” although physically effaced, was in legal contemplation ever present in the deed, and put the defendants upon inquiry; (3) that the word “trustee” was not a mere description of the person; (4) that the alteration of the deed was a forgery and the deed thereby avoided; (5) that complainant was under no duty to make tender to the person to whom the reversion had been sold; (6) that complainant was entitled to equitable relief against all three of defendants.</p>

The mortgagees and the grantee Depue have no title for the reasons hereinabove stated; but the title of the defendant Robison as trustee remains. For it is not contended that the forgery of the deed after delivery would operate to revest the title in the grantor. But, the rights of innocent purchasers not being in question, it is clear that the deed to Robison, procured as we have seen by fraud, should not be allowed to stand, and the same is hereby declared null and void.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b153-4" data-blocks='[["BL_153.5",153,[173,1053,1179,458]]]'>The relief herein prayed for is, therefore, granted. And counsel will prepare and submit the necessary decrees in accordance with the views expressed in the foregoing opinion. The costs to be paid by the parties defendant in equal shares. On exception Stxlzberghek, P. J., filed the following opinion: We have carefully considered the numerous exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the trial judge. The fourth exception of the Commonwealth Title Insurance and Trust Company is to the following finding of fact:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b153-5" data-blocks='[["BL_153.6",153,[172,1519,1178,293]]]'>“ After inspection of the deed, Mr. Gretzinger returned it to Robison, with the explanation that the company would not lend money upon a trustee’s title, unless the power to mortgage was shown; and that if the premises belonged to Robison, as he claimed, he had better scratch out the word ‘ trustee ’ and the deed would do.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b153-6" data-blocks='[["BL_153.7",153,[171,1829,1178,564]]]'>This finding was based upon the uncorroborated testimony of the forger and was flatly contradicted by Gretzinger, and not sustained by the evidence of the only other witness who could possibly have heard what was said. We think it erroneous to permit a forger’s evidence to outweigh that of a witness whose character is quite unimpeached, especially when, as in this case, the testimony is improbable in itself and the obvious motive of the forger in currying favor with his female victim must be presumed to have weighed with him. We therefore sustain the Commonwealth Title Insurance and Trust Company’s fourth exception.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b154-3" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[291,327,1178,1594]]]'>
      <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>It seems to us, however, that with this fact eliminated the case of the Commonwealth Title Insurance and Trust Company is not materially bettered. Its grantor had no title, and it has no title. The only ground, therefore, on which it can stand is that the fraud of which it was the victim is due to the blameworthy carelessness of the plaintiff. In the face of the evidence, this position becomes untenable. The company saw the deed when the word “ trustee ” was in it. It pointed out that the presence of that word was a material hindrance to the negotiation of the mortgage. When the mortgage was presented, this hindrance was, it is true, removed; but the evidence of its removal by erasure was patent. And yet the company, with this notice of bad faith staring it in the face, advanced the money. This is gross negligence in law, and it would have been gross negligence in fact were it not for the internal machinery of the company. The deed with the word “ trustee ” in it was originally presented to Mr. Gretzinger, who was the proper party to whom to show it. When the fraudulent alteration was made, it was presented to another clerk of the company, who was, under the company’s rules, the proper person to receive it at that stage. Unfortunately he was unaware of what had happened with Mr. Gretzinger, but this fact cannot help the company. The company has no power, by the subdivision of its labors among clei’ks, to change the general law of the principal’s responsibility for acts of his agent. As a corporation, it is bound to know in every department all that has been properly communicated to it in any department, and the mere fact that to carry out this theory is inconvenient in practice, cannot help the company. We concur, therefore, with the learned trial judge, that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for.</p>
