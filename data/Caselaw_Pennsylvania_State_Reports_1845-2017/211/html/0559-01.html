    <p id="b592-11" data-blocks='[["BL_592.17",592,[294,1808,1178,356]]]'>The plaintiff’s statement in the present action, sets forth the bond, and a settlement of the treasurer’s account by the township auditors in which they found him indebted to the township in the sum sued for. From this settlement of his account the treasurer took an appeal under the statute to the court of common pleas which gave judgment against him, and from such judgment we have this appeal.</p>

L. 104, involving the method of stating the account appellant contending that the auditors erred in charging him prima facie with the full sum of the uncollected taxes. It is admitted that that is the rule under other and prior acts on the <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>same subject, but it is claimed that the act of 1899 contemplates a different method.</p>

The system of accounting by township officers is entirely statutory, and consists of a settlement in the first instance with the township auditors with a right of appeal to the court of common pleas. No further appeal is provided for, and therefore none lies to the Supreme Court from the judgment of the common pleas: Gangewere’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/61/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="61 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="428570" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0342-01">61 Pa. 342</a>; Thomas v.

It is admitted that a considerable amount of the taxes placed in appellant’s hands for collection, remains uncollected. This may have been because they were uncollectable, or because the treasurer failed to exert due diligence in their collection. If the latter was the cause then there was a breach of official</p>
