For, although the contractors with the city of Philadelphia were pretty sure to get their money if they completed their work according to contract, yet the subcontractors, material men and mechanics, who worked and furnished material for them, were often deprived of just payment for their work or materials, because dishonest or insolvent contractors refused or neglected to pay them, and there was no right of lien against a public work. And in the earlier suits upon bonds similar to the one given by the Lincoln Savings and Trust Company in this case, appeals were taken to the Supreme Court, and it was there settled that there was nothing ultra vires (that is, beyond the powers) or contrary to public policy in the city exacting from a contractor the condition that he should give a bond to pay subcontractors and material men. And it was further decided that where an ordinance requires a bond to be given by a -municipal contractor to secure payment to workmen, material men and subcontractors, and the ordinance provides that “ any person ” who has supplied labor or material shall be furnished with a copy of the bond upon application, and that such person “ shall have a right of action, and shall be authorized to bring suit in the name of the city; ” each person for whose benefit the bond was given may maintain against the contractor a separate suit in the name of the city to his own use.</p>

The testimony of the witnesses as to what the contract was between the McAvoy company and Neill does not seem to me to vary very much, both parties testifying, if my recollection is correct (though the ultimate recollection of testimony is always for the jury), that some time prior to the letting of the city contracts Neill went to the McAvoy company and asked for a price for vitrified bricks to be furnished in large quantities and was told the price would be $11.00 a thousand. Then bricks were furnished from time to time in large quantities, and prior to the letting of the city contracts Neill used the bricks for paving private streets, and, according to the testimony, paid for them. After the city contracts were let bricks were furnished to Neill f. o. b. the cars of the Reading Railroad at various points, and on the part of the plaintiff Mr. John C. McAvoy testified : “ Mr. Neill came to our office in the fall of that year (1899) and ordered from me personally 500,000 paving brick for the paving of Wake-ling, Howarth and Dyer streets. . . . He told me they were for those three streets. Those three streets were right together. The order was taken and the bricks were shipped to Frankford and used in the paving of those three streets. This one in particular, Howarth street, the brick was sent to him, and they were not paid for. . . . The brick was guaranteed to pave fifty-eight to the square yard, laid on edge as in paving.” And the witness further stated: “ I was on all three of those streets and I saw them paving the brick on those streets. It was my business to go on the streets at certain times.”</p>

This is the defense upon which one of the defendants, the Lincoln Trust Company, largely relied. One of the conditions of the bond of the trust company was to pay for labor and materials furnished and supplied in and about said work. If the bricks were not supplied in and about Howarth street, plaintiff cannot recover. The great advantage to the city of the ordinance ought not to be frittered away, but a general balance of indebtedness or a lunning account between merchants is not what was contemplated by the ordinance, nor is it within the terms of the bond. You have heard the cross-examination of the witnesses and Lave had the books of the plaintiff before you, introduced and offered by the defendant, without objection on the part of the plaintiff. These questions of fact have been fully argued. They are, perhaps, not without difficulty, but you should determine from the whole evidence, without prejudice and without sympathy, whether the plaintiffs furnished and supplied bricks to Howarth street], [11] the paving of which was the work contracted for between Neill and the city of Philadelphia, and also whether those bricks have been paid for or have not been paid for.</p>

This assumes a fact not found by tbe jury, and which, under the evidence, they were justified in not finding. There was testimony that Neill, the contractor, called at the office of the appellees and asked for a price on vitrified paving brick, which he wished to use at a <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>later date in the highway department; that the price was given him and he became the successful bidder for paving a number of streets, among them Howarth street; that when he subsequently ordered the bricks he named the streets on which they were to be used, Howarth being one of them, and to this street the bricks were sent and used on it. The contractor was ask^d: “ Q. With the brick you bought from the McAvoy Brick Company you paved Howarth street from Willow to Frankford avenue?” and the answer was, “Yes, sir.” The condition of the appellant’s bond was that A. M. Neill, the contractor, would “promptly pay or cause to be paid to any and all persons, any and all sum or sums of money which may be due for labor and materials furnished and supplied or performed in and about ” the paving of Howarth street; and, under the testimony produced by the appellees, they can turn to tbe bond for protection.</p>
    <p id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.5",394,[278,1190,1178,506]]]'>Objection is next made that “ there is a fatal variance between the allegata and probata ”; and we are asked to say that the suit is not on the bond. We can hardly understand this, for the suit is plainly on it, and it was offered in evidence in proof of the appellant’s liability to the appellees. In setting forth their cause of action on the bond, the plaintiffs properly stated the conditions under which it had been given, and then averred the breach of it as the ground of their complaint. The statement is a careful piece of pleading and its material allegations were supported by proper proofs.</p>
    <p id="b394-6" data-blocks='[["BL_394.6",394,[277,1706,1179,611]]]'>By the seventeenth assignment we are asked to say that the bond is void, because it is broader than .the form provided by the ordinance—so broad that it includes sub-subcontractors, and it is argued (1), that if the ordinance protects sub-subcontractors, it is void as against public policy, and (2), if the ordinance does not protect sub-subcontractors, but the bond does, then the latter is wholly void. These questions are not now before us. Neill was a contractor and the unpaid materials were furnished directly to him by the appellees. The ordinance and bond are for just such a case. Whether they protect sub-subcontractors we can only decide when that question arises. We pass upon nothing that is not before us.</p>
    <p id="b394-7" data-blocks='[["BL_394.7",394,[277,2325,1179,96]],["BL_395.1",395,[157,359,1179,512]]]'>Whether the notes and checks given by Neill to the appellees were taken by them as payment, in discharge of the <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>surety on the bond, was a question of fact for the jury. They were instructed that, to make a note payment absolute, there must be an express agreement by the creditor to receive it as such, and that the burden of proving this is upon the debtor. This was correct: Philadelphia v. Stewart, <a href="/pa/195/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="195 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="914026" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0309-01">195 Pa. 309</a>. The president and bookkeeper of the company both testified that the notes had not been accepted as payment, and Neill, the debtor, upon whom was the burden of showing that they had been so accepted, does not testify that they or the cheeks were so given and received.</p>
    <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[157,878,1178,356]]]'>In the judgment of the trial judge, the accounts of the appellees with Neill were not of such a complicated nature as to call for explanation by an expert accountant. Whether a contention is such as calls for expert testimony is largely in the discretion of the trial judge: Ryder v. Jacobs, <a href="/pa/182/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="182 Pa. 624" data-case-ids="893377" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0624-01">182 Pa. 624</a>; and, in the present case, it is manifest that this discretion was wisely exercised.</p>
    <p id="b395-6" data-blocks='[["BL_395.6",395,[156,1242,1181,1014]]]'>The evident purpose of the trial judge in reading the plaintiffs’ statement and the defendant’s affidavit of defense to the jury was to let them know what the issue was. In Reese v. Hershey, <a href="/pa/163/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="163 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="859012" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0253-01">163 Pa. 253</a>, relied on by appellant in support of the third and fourth assignments, the suit was for personal injuries and the court below was criticised for reading the averment of the unliquidated damages claimed, because such reading tended “ to get figures and amounts into the jury’s mind without evidence.” In the present case there was no dispute as to the amount of plaintiffs’ claim for the material furnished. The defense was that they had been paid, and, if not, that they were not protected by the bond. No conceivable harm was done the appellant in reading to the jury what the plaintiffs claimed and what the defendant said in reply. After all the testimony had been heard by the jury they simply had reimpressed upon them by the reading of the papers the issues between the parties. It was the court’s duty to do this in its charge, and, in doing so in the manner complained of, nothing in this dispute got into the jury’s mind that ought not to have reached it.</p>
    <p id="b395-7" data-blocks='[["BL_395.7",395,[157,2274,1174,148]],["BL_396.1",396,[293,359,1176,717]]]'>That portion of the judge’s charge in which he referred to the fact that these plaintiffs had recovered from the same defendants in an action on a bond given to the city of Philadel<a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>phia under the ordinance of March 30, 1896, must be read in connection with what preceded it. He was simply instructing the jury as to the law of. the case, and they were told that there could be a recovery on such a bond as had been given in this case, an illustration being the recovery in another suit which had been sustained. But they were further told that these plaintiffs could not recover unless they found from the whole evidence that the bricks for Howarth street had been furnished by them and the same had not been paid for. Another reason why the appellant should not complain of the reference to a recovery against it in another suit, is the fact that it developed this in its own cross-examination of one of appellees’ witnesses. This disposes of all the assignments. They are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
