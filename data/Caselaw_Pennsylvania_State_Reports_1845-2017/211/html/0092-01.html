Such claims are looked upon with great disfavor, and every intendment will be made against them. If .it be conceded that the law with regard to the statute of limitations is, as between the ordinary debtor and creditor, as asserted by counsel for the claimant, which is at least questionable, it by no means follows that the creditor of a firm, holding its note payable so many days or months after demand, and knowing of its dissolution and that its affairs were in the hands of a liquidating partner for settlement—the firm being, as here, admittedly solvent, and, if not so admitted, the partner whose estate is now before the court being certainly solvent— <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>can forbear to make a demand against the firm or the liquidating partner, and proceed against the estate of a deceased partner thirty-six years after the date of the paper, and recover the debt with interest amounting to more than twice the original principal.</p>

It was demonstrated that he was, himself, a member of the firm of Barclay &amp; Barclay, though he now denies it, and that the amount which he claims was carried to his credit on the books of the firm, blended with other moneys arising from his share of profits, with interest, etc. This was shown not only by the positive testimony of John K. Barclay and by tlio books of the firm, as pointed out by the convincing testimony of Mr. Goldsmith, but by an affidavit of defense filed in October, 1890, by the claimant in a suit upon a promissory note given by him to J. Ii. Grier, in which he alleged that the money was borrowed for the firm of Barclay <em>&amp; </em>Barclay of which he was a member; this being repeated by him when called as a witness at the trial of the suit, when in answer to the question, Are you a member of the firm of Barclay &amp; Barclay ? lie said that he was; that the firm consisted of John K. Barclay, Samuel G. De-Coursey, and himself; that there was no written partnership agreement; that his share of the profits was one third; and that he was to bear one third of the losses. Whether solemn admissions under oath are or are not conclusive as between the party making them and a third person (see Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 27), need not be considered; they are certainly very strong evidence against him, and completely destroy the credibility of any subsequent statement contrary to what he has thus sworn to.

Two of the duebills were payable on demand, and one on thirty days’ notice. No demand having been shown to have been made, it was claimed that the statute of limitations had not begun to run, and that the estate of the decedent, who, at the date of the duebills, and for years afterwards, was a member of the debtor firm, was liable. The presumption of payment, however, is so violent where a claim has outlived the life of a generation, that without going further, the auditing judge would have been justified in dismissing the demand as hopelessly stale. He rejected it upon the stronger ground that the <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>claimant was himself a member of the firm of Barclay &amp; Barclay. The proof of this fact approached demonstration; it was apparent on the firm’s books, wherein he was credited with a share of the profits; by his own affidavit of defense in an action against him in 1890, where he set up that the money in suit was borrowed for the firm of Barclay &amp; Barclay, and that he was a member of that firm; and by his correspondence with this decedent, in which he hinted at a dissolution of the partnership, and proposed to sell his interest therein to the other partners. The claim, therefore, is made by one partner against the estate of a deceased copartner, and requires, before it can be considered in this court, that the accounts of the partnership should first have been settled in the common pleas. Such an accounting was actually had upon a bill in equity filed in 1895 by John K. Barclay against the present claimant and the decedent, in which a decree pro confesso was taken against the claimant. Before final hearing, the judgment having been obtained against the claimant, his interest in the firm was sold and the sum of $25,000 was paid in full settlement. Further comment would be useless.</p>
