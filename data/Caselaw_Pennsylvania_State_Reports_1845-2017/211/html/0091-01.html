He <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>was riding on the back platform, though his own testimony-shows that there was available room inside.

There was really no sufficient evidence that the jerk of the car was due to negligence of the company, but even if it had been plaintiff’s own negligence would have barred his recovery: Bainbridge v.
