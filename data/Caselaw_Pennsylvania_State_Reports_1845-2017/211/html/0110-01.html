Andrews, the defendant, was arrested on a warrant charging him with the sale of oleomargarine without a license, in violation of the Act of May 29, 1901, P. L. 327. He was held for court, and on April 3, 1903, the grand jury found a true bill. On May 7, 1903, an agent of the dairy and food commissioner filed a petition in the court of quarter sessions of Philadelphia county, wherein the indictment had been found, alleging that subsequent to the commencement of said criminal proceedings the defendant had again violated the act by selling oleomargarine without a license, and praying for the issuance of a restraining order enjoining the defendant from further violating the provisions of the act. The court granted a rule on the defendant to show cause why the order should not be made, and after hearing and argument, on June 24, 1903, made the rule <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>absolute and issued the injunction. Exceptions were filed to said decree, which exceptions were dismissed and the decree confirmed, and an appeal was taken to the Superior Court.</p>

L. B27. Before the trial of the defendant an agent of the dairy and food commissioner filed a petition in the court of quarter sessions of Philadelphia county alleging that subsequently to the commencement of said criminal proceeding the defendant had again violated the act of assembly by selling oleomargarine without a license, and praying that the court issue a restraining order enjoining the defendant from further violation of the statute as provided in section 9 thereof.

    <p class="summary" id="b143-7" data-blocks='[["BL_143.8",143,[181,1712,1181,707]]]'>1. Unless the first objection is involved in the second, the appellant’s contention is untenable, for by the very terms of the act of May 29, 1901, the court of quarter sessions is invested with jurisdiction to make the order complained of. Judicial power is vested in the court of quarter sessions by Section 1, of article V, of the constitution, but the jurisdiction of the court is not defined therein. Its jurisdiction is fixed by the common law and the statutes declaring its powers. It is clearly within the power of the legislature to enlarge or restrict that jurisdiction. Unless, therefore, some limitation is found in the constitution, the section of the act referred to is not invalid, for the reason that it vests in the court of quarter sessions power to issue a restraining order to prevent the commission of a misdemeanor.</p>

The second objection is based upon the assumption that the proceeding complained of is equitable, and that jurisdiction in equity is vested in the court of common pleas, and that such jurisdiction is exclusive. The assumption that the proceeding complained of is equitable leads to an erroneous conclusion. The statute was enacted under the police power of the commonwealth for the preservation of the public health and the prevention of fraud on the public. This power, as was said in Bartemeyer v. Iowa, <a href="/us/85/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="85 U.S. 129" data-case-ids="3427234" data-case-paths="/us/85/0129-01">85 U.
