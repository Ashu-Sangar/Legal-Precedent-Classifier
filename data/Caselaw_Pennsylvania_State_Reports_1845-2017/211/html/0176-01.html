Under section 50 of said act of congress it was the duty of said trustee, before entering upon the performance of his official duties, and within ten days after his official appointment, or within such further time, not to exceed five days, as the court may permit, qualify by entering into bond to the United States, with such sureties as shall be approved by the court, conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties. As the record shows, the bond so required to be executed by the trustee within ten days after his election was not executed by him, nor approved, even by the referee in bankruptcy, within ten days after his appointment, nor was there any order of court extending the time, as provided for in said clause, and therefore the trustee failed to qualify as required by the act of congress, and under clause K, of section 50, he shall be deemed to have declined his appointment, and such failure shall create a vacancy in his office.</p>

As the record shows the bond of the plaintiff was not filed in the office of the clerk of the court until September 23, 1903, being over fifteen months after the present suit was brought by this plaintiff, the plaintiff was not legally qualified and authorized on June 21, 1902, when he brought this action, to institute any suit or action in behalf of said estate, and cannot recover in the present action, <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>and the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant. <em>Answer : </em>Refused.

The second count was withdrawn at the trial, and the case went to the. jury on the issue raised by the first, the .'plaintiff’s contention being that the money had been placed by the bankrupt in the defendant’s hands for concealment, and the defendant’s that he had', received it in discharge of a debt due him by the bankrupt. These contentions were submitted to the jury with instruction that if the transaction was the payment of a debt due the defendant, their verdict should be for <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>him ; that if they disbelieved his testimony and found that the bankrupt did not owe him the money, their verdict should be for the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[294,521,1181,960]]]'>In support of a number of assignments of error which raise the question in different forms it is argued that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show that there were unsatisfied creditors at the time of the transfer, at the time the suit was brought, and at the time of the trial, for the reason that if there were no creditors when the transfer was made, there was no one to be defrauded by it, and if there were none afterwards there was no one in whose interest the trustee could maintain the action. The first ground of objection would not be without merit if a recovery had been sought because of a preferential transfer within the time prohibited by law.. But the second count was withdrawn and the only issue at the trial was whether a debt had existed and had been paid. No other right to retain the money was set up. If it had not been given to the defendant in discharge of a debt, it was the bankrupt’s money in the defendant’s hands, which the trustee could recover for creditors. The adjudication was evidence of the bankrupt’s insolvency at its date, and.it was not necessary to prove insolvency at the trial.</p>

The notes of the testimony of the bankrupt taken at a preliminary proceeding before the referee to ascertain his assets and liabilities were properly rejected. The issue was not between the same parties nor did it involve the same subject-matter.</p>
