This is fairly to be implied from his deliberate postponement of distribution until her death (see Jones v. Cable, <a href="/pa/114/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="114 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="550047" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0586-01">114 Pa. 586</a>), and the failure to direct any other than the original distribution of income so long as she lived, especially when coupled with the principle which resolves doubts in favor of a widow accepting the provisions of a will in lieu of her rights under the intestate laws. The Act of March 31, 1812, 5 Sm. L. 395 (Purd. 1089), merely takes away survivorship as an incident of joint tenancy. It makes no change where the estate is created by will (Kerr v. Verner, <a href="/pa/66/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="66 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="432515" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0326-01">66 Pa. 326</a>), or where it is expressly provided for by deed (Redemptorist Fathers v. Lawler, <a href="/pa/205/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="205 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="930048" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0024-01">205 Pa. 24</a>) ; and whether or not survivorship was intended depends not upon the precise language of the instrument or the form of expression, but upon the meaning to be gathered from the will or deed in its entirety : Lentz v. Lentz, 2 Phil a. 117 ; Kerr v. Verner, <a href="/pa/66/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="66 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="432515" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0326-01">66 Pa. 326</a> ; Jones v.

The question, however, is one which only concerns the right of the wife as against the estate of Annie; for if she does not become entitled to the whole income at Annie’s death, it is because Annie had an estate pur autre vie, viz.: during the wife’s life, under the direction that the income shall be paid “ during the life of my wife to her and my daughter Annie equally,” and this estate the wife now has under Annie’s will. If the sale is in “ the lifetime of either of them,” the income is thus given.</p>

The testator was only one of three owners, and after his death it was rented <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>for a sum which, with taxes, etc., which the tenants were required to pay, amounted to $20,000 per annum. The arrangement was obviously for the protection of the .lessors as between themselves ; and the obligation of the tenants, who in this respect simply bound themselves to act as agents for the lessors in paying part of what was, practically, their rent, in discharge of the joint liability of the lessors, was quite as great as their liability to pay the balance, enforceable by action on the lease, at least, if not by distress. It was quite as beneficial to the estate of the testator as if the whole of its share of the $20,000. had been required to be paid in cash and one third of the taxes afterwards paid from it. Under these circumstances it is not easy to see why the accountants who secured the benefit of this lease for the estate' of which they had the- care should not receive the usual compensation of five per cent upon the gross amount required to be paid by the tenants; and as this was expressly conceded by the owners of two-thirds of the income, we think the objection on behalf of the minor owning the other third should have been overruled.</p>
