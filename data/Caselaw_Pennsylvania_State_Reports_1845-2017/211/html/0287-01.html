On June 1, 1903, the defendant received as treasurer $2,000 which were rentals due the plaintiff from the Buck Horn-Portland Cement Company. Immediately thereafter he distributed the said sum to himself and two other stockholders, who practically owned all of the stock of the plaintiff. He made this distribution without any authority from the directors, and without any dividend having been declared. On June 5, 1903, all of the stock of the plaintiff company was sold and assigned by its then stockholders to another party. On the same day the defendant resigned his position as "treasurer. New officers and new directors were elected, and this suit was subsequently brought against the defendant.</p>
