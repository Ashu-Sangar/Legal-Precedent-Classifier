        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThe principal issue raised by this appeal is whether the evidence introduced at trial is sufficient to sustain appellee\u2019s conviction for rape under section 3121 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121; to make that sufficiency determination under the circumstances of the instant case, however, it is first necessary to delineate the elements and define the scope of section 3121.\nIn reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, we apply the usual standard of review:\n[W]e must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, accept as true all the evidence and all reasonable inferences upon which, if believed, the jury could properly have based its verdict, and determine whether such evidence and inferences are sufficient in law to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\nCommonwealth v. Scatena, 508 Pa. 512, 518, 498 A.2d 1314, 1317 (1985). Viewed in that light, the record discloses the following.\nAt approximately 4:20 p.m. on February 18, 1982, the victim, a third grader at the Hunter School in Philadelphia, left her home to go to a cooking class at the nearby Waterloo Playground. The victim had celebrated her eighth birthday the prior month (January 9th). After playing tag for awhile with a playmate at the playground, she went inside a building there and watched two men playing chess. One of the men was twenty year old Nicholas Rhodes, the appellee in this case. Nicholas Rhodes lived across the street from the victim and her family and knew her for about three years. The victim knew the appellee as \u201cNicky.\"\nWhen he was done playing chess, appellee asked the victim if she wanted to go somewhere, whereupon he led her to an abandoned building near the playground and took her upstairs to a dirty, unfurnished room on the second floor. Appellee instructed her to lay down on the dirty floor and to pull her legs up. He then laid on top of her and touched her \u201cbutt\u201d with \u201csomething\u201d in his pubic area. The victim felt pain when appellee \u201ctouched her\u201d this way, and she \u201ctold him to stop.\u201d In a short while, appellee left the building with the victim who then walked to her home in the dark.\nWhen the victim arrived at her home at about 7:30 p.m.-8:00 p.m., her mother observed her crying, frightened and smelling of dog feces which was on her clothing and in her hair. The victim\u2019s mother immediately examined her and found her underwear bloody and turned inside out, her rectum torn and bleeding, and her vagina red. The victim\u2019s mother called the police and the child was taken to a hospital where a medical examination tested positively for sperm in both the \u201cvulvular sample\u201d and the \u201crectal sample\u201d, and revealed a \u201crecto-vaginal fissure\u201d (a tear). Lab results confirmed the presence of blood and \u201cseminal stains\u201d on the victim\u2019s underwear. Appellee was arrested at his home later that evening, and charged with rape, statutory rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, indecent exposure, corruption of minors and unlawful restraint.\nAppellee knowingly and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial, and was tried on August 11, 1982 before the Honorable Alfred J. DiBona, Jr., in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. The Commonwealth presented the above record evidence by testimony of the victim, her mother, the arresting officer and stipulations of fact regarding the medical and laboratory tests. Appellee testified in his defense and denied having seen the victim on February 18, 1982. He claimed to have been home from about 3:30 p.m. until his arrest that evening. Appellee\u2019s mother, who resided with appellee, testified that he had been out of the house earlier in the day and that when he returned home (she did not say what time he returned), she did not notice any unusual odors about him (such as the odor of dog feces). In an attempt to discredit the child victim\u2019s testimony, defense counsel questioned her about a prior inconsistent statement she had given to the police officer to the effect that the incident had taken place in an alley.\nJudge DiBona adjudicated appellee guilty of rape, statutory rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, indecent exposure and corruption of minors. Post trial motions were denied and appellee was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six to twenty years on the conviction for rape (a felony of the first degree) and to a concurrent term of imprisonment of. six to twenty years on the conviction for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse (a felony of the first degree). Additionally, appellee received a sentence of five years probation on the conviction for corruption of minors (a misdemeanor of the first degree) and a suspended sentence on the conviction for statutory rape (a felony of the second degree). No sentences were imposed on the remaining convictions. Appellee filed a motion for reconsideration of sentences which was summarily denied by Judge DiBona without a hearing.\nAppellee\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his convictions, challenged the sentences as \u201ctoo harsh and severe for a sexual assault upon a young girl without violence or injury\u201d and alleged an abuse of discretion in the denial of his motion for reconsideration without a hearing or written statement explaining the denial. A panel of the Superior Court (per Wieand, J., joined by Cirillo, J.; Cavanaugh, J., dissenting) found the evidence sufficient to sustain the convictions for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, statutory rape, and corruption of minors, but insufficient to sustain the conviction for rape under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121. 332 Pa.Super. 273, 279, 481 A.2d 610, 613 (1984). The Superior Court further held that since \u201cwe cannot be certain that the trial court\u2019s sentences for [involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and corruption of minors] would have been the same if it had known that the conviction for forcible rape would be set aside ... we will vacate all judgments of sentence and remand for resentencing.\u201d Id. In effect, the Superior Court\u2019s disposition reduces appellee\u2019s potential maximum sentence, since rape, a felony of the first degree, carries a twenty years maximum sentence of imprisonment, while statutory rape, a felony of the second degree, carries with it a ten years maximum sentence of imprisonment. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1103(1) and (2).\nWe granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s order, and we now reverse.\nSection 3121 of the Crimes Code establishes the crime of rape and its elements as follows:\nRape\nA person commits a felony of the first degree when he engages in sexual intercourse with another person not his spouse:\n(1) by forcible compulsion;\n(2) by threat of forcible compulsion that would prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution;\n(3) who is unconscious; or\n(4) who is so mentally deranged or deficient that such person is incapable of consent.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121(1)-(4). Labelling this section as \u201cforcible rape,\u201d the Superior Court held:\nIt is ... apparent ... that the Commonwealth failed to prove a forcible rape. There is not one iota of evidence that sexual intercourse was accomplished by forcible compulsion or by threat of forcible compulsion. Similarly, there was no evidence that the child was unconscious or mentally deficient. Although we do not minimize the heinous nature of appellant\u2019s act, it seems clear that the act of vaginal intercourse was criminal because of the provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3122 defining statutory rape and not because it was a forcible rape as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3121.\n332 Pa.Super. at 278, 481 A.2d at 613.\nWhile we agree with the Superior Court that there was no evidence that the child victim in this case was unconscious, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121(3), we find the evidence sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the crime of rape by forcible compulsion, threat of forcible compulsion and with a victim who was so mentally deficient by virtue of her young age as to be legally incapable of consent. 18 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 3121(1), (2) and (4). (Appellee had been charged by the Commonwealth under all four of the categories of rape. See note 2, supra.)\nThe Crimes Code of 1972 represented a significant departure from the prior criminal law of Pennsylvania that had been embodied in the Penal Code of 1939. The Crimes Code worked major substantive changes in the criminal law and did not simply recodify and reclassify existing laws, although the Crimes Code did draw from the concepts of and experience under the Penal Code of 1939 and the common law. Three Prosecutors Look At The New Pennsylvania Crimes Code, 12 Duq.L.Rev. 793, 804 (1974). One of the drafters of the Crimes Code, Sheldon S. Toll, has remarked that perhaps the most significant departure from the Penal Code of 1939 and the early common law was the rejection of the very strict approach to interpretation of substantive criminal laws in favor of a more common sense and flexible approach. Criminal Law Reform in Pennsylvania: The New Crimes Code, S.Toll, 78 Dick.L.Rev. 1, 3 (1973) (hereinafter Toll).\nThus, the Crimes Code provides:\nThe provisions of this title shall be construed according to the fair import of their terms but when the language is susceptible of differing constructions it shall be interpreted to further the general purposes stated in this title and the special purposes of the particular provision involved. The discretionary powers conferred by this title shall be exercised in accordance with the criteria stated in this title and, in so far as such criteria are not decisive, to further the general purposes stated in this title.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 105 (emphasis added). The preceding section of the Crimes Code sets forth its purposes:\nPurposes\nThe general purposes of this title are:\n(1) To forbid and prevent conduct that unjustifiably inflicts or threatens substantial harm to individual or public interest.\n(2) To safeguard conduct that is without fault from condemnation as criminal.\n(3) To safeguard offenders against excessive, disproportionate or arbitrary punishment.\n(4) To give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense, and of the sentences that may be imposed on conviction of an offense.\n(5) To differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses, and to differentiate among offenders with a view to a just individualization in their treatment.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 104.\nThe Crimes Code\u2019s provisions on Sexual Offenses are an amalgam of prior criminal law (judicial and statutory), the Model Penal Code promulgated by the American Law Institute in October, 1962 (Proposed Official Draft), and the recommendations of the Pennsylvania Bar Association\u2019s Special Commission on Crime and Juvenile Delinquency in conjunction with the Joint State Government Commission. Comment, Revision of the Law of Sex Crimes In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, 78 Dick.L.Rev. 73, 77 (1973) (hereinafter Comment). The Penal Code of 1939 defined the crime of rape, as did most jurisdictions, in accordance with the common law as \u201cunlawful carnal knowledge of a woman, forcibly and against her will.\u201d The essential elements of the crime of rape under this definition were penetration, however slight, force and the lack of consent of the woman. Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, Torcia, C., (14th ed.) \u00a7 283 (hereinafter Wharton\u2019s); Commonwealth v. Walker, 468 Pa. 323, 362 A.2d 227 (1976); Commonwealth v. Brown, 184 Pa.Super. 494, 136 A.2d 138 (1957). The \u201cforce\u201d required in this formulation of the crime of rape was not the force inherent in the act of penetration but, rather, the force actually used or threatened to overcome or prevent resistance by the victim. Wharton\u2019s supra at \u00a7 288. Since the focus of the element of force was on its use to overbear a victim\u2019s will and demonstrate lack of consent, the cases held that the \u201crequisite force need not have been actually applied, but may have been constructive or implied\u201d, as where the victim was unconscious, insane, drugged, or so young as to have been legally incapable of consenting to the act of sexual intercourse. Comment, supra at 74; Commonwealth v. Brown, supra; Commonwealth v. Stephens, 143 Pa.Super. 394, 17 A.2d 919 (1941); Wharton\u2019s, supra at \u00a7 287, \u201cWithout Consent.\u201d\nThe Penal Code of 1939 also contained a provision defining the crime of statutory rape as the \u201cunlawful carnal knowledge and abuse of a woman child under the age of sixteen (16) years, if the jury shall find that the woman child was\u201d of good repute and did not consent. See Commonwealth v. Walker, supra.\nSexual assault crimes have always presented perplexing, controversial and emotionally charged problems for the criminal justice system. A non-exclusive list of these problems under the common law and the Penal Code of 1939 would include: what constitutes \u201cunlawful carnal knowledge\u201d or \u201csexual intercourse\u201d (are intercourse \u201cper os\u201d or \u201cper anus\u201d included)?; the quality and quantity of force necessary to constitute \u201cforcible rape\u201d, or conversly, the degree of resistance required and/or expected of the victim; when will a victim be deemed incapable of consent?; when will consent be deemed vitiated by fraud, deception, intoxication, incapacity, etc.?; perceived doubts about the reliabil-\nity of a victim\u2019s accusations; etc. See, e.g., In the Matter of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 494 Pa. 15, 34-35, 428 A.2d 126, 135-150 (1981) (Larsen, J., dissenting); Wharton\u2019s supra at Chapter 17; Comment, supra. In response to some of these problems, and in light of modern sociological and psychological views concerning crimes of rape and other sexual assaults, the American Law Institute made comprehensive proposals regarding \u201cSexual Offenses\u201d in Article 213 of the Model Penal Code (MPC), 10 Uniform Laws Annot. (Master ed.).\nThe Proposed Official Draft of the Model Penal Code, adopted in October, 1962 by the American Law Institute, stirred great interest and intense debate among the legislatures of many, if not most, of the states of the union, acting as a catalyst for the revision and reform of criminal laws throughout the country. See generally, Wharton\u2019s, supra at Chapter 17, and Comment, supra. Among the most controversial and hotly debated of the Model Penal Code\u2019s provisions were those of Article 213 classifying the Sexual Offenses. Article 213 proposed the following categories of sexual offenses:\n\u00a7 213.1. Rape and Related Offenses\n(1) Rape. A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if:\n(a) he compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death, serious bodily injury, extreme pain or kidnapping, to be inflicted on anyone; or\n(b) he has substantially impaired her power to appraise or control her conduct by administering or employing without her knowledge drugs, intoxicants or other means for the purpose of preventing resistance; or\n(c) the female is unconscious; or\n(d) the female is less than 10 years old. Rape is a felony of the second degree unless (i) in the course thereof the actor inflicts serious bodily injury upon anyone, or (ii) the victim was not a voluntary social companion of the actor upon the occasion, of the crime and had not previously permitted him sexual liberties, in which cases the offense is a felony of the first degree.\n(2) Gross Sexual Imposition. A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife commits a felony of the third degree if:\n(a) he compels her to submit by any threat that would prevent resistance by a woman of ordinary resolution; or\n(b) he knows that she suffers from a mental disease or defect which renders her incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct; or\n(c) he knows that she is unaware that a sexual act is being committed upon her or that she submits because she mistakenly supposes that he is her husband.\nSection 213.2 of the Model Penal Code established the category of Deviate Sexual Intercourse by Force or Imposition. Under this section, deviate sexual intercourse by force is a felony of the second degree and contains subcategories of offenses substantially similar to the subcategories of rape. Compare MPC \u00a7 213.1(1) (a)-(d) with MPC \u00a7 213.2(1) (a)-(d). Deviate sexual intercourse by imposition is a felony of the third degree and contains subcategories of offenses substantially similar to the subcategories of gross sexual imposition. Compare MPC \u00a7 213.1(2)(a)-(c) with MPC \u00a7 213.2(2)(a)-(c). The Model Penal Code also proposed establishment of the sexual offenses of corruption of minors and seduction, sexual assault and indecent exposure. MPC \u00a7\u00a7 213.3, 213.4 and 213.5, respectively.\nThe Model Penal Code was the focal point of ten years of legislative consideration and debate over several senate and house versions of a revised crimes code which culminated in enactment of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code in 1972. Toll, supra; Comment, supra at 73, 77-86. Comparison of the substantive Sexual Offenses provisions of the Model Penal Code with those of the Crimes Code discloses that the Model Penal Code indeed served as a \u201cmodel\u201d in many respects, but was only the starting point. From that model, the General Assembly proceeded to make substantial modifications, accepting some of the Model Penal Code\u2019s recommendations in whole or in part, and rejecting others.\nWith this background in mind, we now turn to construction of section 3121 of the Crimes Code, guided by the principle that the \u201cprovisions of [the Crimes Code] shall be construed, if possible, according to the fair import of their terms\u201d and, if susceptible of differing constructions, interpreted according to the general purposes of the title and the special purposes of the particular section. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 105. To reiterate, a person commits rape, a felony of the first degree, when he engages in sexual intercourse with another person not his spouse: \u201c(1) by forcible compulsion; (2) by threat of forcible compulsion that would prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution; (3) who is unconscious; or (4) who is so mentally deranged or deficient that such person is incapable of consent.\u201d\nInsight into the purposes of section 3121 of the Crimes Code can be achieved by comparing section 3121 to section 213.1 of the Model Penal Code. (The Historical Note to section 3121 states \u201cThis section is similar to \u00a7 213.1 of the Model Penal Code.\u201d) The first observation is that the Pennsylvania Legislature rejected the three level degree of severity structure envisioned by the Model Penal Code. Under the latter, a person who, in the course of committing one of the four enumerated categories of rape, inflicts \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d or chooses a victim \u201cnot a voluntary social companion of the actor [who] had not previously permitted him sexual liberties\u201d commits a felony of the first degree; otherwise he commits a felony of the second degree. A person who commits one of the three enumerated categories of gross sexual imposition commits a felony of the third degree. In contrast, the Pennsylvania legislature created the crime of rape and treated each of the four enumerated categories with equal severity, classifying all as felonies of the first degree. There are also significant differences in the various enumerated categories.\nSection 3121(3) of the Crimes Code is similar to MPC \u00a7 213.1(1)(c) and establishes a category of rape where the victim is unconscious, as did the Model Penal Code. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121(3). From there, the categories differ markedly.\nSection 3121(1) defines the category of rape where the actor engages in sexual intercourse by \u201cforcible compulsion.\u201d The comparable provisions of the Model Penal Code are more specifically directed at acts of physical force and/or acts of violence by the terminology \u201ccompels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death, serious bodily injury, extreme pain or kidnapping.\u201d MPC \u00a7 213.-1(1)(a). \u201cForcible compulsion,\u201d therefore, would seem to have a broader meaning than the comparable provisions of the Model Penal Code with its emphasis upon physical force and violence. The \u201cfair import\u201d of the phrase \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d may be gathered by looking at the common, accepted meaning of those words.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary provides the following definitions:\nForcible: a. 1. Done by force; involving the use of force or violence; esp., in law ...\nForce: n. Strength, Power.\n1. Physical strength, might or vigour, as an attribute of human beings.\n2. As an attribute of physical action or movement: strength, impetus, violence or intensity of effect.\n3. Power or might____\n5. Physical strength or power exerted upon an object; esp. the use of physical strength to constrain the action of persons; violence or physical coercion.\n... (d) In non-material sense: Constraint or compulsion or constraint upon____to act under self-constraint and against one\u2019s natural impulses. Under a force: under compulsion.\n6. Mental or moral strength____ power of vigorous and effective action, or of overcoming resistance.\n7. Of things (in non-material or moral relations): Power to influence, affect or control (esp. men in their actions \u25a0 \u2022\u2022)\n[other definitions omitted]\nForce: v. [includes]\n1. To use violence; to violate, ravish (a woman).\n2. To press hard upon ...\n3. To constrain by force (whether physical or moral); to compel; to overcome the resistance of____\n4. To compel, constrain or oblige (a person, oneself,\netc.) to do a thing____\n[other definitions omitted]\nCompulsion: n.\nThe action, or an act, of compelling, or the condition of being compelled; constraint, obligation coercion.\nCompel: v.\n1. To urge irresistably, to constrain, oblige, force: a. a person to do a thing (the usual const.) ...\n2. a. To take or get by force, to extort, b. To constrain (an action) ... to command.\n3. To force ... to drive forcibly.\n4. To overpower, constrain.\n[other definitions omitted]\nWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary defines \u201cforce\u201d not only as \u201cstrength or energy exerted or brought to bear; to do violence,\u201d but also to \u201ccompel by physical, moral or intellectual means,\u201d and \u201cviolence, compulsion or constraint exerted upon or against a person or thing.\u201d Synonyms offered are \u201ccompel, coerce, constrain, oblige,\u201d which synonyms have the: \u201cshared meaning element: to make someone or something yield. Force, the general term, implies an overcoming of resistance by the exertion of strength, weight, power, stress, or duress.\u201d\nIn common usage, therefore, the phrase \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d clearly connotes more than the exercise of sheer physical force or violence as the Superior Court has so limited section 3121(1) in this case and others. The phrase also connotes the act of using superior force \u2014 physical, moral psychological, or intellectual \u2014 to compel a person to do a thing against that person\u2019s volition and/or will.\nSection 311 of the Crimes Code, enacted simultaneously with section 3121, lends further support for the construction of \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d as an act, including but not limited to physical force or violence, used to compel a person to engage in sexual intercourse against that person\u2019s will. Section 311 provides, in relevant portion:\nConsent\n(a) General rule. \u2014 The consent of the victim to conduct charged to constitute an offense or to the result thereof is a defense if such consent negatives an element of the offense or precludes the infliction of the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.\n(c) Ineffective consent. \u2014 Unless otherwise provided by this title or by the law defining the offense, assent does not constitute consent if:\n(1) it is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct charged to constitute the offense;\n(2) it is given by a person who by reason of youth, mental disease or defect or intoxication is manifestly unable or known by the actor to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute the offense;\n(3) it is given by a person whose improvident consent is sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense; or\n(4) it is induced by force, duress or deception of a kind sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 311. Effective consent to sexual intercourse will negate a finding of forcible compulsion. See, e.g. Commonwealth v. Williams, 476 Pa. 557, 563, 383 A.2d 503 (1978) (under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3123, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, this Court stated that \u201clacerations in the area of the anus and vagina and the injury to the mouth clearly suggest a forcible rather than a consensual act\") The Superior Court has held that the \u201cdegree of force involved in rape and involuntary sexual deviate intercourse is defined, not in terms of the physical injury to the victim, but in terms of the effect it has on the victim\u2019s volition.\u201d Commonwealth v. Irvin, 260 Pa.Super. 122, 126, 393 A.2d 1042, 1044 (1978). Accordingly, the \u201cforce necessary to support convictions for rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse need only be such as to establish lack of consent and to induce the woman to submit without additional resistance ... The degree of force required to constitute rape [or involuntary deviate sexual intercourse] is relative and depends upon the facts and particular circumstance of the case.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 294 Pa.Super. 93, 97, 439 A.2d 765, 768 (1982); Commonwealth v. Rough, 275 Pa.Super. 50, 418 A.2d 605 (1980).\nFrom all of the foregoing, therefore, we hold that \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d as used in section 3121(1) includes not only physical force or violence but also moral, psychological or intellectual force used to compel a person to engage in sexual intercourse against that person\u2019s will.\nClosely related to section 3121(1) is section 3121(2) which applies to the situation where \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d is not actually used but is threatened. That section uses the phrase \u201cby threat of forcible compulsion that would prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution.\u201d The Model Penal Code used the terminology \u201ccompels her to submit by any threat that would prevent resistance by a woman of ordinary resolution\u201d and graded that offense as gross sexual imposition, a felony of the third degree. The Pennsylvania legislature rejected the concept that sexual intercourse compelled by \u201cgross imposition\u201d should be graded as a less serious offense and, therefore, enacted section 3121(2). By use of the phrase \u201cperson of reasonable resolution,\u201d the legislature introduced an objective standard regarding the use of threats of forcible compulsion to prevent resistance (as opposed to actual application of \u201cforcible compulsion.\u201d)\nThe determination of whether there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused engaged in sexual intercourse by forcible compulsion (which we have defined to include \u201cnot only physical force or violence, but also moral, psychological or intellectual force used to compel a person to engage in sexual intercourse against that person\u2019s will,\u201d supra, at 555), or by the threat of such forcible compulsion that would prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution is, of course, a determination that will be made in each case based upon the totality of the circumstances that have been presented to the fact finder. Significant factors to be weighed in that determination would include the respective ages of the victim and the accused, the respective mental and physical conditions of the victim and the accused, the atmosphere and physical setting in which the incident was alleged to have taken place, the extent to which the accused may have been in a position of authority, domination or custodial control over the victim, and whether the victim was under duress. This list of possible factors is by no means exclusive.\nIt is neither desirable nor appropriate to attempt to delineate all of the possible circumstances that might tend to demonstrate that sexual intercourse was engaged in by forcible compulsion or by the threat of forcible compulsion within the meaning of section 3121(1) and (2). That delineation will evolve in the best tradition of the common law \u2014 by development of a body of case law applying section 3121 (as it has been here construed) and the principles of construction set forth in the Crimes Code. When forcible compulsion (used or threatened) consists of physical force or violence, relatively tangible circumstances, testimony and other evidence will tend to prove the existence of such. When forcible compulsion (used or threatened) consists of \u201cmoral, phychological or intellectual force,\u201d the force may be less tangible but is not less susceptible of proof, and the critical circumstances and evidence here will be those which tend to prove or disprove compulsion or lack of consent, i.e. that such force was \u201cused to compel a person to engage in sexual intercourse against that person\u2019s will.\u201d In this regard, the excellent analogy made by Mr. Justice Hutchinson in his concurring opinion is a point well made \u2014 proof of compulsion and lack of consent under section 3121(1) and (2) is not unlike proof of compulsion or coercion in the context of confessions challenged by a defendant as involuntary. The task of the fact finder in each ease will be essentially the same, the determination of whether the victim or the defendant was forced to do a thing (respectively, to engage in sexual intercourse or to confess to a crime) against his or her will.\nReviewing the evidence in the instant case, we find it sufficient to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that appellee engaged in sexual intercourse with his eight year old victim by forcible compulsion and by the threat of forcible compulsion. Appellee, a twenty year old man who knew the child victim and her family for three years and who the victim knew as Nicky, lured the victim into an abandoned, filthy building and instructed her to lay down and pull her legs up, whereupon he forced his will upon her and engaged in acts of sexual and deviate sexual intercourse to the extent that she was bleeding and torn.\nThere is an element of forcible compulsion, or the threat of forcible compulsion that would prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution, inherent in the situation in which an adult who is with a child who is younger, smaller, less psychologically and emotionally mature, and less sophisticated than the adult, instructs the child to submit to the performance of sexual acts. This is especially so where the child knows and trusts the adult. In such cases, forcible compulsion or the threat of forcible compulsion derives from the respective capacities of the child and the adult sufficient to induce the child to submit to the wishes of the adult (\u201cprevent resistance\u201d), without the use of physical force or violence or the explicit threat of physical force or violence. As Judge Cavanaugh noted in his dissenting opinion in this case, \u201cthe illicit commands of this twenty year old [man] in an isolated and abandoned room were ... an imperative which gave the [eight year old] child victim no alternative but submission to appellant\u2019s corrupt scheme.\u201d 332 Pa.Super. at 281, 481 A.2d at 614. This eight year old child was physically and emotionally helpless to resist the commands of her twenty year old neighbor, and his perverse acts of sexual intercourse and deviate sexual intercourse were indeed achieved by \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d and \u201cby threat of forcible compulsion that would prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution.\u201d Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction for rape under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121(1) and (2).\nAdditionally, section 3121(4) creates the category of rape where the actor engages in sexual intercourse with a person \u201cwho is so mentally deranged or deficient that such person is incapable of consent.\u201d Related categories of the Model Penal Code would seem to be the categories of rape where\n(b) he has substantially impaired her power to appraise or control her conduct by administering or employing without her knowledge drugs, intoxicants or other means for the purpose of preventing resistance; or\n* # sfc sf: s}! sfc\n(d) the female is less than 10 years old.\nand the category of gross sexual imposition where\n(b) he knows that she suffers from a mental disease or defect which renders her incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct____\nMPC \u00a7 213.1(1)(b) and (d) and (2)(b), respectively. The Pennsylvania legislature simplified this structure and enacted the one category of rape (a felony of the first degree) which would seem to cover all of these Model Penal Code categories.\nWe do not address all of the possible conditions that would demonstrate that a person \u201cis so mentally deranged or deficient that such person is incapable of consent.\u201d Suffice it to say that the eight year old child in this case was \u201cso mentally deficient,\u201d as a matter of law, that she was incapable of consenting to an act whose nature she could not appreciate or comprehend; this is the \u201cfair import\u201d of \u00a7 3121(4).\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines \u201cdeficient\u201d as \u201c1. Wanting some part, element, constituent, or characteristic which is necessary to completeness, or having less than the proper amount of it; wanting or falling short in something; defective.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary defines \u201cdeficient\u201d as \u201c1. lacking in some necessary quality or element ...\u201d using as an example \u201cdeficiency in judgment.\u201d And, as noted previously, the Crimes Code explicitly informs us as to when a person is incapable of consent, namely, when \u201cassent\u201d to an act\n(1) ... is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct charged to constitute the offense;\n(2) ... is given by a person who by reason of youth, mental disease or defect or intoxication is manifestly unable or known by the actor to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute the offense____\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 311(c)(1) and (2).\nAs Judge Cavanaugh stated in dissent:\nThe necessary implication of the [Superior Court] majority\u2019s decision is that this eight year old child engaged in an act of consensual intercourse with appellant. I cannot agree. There is a serious question that an eight year old child is capable of consenting to sexual intercourse. Common sense and human experience compel us to the conclusion that a child of such tender years should not be expected to know the nature and implications of human sexual intercourse. Since the statute excludes from the consensual defense a victim who is \u201cso mentally deranged or deficient that such person is incapable of consent\u201d, how much more so should it be interpreted to protect a child who by reason of her infancy may not be said to have developed a cognition of the nature of an act of adult sexuality.\n332 Pa.Super. at 280, 481 A.2d at 614 (footnotes omitted).\nWe hold, therefore, that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that appellee engaged in sexual intercourse with a person (an eight year old child) who was \u201cso mentally ... deficient that such person [was] incapable of consent.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121(4).\nThe Superior Court also stated in the instant case that \u201cit seems clear that the act of vaginal intercourse was criminal because of the provisions of \u00a7 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3122 defining statutory rape and not because it was a forcible rape as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3121.\u201d 332 Pa.Super. at 279, 481 A.2d at 613. We reject the implication of this passage that an act of sexual intercourse with a victim who is under the age of fourteen years cannot constitute rape as well as statutory rape where the elements of each distinct offense have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. As we have held, the elements of the crime of rape have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt as appellee engaged in sexual intercourse with a person not his spouse by forcible compulsion, the threat of forcible compulsion and with a victim so mentally deficient because of her youth as to be legally incapable of consenting to the act of sexual intercourse. Additionally, there is no doubt that appellee was guilty of statutory rape under section 3122 which provides that: \u201cA person who is 18 years of age or older commits statutory rape ... when he engages in sexual intercourse with another person not his spouse who is less than 14 years of age.\u201d The absence, existence or effectiveness of the victim\u2019s consent is immaterial to the crime of statutory rape. Appellee\u2019s guilt of this crime was established by the proven elements that he was older than eighteen (he was twenty) years and that he engaged in sexual intercourse with a victim who was younger than fourteen (the child victim was eight) years.\nThe crimes of rape and statutory rape are no longer mutually exclusive offenses as they were held to be by this Court when statutory rape was defined as \u201cconsensual carnal knowledge of a female under the age of sixteen years, by a male, not her husband, older than sixteen....\u201d Commonwealth v. Walker, supra 468 Pa. at 332, 362 A.2d 227, overruled in part in Commonwealth v. Frisbie, 506 Pa. 461, 465, 485 A.2d 1098 (1984). (See note 10, supra.) In Walker, we held that, since a single act could not be simultaneously consensual and without consent, the appellant there committed only one of the injuries to the Commonwealth proscribed by the crimes of rape and statutory rape and could not, therefore, be convicted of both. With the elimination of the consensual element of statutory rape, this impediment to the dual convictions for rape and statutory rape no longer exists.\nNor do double jeopardy principles or the doctrine of merger of lesser included offenses prohibit the conviction and sentence for both rape and statutory rape arising from a single act of sexual intercourse. In Commonwealth v. Norris, 498 Pa. 308, 319, 446 A.2d 246 (1982), involving a double jeopardy challenge to dual convictions, this Court stated: \u201cunlike the situation in Walker, the Commonwealth suffered two injuries from appellant\u2019s single act in that appellant not only engaged in forcible intercourse with an individual who was not his spouse, but also corrupted the morals of a child under the age of eighteen.\u201d So too in the instant case, the Commonwealth has suffered two injuries from appellee\u2019s single act in that he not only engaged in sexual intercourse by forcible compulsion, the threat of forcible compulsion, and with a victim so mentally deficient as to be incapable of consent, he has also engaged in such acts with a victim under the statutory age of fourteen while he was older than eighteen. The separate injuries are proscribed by separate offenses with distinct elements.\nIn Commonwealth v. Sayko, Pa. (1986), Justice McDermott, speaking for the majority, extrapolated the Norris reasoning in the double jeopardy context to a challenge to dual convictions for indecent exposure and indecent assault based upon the doctrine of merger. In that case, Justice McDermott stated for the Court:\nThe General Assembly may discern by statute different interests to be protected in the same person during a criminal transaction. There is a difference in fact and in consequence between an indecent touching and an indecent exposure; and a profound difference between both acts and the corruption of a minor. Each contain different elements designed to protect different interests. The corruption of a minor child can only be committed against a minor child, hence the interest to be protected and the age of the victim are elements different from those of indecent assault and indecent exposure, which offenses can be perpetrated against anyone, young or old. So too, are there different interests and different elements dividing an indecent touching and an indecent exposure.\nId., slip op. at 4-5 (footnotes omitted). We therefore held that the offenses charged did not merge and it was not error for the lower court to sentence the defendant therein separately on each offense charged. See also Commonwealth v. Williams, 344 Pa.Super. 108, 496 A.2d 31 (1985); Commonwealth v. Whetstine, 344 Pa.Super. 246, 496 A.2d 777 (1985); Commonwealth v. White, 341 Pa.Super. 261, 491 A.2d 252 (1984). In the crime of statutory rape, the consent of the underage victim is immaterial and is no defense; rather, the legislature has determined that a person eighteen years of age or older commits the crime of statutory rape (a felony of the second degree) by the act of sexual intercourse with another person not his spouse under the age of fourteen with or without the victim\u2019s consent. 18 Pa-C.S.A. \u00a7 3122. The crime of rape, as we have discussed, is concerned with the situation where \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d or the threat thereof is used to compel a person to engage in sexual intercourse against her will or with a person who, by reason of being unconscious or mentally deranged or deficient, is incapable of consent. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121. Effective consent is a defense to the crime of rape. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 311(a). Because the crimes of rape and statutory rape designate separate offenses for different injuries to the Commonwealth, an actor may be convicted and punished for both offenses arising from a single act of sexual intercourse.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Superior Court erred in finding the evidence insufficient to establish the crime of rape under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121, and we reinstate appellee\u2019s conviction and judgment of sentence for rape.\nIn his appeal to the Superior Court, appellee had also challenged his sentences on the grounds that a sentence of six to twenty years was \u201ctoo harsh and severe for a sexual assault upon a young girl without violence or injury,\u201d that he was \u201centitled to a written statement by the [post verdict motions] Court of the reason why a hearing to reconsider a severe sentence was denied,\u201d and that he was entitled to a hearing on his motion to reconsider sentence. It is unclear whether the Superior Court actually resolved these issues. That court stated:\nWe have also reviewed the sentences imposed for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and corrupting the morals of a minor, as well as the court\u2019s reasons for these sentences. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, we perceive no abuse of discretion. The sentence was warranted by the nature of the crimes committed, appellant\u2019s prior criminal and psychiatric record, and the potential threat which he presented to the community if he were not confined.\n481 A.2d at 610. Nevertheless, the Superior Court vacated all judgments of sentence and remanded for resentencing because \u201cwe cannot be certain that the trial court\u2019s sentences for such offenses would have been the same if it had known that the conviction for forcible rape would be set aside.\u201d Id.\nSince the conviction for \u201cforcible rape\u201d under section 3121 has now been reinstated, the reason Superior Court gave for remanding to Common Pleas for resentencing disappears. Therefore, no purpose would be served by a remand to Superior Court for consideration of appellee\u2019s challenges to the discretionary aspects of his sentence, an issue over which we lack jurisdiction. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9781(f). We note, however, that the suggestion that the heinous acts committed upon this young child of tender years was a \u201csexual assault without violence or injury\u201d is offensive and ignorant of the deep emotional and psychological trauma that in all likelihood will result from appellee\u2019s perverse conduct. See Matter of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, supra 494 Pa. at 38-43, 428 A.2d at 138-140 (Larsen, J., dissenting). Mr. Rhodes earned and deserves every day of the sentences lawfully imposed upon him by Judge Alfred J. DiBona, Jr.\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed, the conviction for rape is reinstated, and all judgments of sentence are reinstated.\nFLAHERTY, HUTCHINSON and PAPADAKOS, JJ., join this opinion.\nNIX, C.J., and HUTCHINSON, J., filed concurring opinions.\nZAPPALA, J., filed a concurring opinion which McDERMOTT, J., joined.\n. At trial, the victim was unable to respond to numerous questions during her direct examination: \"After you finished watching them play chess, what did you do?\u201d \"What happened after you put your legs up? What did Nicky [appellee] do?\" \"[W]hat did Nicky do after you put your legs up?\u201d \"Now, what did Nicky do when he laid down on you?\u201d She was, however, able to provide answers to these questions after they were rephrased for her. She was also unable to describe how or with what she had been touched, but she was permitted to \"point for the Judge where it is, what thing, that is, he touched you with, where it is on Nicky.\u201d\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3121, 3122, 3123, 3126, 3127 and 6301, respectively. The Commonwealth had charged appellee with four separate counts of rape corresponding to each separate category of rape set forth in section 3121(1)-(4). See text of section 3121, infra at 543-544.\n. Appellee\u2019s post trial motions and Superior Court brief challenged the sufficiency of the evidence primarily on the grounds that the victim\u2019s testimony was so inconsistent with her prior statements to the police as to be untrustworthy and unreliable as a matter of law. Nevertheless, the Superior Court found the post trial motions and brief adequate to raise the issue of sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the convictions generally. Although it is a close question, we will accept the Superior Court\u2019s finding in this regard in the interests of justice and judicial economy.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3123. Involuntary deviate sexual Intercourse\nA person commits a felony of the first degree when he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another person:\n(1) by forcible compulsion;\n(2) by threat of forcible compulsion that would prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution;\n(3) who is unconscious;\n(4) who is so mentally deranged or deficient that such person is incapable of consent; or\n(5) who is less than 16 years of age.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3122.

The Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, \u00a7 721, 18 P.S. \u00a7 4721, as amended provided:\n(b) Whoever, being of the age of sixteen (16) years and upwards, unlawfully and carnally knows and abuses any woman child under the age of sixteen (16) years with her consent, is guilty of statutory rape, a felony ...\nUpon the trial of any defendant charged with the unlawful carnal knowledge and abuse of a woman child under the age of sixteen (16) years, if the jury shall find that such woman child was not of good repute, and that the carnal knowledge was with her consent, the defendant shall be acquitted of rape, and be convicted of fornication.\n. The Model Penal Code also recommended \u201cProvisions Generally Applicable to Article 213.\u201d MPC \u00a7 213.6. The Model Penal Code provides that it shall be a defense to prosecution under sections 213.3 and 213.4 that the \u201calleged victim had, prior to the time of the offense charged, engaged promiscuously in sexual relations with others.\u201d MPC \u00a7 213.6(3). It also contains a \"prompt reporting\u201d requirement and a requirement that, in order to secure a conviction for any felony under Article 213, the testimony of the alleged victim must be corroborated and the jury instructed to regard the testimony of the alleged victim with \u201cspecial care in view of the emotional involvement of the witness and the difficulty of determining the truth with respect to alleged sexual activities carried out in private.\u201d MPC \u00a7 213.6(4) and (5). In this respect, the Model Penal Code was not very progressive vis a vis these \u201cspecial rules\" governing rape prosecutions. These pernicious \"special rules\u201d perpetuated many of the myths of rape and had ancient legal roots that have been \"attributed to Lord Chief Justice Matthew Hale, the seventeenth-century English jurist, who wrote: \u2018Rape is an accusation easily to be made and hard to be proved, and harder still to be defended by the party accused, tho never so innocent.\u2019 Hale, History of the Pleas of the Crown, Vol. 1, 634 (R.H. Small 1847).\u201d Matter of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 494 Pa. 15, 428 A.2d 126, 140-141 (1981). Modern social, legal and psychological thinking has thoroughly discredited these \"special rules,\u201d and our Crimes Code, with amendments in 1973 and 1976, has finally discarded the last vestiges of these ill-conceived rules. 18 Pa.C.S.A. Ch. 31, subch. A, \u00a7\u00a7 3101-3107; see Matter of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, supra, 494 Pa. at 43-49, 428 A.2d at 140-43 (1981) (Larsen, J., dissenting).\n. Commonwealth v.

In Irvin, Rough and Williams, however, the actors did employ physical force or the threat of physical force to varying degrees.\n. It is not necessary to prove that the victim actually resisted in order to prove that the act of sexual intercourse was against the victim\u2019s will and/or without consent. Section 3107 provides that the \"victim need not resist the actor in prosecutions under\u201d chapter 31 and makes it clear that lack of consent is not synonymous with lack of resistance. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3107.\n. It should be clear from the foregoing that the element of forcible compulsion that will demonstrate rape under section 3121 requires much more than simply convincing an initially reluctant consenting adult to engage in sexual intercourse by moral, psychological or intellectual persuasion. It was not the legislature\u2019s intent to condemn such conduct as rape. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 104(1), (2) and (4) (purposes of the Crimes Code). Rather, section 3121(1) and (2) requires actual forcible compulsion or the threat thereof which is used to compel the victim to engage in sexual intercourse against that person\u2019s will such that the act of sexual intercourse cannot be regarded as consensual.\n. See Commonwealth v. Stephens, 143 Pa.Super. 394, 401, 17 A.2d 919, 921 (1941) (citation omitted) ('\u201c[I]t has been held that ... in one case, where [the female] was under the age of ten years, she was incapable of consenting, and the law implied force.\u2019\u201d); Commonwealth v. Cyans, 88 Pa.Super. 227, 229 (1926) (\u201cWhere, as here, the female is not only so young [five years of age] that she is incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse, but cannot even entertain a thought upon that subject, a jury is warranted in finding an intent to have carnal knowledge of the child forcibly whenever the evidence warrants a finding that the defendant laid his hands upon her with an intent to carnally know her.\u201d).\n. The Crimes Code provides: \u201cSexual intercourse. In addition to its ordinary meaning, includes intercourse per os or per anus, with some penetration however slight; emission is not required.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3101.\n. Many states have enacted schemes of sexual offenses recognizing the crime of \u201crape\u201d or other \"most serious\u201d sexual offense where the victim is under a certain age (usually 10, 11 or 12) and/or is \"physically helpless,\u201d in addition to crimes of \u201cstatutory rape\u201d where the victim is under a certain age (usually 15 or 14) and the actor over a certain age.

See Commonwealth v. Williams, 294 Pa.Super. 93, 439 A.2d 765 (1982). This test has a subjective aspect which takes into account the immaturity of the victim as well as all other factors bearing upon the will of the victim to resist.\nThe attempt by the majority to suggest the age of the victim alone can eliminate the requirement of force distorts the traditional distinction between statutory and common law rape. The offense of statutory rape is only applicable when the victim is under age, whether or not she has consented to the entry. This is a distinction that our legislature has evidenced a clear intent to preserve in the drafting of sections 3121 and 3122. The fact that the legislature chose to distinguish between the punishment given for a violation of section 3121 as opposed to section 3122 is a judgment that is theirs to make. This Court has no right to overrule that judgment by attempting to obliterate that distinction through case law.\nMoreover, the focus by the majority on the force used to accomplish carnal knowledge in this case was gratuitous. Here there has not been the slightest suggestion that this victim consented to the penetration. The Superior Court, sua sponte, raised this question as a basis for justifying its decision to reverse the rape conviction under section 3121. The law is clear in this Commonwealth that a reviewing court should not address issues that have not been previously advanced by the parties. See, e.g., Consumer Party of Pennsylvania v. Commonwealth, 510 Pa. 158, 507 A.2d 323 (1986); Estep v. Estep, 508 Pa. 623, 500 A.2d 418 (1985); Commonwealth ex rel. Robinson v. Robinson, 505 Pa. 226, 478 A.2d 800 (1984); In re: Duncan Trust, 480 Pa. 608, 391 A.2d 1051 (1978); Coleman v. Board of Education of School District of Philadelphia, 477 Pa. 414, 383 A.2d 1275 (1978); Wiegand v. Wiegand, 461 Pa. 482, 337 A.2d 256 (1975). It is for this reason that I join in the mandate reversing the Order of the Superior Court.",

On all the evidence in this record, including the victim\u2019s age and injuries, a jury was entitled to infer such compulsion. Certainly, if a grown man can be coerced or compelled to confess to a crime by the questioning of an arresting officer, see Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 602, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 1879, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1961), an eight year old victim of a sexual assault is no less likely to have had her will forcibly overcome by an adult male in the dirty, bare and unfamiliar place in which this crime took place. It is, indeed, time for us to apply to the victims of crime the same protective standards that we give criminal defendants.",

I cannot accept, however, the majority\u2019s conclusion that forcible compulsion would have been established in the absence of that evidence.\nThe majority\u2019s discussion of whether the age of a victim is in itself sufficient to establish forcible compulsion is unnecessary under the factual circumstances presented in this case. I do not join in that portion of the majority opinion and am concerned that the majority\u2019s finding that forcible compulsion may be established by a showing of the respective capacities of the defendant and victim will eradicate the distinction between the criminal offenses of rape, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3121, and statutory rape, 18 Pa.
