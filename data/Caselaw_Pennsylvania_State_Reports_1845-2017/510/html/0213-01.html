It has long been established that statements contained in pleadings, as well as statements made in the actual trial or argument of a case, are privileged. In <em>Kemper v.

That history, an excerpt from which follows, demonstrates that protection has from early times been afforded communications that play an <em>integral role in pursuing the ordinary course of justice:</em>

    <blockquote id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.4",282,[272,582,1103,1763]],["BL_283.1",283,[243,307,1114,1871]]]'>In England, as far back as the time of Coke, anything said or written in legal proceedings was absolutely privileged. In Cutler and Dixon, Coke’s Reports, Part IV, p. 14, it was adjudged, “that if one exhibits articles to justices of peace against a certain person, containing divers great abuses and misdemeanors, not only concerning the petitioners themselves, but many others, and all this to the intent that he should be bound to his good behavior; in this case the party accused shall not have for any matter contained in such articles any action upon the case, for they have pursued the ordinary course of Justice in such case; and if actions should be permitted in such cases, those who have just cause of complaint, would not dare to complain for fear of infinite vexation.” And on the same page, in Buckley and Wood, “It was resolved per totam curiam, that for any matter contained in the bill that was examinable in the said court, no action lies, although the matter is merely false, because it was in course of justice.” <em>In The King v. Skinner, </em>Lofft, 55, on a motion to quash the indictment against the defendant, who, as one of his majesty’s justices of the peace, was charged with having said to a grand jury before him in the general sessions of the county, “You are a seditious, scandalous, corrupt and perjured jury,” Lord Mansfield remarked: “Neither party, witness, counsel, jury or judge, can be put to answer, civilly or criminally, for words spoken in office. If the words spoken are opprobrious or irrelevant to a case, the court will take notice of them as a contempt, and examine on information. If anything of mala mens is found on such enquiry it will be punished suitably.” In comparatively recent times, in <em>Revis v. Smith, </em>86 E.C.L. 127, it was held that no action will lie against a man for a statement made by him, whether by affidavit or viva voce, in the course of a <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>judicial proceeding, even though it be alleged to have been made “falsely and maliciously, and without any reasonable or probable cause.” That case was followed by <em>Henderson v. Broomhead, </em>4 H. &amp; N. 569, and it was there said by Crompton, J.: “No action will lie for words spoken or written in the course of any judicial proceeding. In spite of all that can be said against it, we find the rule acted upon from the earliest times. The mischief would be immense if the person aggrieved, instead of preferring an indictment for perjury, could turn his complaint into a civil action. By universal assent it appears that in this country no such action lies. Cresswell, J., pointed out, in <em>Revis v. Smith, </em><a href="/citations/?q=18%20C.B.%20126" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="18 C.B. 126">18 C.B. 126</a> (E.C.L.R. vol. 86), that the inconvenience is much less than it would be if the rule were otherwise. The origin of the rule was the great mischief that would result if witnesses in courts of justice were not at liberty to speak freely, subject only to the animadversion of the court____ The rule is inflexible that no action will lie for words spoken or written in the course of giving evidence.” Another case that may be cited is <em>Seaman v. Netherclift, </em>L.R. 1 C.P.Div. 540, where it was said by Lord Coleridge, C.J.: “Now, a long course of authorities, of which perhaps the best known, as the most remarkable, is the case of <em>Astley v. Younge </em>(2 Burr. 807), has decided that no action of slander can be brought for any statement made by the parties either in the pleadings or during the conduct of the case____ But I conceive the law on this point to be now quite certain, although most men of any experience in the profession must have seen many instances in which judicial proceedings have been made by parties to them to serve the ends of private malignity. It is equally certain, however, nor has any question ever been raised, that the privilege of parties is confined to what they do or say in the conduct of the case.”</blockquote>

Although the letter made <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>reference to matters which occurred in an ongoing trial, the letter was not directly relevant to the court proceedings. Accordingly, we do not believe issuance of the letter was within the sphere of activities which judicial immunity was designed to protect. The privilege is not a license for extra-judicial defamation, and there is unnecessary potential for abuse if letters of the sort written in this case are published with impunity. Formal procedures are available to address the grievances which the writer of the letter perceived, without resort to extra-judicial defamation.</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[243,866,1155,957]]]'>The letter was not addressed to Judge Kelton, but rather a copy was merely sent to him. The letter did not state or argue any legal position, and it did not request any ruling or action by the court. Nor did the communication request that anything contained in it should even be considered by the court. The letter was clearly not a part of the judicial proceedings to which it made reference, and merely forwarding a copy of the letter to the court did not make it a part of those proceedings. Likewise, forwarding copies of the letter to plaintiffs alleged client, William H. Simon, M.D., and to the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania did not render the letter a part of the trial proceedings, and transmittal of those copies would not logically have been expected to affect the course of trial. Thus, the policy of promoting an unfettered airing of issues at trial is not infringed by our holding that the letter published in this case was outside the ambit of judicial immunity.</p>
    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[242,1841,1153,529]],["BL_287.1",287,[204,333,1138,147]]]'>It is argued that if, as we have held, the letter was not published as part of the course of the judicial proceedings to which the letter referred, then publication of the letter was privileged with respect to other proceedings, such other proceedings being those which might be brought in an action before the Disciplinary Board charging plaintiff with professional misconduct, or other proceedings which might be brought charging plaintiffs alleged client, William H. Simon, M.D., with perjury. Citing the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 586 (1977), defendant asserts that judicial <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>immunity is applicable to communications which are preliminary to proposed judicial proceedings. The Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 586, states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[242,496,1106,307]]]'>An attorney at law is absolutely privileged to publish defamatory matter concerning another in communications <em>preliminary to a proposed judicial proceeding, </em>or in the institution of, or during the course and as a part of, a judicial proceeding in which he participates as counsel, <em>if it has some relation to the proceeding.</em>

    <p id="b287-7" data-blocks='[["BL_287.6",287,[199,882,1141,890]]]'>Whether a challenged communication is published prior to, or during, a judicial proceeding, it must bear a certain relationship to the proceeding so as to qualify it as privileged. That relationship is, in either case, the same. As discussed supra, in reference to communications made during judicial proceedings, it is necessary that a protected communication have been pertinent and material to the redress sought and that the communication have been issued in the regular course of the proceedings. Similarly, with respect to communications made prior to the institution of proceedings, the protected communication would need to have been pertinent and material and would need to have been issued in the regular course of preparing for contemplated proceedings. Evaluated by this standard, the instant letter does not qualify as privileged with respect to proceedings which might be brought against plaintiffs alleged client, William H. Simon, M.D., or against plaintiff himself.</p>

Further, the characterizations, as distinguished from alleged facts, set forth in the letter describing plaintiff as an unprofessional attorney and a nefarious piranha and liar would not be relevant to a perjury proceeding against William H. Simon, M.D. Similarly, in any action based upon professional misconduct which might be brought against plaintiff in a proceeding before the Discipli<a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>nary Board, it would not be pertinent, material, and in the regular course of procedure to forward copies of a letter such as the present one to Judge Kelton and to William H. Simon, M.D. In short, defendant published the letter to persons who would have had no direct interest in either of the proceedings which might have ensued. Publication of the letter to such persons was, therefore, not privileged.</p>
    <p id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.4",288,[254,704,1156,902]]]'>Thus, the Court of Common Pleas, in sustaining defendant’s preliminary objections to the count sounding in libel, erroneously determined that judicial immunity precluded liability with respect to that count. In dismissing that count, the court did not afford plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint to allege certain additional facts pertaining to the libel action, apparently in the belief that amendment would be futile since judicial immunity was perceived as barring any such suit. It is established that leave to amend should not be withheld where there is some reasonable possibility that defects in a complaint can be cured through amendment. <em>Otto v.

A reading of the communication indicates, in the clearest <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>possible language, that the letter itself was notice to Appellant that Appellee was filing charges against him with the Disciplinary Board. The letter itself is the formal complaint against Appellant which was forwarded to the Board. The copies of the letter to the trial judge and Dr. Simon were pertinent, material, and in the regular course of procedure because these individuals were involved in the alleged improper conduct of Appellant and could very well be called upon by the Disciplinary Board in its investigation of Appellee’s complaint. Accordingly, they clearly had an interest in the proceedings which might ensue before the Disciplinary Board. I would hold this communication protected as made prior to the institution of proceedings (Restatement of Torts, § 586) and would affirm the order of Superior Court.</p>
