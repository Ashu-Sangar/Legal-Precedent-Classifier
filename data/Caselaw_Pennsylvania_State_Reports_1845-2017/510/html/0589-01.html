      <em>Lamp </em>requires of plaintiffs a good-faith effort to effectuate notice of commencement of the action. Although this good-faith requirement is not apparent from a reading of the rule itself, we interpret the rule mindful of the context in which it was announced. The purpose for the rule, as stated in <em>Lamp, </em>“is to avoid the situation in which a plaintiff can bring an action, but by not making a <em>good-faith </em>effort to notify a defendant, retain exclusive control over it for a period in excess of that permitted by the statute of limitations.” <a href="/pa/469/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="469 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1722159" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0465-01">469 Pa. at 478</a>, <a href="/pa/469/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="469 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1722159" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0465-01">366 A.2d at 889</a> [Emphasis supplied]; see also <em>Jacob v.

Thus, evidentiary determinations are required. Instantly, plaintiffs submitted an affidavit which the court considered in rendering its decision. Defendants agree that this affidavit sets forth all relevant facts and that no further evidentiary proceedings are required. Based on the affidavit, the Court of Common Pleas found that eight or nine days of the delay was attributable to counsel’s simply misplacing the <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>file.

On the contrary, the record reviewed by the trial court does indicate that the Appellees were made aware of the Appellant’s claim within one year prior to the commencement of these legal proceedings. Therefore, this is not a case in which a potential party has no notice of a pending claim until the filing of a writ for the purpose of tolling the statute of limitations.
