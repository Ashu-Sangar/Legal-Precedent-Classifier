On the evening of May 11, 1981, a police officer stopped appellee while the latter was standing on a street corner in Philadelphia. At the time the officer was responding to a radio call which indicated that a man with a gun was present on the corner. Appellee fit the description which the officer had received,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and at the time of the stop appellee was engaged in what could have been considered suspicious activity, in that he was standing in the rain observing a sandwich shop through a pair of binoculars. Since the officer believed that the man was armed, he conducted a pat-down of the appellee, which revealed a .32 caliber revolver located in appellee’s pants. Appellee was then arrested on suspicion of violating the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

When asked if the cases belonged to him, appellee responded in an ambiguous manner. The cases were seized and taken into custody along with appellee. Upon arrival at the police facility the two cases were examined without search warrant authority. This search revealed various articles, which later proved to be the fruits of a burglary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The Commonwealth chose not to appeal Judge Diaz’ decision and instead elected to <em>nolle pros </em>the burglary charge.</p>

Rather, after receiving memoranda and hearing argument, Judge Clarke ruled that by operation of collateral estoppel Judge Diaz’ findings of fact and conclusions of law were binding on him in this second prosecution. Consequently, he suppressed the physical evidence, i.e., the gun.</p>

An assessment of the legality of the seizure of evidence is the very purpose of a suppression hearing.

One of the <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>most important of these is the sound policy of avoiding having judges of equal jurisdiction, sitting on the same bench, overruling each other on the same record.</p>

Since an appellate court may affirm the decision of a lower court on a different basis than that offered below, the Commonwealth believed that appeal of this first decision would have proved to be a waste of resources.

The second judge deemed himself powerless to overrule his coordinate colleague, since the same evidence and the same issue were involved, i.e., whether there was a valid <em>Terry </em>stop. From that ruling the Commonwealth appealed. The reason the Commonwealth chose to appeal this ruling was that the <em>Terry </em>issue was the only possible basis upon which the seizure of the gun depended.
