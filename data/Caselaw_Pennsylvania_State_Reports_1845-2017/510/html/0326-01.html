Commonwealth Court affirmed the order of the Board of Finance and Revenue, sustaining the Department of Revenue’s assessment filed against the Appellant, Vernon C. Buckley, for failure to pay personal income tax. At issue is the constitutionality of the 1978 Reciprocal Personal Income Tax Agreement between Pennsylvania and New Jersey insofar as it distinguishes between “compensation” and “net profits”.</p>

Between 1971 and 1977, the Appellant paid the Pennsylvania personal income tax. In 1978, he filed a personal income tax return reporting a net profit of $33,798.91 but asserting no tax liability. Appellant argued that pursuant to the Reciprocal Personal Income Tax Agreement between Pennsylvania and New Jersey he, as a non-resident, was exempt from the tax. Successive petitions for review to the Department of Revenue Board of Appeals and the Board of Finance and Review resulted in the sustaining of the assessment for a tax deficiency.</p>

The agreement provides that persons who reside in one state and are employed in the other may file certificates of non-residence with their employers and thereby exempt themselves from filing returns and paying personal income taxes on compensation paid in the state where they are employed. Employers receiving such certificates of non-residence are obligated to withhold income tax at the rate appropriate for the residence state of the employees and to remit the taxes so collected to that state. The agreement further provides that nothing in it “shall be interpreted to exempt a resident of Pennsylvania or New Jersey who has taxable income in the Commonwealth or State of non-residence <em>other than in the form of compensation </em>from liability for payment of income tax or filing an income tax return with regard to such other taxable income.”</p>

The mere assertion that there is no justification for the distinction between wage earners and self-employed persons cannot be considered sufficient to meet the challenger’s heavy burden of proof. Neither is it sufficient to present, as Appellant does, one or two examples of the different results accruing to different persons because of the legislative classification. Different results <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>are the necessary product of statutory differentiation. It is only where the legislative scheme is based on distinctions irrelevant to the statutory purpose and affects related objects of the legislation differently that the scheme can be said to be irrational.</p>
    <p id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[243,560,1158,881]]]'>. We need not search long and hard to recognize a rational basis for the challenged legislation. A worker receiving compensation has little choice about where he earns his income. The business entity by which he is employed and from which he derives compensation determines the location where his skills and labor will be put to use. The interests in promoting interstate commerce and economic comity between separate sovereigns provide ample reason for the policy of treating interstate commuters as though their income was earned in the state of their residence rather than in the state of their employment. A person operating a business from which he derives net profits is not similarly situated. As the proprietor of the business he has the freedom to locate at a place of his own choice. The tax consequences of earning profits in a state other than the state of his residence must be considered as factors entering into his business decision to so locate.</p>
    <p id="b394-6" data-blocks='[["BL_394.5",394,[239,1460,1156,876]],["BL_395.1",395,[221,290,1150,141]]]'>The ease of administration in collecting and reporting personal income tax withholding money adds to the rational basis for this statute. Without the interstate agreement each New Jersey resident receiving compensation in Pennsylvania would have tax money withheld from his pay at the Pennsylvania rate. He would then be required to annually file a Pennsylvania tax return in which he claimed non-residence and a full refund of money withheld. He would also be required to file a New Jersey tax return in which he reported his full income to New Jersey taxing authorities and pay the appropriate New Jersey tax. A similar scenario would apply in the case of all Pennsylvania residents working in New Jersey. Under the statute, however, this entire process is simplified by allowing the employer to withhold not at the rate of the state where it is located, but at the rate of the employee’s residence state. The employee is thus exempted from filing, and the authorities are re<a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>lieved of the burden of processing returns for refunds in the employing-state and separate returns for payment in the residence-state.</p>
    <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[219,457,1153,835]]]'>By contrast, in the case of an individual earning net profits there is no withholding of either Pennsylvania or New Jersey tax. The responsibility for ensuring that the tax is collected (paid) lies not with an employer but with the taxpayer himself. The requisite forms for reporting the manner in which money was earned, the taxable status of that money, and appropriate credits, if any, for taxes paid on that money to another jurisdiction, will be the same regardless of the residence and business addresses of such a person. Rational decision-making does not mandate that by choosing to relieve the administrative burdens of a large number of taxpayers who are not in the first instance required to ensure collection of taxes, the Commonwealth must also reduce the administrative burdens encountered by a much smaller group who are primarily responsible for “collecting” and reporting their own taxes.</p>

    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[235,987,1157,1025]]]'>Thus, the majority has failed to establish that the classification is reasonable, for there is no significant difference between a person who pays taxes on wages and one who pays taxes on income from a business. The majority has also failed to establish that the classification rests upon a difference in the classes which has a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. The only differences in the classes, according to the majority, is that one class pays installments on its Pennsylvania tax liability which are withheld by its employers, and the other pays its tax liability at the end of the year and bears the responsibility of paying its own taxes. Absent the reciprocal agreement with New Jersey, members of both classes would file Pennsylvania tax forms at the end of the year. Regardless of what the object of the legislation is, therefore, the majority must needs fail to establish the second prong of the test articulated in <em>Snider v. Thornburgh, </em>supra, (that the classification rests upon a difference having an important relationship to the object of the legislation) for there is no essential difference between the classes.</p>

    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[213,472,1153,828]]]'>The flaw in these responses is that while the Commonwealth has given reasons for entering into the reciprocal agreement, not all of those reasons are relevant to the question of whether it is reasonable to exclude some classes of income earners and include others in a separate class subject to different tax burdens. Comity between the state (# 1), orderly operations (# 2), and easing the burdens on taxpayers (# 4), for example, have nothing to do with whether there is a reasonable distinction between the classes of self-employed and non self-employed which explains their difference in treatment. Such concerns may have to do with whether it is desirable for the Commonwealth <em>to have a reciprocal income tax agreement </em>with New Jersey, but they have nothing to do with whether there are differences between the groups of taxpayers <em>which justify the difference </em>in tax treatment.</p>

    <p id="b399-7" data-blocks='[["BL_399.6",399,[211,1639,1153,719]]]'>Even reasons (# 3) and (# 5) are not, however, self-evidently valid justifications of differential treatment. The argument that employees and employers utilize W-2 forms which can be reconciled and which can be used to enforce reporting requirements is, without more, not an argument at all, but merely a description of the fact that W-2 forms are utilized for one group of persons and not for another. Without explanation, we have no idea of the significance of the fact that one group of taxpayers files W-2 forms and the other does not: this fact may be of extreme importance, of some importance, or of no importance at all for Commonwealth enforcement efforts. We are not told how reconciliation works or how W-2 forms enhance enforcement or reporting requirements.</p>

I would conclude, therefore, that even though Section 7356 specifically authorizes the exemption of compensation from Pennsylvania income tax, its terms are broad enough to include, as well, an exemption for net profits.</p>
