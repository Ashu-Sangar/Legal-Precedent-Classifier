They also indicated that they might challenge the validity of the Ordinance. After a hearing on the special exception issue, the Zoning Hearing Board ruled that appellees had not established their entitlement to a special exception. Appellees filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County, claiming that the Zoning Hearing Board erred in denying the special exception. They also challenged the validity of the Ordinance. By agreement of the parties and before the court of common pleas heard argument on the matter, the Zoning Hearing Board held a hearing on appellees constitutional challenge to the Ordinance. At this latter hearing, it was stipulated that all of the technical requirements of the Ordinance with respect to setback, lot size, rear yard, etc. imposed in Agricultural/Rural Residential districts for a single family detached dwelling would be met by the appellees’ plans to <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>situate the home on their lot.

However, the court did find merit in the constitutional challenge, and held that the Township cannot forbid mobile homes on individual lots, a legitimate use, without demonstrating that they are harmful to the health, safety and welfare of the community. Since the Township had made no attempt to so justify its general prohibition of such use, the Ordinance was held unconstitutional and the decision of the North Whitehall Township Zoning Hearing Board was reversed.</p>

Pillars would be placed at the end of the structure to anchor it to the ground. He planned to put skirting around the home and plant shrubbery around the front. (Transcript 7/13/82, at 16-17.) He planned to remove the wheels and the hitch from the home once located at the proposed site. In addition, the home would have its own connections for water, sewer, electricity and telephone.

While the majority might be correct that the Township’s zoning distinction between the placement of mobile homes on individual lots, a prohibited use, and the placement of sectional or modular homes on individual lots, a permitted use, is an arbitrary and capricious distinction, I am uncomfortable with this “different analysis” because nowhere has it been espoused by the parties to this proceeding or by the lower courts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
      <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>Throughout these proceedings, from the Zoning Hearing Board proceedings to briefs and oral argument before this Court, the Geigers, appellees, have challenged the constitutionality of the zoning ordinances on the grounds that the prohibition of mobile homes on individual lots was a total exclusion of a legitimate use and that this exclusion coupled with allowance of mobile homes in mobile home parks created an arbitrary and capricious classification, which classification did not bear a substantial relationship to the health, safety or welfare of the community. Throughout these proceedings, the appellant Township has responded to <em>this challenge. </em>In its brief before this Court, the Township summarizes its position, stating:</p>
    <blockquote id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[269,1026,1109,593]]]'>The Geigers have not met their heavy burden of proving that the Township Zoning Ordinance is unconstitutional insofar as it restricts mobile homes to mobile home parks. This regulation is neither exclusionary, arbitrary, unreasonable, nor confiscatory, but rather reflects proper considerations of the public health, safety, and general welfare. The Township recognizes and provides for the usage of “mobile homes” in its Zoning Ordinance; its general limitation of mobile homes to groupings of them in mobile home parks is a legitimate and reasonable regulation of that use.</blockquote>

North Whitehall Township cannot forbid mobile homes on individual lots, a clearly legitimate use, without demonstrating that they are harmful to the health, safety and <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>welfare of the community.

    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[255,424,1156,418]]]'>On appeal to Commonwealth Court, the Township argued that the court of common pleas erred in finding that mobile homes on individual lots were a separate and distinct use from mobile homes in parks, a finding which had the effect of shifting the burden to the Township to demonstrate the justifications for such a distinction. In affirming the lower court, President Judge James Crumlish, Jr., writing for the majority, stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[296,857,1111,249]]]'>This is a case of first impression before this Court.

North Whitehall Township provides specifically for the development of mobile home parks, yet totally excludes mobile home placement on individual lots. The only provision for mobile homes on individual lots stems from a restrictive special exception to the total ban by the Township. Although not specific, the zoning ordinance effectively excludes mobile homes on individual lots in the municipality by restricting the use of mobile homes to mobile home parks____ We hold that this token special <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>exception is <em>equivalent to a total prohibition of mobile homes on individual lots, a legitimate land use. </em>“When it is demonstrated that an ordinance entirely excludes a facially legitimate use, the presumption of validity is rebutted; and the municipality must then present evidence to establish that its regulation bears a relationship to the public health, safety and welfare.” (citations omitted)</blockquote>
    <p id="b307-4" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[230,736,1153,902]]]'>I agree with the lower courts that the Township’s ban on placement of mobile homes on individual lots is equivalent to a total exclusion shifting the burden to the Township to demonstrate the requisite nexus (substantial relationship) between the classification created by its ordinances and the public health, safety and welfare. Moreover, even if we accepted the Township’s argument that there was not a total exclusion sufficient to rebut the presumption of constitutionality and shift the burden to the Township, appellees would still prevail because they presented sufficient, competent evidence to demonstrate that the classification was arbitrary and capricious in that it did not bear a substantial relationship to the public health, safety and welfare. In either event, the burden became the Township’s to demonstrate legitimate justifications for the classifications created by the ordinance and challenged by appellees, and the Township utterly failed to carry that burden.</p>
