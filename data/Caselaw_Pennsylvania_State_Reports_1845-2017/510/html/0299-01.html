      <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>The Commonwealth could not establish actual possession; its case relied upon constructive possession. Constructive possession is a somewhat vague and esoteric concept. “The purpose of the constructive possession doctrine is to expand the scope of possession statutes to encompass those cases where actual possession at the time of arrest cannot be shown but where the inference that there has been actual possession is strong.” Whitebread and Stevens, <em>To Have and To Have Not, </em>58 U.Va.L.Rev. 751, 755 (1972). We have held that constructive possession exists if an individual has “conscious dominion” over the illegal property. <em>Commonwealth v. Chenet, </em><a href="/pa/473/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="473 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1730250" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0181-01">473 Pa. 181</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="473 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1730250" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0181-01">373 A.2d 1107</a> (1977); <em>Commonwealth v.

Constructive possession by its nature is not amenable to “bright line” tests. We have held, therefore, that it may be established by the totality of the circumstances. <em>Commonwealth v. Macolino, </em><a href="/pa/503/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="503 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1785926" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0201-01">503 Pa. 201</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="503 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1785926" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0201-01">469 A.2d 132</a> (1983); <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[224,1475,1154,571]]]'>In our judgment, the instant case is controlled by <em>Macolino, <a href="/pa/503/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="503 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1785926" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0201-01">supra</a></em>

      <em> </em>In that case, police officers entered the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Macolino. They found a large quantity of cocaine in their bedroom closet. A device for packaging cocaine, an electronic eavesdropping detector and drug books were also found in the bedroom. Several containers of Manitol, a cocaine cutting agent, were found in the attic. We held that joint control will not prevent a finding of constructive possession in one of the individuals and that the factfinder could have concluded that appellee exercised conscious dominion over the cocaine.</p>

On these facts, as in <em>Macolino, </em>a jury can find the conscious dominion from which constructive possession is inferred. Although the family’s rented motel room in this case poses a factual distinction with the more permanent residence involved in <em>Macolino, </em>we think the effect of that distinction, as part of the total circumstances, is for the jury to determine.

The majority states that “[i]n <em>Macolino, </em>we also held that constructive possession <em>may </em>be inferred if the contraband is located in an area under the joint exclusive control of the defendant and his spouse.” Slip opinion at 4 (emphasis added). This language from <em>Commonwealth v.

It means only that the inference is not prohibited under the circumstances, not that the inference follows from those circumstances. As I noted in my dissenting opinion in <em>Mudrick, </em>we were careful in <em>Macolino </em>to weigh “other evidence sufficient to establish a link between” the defendant and the contraband along with the evidence of joint control. In the absence of such other evidence tending to prove intent to control the contraband, I cannot agree that the Commonwealth has met its burden of proving all material elements of the offense charged beyond <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>a reasonable doubt. Accordingly I would affirm the Order of the Superior Court.</p>
