The defendant involved is Salvatore Chimenti. He was convicted by a jury of first degree murder after a trial presided over by the Honorable Lisa A. Richette of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. Subsequently, Mr. Chimenti dismissed his trial counsel, and hired new counsel to pursue his post-trial motions. These motions were de<a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>nied by Judge Richette. Prior to this denial however, Mr. Chimenti dismissed his post-trial counsel and retained his present appellate counsel.</p>

These allegations included claims that Mr. Chimenti’s trial counsel acted contrary to his best interests by suborning perjury from certain witnesses. The district attorney was intrigued by these allegations and was convinced that they had merit, so much so that Mr. Chimenti’s counsel was able to strike a deal with the Commonwealth which would vacate the first degree murder conviction in return for Mr. Chimenti’s cooperation in a police investigation and prosecution. The terms of the deal were incorporated into a petition, the import of which provided:</p>

Unless the district attorney is suggesting that a guilty plea could ever be blindly accepted by a hearing judge, it must be admitted that someone conducted an inquiry into the circumstances of defendant’s plea. Since on remand the “special assignment” judge was given no option of avoiding Judge Spaeth’s command, the only person who conducted any inquiry was Judge Spaeth himself.

Counsel for Mr. Chimenti and for the Philadephia District Attorney’s Office opted to rephrase the issue so as to introduce superfluous matters relating to the general appellate powers of the Superior Court: a license which we do not appreciate. There is, however, so much wrong here, more adds little.</p>

The odious nature of Judge Spaeth’s proceedings is the antithesis of American jurisprudence. Star Chamber proceedings were abolished in antiquity and any attempt to resurrect them should not be condoned by this Court. The dispensing of injustice is always in the right hands.

In a setting painfully reminiscent of the Star-Chamber, abolished now for centuries, the chief administrative judicial officer of superior court, at the urging of qua conspiratorial, yet antithetical, counsel sought to bring about the early release of a convicted murderer in exchange for testimony that might form the basis of subornation of perjury charges against the convicted murderer’s trial counsel.</p>

Although Judge Richette impermissibly injected herself into the fray as a litigant by filing with us a formal petition (trial judges must never be litigants in cases over which they preside), I view her efforts as coming from a lack of direction by our Court to lower court judges who wish to bring matters of serious judicial concern to our attention. In my opinion, a simple letter to us would suffice.</p>
