The following excerpts from the Chancellor’s opinion make clear his basis for the finding of liability.</p>
    <blockquote id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.7",262,[292,895,1110,194]]]'>It is plaintiff’s [appellant’s] position that the lease was in full force and effect and that as such defendants [appellees] were bound to restore all utilities in a reasonable time.</blockquote>

    <p id="b262-6" data-blocks='[["BL_262.9",262,[249,1172,1153,195]]]'>After considering a provision that terminated the lease if the damage was such that, “... the same cannot be repaired or restored within a reasonable time...”, the court continued as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b262-7" data-blocks='[["BL_262.10",262,[290,1390,1112,202]]]'>The court has found that the lease specifically spelled out the causes for the termination of the lease. Those conditions were not met. Therefore, the lease remains in force against both parties.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b262-8" data-blocks='[["BL_262.11",262,[289,1606,1112,362]],["BL_263.1",263,[237,319,1096,368]]]'>We must now consider what were the obligations of the defendants under the lease. The lease gives the Lessor the option to repair notwithstanding the damage by giving notice to the tenant of his intention to do so within thirty (30) days of its notice of the damage or destruction. No such notice was given. Clearly the restoration was not completed within thirty (30) days or by any period <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>that might be considered reasonable. Under our law and the terms of the lease, the building was not so destroyed as to terminate the lease. As the lease remained in force, the landlord was obligated to continue to provide the services as agreed in the lease. The failure to do so was not because it could not, but rather the defendants chose not to make repairs.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b263-4" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[237,702,1098,527]]]'>Attention must now turn to the failure of the defendants to provide the services required under the lease. The lease would have excused the defendants if the reason for the interruption of the services were due to the repairs. However the failure was not due to repairs or restoration. The defendants have shown no valid excuse for their failure, except the argument that the building was too costly to repair. They are therefore in breach of the lease agreement and the question presented is the measure of damages for that breach.</blockquote>
    <p id="b263-5" data-blocks='[["BL_263.5",263,[194,1249,1141,416]]]'>It is therefore clear that the theory of liability sustained by the trial court was that of assumpsit for appellant’s failure to perform in accordance with the terms of the lease. Clause 11(a) is therefore clearly not applicable. The Order of the Superior Court should be reversed and the matter remanded to that court to address the remaining issues. <em>See </em><a href="/pa-super/335/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="335 Pa.

However, I do not believe that either is applicable here under the meaning of the term “demised premises” in this lease.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> The lease <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>seems to define the demised premises as “third floor in building No. 12, as outlined in the attached plan.” If this is correct, neither paragraph 11 nor 12 would be applicable.</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[230,482,1156,1238]]]'>Paragraph 12 of the lease permits the lessor to terminate the lease if the demised premises have been “destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty.” The fire occurred in Building No. 1. If the demised premises were confined to Building 12, which was not damaged, lessor’s right to terminate would not arise. Applying the same definition of “demised premises,” I believe that paragraph 11 of the lease is likewise inapplicable here. That paragraph “relieves the lessor from all liability by reason of any injury or damage to any person or property in the demised premises[.]” There was no injury or damage to property in the demised premises, if defined as Building 12; only lessee’s business was damaged. Paragraph 12 further requires that the injury or damage be “caused by any fire, breakage or leakage in any part or portion of the demised premises, or any part or portion of the <em>building </em>of which the demised premises is a part” (emphasis supplied). The fire occurred in a different building than the demised premises; therefore, this clause cannot relieve the lessor of liability. Paragraph 34 which merely limits paragraph 11 is, accordingly, also of no moment. Nevertheless, I do not believe it is necessary to remand for consideration of the meaning of demised premises; I believe that Common Pleas’ liability finding is supportable on other grounds.</p>
    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.6",264,[228,1738,1153,513]],["BL_265.1",265,[213,292,1152,298]]]'>To me, the determinative issue is what the law of contracts supposes the parties agreed upon concerning the supply of electricity, heat and water in the event of their disruption. The lease does not speak on this issue. Should we suppose an agreement that these services would be provided unconditionally or instead an understanding that they would be provided from the existing plant in Building No. 1? If the agreement was for an unconditional supply of these services, the lessor is clearly in breach. On the other hand, if continuing service from the existing central <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>plant was assumed by the parties, we must consider whether the lessor’s non-performance would be excused by the doctrine of impossibility or frustration. Under that legal concept, the lessor’s failure to provide continuing service also results in a breach on the facts found by Common Pleas.</p>
    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[211,615,1155,1415]]]'>Under Pennsylvania law, impossibility excuses non-performance if, through no fault of either party, the subject matter of the agreement has been destroyed. <em>West v. Peoples First National Bank &amp; Trust, </em><a href="/pa/378/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="378 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="1250884" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0275-01">378 Pa. 275</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.2d%20427" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="106 A.2d 427">106 A.2d 427</a> (1954). In this case, Common Pleas determined that the destruction of the plant in Building No. 1 was caused by lessor’s fault; its negligence caused the fire. This finding is supported by the evidence, which shows that lessor failed to maintain the level of security in effect at the beginning of the lease and generally allowed the condition of the premises to deteriorate. Thus, lessor’s non-performance is not excused by impossibility and the lessee is entitled to damages for breach of contract. The lease is a contract. With some exceptions not material here, the usual contract measure of damages applies. <em>Pugh v. Holmes, </em><a href="/pa-super/253/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="253 Pa.

The damages recoverable for breach of contract are those which will, as nearly as possible, put the injured party in the same position it would have been in had the contract been fully performed. <em>Maxwell v. Schaefer, </em><a href="/pa/381/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="381 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="1258907" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0013-01">381 Pa. 13</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%2069" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="112 A.2d 69">112 A.2d 69</a> (1955). They are measured by the difference between the rental in the breached lease and the rental the lessee would have to pay at current market for equivalent alternate premises during the remaining term of the lease, plus reasonable relocation expenses and demonstrable profits lost because of business interruption resulting from the necessity of relocating.</p>
