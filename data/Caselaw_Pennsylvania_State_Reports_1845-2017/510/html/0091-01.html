It was announced that because the Board was unable to meet the next day (Friday, June 22, 1984) the hearing could not be resumed until the following week. This presented a conflict with the schedule of counsel for McCrackin and he requested a continuance. Prior to a continuance being granted both parties were advised that each would have to waive the provisions of Board of Vehicles Act (Section 818.7) which provides that a “final determination” must be made by the Board within 120 days after the filing of a protest. Subsequently, both sides agreed to waive the 120 day rule with Ford attaching a proviso that its waiver was conditioned upon the case being decided by August 15, 1984. This limiting provision was communicated to the Board in a telephone conversation and a confirming letter. McCrackin alleges that it was not informed of this proposed limitation until July 23, 1984 at a preliminary conference two days <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>before the hearing was resumed. When the reconvened hearing was concluded (July 27, 1984), Ford agreed to extend its waiver limitation to August 31, 1984.
