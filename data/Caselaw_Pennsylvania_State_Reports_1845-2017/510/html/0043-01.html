Appellant waived trial by jury at both the guilt stage and the sentencing stage, electing instead to be tried by the Hon. Juanita Kidd Stout, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia.</p>

The factual history is complicated. At approximately 1:00 a.m. on May 5, 1981, Pablo Ortiz, the victim in this case, was visited at his home by Carlos Tirado and Miquel Pirela, the brother of appellant. The three young men left the home of Ortiz and “shot” heroin. When Pirela became ill, Ortiz and Tirado delivered Pirela to his home. Pirela’s wife testified that when she awoke on the morning of May 5, her husband was dead. Although all three men had used heroin from the same source and the same appliances, only Miquel Pirela <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>died. The cause of Pirela’s death was determined to be a drug overdose, achieved through non-homicidal means.</p>

    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[209,622,1153,839]]]'>Gilberto Giraud Romero, who was also charged in connection with the murder of Pablo Ortiz, testified for the Commonwealth against appellant and his two co-defendants. Romero testified that on May 6, the day after Miquel Pirela’s death, at about 1:00 p.m., he went to his sister’s home. There both appellant and his brother, Heriberto Pirela, announced their intentions to kill Pablo Ortiz. Approximately 20 minutes later Ortiz joined the men. Both Pirela brothers inflicted a brutal beating upon Ortiz who was struck by fists and by a tire which was mounted on a rim. Ortiz was then pushed into the basement of the house where the beating continued. Eventually, Heriberto Pirela instructed Carlos Tirado to inject Ortiz with battery acid, or face death himself. While appellant and Pedro Torres held Ortiz’s hands, the injection was accomplished. Ortiz became unconscious.</p>

Appellant warned Carlos Tirado that if Pablo Ortiz did not die, appellant would kill Tirado. While Romero drove the automobile, Tirado strangled Ortiz with a pair of socks. Romero was warned by appellant that if he “ratted” on appellant, appellant would kill him. The families of Romero and Tirado were also threatened. Much of Romero’s testimony was corroborated by Carlos Tirado who testified on his own behalf.</p>
    <p id="b111-7" data-blocks='[["BL_111.7",111,[210,2028,1152,312]]]'>Appellant admitted hitting Pablo Ortiz in the course of questioning Ortiz as to the cause of Miquel Pirela’s death.

The theory advanced by appellant was that the homicide was conceived by either Tirado or Romero and executed by Carlos Tirado to advance some personal interest of either Tirado’s or Romero’s. Furthermore, appellant continues to argue on this appeal that he did not commit the fatal assault, did not attempt to kill and did not intend to kill Pablo Ortiz. These arguments are grounded on the fact that appellant was not present when the strangulation occurred. Notwithstanding this apparent conflict in defense strategies, however, we will address the propriety of such verdicts on the evidence presented below.</p>

In <em>Berry, </em>we recognized that a reasonable man might become so impassioned that he would kill where he arrives upon the scene within seconds of an attack upon his mother, finds her prostrate on the ground, and hears from her the account of her attack. We stated: “The threatened or immediate <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>infliction of serious injury upon a parent, spouse or child because of the relationship of the parties and the expected concern of one for the well being of the other, has occasioned courts to hold this conduct may be sufficient provocation to reduce the killing to voluntary manslaughter.” <em>Id,., </em><a href="/pa/461/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="461 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="483734" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0233-01">461 Pa. at 238</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="461 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="483734" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0233-01">336 A.2d at 264</a>. Certainly, <em>immediate </em>infliction of serious injury upon a sibling is conduct that might provoke in a reasonable man such sudden passion that would reduce the degree of guilt to voluntary manslaughter. However, the instant case does not present the kind of <em>immediacy of harm </em>and resultant <em>sudden passion </em>relative to the time of the homicide provoked thereby as could reduce the degree of guilt to voluntary manslaughter.</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[210,998,1152,636]]]'>Pablo Ortiz, Carlos Tirado and Miquel Pirela shot heroin sometime after 1:30 a.m. on May 5. Miquel Pirela was taken home in the early morning hours on the same day. When his wife awoke around 9 a.m., she found Miquel Pirela had died. The attack upon Pablo Ortiz, unquestionably the result of the death of Miquel Pirela, occurred after noon on May 6 — more than 24 hours after Miquel Pirela’s death. Thus, the death of Miquel was not immediate with respect to appellant’s attack upon Pablo Ortiz. Nor, in view of the lapse of time between the two events, could appellant have attacked Pablo Ortiz out of a <em>sudden </em>passion resulting from Miquel’s death.</p>

Under the law in effect when Stewart was prosecuted, there were only two degrees of murder. Murder of the first degree encompassed criminal homicides accomplished by poison, by lying in wait or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, as well as homicides committed during the attempt, perpetration or flight after commission of any of certain designated felonies. Murder of the second degree encompassed all other kinds of murder. In 1974, the statute defining the various degrees of murder was amended. Act of March 26, 1974, P.L. 213, No. 46, since amended. Since 1974, murder of the first degree is committed by an intentional killing; murder of the second degree is “felony murder” and murder of the third degree encompasses “[a]ll other kinds of murder.” Appellant’s reliance upon <em>Stewart </em>
      <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>indicates appellant would not have us find his actions constitute murder of the second degree which is felony murder but murder of the third degree under the present statute.</p>
    <p id="b116-5" data-blocks='[["BL_116.4",116,[248,465,1156,631]]]'>Appellant’s argument that his degree of guilt can rise no higher than murder of the third degree is based upon his contention that the homicide of Pablo Ortiz was committed in such a state of intense rage that necessarily negates the existence of the intent to kill which is required for a conviction of murder of the first degree. However, appellant had been proclaiming his intention to kill Pablo Ortiz for more than 24 hours prior to Ortiz’s slaying. There is ample evidence in the record that Pablo Ortiz died by a willful, deliberate and premeditated killing and appellant’s conviction for murder of the first degree will not be set aside.</p>

Secondly, reasonably considering the comment in the context in which it was made, it appears not <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>to constitute a “guarantee” that appellant would not be sentenced to death under any circumstances, but only if the evidence proved the facts to be as represented by defense counsel during his motion. In other words, the court’s response amounted to an admonition that the motion was premature, and should the evidence prove as defense counsel predicted, appellant would not be sentenced to death by that tribunal. The court’s choice of words was, perhaps, unfortunate, but, in what appears to be the informal atmosphere of this exchange, words were obviously not spoken out of regard to their manner of appearance on the cold record at a later time.</p>
    <p id="b118-5" data-blocks='[["BL_118.4",118,[238,942,1157,734]]]'>Moreover, the record contains additional support for the conclusion that the court’s statement could not have lulled appellant into waiving his right to a jury. Immediately prior to commencement of the penalty phase of the trial, the prosecutor inquired of the court whether she possessed any “conscientious, philosophical objections which would prevent [her] from imposing the death penalty in a proper case.” To this query, the court replied: “I have no conscientious and philosophical objections, but mine doesn’t matter. I will follow the law as I see it. ... I will also tell you now that I will not impose a death penalty on all of them.

Appellant also argued that none of the purposes of sentencing, to-wit, rehabilitation, deterrence, quarantine or retribution would be accomplished by imposition of the death penalty in this case, as appellant was already under imposition of one life sentence and one death sentence for the two homicides mentioned supra. The Court found one aggravating circumstance, that appellant had been “convicted of another ...

Prior to the trial in the matter sub judice, appellant had been convicted of the April, 1980 murder of Julio Cruz and the August, 1982 murder of Jorge Figuroa. Appellant argued the conviction for Figuroa’s homicide, which was perpetrated after the murder of Pablo Ortiz, should not be considered as part of a “signifi<a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>cant history of felony convictions” for the purpose of imposing the death penalty in the instant case. The lower court agreed. Nevertheless, appellant now argues his counsel was ineffective in failing to object when certain references to the Figuroa homicide were made, failing to ask for a jury at sentencing after the court was advised of the conviction for the murder of Jorge Figuroa, and failing to ask for a mistrial when, over objection, the prosecutor introduced evidence of the objected to homicide conviction at the sentencing hearing. The record clearly shows that the court disregarded the Figuroa homicide when she imposed sentence. Once again, it cannot be concluded that the alternatives not chosen offered a substantially greater potential for success than the tactics actually utilized.
