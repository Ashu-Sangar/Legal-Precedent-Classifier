Remp, was arrested on May 23, 1981 and charged with criminal homicide, murder and aggravated assault in connection with the stabbing death of a Berks County man. After an initial consultation with appellee, defense counsel went to the Berks County mental health facility and requested that a psychiatrist at the facility evaluate appellee. Pursuant to that request, on August 10, 1981, appellee was seen by one Dr. Larry Rotenberg who submitted a report to defense counsel. Subsequently, on August 12, 1981, seeking further evaluation, defense counsel filed in the Berks County Court of Common Pleas an application for leave to employ a psychiatrist and/or psychologist.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Commonwealth’s answer stated that it had no objection to appellee’s application and, on September 2, <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>1981, the application was granted.

The Court noted that an appellate court, in reviewing such a ruling, should consider the nature of the crime and its surrounding circumstances in deciding whether the denial of the requested continuance was an abuse of the trial court’s discretion. The criteria established by the Court to determine whether the trial court’s discretion was properly exercised are: (1) the necessity of the missing witness to strengthen the defendant’s case; (2) the essentiality of the witness to defendant’s defense; (3) the diligence exercised to procure his presence at trial; (4) the facts to which he could testify; and (5) the likelihood that he could be produced at the next term of court. Applying these criteria to the record in this case, I conclude <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>that the order entered by the trial court was fully justified and constituted an appropriate exercise of the discretion vested in the trial judge.</blockquote>

Although an initial evaluation of [appellee] had been made by Dr. Rotenberg, no report, oral or written, of the evaluation was given by his counsel to the trial court for its consideration in passing on the motion. [Defense] counsel conceded that he was requesting the continuance because of a <em>‘possibility </em>’ that the doctor <em>‘might </em>’ desire to reevaluate [appellee] and because counsel would like ‘to seek’ the doctor’s advice. There was absolutely no information provided to the trial court as to what the doctor’s testimony <em>might </em>have been. The reasons given for the late request amount to pure speculation.</blockquote>

It does not even appear that, after the appointment, he attempted to contact the doctor prior to appearing before the court at 11:41 a.m. on Monday morning to commence selection of the jury. The trial court, after considering the motion, recessed court until after 1:30 p.m. that day, and it does not appear that any effort was made to substantiate [appellee’s] ‘hope’ or ‘expectation’ that further evaluation or consultation with the doctor would assist in [appellee’s] defense. Finally, although we do not have any information regarding the doctor’s initial evaluation, it is noteworthy that in response to [appellee’s] notice of an insanity defense the Commonwealth, as was its right, listed Dr. Rotenberg as a rebuttal witness. The evidence of record in this case, then, is totally devoid of the remotest suggestion that [appellee] was (1) incompetent to stand trial or (2) ‘insane’ at the time of the commission of the homicide. In addition, <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>there is no indication of any evidence available to support such claims. Thus, [appellee] has failed to meet his burden of showing that Dr. Rotenberg was, or even might be, necessary or essential to his defense.</blockquote>

On the contrary, I do not view it to be the responsibility of the trial judge or the prosecutor, after the order of appointment was signed, to contact the doctor and make arrangements for any further evaluation. That was the responsibility of [defense] counsel. Nor do I agree that counsel should have been misled by the court’s order or that he ‘ <em>reasonably </em>relied’ on the order as effecting a continuance of the trial date previously scheduled. Furthermore, it appears that, even during trial and subsequent thereto, there has been no effort made to ascertain whether Dr. Rotenberg might “possibly” assist or benefit [appellee’s] defense. It is also important to note that prior to trial counsel did not object to the appointment of Dr. Rotenberg nor did he request the appointment of another or different doctor.</blockquote>

Although [appellee] did not present any evidence of insanity, he did present two defenses at his trial: (1) voluntary intoxication and (2) diminished capacity; both to establish the lack of a specific intent required for first degree murder and to reduce the crime, if any, to third degree murder. Both of these defenses were presented for the jury’s consideration by the trial judge in a charge to which no exception has been taken. The diminished capacity defense was based upon the testimony of Dr. Peter Howard Thomas, called by [appellee]. Dr. Thomas is a clinical psychologist and at the time of trial had an independent practice. Prior to that time, he had some consulting <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>relationships with the local hospital and school district as well as with the county Children and Youth Services. He had been practicing psychology in Pennsylvania for eight years. Even more importantly, Dr. Thomas had worked with [appellee] off and on for some seven years prior to the trial. Dr. Thomas had personal knowledge of [appellee] and his past experiences with mental health institutions. In fact, Dr. Thomas had seen [appellee] during the two week period prior to the commission of the homicide. Dr. Thomas diagnosed [appellee’s] condition as a ‘borderline personality.’ In response to a hypothetical question from [defense] counsel, the doctor expressed an opinion ‘with great certainty’ that [appellee] was highly vulnerable to acting out impulsively under stress accompanied by heavy drinking. The acting out would be impulsive, according to the doctor, and would be accompanied by a loss of control. The doctor further expressed the opinion, however, that he could <em>not </em>say ‘that there was no premeditation.’ On cross-examination, Dr. Thomas testified that [appellee], in his opinion, would know the difference between right and wrong at the time of the homicide. Thus, even [appellee’s] own expert, who had treated him over a period of years and was familiar with his condition, not only flatly contradicted any suggestion of insanity but he also failed to support his claim of diminished capacity to any great degree.</blockquote>

It is also true that the only recourse left to [appellee] was to defend against the charges on grounds of his mental capacity or incapacity. However, although [appellee] filed a notice of an insanity defense, he has not to this day presented one bit of evidence to support that claim. In fact, on the contrary, his own expert has refuted that claim. Additionally, the testimony by the witnesses who were present at the time of the stabbing and those who observed him later, including the officers who effected his arrest, overwhelmingly establishes his sanity on that evening. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Counsel presented him with nothing of substance to support the request. Nor did counsel request a limited continuance or recess during the course of the trial that lasted for a week. Moreover, subsequent events such as the testimony by [appellee’s] own expert and the failure to produce, even to this day, any substantiation of a claim of insanity or incapacity to stand trial bear out the fact that the trial court’s decision was a sound one reached after an appropriate exercise of the discretion vested in him.”</blockquote>

When I talked to Dr. Rotenberg on the telephone, he indicated to me that he had already evaluated your client and he would be happy to accept the appointment. Now, unless he is presently telling me, through you, that he needs additional time for further or reevaluations, I don’t <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>see any merit to your request for a continuance on that basis.</p>
