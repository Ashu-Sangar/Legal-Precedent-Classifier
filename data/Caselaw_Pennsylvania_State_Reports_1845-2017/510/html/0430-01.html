As plaintiffs below, appellees filed an original class action complaint with the Commonwealth Court seeking to have section 9902 of the Vehicle Code, the axle tax, declared unconstitutional. Appellees were certified to represent a class of plaintiffs consisting of all interstate motor carriers who own vehicles registered outside of Pennsylvania who are or will be subject to the axle tax, as well as a subclass of plaintiffs consisting of such interstate motor carriers who are registered in any of the states or provinces that are not members of the International Registration Plan. Appellants are the same public officials named as defendants in <em>American Trucking I </em>who are charged with the duty to administer and enforce the challenged legislation. <em>(See </em>note 7, <em>supra </em>and accompanying text). The axle tax was challenged as violative of: the Commerce Clause as discriminating against and unduly burdensome to interstate commerce; the Privileges and Immunities Clause; the Equal Protection Clause; and the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution. As in <em>American Trucking I, </em>the gravamen of most of these allegations is discrimination. Appellees have asserted <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>throughout these proceedings that the imposition of the $36 per axle tax upon all motor carrier vehicles, accompanied by Act 234’s simultaneous reduction in the Pennsylvania registration fees almost exactly offsetting the amount of the axle tax for Pennsylvania registered vehicles, was facially and actually discriminatory and imposed the full burden of the axle tax upon non-Pennsylvania registered interstate motor carriers. Complaint paras. 42, 43, 50, 52, 56. Appellees’ second principal contention was that Act 234 imposed an “unlawful burden” upon interstate motor carriers because the axle tax is a flat tax that is unrelated to the “volume, value or nature of the services provided by the Commonwealth” and is “wholly unrelated to the magnitude or nature of any benefit received by or conferred upon” interstate motor carriers.

The crux of appellants’ defense is and has been that Act 234, imposing the axle tax while reducing Pennsylvania registration fees, “effects a rational restructuring of Pennsylvania’s highway user charges” which increased the burden borne by those interstate motor carriers who had been least burdened before, <em>i.e., </em>those carriers who did not pay Pennsylvania’s substantial (higher than the national <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>average) registration fees. Thus, appellants argue that Act 234 does not discriminate against appellees and that, in fact, “local commerce” (Pennsylvania registered interstate motor carriers) bears more of the burden of Pennsylvania’s highway user fees than does “interstate commerce” (non-Pennsylvania registered interstate motor carriers).</p>

The marker fee clearly satisfies the first two elements of the <em>Complete Auto </em>test. It is applied to an activity — the use of Pennsylvania’s highways for interstate commerce — with a substantial nexus to Commonwealth. There is also no issue as to whether it is “fairly apportioned” between several taxing states each having a substantial nexus with the activity (as with a tax on gross sales receipts wherein two or more states have contributed to the sales and may each, therefore, lay claim to some portion of the receipts) because the activity taxed is a purely local event.

Appellees call this “deeming” a clever pretext insulating Pennsylvania registered vehicles from the impact of the marker fee. The Commonwealth Court accepted this argument based upon its finding that the word “deemed” as used in section 2101(b) was vague and ambiguous and its reliance upon the legislative history of Act 68 and its precursor, Senate Bill No. 10, from which it “divined” a discriminatory intent.

This subclass consisted of all interstate motor carriers whose vehicles were registered in any of the states or provinces with which Pennsylvania had entered into bilateral Apportioned Registration Agreements and whose vehicles were or would be subject to the $25.00 marker fee. Count VII of the complaint asserted, alternatively, that this subclass was being discriminated against because payment of the marker fee by its members, who also paid an apportioned Pennsylvania registration fee that was "deemed” to include that marker fee, amounted to payment in excess of the $25.00 marker fee. Refund of the excess was demanded. In April, 1982, the Department of Transportation announced that, because Pennsylvania registration fees were deemed to include the $25.00 marker fee, $25.00 was to be subtracted from the registration fees before they were apportioned. Refunds were ordered and have been made by the Commonwealth of the amounts in excess of $25.00 erroneously received from members of this subclass prior to April, 1982. Accordingly, Count VII of the complaint has been rendered moot and is not an issue in this appeal.</p>

Naturally, a state has a rational basis for exacting more fees from in-state-registered vehicles than from out-of-state registered vehicles. Thus, the majority’s revelation of the “operative fact” that Pennsylvania-registered vehicles are subject to $940.00 in registration fees which the foreign-registered, non-IRP counterparts are not subject to, comes as no startling surprise. The practical operation of Act 234, which does not restructure the entire Pennsylvania user fee system, does not serve to achieve equal treatment, rather it serves instead to shift an additional financial burden <em>only </em>upon interstate commerce.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The protectionist nature of this legislation is evident and cannot be ignored. Should every state impose such a tax to burden only out-of-state registered vehicles, the impact upon interstate commerce would indeed be crippling.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

This argument erroneously assumes that <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>the Commerce Clause analysis is somehow based upon the percentage of discrimination effected by the statute. <em>See Maryland v.
