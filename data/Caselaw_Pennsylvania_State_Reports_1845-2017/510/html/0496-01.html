    <p id="b564-7" data-blocks='[["BL_564.7",564,[217,1060,1157,802]]]'>Appellant asserts however, that because of the unique circumstances of this case a different result should occur. Appellant argues his notice of appeal was timely filed, by relying on Rule 108(a), Pa.R.A.P. which provides, in part, that the entry date of an order is the day “... the office of the government unit mails or delivers copies of the order to the parties....” Appellant received a copy of the September 24, 1985 order from appellee by letter dated October 28, 1985. Appellant asserts that he had ten days from the date on the letter, or until November 8, 1985, to file an appeal. The facts belie appellant’s position. Appellant filed his notice of appeal on October 24,1985, four days before the date of appellee’s letter. It is rather anomalous that appellant would appeal an order he did not think or know was yet “entered” on record.</p>

Appellant and his counsel were present on September 24, 1985 when the contempt finding was made and imprisonment imposed; a written order dated September 24, 1985 embodied the finding; and, the order was obviously effective as of that day. Clearly, September 24, 1985 was the day on which the order was “adopted” by the court and the date governing the beginning of the appeal period.</p>
    <p id="b565-5" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[220,944,1161,747]]]'>Appellant argues, in the alternative, that he was appealing a civil contempt order only affecting “the Appellant and not the Investigating Grand Jury” and therefore he had thirty days to appeal. Appellant’s Answer to Motion to Quash Appeal by Commonwealth, p. 1. Appellant is in error. Rule 3331 clearly governs appeals from a finding of civil contempt. The Note to Rule 3331 provides, in pertinent part, “This rule is intended to provide a simple and expeditious method for Supreme Court supervision of special prosecutions and investigations, <em>e.g. </em>orders of the supervising judge of an investigating grand jury, <em>findings of contempt (whether civil or </em>criminal)____” <em>Note, </em>Rule 3331, Pa.R.A.P.
