Appellant was tried before a jury with the Honorable Samuel W. Salus, II, of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, presiding. On January 18, 1983, Appellant was found guilty of murder of the first degree for the killings of Courtland Gross and Alexandra Gross, husband and wife, and their housekeeper, Catherine VanderVeur. Appellant was also found guilty of several related offenses. Immediately thereafter, a separate sentencing proceeding was commenced pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(a)(1),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> following which the jury determined that the Appellant be sentenced to death on each of the three murder of the first degree convictions. Formal sentencing was deferred pending the filing and disposition of post-trial motions. On June 17, 1983, the post-trial motions were <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>argued before a court <em>en banc </em>which denied same on October 13, 1983. Appellant was sentenced to three consecutive death sentences on the convictions of murder of the first degree, and concurrent sentences of ten to twenty years each on the burglary and robbery convictions on December 14, 1983. Sentence on each of the remaining convictions either merged or was suspended. This automatic appeal followed.</p>

On July 16, 1982, the bodies of Courtland Gross, aged seventy-nine years, his wife, Alexandra Gross, aged sixty-eight years, and their housekeeper, Catherine VanderVeur, aged sixty-nine years, were found shot to death at the Gross estate in Lower Merion Township, Villanova, Pennsylvania. It was determined that the three had died sometime during the mid-afternoon or evening of July 15, 1982. Courtland Gross’s body was found in an area above the cellar steps. He had been shot three times: once above the right heel, once in the abdomen, and once in the left cheek. Mrs. Gross’s body was found in the kitchen. She had been shot twice: once in the left elbow and once in the right eye. Mrs. VanderVeur’s body was found in a back bedroom tied to a chair by scarves. She had been shot once in the back of the head. Several of the rooms were in disarray. Drawers had been pulled out of cabinets in the bedrooms and bathrooms and their contents strewn about. A dropcloth on a safe in the basement had been pulled aside revealing its handles and the dial. Six bullets and six .380 cartridge casings were recovered from the bodies and the rooms where the bodies were found. There were no eyewitnesses to the killings. However, the prosecution was able to piece <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>together a complicated trail of circumstantial evidence which was the basis of Appellant’s convictions.</p>

He slightly damaged the left-front tire and lost the hubcap. On July 8, 1982, Dwyer sold the Skylark to Kelly. On July 10, 1982, Kelly lent the Skylark to Appellant, and the Walther PPK loaded with a full clip of ammunition. Dwyer testified that he saw both items in Appellant’s possession on July 10, 1982. He further stated that Appellant asked him to help commit robberies, specifically a “job on Pine Street” and a “place up Montgomery County” where Appellant would force people to “open the safe.” Dwyer declined.</p>

Appellant told La Motte he was driving a red Skylark which La Motte observed from his office window. Also on July 13, 1982, Appellant purchased fifty cartridges of 9mm Luger ammunition from Michael Bradford, assistant manager of Pearson’s Sporting Goods Store. This ammunition did not fit Appellant’s gun and Bradford recommended 9mm short (which is .380 caliber) ammunition. Appellant exchanged the ammunition and was issued a credit slip in the amount of $4.45. Appellant signed the required form but his signature was illegible. Bradford asked for Appellant’s driver’s license and printed Appellant’s name under the signature on the federal register.</p>

Antoinette Fucci Quinn and Nathan Cohn attended the store. After requesting several items, Appellant pulled a gun and <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>demanded that Ms. Quinn put the items, plus the contents of the cash register, into a paper shopping bag. Before Appellant left the store, he shot Nathan Cohn above the left ankle, saying, “I’m not playing around.” He told Ms. Quinn, “If anybody comes out here, I’ll blow your eyes out.” Appellant was observed by John Lyons leaving the shop with a paper shopping bag and speeding away in a red car. It was determined by ballistics experts that the two cartridge cases recovered from the store were ejected from the same gun that had ejected cartridges at the junkyard and the Gross estate.</p>

He noticed that the car was missing its left-front hubcap. On that same afternoon around the same time, Richard Kirkpatrick arrived at his home on Berks Road. He saw a red Skylark in his driveway. Upon entering his home, he was confronted by a man with a pistol, who ordered Kirkpatrick to turn around and then blindfolded him. The gunman said, “I’ve shot two other people, I’ll shoot you also. I’ll start with your leg and work up.” The gunman did not carry out this threat but he stole some of Mrs. Kirkpatrick’s jewelry and left. At the Kirkpatrick home, three cartridge casings were found, which were determined to have been ejected from the same pistol that ejected casings at the junkyard, the Good Scents Shop, and the Gross estate.</p>

This market is about 1.5 miles from the Gross estate. When her body was discovered on July 16, 1982, Mrs. Gross was wearing a flowered dress and a straw hat was near her head. Also, the brown sugar was found still in its paper bag on the kitchen counter. There was testimony at trial that the Grosses ran their house in a very neat and methodi<a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>cal way.

He asked to borrow La Motte’s car, a gray 1982 Datsun. When La Motte refused, Appellant said he had “just pulled a job” and he “had to go back and wipe off the fingerprints.” When asked why he could not use his own car, Appellant stated that the red Skylark was a stolen car and he did not want to get stopped by the police. When La Motte still refused, Appellant said, “Look, this is my life we’re talking about. I just wasted three people and I want your car.” La Motte testified that Appellant had a gun in the waistband of his jeans and told La Motte that he would be driving to Conshohocken, which exit from the Schuylkill Expressway is about 1.5 miles from the Gross estate. The Commonwealth produced testimony that it is possible to drive from La Motte’s office, at Fourth and Chestnut Streets, to La Motte’s house, at Eighth and Catherine Streets, and then to the Gross estate in thirty-six minutes observing the posted speed limits.</p>

At trial, Ms. Treat testified that he was nervous and crusty looking. Later that evening, at approximately 7:00 p.m., Appellant sold jewelry to Avrum Kay at Kay’s shop at 725 Sansom Street in Philadelphia.

Appellant told Miller he had killed people with a PPK and had thrown it into a lake or river. He also asked Miller if he had ever heard of the Gross family. Appellant offered Miller a St. Christopher money clip, which Miller later found in his car and put into his briefcase. Upon their return to Atlantic City, Appellant and Miller had several arguments over money and Appellant threatened to “get his PPK and come back and blow Miller away.” Miller traveled to Zurich on August 5, 1982, and while he was in Zurich, Eros Peter Simone observed the St. Christopher money clip in his briefcase.</p>

This Court has recognized three types<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> of inherently prejudicial materials which would obviate the need for a defendant to demonstrate actual juror prejudice. However, the trial judge determined that there was an absence of these types of materials. In support of the decision not to hold a pre-trial hearing on the change of venue motion, the trial judge set forth the following reasons: 1) fear that the hearing itself would contribute to the prejudicial publicity which was sought to be avoided; 2) a preference to focus on the actual effect of any publicity on individual jurors as revealed in the voir dire examination rather than speculate; 3) an absence of the three types of inherently prejudicial materials. The court determined that the pre-trial publicity was not so extensive so as to cause irreparable harm to the defendant; therefore, the motion was denied.</p>

On November 5, 1982, Appellant was advised by both the trial court and the district attorney that a possible conflict of interest existed in that his trial counsel had represented Avrum Kay in August, 1982. This representation took place when Kay was interrogated by the police regarding his purchase of stolen items from Appellant. Appellant was further advised that Kay would so testify at trial. Appellant now asserts that despite his election to retain his counsel and waive the conflict of interest, it was not a knowing waiver because he was not advised that Kay would testify that Appellant admitted to Kay that he owned a Walther PPK gun. We find no merit in this claim. While it is true that prejudice is presumed when counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest, this is so only if the defendant demonstrates that counsel “actively represented conflicting interests” and “that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer’s performance.” <em>Cuyler v.

An examination of the record reveals that the cross-examination of Lynch was not deficient or lacking in tactical purpose so as to warrant a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. Joseph La Motte testified that he lent Appellant his car on July 15, 1982, because Appellant told La Motte that “he had just wasted three people.” In a statement given by Lynch to the police, he stated that La Motte told him what Appellant said about wasting three people. Lynch’s testimony in this regard was excluded, <em>in limine, </em>as inadmissible hearsay. On cross-examination of Lynch, defense counsel elicited testimony that Appellant often borrowed La Motte’s car. Counsel already had a ruling that Lynch’s hearsay testimony would not be admitted. Armed with the benefit of this ruling, counsel’s strategy was sound in attempting to show that it was not unusual for Appellant to borrow La Motte’s car, and in attempting to impeach the testimony of both La Motte and <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>Lynch. The hearsay testimony was permitted on redirect to rebut a claim of recent fabrication on the part of La Motte, and because defense counsel had “opened the door” on cross-examination of Lynch. The cross-examination would have been extremely effective if the trial judge had not permitted the prosecution to go into the conversation that La Motte had with Lynch as to Appellant’s purpose in borrowing the car <em>that </em>day.

Appellant wished to show that La Motte had lied and had provided him with an alibi at a 1978 trial in which Appellant was convicted of arson. La Motte denied lying at the prior trial, and he has never been prosecuted for perjury following the 1978 trial. The mere fact that his testimony was contradicted at the 1978 trial by that of other witnesses is inconclusive. It was within the discretion of the trial judge to cease inquiry into the matter. We find that aside from this issue, the record reveals that defense counsel was permitted extensive cross-examination on discrepancies between La Motte’s various written statements and his in-court testimony.</p>

As to the question, “Have you been under the care of a psychiatrist?”, since defense counsel did not relate the question either to the time at which the events occurred, or to the time of trial, it was clearly irrelevant.</p>

It is clear from the record that there were no known “eyewitnesses” to the murders. We reject Appellant’s interpretation of who may be considered an eyewitness.

Dr. Kool’s testimony was offered to impeach the testimony of Franny Kelly, a Commonwealth witness, and an admitted user of Methaphetamine. The trial court refused the testimony on the ground that it was not sufficiently specific to be probative. We agree. Kelly was not a patient of Dr. Kool’s, nor did Dr. Kool ever examine him, or have personal knowledge of his drug use. Dr. Kool was not in possession of Kelly’s medical or psychological/psychiatric records.

In addition to the issues discussed in text pertaining to errors at trial, Appellant also alleged numerous other trial errors. These issues are: 1) the court erred in refusing to admit into evidence conflicting affidavits of Detective Natoli; 2) the court erred in refusing to remove a juror who was acquainted with one of the witnesses; 3) the court erred in denying Appellant’s request for instruction to the jury that second degree murder carries no death penalty; 4) the court erred in refusing to charge the jury on diminished capacity at the guilt phase of the trial; 5) the court erred in dismissing, for cause, a juror who was an out of county resident; 6) the court erred in admitting testimony of police officers as to the length of time it took to go from Fourth and Chestnut Streets to Eighth and Catherine Streets and back to the Gross residence; and 7) the trial court erred in refusing Appellant’s motion for a mistrial on the basis of prior non-disclosure of the testimony of a Commonwealth witness. There is no merit to any of these issues as they lack factual or legal foundation.</p>
