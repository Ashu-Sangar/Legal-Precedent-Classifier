The traditional view is that a prior statement of a witness is hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein. The orthodox rule deems hearsay generally, and prior inconsistent statements specifically, too unreliable to be admitted as substantive evidence because the declarant was (1) not under oath, (2) not subject to cross-examination at the time the statement was made, and (3) not in the presence of the trier of fact when the statement was made. <em>McCormick, supra </em>at § 251; <em>Wigmore, supra </em>at § 1018; <em>Graham, supra </em>at 1568.

Tina Traxler initially talked to state and local police on the afternoon of September 14, 1980. At that time, she told police that the car she and appellee had been riding in had gotten stuck in a ditch and that they had walked back to Sunbury past Wilson Manufacturing plant without entering the plant. She voluntarily rode with police out to the area to show them where she and appellee had walked.

As indicated, this statement admitted that she and appellee had entered the plant and that appellee had stabbed the security guard who had surprised appellee while attempting to pry open the dollar-bill change machine.

She testified that, at the plant, the police had asked her “leading” questions (e.g., “Is this where Tony Brady stabbed the guard?”) and that she had responded with yes/no answers. Her fears continued at the police station where, despite the presence of her attorney and her mother, she felt pressured and continued <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>to give the police what they wanted to hear, instead of the truth as she subsequently stated it at trial.

    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[244,537,1156,793]]]'>Although the concerns that the exclusion of the prior statement as substantive evidence would severely jeopardize the prosecution’s case and that an acquittal would preclude review of the issue are understandable, those concerns do not justify the course taken by the trial court. An appropriate avenue of appellate review was, in fact, available. The Commonwealth’s pretrial application to rule the prior statement admissible should have been denied. The Commonwealth could have then petitioned for permission to appeal from that interlocutory order, and obtained the trial court’s certification that the evidentiary issue was controlling. 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b); Pa.R.A.P. 1311. Thus a determination by an appellate court could have been obtained before trial and without willful disregard for the binding decisions of this Court.</p>

Regardless of how laudable the trial court’s intentions may have been, however, its unauthorized refusal to apply existing law cannot be tolerated. To permit such a practice will throw the administration of justice and the expectations of litigants into utter confusion.</p>

Until today, that has never been the law of Pennsylvania. The rule discarded today by the majority is indeed “antiquated,” as are many of the hard-wrought concepts which enhance our traditional definition of due process.</p>

    <blockquote id="b201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_201.4",201,[238,465,1110,414]]]'>We simply set the two [statements] against each other, perceive that both cannot be correct, and immediately conclude that he has erred in one or the other — but without determining which one. It is the repugnancy and inconsistency that demonstrates his error, and not the superior credibility of the prior statement. Thus, we do not necessarily accept his former statement as replacing his present one.</blockquote>

    <p id="b201-7" data-blocks='[["BL_201.6",201,[195,960,1153,526]]]'>The question which arises at this point in the analysis is whether the prior statements <em>may </em>be utilized as substantive evidence, and not merely to indicate that the witness is unreliable. The majority would permit the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements because the witness is present in court, under oath, able to explain the circumstances of the prior statement, subject to cross-examination, and because the prior statement will normally have been made closer in time to the incident in question, and therefore, presumably is more reliable.</p>
    <p id="b201-8" data-blocks='[["BL_201.7",201,[194,1504,1155,849]]]'>These observations notwithstanding, it is nevertheless the Commonwealth’s obligation to <em>establish in court, </em>not at some prior time, <em>every element of the crime </em>with which the defendant is charged. If the Commonwealth’s case is not substantial enough to stand alone, based on reliable evidence presented <em>here </em>and <em>now </em>to the court, but instead must rely on the use of prior statements <em>made out-of-court </em>which are inconsistent with those presently being <em>made in court </em>to prove any element of the crime, the case should fail, for the prior statements, if made at all, may or may not be adequately, fully, and competently presented and explained in the present forum. This uncertainty raises the requisite reasonable doubt as to the trustworthiness and value of the prior statements as <em>substantive evidence, </em>and the rule announced by the majority works to “bootstrap” the guilt of the accused.</p>
