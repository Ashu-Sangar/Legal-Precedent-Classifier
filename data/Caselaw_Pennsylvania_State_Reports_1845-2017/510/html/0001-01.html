No other adult was supervising the boys at that time. On being apprised of the situation, Father Flynn, who is an excellent swimmer and trained in water rescue, dove into the pool and retrieved Rivera’s body.

Under these circumstances the appellant should not be deprived of her verdict against the Church simply because the Seminary has been awarded a new trial. The Church, therefore, is not prejudiced by our permitting plaintiff to recover her judgment from it. The Church’s minimum proportionate percentage of liability and the amount of plaintiff’s damages award reduced by decedent’s 5% comparative negligence have been finally determined. The Church has not preserved the right to question the jury’s attribution to it of 65% of the total negligence or 68.4% relative to the Seminary. The Church retains the right to pursue contribution from the Seminary provided the new trial results in a determination that the Seminary was in some degree causally negligent.

The 1966 Act also enlarged upon the activities encompassed in the term “recreational purpose.” <em>See </em>68 P.S. § 477-2(3).

In its attempt to ignore the plain meaning of section 477-2(1), the majority engages in what can only be described as creative grammar. Section 2(1) first defines land to include "land, roads, water, watercourses, private ways and buildings . . . .” There is nothing which logically suggests, as the majority concludes, that the word "buildings” is a restrictive modifier of "land, roads, water, watercourses.” In fact it is mind-boggling to imagine how “buildings” could modify land, roads, water or watercourses. The definition of land in section 2(1) then continues with “structures and machinery or equipment when attached to the realty.” The phrase "when attached to the realty’ modifies structures, machinery and equipment. This interpretation is congruent with the rest of the statute because it places the requirement that the structure, machinery or equipment be part of real property.' There is no requirement that the structure, machinery or equipment be located outdoors, only a requirement that they are affixed to the realty, which entails the possibility that the structure is located in the building.</p>
