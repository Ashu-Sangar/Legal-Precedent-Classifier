We held in <em>Palmeri, </em>that the employer is required to prove by competent evidence that an employee’s disability will permanently prevent him from resuming the duties of his employment before Heart and Lung Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> benefits can be terminated. The standard of proof required to show a permanent disability is evidence which raises a reasonable inference of permanency. And a reasonable inference of permanency may be established by evidence connecting the disability to a scientific probability that the incapacity will not improve to a point where the disabled employee can resume his employment duties. There is no cause to re-examine, restate, or disturb in any way this recently adopted standard.</p>

The majority, how<a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>ever, expresses disagreement with the concept that a reasonable inference of permanency is established by evidence connecting the disability to a scientific probability that the incapacity will not improve to a point where the disabled employee can resume his employment duties. The majority equates “scientific probability” to “absolute certainty” and then opines that requiring proof that a disability is permanent to the degree of “absolute certainty” is much too onerous of a burden for an employer to meet. The “absolute certainty” criterion is created by the majority and set up as a strawman to be rejected as unrealistic.</p>

A disability of indefinite duration is one which has no limits. It is a disability that will not end. This then is another way of saying that the disability is permanent. That is to say, if a disability is expected to continue on without limitation, then that disability is permanent. The criterion purportedly adopted by the majority can be expressed thusly; the standard of proof to establish that a disability is permanent is proof by substantial evidence of a reasonable inference that the disability is a permanent one. This is hardly a satisfactory standard. There remains a question of the evidence required to raise an inference that the disability is of “lasting or indefinite duration.” It is entirely unsatisfactory to say that a disability is permanent if it is of lasting and indefinite duration; and a disability is of lasting and indefinite duration if it is shown to be permanent. Proof that a disability is of indefinite duration may be met by the standard we adopted in <em>Palmeri, </em>namely, evidence connecting the disability to a scientific probability that the disabled employee has reached the maximum benefit from medical treatment, or he is as far restored as the permanent charac<a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>ter of his injuries will permit and he cannot resume the duties of employment. <em>Palmeri v.
