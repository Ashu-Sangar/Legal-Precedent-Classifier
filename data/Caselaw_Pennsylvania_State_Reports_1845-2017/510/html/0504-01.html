Belasco (Belasco) and Edward R. Powers (Powers), as professional employees and reinstated them to their respective teaching positions in the appellant School District. At issue is the essence of the review powers of the Secretary in an appeal from a decision of a School Board. We are asked to decide the nature of the Secretary’s review in a case where no additional testimony is taken. In such a case, is the Secretary limited to traditional appellate review, or is he to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the School Board’s decision? The question is raised: may the Secretary make new findings of fact based upon the evidence presented to the board as reflected in the official record without taking additional testimony? Also at issue is the Commonwealth Court’s finding that the School <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>Board’s decision was not in accordance with the law in that the evidence was insufficient to establish intemperance, cruelty and willful violation of the school laws.</p>

On April 20, 1982, appellees were separately involved in two distinct incidents centering around Gary Neel (Neel), a socially and emotionally disturbed student. Neel, an eighth-grader at the school, had been involved in physically aggressive conduct toward a fellow student. Appellee Powers, one of Neel’s teachers, talked to Neel about the incident and then as a form of punishment, lightly struck Neel on the buttocks with a wooden paddle. Powers characterized the single act of light contact as a “love tap” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> administered with a flick of the wrist. He described the force of the “love tap” as enough for the child to know it happened but not enough to hurt. Later, Power’s class ended, and Neel went to his next class in the classroom of appellee Belasco. There he was called to the front of the room by a teacher’s aide, Sandra Saunders, where he again was punished for his aggressive conduct. Ms. Saunders,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> using considerable force, smacked Neel five times with a paddle across the buttocks. Harrison Richman, a second teacher’s aide in the room at the time, joined in the paddling and swatted Neel once on his buttocks. Belasco who was present in the classroom apparently observed the paddling but did not intervene. Belasco testified that he did not attempt to stop the aides from paddling Neel because when Neel was summoned to the front of the room, the other class members became excited and unruly. Belasco indicated that he was busy calming them and keeping order. After the aides left <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>the room, Belasco took the paddle in hand and laid it on the buttocks of Neel in what both he and Neel described as a joking fashion, attempting to lighten the atmosphere.</p>

A hearing on the charges was held before the School Board on July 13, 1982. On October 25, 1982 the Board found appellees guilty of the charges and dismissed them from their positions. On appeal the Secretary reversed the decision of the School Board and ordered appellees reinstated, but without back pay, The Commonwealth Court affirmed the Secretary’s order reinstating appellees and modified that portion of the order denying back pay by directing that appellees receive back pay.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On petition brought by the School Board, we granted allowance of appeal.</p>

The review limitation announced by our comment in <em>Strinich </em>is inconsistent with the meaning and intent of the School Code and contrary to sound dismissal procedures.

In a case involving the dismissal of at professional employee, the School Board who hears and-) adjudicates the case is not an independent body. The Board prefers the charges, prosecutes the case and makes the decision. In addition, it has been held that a lawful and proper hearing may be conducted without all members of the Board present to hear the evidence. <em>Acitelli v. Westmont Hilltop School District, </em>15 Pa.Cmwlth. 214, <a href="/citations/?q=325%20A.2d%20490" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="325 A.2d 490">325 A.2d 490</a> (1975); <em>Boehm v.

To the extent that <em>Strinich </em>provides otherwise, <em>Strinich </em>is overruled. Minimum requirements of due process demand that a litigant have, at some stage of a proceeding, a neutral fact-finder. Needless to say that the Secretary, as a neutral finder of facts, may not act arbitrarily or capriciously.</p>
