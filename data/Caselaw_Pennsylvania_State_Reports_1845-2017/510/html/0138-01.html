      <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>On March 5,1982, at approximately 8 p.m., Officer Thomas Hoover of the Sugarcreek Police Department responded to a hit and run complaint involving a parked vehicle. At the scene of the accident, one Mr. Keays informed Officer Hoover that the other vehicle involved in the accident belonged to appellant, and that Keays had observed appellant stumble after alighting from his vehicle. While Officer Hoover was inspecting the fresh damage to appellant’s vehicle which was parked in appellant’s driveway, Mrs. Monarch, appellant’s wife, emerged from the Monarchs’ home, and told Officer Hoover her husband had been involved in an accident. When Officer Hoover asked to speak with appellant, Mrs. Monarch indicated she had given appellant a sedative and he was asleep. Officer Hoover insisted upon speaking with appellant, whereupon Mrs. Monarch replied she would “see what she could do.” As she walked toward the house, Officer Hoover followed. In spite of Mrs. Monarch’s request that Officer Hoover remain outside, he followed Mrs. Monarch onto the porch and then inside her home. Once inside, Officer Hoover observed that appellant appeared to be intoxicated. Appellant was immediately arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, public drunkenness and unlawfully leaving the scene of an accident. Appellant’s arrest occurred at approximately 8:30 p.m.</p>

In denying appellant’s motion to suppress, the suppression court found as a fact that Officer Hoover’s presence on the porch was permitted by Mrs. Monarch and that his observations of appellant’s intoxicated appearance were made from the porch. The court then upheld the arrest on the grounds that the entry was based on probable cause, the entry was peaceable, and exigent circumstances, to-wit, the fleeting nature of evidence of intoxication, existed.</p>

As Officer Hoover possessed no evidence of intoxication prior to entering appellant’s home, the suppression court’s conclusion that probable cause was established while the officer was on the porch and prior to the officer’s warrantless entry of appellant’s home is unsupported by the record.</p>

      <em>DeMichel, </em>supra, and Rule 323(j), that the admissibility of evidence cannot be relitigated at trial, prohibits a trial court’s reversal of the suppression court simply because the Commonwealth failed to <em>re-prove </em>at trial probable cause for the arrest. However, where the suppression ruling is not supported by the record of the suppression proceeding, it is perfectly appropriate for the court, on post-verdict motions, to reverse its earlier suppression ruling. Indeed, in view of the requirement of Rule 1123 that suppression issues be preserved in post-verdict motions, it would be ludicrous to require the filing of such motions, but prohibit the court’s meaningful review.</p>

No one contends that probable cause to arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol existed prior to Officer Hoover’s personal observation of appellant’s intoxicated condition. Until Officer Hoover observed appellant, he only had information that appellant had been involved in a motor vehicle accident and that appellant stumbled as he alighted from his vehicle. This information is not sufficient to establish that appellant had operated his vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Thus, prior to Officer Hoover’s personal observation of evidence of appellant’s intoxicated condition, he had no probable cause to arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol.</p>
