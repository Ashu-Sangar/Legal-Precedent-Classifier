In affirming the Superior Court’s decision in this case, the majority strips the police officer — and society — of a principal element for his protection in that ceaseless struggle. That protection is <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>the right, authority and obligation of the police officer to use reasonable force, including deadly force if necessary, in executing his duties and in defending himself and others so long as the use of force is exercised within the parameters established by law. To be effective, that protection must extend to a police officer charged with and called to account for the excessive use of force. Accordingly, a jury chosen to determine whether the officer did, in fact, use force which was excessive under the circumstances must be fully appraised of the principles of law which govern a police officer’s use of force in defending the peace and in enforcing the penal laws of this Commonwealth. In affirming Corporal Thomas Boden’s conviction for involuntary manslaughter returned by a jury that was woefully uninformed as to those principles, the majority has seriously weakened our first line of defense.</p>

The officers arrived at the home of that man, Marne Toogood, a large man whom Corporal Boden knew as being eccentric or deranged and, possibly, a practitioner of voodoo. (Mr. Toogood’s voodoo reputation stemmed in part from his habit of displaying animal carcasses and skeletons on his front porch.) When one of the officers knocked on the front door, he was forcefully pushed back by Mr. Toogood who then picked up an axe handle and vigorously cursed at the officers to “get the hell off” of his property.</p>

He did come out, brandishing the axe handle in a threatening manner, and advanced toward Corporal Boden who warned him to drop the axe handle. When he did not, Corporal Boden drew his service revolver and fired what he described as a “warning shot.” When Mr. Toogood continued to advance, Corporal Boden fired a second shot, which struck him in the face and dropped him to his knees. Stunned but conscious, the other officers kicked the axe handle away from Mr. Toogood.</p>

With a bullet protruding from his upper teeth, Mr. Toogood began to get up and move toward Corporal Boden again, according to the testimony of the three officers. Corporal Boden, alarmed and wondering “what the hell was going on in front of me now ... whether it was a superman, a freak of nature,” fired his revolver a third time, striking Mr. Toogood in the chest and, unfortunately, killing him.</p>

The defense was that the killing was justified under the circumstances. In support of this defense, counsel requested several points for charge based upon various principles of justification codified at Chapter 5 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 501-510.

In this case, because the defendant was what is called a “peace officer”, by reason of the fact that he was a policeman, special rules apply in determining whether the defendant’s use of force was justified. A peace officer need not retreat or desist from efforts to make a lawful arrest merely because the person he is attempting to arrest resists or threatens to resist arrest. Furthermore, the Commonwealth has the burden of disproving the defense of justification. Thus, you cannot find the defendant guilty unless the evidence convinces you beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not [reasonably] believe that the force he used was necessary to make the arrest of Marne Toogood and to defend himself from bodily harm while making the arrest.

In assessing the reasonableness of his belief, the jury should have been fully informed of the demands that society has placed upon a police officer in requiring that officer to stand his ground in making arrests and executing his duties, demands which society does not place upon private citizens.</p>

Comparison of the court’s instructions to the jury with the appellant’s requested points for charge and the Crimes Code discloses the inadequacy of the court’s charge concerning a police officer’s use of force and the parameters of his authority and responsibility. The reasonableness of a police officer’s belief that he needs to use deadly force is not to be determined in a vacuum. The determination of reasonableness must take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances <em>including his status, duties, and obligations as a police officer.</em>

The facts and circumstances surrounding the unfortunate incident were before the jury; however, the jury was deprived of critical information regarding Corporal Boden’s authority and responsibility as a police officer attempting to subdue a dangerous person and effectuate an arrest. This deficiency is particularly accute because the Commonwealth did bring out, in its cross-examination of Corporal Boden, that there was a vacant lot behind him and “there was nothing behind [him] which would have prevented [him] from retreating ...” N.T., October 7, 1981 at 3-89. Superi- or Court dismissed this reference as “irrelevant” since it was the only reference to “retreat” among 540 pages of transcript. 486 Pa. at 506, n. 2. I cannot accept this characterization. Though the reference to Corporal Boden’s ability to retreat may have been “fleeting”, it certain<a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>ly was not “irrelevant.” The seed of “retreat” was planted by this reference and from there it might well have grown. This is especially likely here because the trial court’s instructions were confusing and vague, thus necessitating repeated requests by the jury for clarifying instructions (five requests for clarification were made on three separate occasions) and lengthy deliberations (the deliberations extended from late afternoon to 11:30 p.m. on October 8, 1981 and from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on October 9, 1981, approximately) in reaching its verdict.
