They intended to serve a New Jersey fugitive warrant on her. They knocked; appellee answered the door. After the officers explained their purpose, he told them that Ms. Dietz was sleeping in the bedroom and directed them to it. Ap<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>pellee was wearing only a pair of blue jeans. Some of the officers entered the bedroom, woke her, and placed her under arrest. Ms. Dietz was taken to the District Magistrate after dressing and using the bathroom. Appellee told another officer that he lived with Ms. Dietz and they were going to be married. He also mentioned that one of the dogs on the premises was his. The officers saw a box of what they believed to be marijuana on the living room coffee table. Appellee was ordered to sit down; he sat within two feet of the contraband. One officer remained on the premises with appellee while others obtained a search warrant. While waiting for the officers to return, appellee got up, walked into the kitchen and helped himself to a cold drink from the refrigerator. At about 3:00 P.M. the officers returned with a search warrant for the residence. In addition to the box on the coffee table, they found what proved to be cocaine in the bedroom and the study. The suspected contraband was confiscated and appellee was arrested. He retrieved his clothes from the bedroom in which Dietz had been sleeping. This was the only room in the residence in use as a bedroom. Subsequent chemical analysis showed that the substances seized were marijuana and cocaine.</p>

Constructive possession is a legal fiction, a pragmatic construct to deal with the realities of criminal law enforcement. Constructive possession is an inference arising from a set of facts that possession of the contraband was more likely than not. We have defined constructive possession as “conscious dominion.” <em>Commonwealth v. Davis, </em><a href="/pa/444/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="444 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1938552" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0011-01">444 Pa. 11</a>, 15, <a href="/citations/?q=280%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="280 A.2d 119">280 A.2d 119</a>, 121 (1971). We subsequently defined “conscious dominion” as “the power to control the contraband and the intent to exercise that control.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Nevertheless, in that case we did not rely on Macolino's control of the residence as establishing control of the contraband, but were careful to weigh that evidence “in conjunction with other evidence sufficient to establish a <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>link between Carol Macolino and the illegal substance.” <em><a href="/pa/503/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="503 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1785926" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0201-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/503/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="503 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1785926" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0201-01">503 Pa. at 209</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="503 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1785926" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0201-01">469 A.2d at 136</a>. By abandoning the need for such other evidence, the majority creates a grave risk of an unscrupulous cohabitant intentionally or unintentionally exposing his innocent partner to criminal liability simply by storing contraband in a place over which there is “shared access and control.” The burden has been effectively shifted to the defendant to disprove his intent to exercise control over the contraband, a result which offends the most basic principles of our system of justice.</p>

I suspect that the majority would also permit an attempt to conceal contraband during a search to be considered as evidence of guilt in a possessory charge. If so, there would appear to be no sure way for an innocent resident or occupant of a room to disassociate himself from its contents, for he is implicitly demonstrating an intent to control whether he acknowledges or ignores the contents.</p>
