The injury restricted his ability to safely lift heavy objects; his physician advised him to lift no more than twenty-five pounds. After reinjuring his back in early 1979, he was placed on permanent light duty and was soon assigned to work half of each work day in the Berks County Maintenance Department Storeroom. From April through October of 1979, complainant became familiar with the operation of the storeroom, and when an opening for the position of Storekeeper II was posted by PennDOT, he bid for the position. Another applicant, David Scrobe, also bid for the position. Neither complainant nor Scrobe were hired for the job. Eventually, an equipment operator, Kenneth Scheuring, was hired for the position.</p>

In order to properly review findings of fact, the record from which they are derived must be examined in order to determine if the findings are based on substantial evidence.

We also direct that before such review is conducted, the Commission make more specific findings of fact regarding the requirements of the job for which complainant applied. One reason for this direction is that we read the Commission’s crucial finding that the “Storekeeper II <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>position in 1979 did not require heavy lifting ... Numerous people were available to assist when heavy lifting was required” (finding of fact no. 23) as being inherently inconsistent. If the Commission finds that the job requires no lifting then they should say so; if the job entails some heavy lifting, <em>and there are persons whose job it is to assist the Storekeeper when lifting is required, </em>then the Commission should so find. In either case the Commission will have satisfied their burden that complainant’s disability is not job-related. However, if the evidence establishes that the job does require lifting beyond complainant’s capacity, and that PennDOT will be required to shift workers from their intended assignments to assist the applicant, then the Commission will be required to decide whether such requirement is a “reasonable accommodation” or imposes an “undue hardship” upon the employer. See 16 Pa.Code §§ 44.4; 44.14. In the absence of such specific findings we are unable to properly review the issue of whether complainant’s disability was job-related or not.</p>
