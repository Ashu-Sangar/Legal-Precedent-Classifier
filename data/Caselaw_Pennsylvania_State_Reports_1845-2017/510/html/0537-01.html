The victim’s mother immediately examined her and found her underwear bloody and turned inside out, her rectum torn and bleeding, and her vagina red. The victim’s mother called the police and the child was taken to a hospital where a medical examination tested positively for sperm in both the “vulvular sample” and the “rectal sample”, and revealed a “recto-vaginal fissure” (a tear). Lab results confirmed the presence of blood and “seminal stains” on the victim’s underwear.

Appellee testified in his defense and denied having seen the victim on February 18, 1982. He claimed to have been home from about 3:30 p.m. until his arrest that evening. Appellee’s mother, who resided with appellee, testified that he had been out of the house earlier in the day and that when he returned home (she did not say what time he returned), she did not notice any unusual odors about him (such as the odor of dog feces). In an attempt to discredit the child victim’s testimony, defense counsel questioned her about a prior inconsistent statement she had given to the police officer to the effect that the incident had taken place in an alley.</p>

Under the latter, a person who, in the course of committing one of the four enumerated categories of rape, inflicts “serious bodily injury” or chooses a victim “not a voluntary social companion of the actor [who] had not previously permitted him sexual liberties” commits a felony of the first degree; otherwise he commits a felony of the second degree. A person who commits one of the three enumerated categories of gross sexual imposition commits a felony of the third degree. In contrast, the Pennsylvania legislature created the crime of rape and treated each of the four enumerated categories with equal severity, classifying all as felonies of the first degree.

On all the evidence in this record, including the victim’s age and injuries, a jury was entitled to infer such compulsion. Certainly, if a grown man can be coerced or compelled to confess to a crime by the questioning of an arresting officer, <em>see Culombe v.

It is, indeed, time for us to apply to the victims of crime the same protective standards that we give criminal defendants.</p>

C.S. § 3121.</p>
