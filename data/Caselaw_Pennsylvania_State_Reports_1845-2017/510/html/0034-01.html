At the time of the hearing on May 12, 1980, appellee was 47 years old and had been working for PSC since December 29, 1955. As of his last day of employment on October 1, 1976, appellee was working as a printer at PSC and had worked in that capacity for <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>the previous ten (10) years. As part of his job he was required to clean the printing presses with a chemical known as methyl ethyl ketone (“MEK”). He also worked with another chemical known as methyl isobutyl ketone (“MIBK”), but used MEK almost exclusively to clean the printing presses.</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[243,641,1156,574]]]'>Appellee testified that he had started becoming ill on his job and that upon the advice of his doctor he left the job on October 1, 1976. Appellee stated that while he was at work, his sight would become blurry and he would have headaches, a dry throat and his tongue and lips would get numb and he would get dizzy. Appellee also stated that he had an infection and that anything he smelled, whether dust or dirt, would infect his nose. Appellee admitted, however, that he had had a sinus problem since his tonsils were removed approximately 28 years prior to the time of the hearing.</p>

Mr. Willard also testified that appellee refused a job on the presses which did not require him to use MEK or MIBK because he would have been required to work nights.</p>

Gronka, an industrial hygiene engineer, performed air sample tests at PSC on May 8,1977 and reported that the amount of MEK did not reach the threshold limits of danger as prescribed by the Office of Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The OSHA threshold limit value for MEK is 200 parts per million (“p.p.m.”) Mr. Gronka found that while cleaning the pump, an employee would be exposed to 26 p.p.m. when using MEK, and while washing the rollers with MEK, an employee would be exposed to 180 p.p.m. A general air sample at the plant taken for MEK showed a level of 7 p.p.m.</p>

Dr. Falkenburg saw appellee numerous times thereafter in the years 1973 through 1976 for the same problem. Dr. Falkenburg concluded that the chemical solvents MEK and MIBK had something to do with appellee’s condition or at least aggravated his problem, if not caused it. It was Dr. Falkenburg who advised appellee that he should discontinue his employment at PSC to avoid being exposed to the chemical solvents. However, even after appellee’s exposure to these substances had terminated, he continued to have problems with his nose and throat area.

In his full examination of appellee, Dr. Ridell found nothing abnormal about appellee’s nose, sinus, throat (including no signs of rhinitis or sinusitis) and that there was nothing to prevent appellee from working. Dr. Ridell’s examination showed no permanent damage to appellee’s nose or throat area and Dr. Ridell testified that if appellee had permanent damage from chemical solvents or any allergy, such damage would have been revealed in the examination. Dr. Ridell further testified that if appellee’s sinus, nose and throat were irritated by chemical solvents, this irritation would clear up after the <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>exposure stopped.

The latter testified that appellee’s exposure to MEK and MIBK either had “something to do with” appellee’s condition, “aggravated” his condition, or “caused” his condition. His testimony concerning the extent of the causal connection was clearly equivocal. On cross-examination, he admitted appellee had many allergies that may have caused some of the problems. Moreover, he could not explain why appellee continued to have problems with his nose and throat area even after his exposure had ceased. It is axiomatic that a complainant does not carry his burden by offering equivocal medical testimony to establish that the claimed disability resulted from the workplace environment. <em>See, e.g., Lewis v.

The first referee assigned to appellee’s petition conducted the hearings and received the evidence, but retired before making a final decision. In the court below Arena contended that because the referee who made the decision on his claim did not actually take the evidence in the case, but instead based his decision only upon the record, the Board and reviewing courts are not confined to their usual scope of review. The Commonwealth Court correctly concluded that it is the referee who has the ultimate factfinding role in workmen’s compensation cases, 77 P.S. §§ 833, 854. Deference is given to the referee’s determination for two reasons: (1) generally it is the referee who observes the witnesses and who is in the best position to rule on the credibility of the witnesses; and (2) the referee, as well as the Board, deals exclusively with workmen’s compensation cases and has developed expertise in the area. Even though the substitution of the second referee in this case may have removed the first reason for giving deference to the fact finding of the referee, the second basis for the principle of deference remains applicable and those findings must be accepted where the record reflects substantial evidence to sustain them.</p>
