He enlisted in 1969 and was scheduled for discharge on September 17, 1975. In August of 1975, he attended what was to be his last annual encampment at Fort Indiantown Gap. While loading a truck at camp he injured his back. He was treated by Army physicians and put on incapacitation pay. He applied for a disability pension, which was denied, and on September 17, 1975, he was, according to the scheduled end of his enlistment, discharged from the Guard. His incapacitation pay ended, and, except for continued medical services, the Army denied all other claims for benefits on grounds that appellee’s injury was not such as to entitle him to disability compensation beyond his date of discharge. Since the standards for evaluating a soldier’s fitness for duty are not the same as those used to assess disability for civilian occupations the federal government, applying its standards, determined that appellee, although injured, was not disabled from military duty. Appellee therefore was discharged because he requested discharge, and not because he was unfit for military duty. That he was unable to return to his civilian construction job until January, 1976, was not disputed.</p>

The proviso that an otherwisé eligible Guardsman shall receive benefits only “... if not compensated therefor by the government of the United States” evinces a restrictive legislative intention, though it does not control our <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>threshold inquiry of what State military status qualifies an individual for eligibility.</p>

If the General Assembly’s action in adding the word to the section is to be given effect, it must be concluded that that body intended to restrict compensation and to deny benefits to Guardsmen injured performing other military duty that did not qualify as “State military duty.” This restriction is consistent with the construction that the Section 844 state benefits scheme is aimed at those situations where the interests of Pennsylvania, rather than the federal government, are at stake.</p>

The General Assembly did not in this instance choose to explicitly include annual training. That the General Assembly was capable of expressly providing for state benefits for claims arising from federally-funded training is apparent from the fact that it has done so in the deceased soldiers’ dependents’ pension scheme. 51 P.S. § 381 <em>et seq.</em>

We need not, however, decide which such forms of service qualify for state benefits under Section 844, because it is clear from the language employed by the General Assembly in the statute and the preamble, from the available alternatives not chosen by that body, and from the essentially federal character of annual training <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>encampments, that the General Assembly did not intend to include Guardsmen injured during such training among those eligible for state military benefits under Section 844.</p>

      <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>In my view, the controlling question in the case is whether the guardsman in this case may be said to have performed a state function within the meaning of Section 844. Like Judge Craig, I believe that the guardsman performed a state military duty under Section 844, and thus, that he is eligible for the state benefits conferred by that section.</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[248,674,1154,543]]]'>While it is true, as observed by Mr. Justice McDermott, that many aspects of the National Guard training program are “pervasively federal,” it is also true, as observed by Judge Craig, that the National Guard is the modern militia reserved to the states by Art. I, § 8, cl. 16 of the Constitution of the United States, and that state military personnel and a state hierarchy of command, culminating in the Governor, actually implement the federally mandated training. Thus, federal and state personnel, statutes, and governmental organizations are involved in the training.</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[245,1251,1155,599]]]'>Furthermore, this training benefits the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as well as the federal government. Again, as Judge Craig points out, the Governor is empowered under the Pennsylvania Military Code to call the National Guard into active duty to protect against various threats to the security and integrity of the Commonwealth. Thus, it is in Pennsylvania’s interest to have at its disposal competently trained military personnel able to be called up when the need arises. Since the training serves both federal and state interests, a national guardsman may be said to be performing a state military duty under Section 844.</p>
    <p id="b422-6" data-blocks='[["BL_422.6",422,[244,1882,1152,478]]]'>In sum, I understand the phrases “service of the state” and “state military duty” to refer to any official National Guard duties which are not <em>distinctly </em>federal in character, as would be the case when the National Guard is activated into federal service. I do not believe that the use of the modifying term “state” was meant to foreclose a guardsman’s receiving benefits under Section 844 merely because he was involved in service which was not <em>exclusively </em>for the benefit of the Commonwealth.</p>
