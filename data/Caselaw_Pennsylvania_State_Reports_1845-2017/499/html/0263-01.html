On May 10, 1974, appellant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to count one, which charged appellant with murder generally. Pursuant to the agreement, the Commonwealth agreed to nol pros two charges based on firearms violations and to certify that the homicide would rise no higher than murder of the second degree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Although the court explained to appellant that he had the right to be tried by twelve individuals and that a jury’s verdict of guilty would have to be unanimous, the court did not inform appellant that he had the right to participate in jury selection or that a jury would be selected from the community.

    <p id="b436-7" data-blocks='[["BL_436.7",436,[258,991,1146,714]]]'>Appellant also contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request the court to define voluntary manslaughter during the guilty-plea colloquy and for failing to argue that appellant’s degree of guilt rose no higher than voluntary manslaughter. Because appellant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to the charge of murder, it was unnecessary that the court explain the elements of voluntary manslaughter. Similarly, any attempt by trial counsel to argue for the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter would have been incompatible with the plea. Hence, counsel’s actions did not constitute ineffective assistance. See <em>Commonwealth v. Rice, </em><a href="/pa/456/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="456 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="584461" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0090-01">456 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20705" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="318 A.2d 705">318 A.2d 705</a> (1974) (trial counsel not ineffective for failing to raise baseless claim); <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

In a related claim, appellant asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to inform appellant of his right to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. However, in 1974, when appellant’s plea was entered, the failure to file a petition to withdraw a guilty plea did not preclude the right to challenge the plea on appeal. See <em>Commonwealth v. Lee, </em><a href="/pa/460/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="460 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="482725" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0324-01">460 Pa. 324</a>, 327 n. *, <a href="/pa/460/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="460 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="482725" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0324-01">333 A.2d 749</a>, 750 n. * (1975). In addition, appellant has failed to show how the alleged ineffectiveness in any respect caused his failure to exercise his right to take a direct appeal, a right of which appellant had been fully apprised by the trial court.</p>
