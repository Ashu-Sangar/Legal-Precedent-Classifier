Williams, Jones, and defendant entered the latter’s second floor apartment, whereupon they discovered that the apartment’s electrical power had been cut off. Defendant then went downstairs to the first floor apartment of his seventy year old landlord, Rinaldo Capellupo, and told him to restore the electrical power. Defendant returned upstairs, and, when electrical service resumed, dispatched Williams to inform Capellupo <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>that the apartment was no longer without electricity. Thirty minutes later, Williams had still not returned from this errand, and defendant went downstairs. Shortly thereafter, Jones, who had remained in defendant’s second floor apartment, heard loud cursing and arguing emanating from the first floor. After calling out an inquiry as to what was happening below, Jones moved to the top of the staircase and noticed that the commotion arose from the first floor hallway, near the door to Capellupo’s apartment, where Capellupo, Williams, and defendant were standing. Jones demanded that the confrontation be ceased, but the argument continued and Williams then struck Capellupo, whereupon Jones retreated into defendant’s apartment. An affray ensued which continued into Capellupo’s apartment. Defendant and Williams, both of whom had been drinking, viciously beat Capellupo, fracturing his skull, breastbone, eleven of his ribs, and bursting his right lung. Capellupo subsequently died of these injuries, but prior to doing so indicated to police only that he had been robbed by a tenant. In statements given to police, the defendant, claiming preexisting animosity as the motive for his participation in the beating, admitted to breaking a cigarette stand over Capellupo’s head, and to kicking Capellupo three or four times while inside the latter’s apartment. Physical evidence discovered in the apartment corroborated that a fight had occurred therein.</p>

In particular, defendant theorizes that, during the altercation, he might have fallen or have been pushed into the apartment, or that he might have entered in such heat of emotion as not to have noticed that he was entering and not to have had any objective, or at least not a criminal one, in mind.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

This, however, does not in itself demonstrate the existence of a conspiracy. As the foregoing summary of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth reveals, a <em>mere association </em>between defendant and Williams was shown, along with their simultaneous participation in the assault upon Capellupo. Nothing in the relation, conduct, or circumstances of the parties, however, is indicative of there having been an agreement, explicit or implicit, as to commission of the assault. The fact that the affray erupted from an argument, the manner in which the beating was inflicted, and the overt acts of the participants prior to and concurrent with commission of the assault fail to bespeak concert of action indicative of a common design. Indeed, the evidence reveals only that defendant and Williams became embroiled in an argument with Capellupo, and that this argument immediately escalated into a violent confrontation in which defendant and Williams inflicted beatings upon Capellupo. These events being perfectly consistent with the presumption that defendant and Williams acted independently and spontaneously, and there being no evidence upon which existence of the common understanding or agreement requisite to the charge of conspiracy might properly be inferred, the verdict of guilt as to conspiracy must be regarded as inadequately supported by the evidence. Thus, the order of the court below, insofar as judgment of sentence with regard to conspiracy was thereby arrested, is affirmed.</p>

Mobley, </em><a href="/pa/467/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="467 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1717321" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0460-01">467 Pa. 460</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="467 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1717321" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0460-01">359 A.2d 367</a> (1976), this Court upheld a conspiracy conviction against a similar challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. In that case, the accused and his companions encountered members of a rival gang, had an exchange of words, and proceeded to chase and fight their adversaries. Chief Justice Jones, speaking for a unanimous Court, concluded that evidence that the accused voluntarily joined his companions in their attack upon the rival gang was sufficient to support his conspiracy conviction.</p>
