Appellant testified in his own behalf, maintaining that the shooting was in self-defense. As the only witness to provide exculpatory testimony, he testified that Hilton put a gun to his shoulder, whereupon he grabbed Hilton, disarmed him, and, then noticed a drug dealer with whom he had been negotiating during the course of the evening, standing behind Hilton with a gun. Thinking the dealer had fired at him, appellant fired Hilton’s gun once, striking Hilton. Appellant, firing the gun over his own shoulder because he heard two additional shots fired at him, ran from the scene. Hilton was hit three times and died from these wounds.</p>

Before appellant answered, defense counsel objected to the question and, at sidebar, moved for a mistrial.

The jury may have decided that the Commonwealth’s case was significantly bolstered by the reference to appellant’s post-arrest silence and that it would be appropriate to impose a verdict more severe than acquittal but less severe than murder. <em>See Commonwealth v.

As we cannot be sure that the jury would have resolved the issue in the same manner absent the improper reference, we are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict.
