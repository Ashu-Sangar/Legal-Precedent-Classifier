The two assailants were angry because appellant had objected in the bar to one of them making advances to his female companion. Outside the bar, as the assailants approached, the man armed with the pistol, after making verbal threats, began shooting, and one of appellant’s friends was shot in the leg. The assailant armed with the shotgun then apparently abandoned the shotgun, and, according to the testimony of the appellant and his female companion, the woman, who had been hiding behind a car during the shooting, saw the shotgun and threw the gun to appellant. Appellant claims that as he caught the gun, it accidentally discharged, killing the victim.</p>

Post-verdict motions and an application for leave to withdraw as counsel were filed by trial counsel, stating that appellant intended to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness on appeal. The trial judge granted the motion to withdraw and, after appointing new counsel, ordered a hearing to be held on the issue of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness. Post-verdict motions subsequently were de<a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>nied and appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for not less than four nor more than ten years.

In the present case, the prior crimes may not be admitted to attack appellant’s credibility because the prior crimes do not involve dishonesty or false statement and the defendant’s character is not in issue.
