It does not convert a previously acquired easement into a fee.

We disagree. The Commonwealth’s interest in the Vine Street Expressway was acquired by it under prior statutes limiting its interest to an easement for highway purposes. Appellees asserted inchoate rights can only ripen into a property interest upon abandonment by the Commonwealth. Upon such abandonment the easement terminates and the Commonwealth is left with nothing to sell. Serious constitutional questions would arise were we to decide that Act 100 transferred the rights granted to adjoining property owners under section 3 of the Act of February 27,1849, P.L. 90, 36 P.S. § 2131 on abandonment of an easement, to persons granted leases on the right-of-way. Moreover, we are not inclined to decide that Act 100 requires the Commonwealth to purchase or otherwise acquire the rights of the residual fee owners in cases such as this where the taking was properly limited to an easement under the law then in effect. The inchoate property right these appellees claim under Act 100 belongs to others upon abandonment for highway purposes, the very event they say causes it to ripen. Consequently, we hold the rights accorded PennDOT’s lessees under Act 100 apply only in cases in which PennDOT has acquired a fee. It has no application to cases involving easements for highway purposes. Therefore, appellees have no Act 100 rights subject to equitable protection.</p>

Prior to the Act of October 5, 1978 the predecessor to the Board of Claims, the Board of Arbitration, had jurisdiction to hear and decide such claims against the Commonwealth. Act of May 20, P.L. 728, No. 193, § 4, <em>as amended. </em>By the Act of October 5, 1978 the legislature expressed its intention that the Board of Claim’s jurisdic- ■ tion be “exclusive”.</p>

      <blockquote id="b797-6" data-blocks='[["BL_797.7",797,[228,1753,1080,463]]]'>Pursuant to section 11 of Article 1 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, it is hereby declared to be the intent of the General Assembly that the Commonwealth, and its officials and employees acting within the scope of their duties, shall continue to enjoy sovereign and official immunity and remain immune from suit except as the General Assembly shall specifically waive the immunity. When the General Assembly specifically waives sovereign immunity, a claim against the Commonwealth and its officials and employees shall be brought only in such manner and in such courts and in such cases as directed by the provisions of Title 42 (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure) <em>unless otherwise specifically authorized by statute.</em>

Appellees argue that the Board of Claims’ jurisdiction over cases involving wrongful termination of their leases is not “exclusive” despite the wording of the statute because the Pennsylvania Eminent Domain Code, Act of June 22, 1964, Special Sess., P.L. 84, Art. IV, 26 P.S. § 1-101, <em>et seq., </em>provides another forum in Common Pleas to remedy wrongful termination of a lease between the Commonwealth and its lessee. We find no authority for the proposition that the termination of a lease by the Commonwealth constitutes a “taking” under the Eminent Domain Code as opposed to an action for damages based upon a breach of contract. The Eminent Domain Code only provides for an apportionment of damages between a lessor and the owner of the fee where the Commonwealth takes, injures or destroys private property. The easements in question here, previously were taken, are public property and the lessees rights are strictly contractual.</p>

Furthermore, appellees have produced no evidence to show that the Commonwealth’s interest in the leased premises was any more than an easement.</p>
