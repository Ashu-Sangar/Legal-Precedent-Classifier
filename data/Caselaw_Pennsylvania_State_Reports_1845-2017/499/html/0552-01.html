Appellant had received a memorandum from Falcone dated November 3, 1977, alleging that Boyer had engaged in illegal conduct in his use of a vehicle owned by the City of Lancaster. A copy of this memorandum was placed in appellant’s file. Appellant received a second memorandum from Falcone, also dated November 3, 1977, alleging that appellant had misused a city vehicle, and further threatening appellant with suspension. Copies of this memorandum were sent to the personnel department and to Lee Mowery, the union local president, and one copy was placed in appellant’s file.</p>

Thereafter appellant received another memorandum from Falcone, dated April 5, 1978, reprimanding Boyer for careless work and a poor attitude. Again, disciplinary action was threatened. Copies of this memorandum were sent to the personnel department, to Morris, to the union steward, and additionally, to Lancaster Mayor Scott. Finally, Boyer received a memorandum from Falcone dated April 27, 1978, reprimanding him for careless workmanship and a poor attitude.

Security against unemployment and the spread of indigency can best be provided by the systematic setting aside of financial reserves to be used as compensation for loss of wages by employes during periods <em>when they become unemployed through no fault of their own. </em>The principle of the accumulation of financial reserves, the sharing of risks, and the payment of compensation with respect to unemployment meets the need of protection against the hazards of unemployment and indigency.

Although it may be permissible for an employee to seek relief from an official senior to his own supervisor where the employee has a dispute with his supervisor, in the normal case, seeking such relief would not involve invectives of the type used by appellant in his letter.

But if that is to be the test, what employee discharged for cause could ever be denied unemployment compensation benefits? Boyer may have felt that he was wronged when Falcone did not talk with him about a particular matter before issuing a reprimand, but there is no evidence of record that such a discussion is required. Boyer’s anger may explain his willingness to risk damage to Falcone’s presumed good reputation by addressing a letter to Falcone’s superiors insinuating that Falcone was a racist, but that feeling of anger does not make Boyer’s action reasonable. Boyer may have felt that he could not grieve the reprimands that Falcone put in his file, but if he was correct in assuming this, other actions short of character assassination were open to him, and if he was not correct, his mistake hardly transforms his letter into a reasonable response. Finally, the majority mentions Mr. Goldberg’s testimony as evidence of Boyer’s reasonableness. At 526. Goldberg testified that he did not attempt to resolve the complaints made by Boyer “because I didn’t consider them to be problems.” When one considers the complaints — Boyer did not like getting adverse comment on his breaking of rules and on the quality of his work — one can understand both the Goldberg response and Boyer’s <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>dissatisfaction with it.
