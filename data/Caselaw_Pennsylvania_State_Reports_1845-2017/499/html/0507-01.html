    <p id="b678-9" data-blocks='[["BL_678.10",678,[266,815,1143,467]]]'>Petitioner, Charles Emory Smith, was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County of burglary, attempted theft, criminal trespass, and conspiracy. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two to four years for burglary, six to twelve months for attempted theft, one to two years for criminal trespass, and one to four years for conspiracy, the sentences to run concurrently. He was also fined $200 for each count. The Superior Court affirmed and petitioner seeks our review.</p>

Petitioner also raises the following issues: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, (2) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion for reconsideration of sentence, (3) trial counsel was ineffective because he elicited testimony concerning petitionerâ€™s post-arrest silence, and (4) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to lay a proper foundation for the impeachment of witness Nemeth with a prior inconsistent statement. Following our review of the record, we find no merit to the above allegations of error.</p>
