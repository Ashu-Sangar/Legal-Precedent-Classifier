Since the psychiatric testimony was first offered in <em>Weinstein </em>at the degree of guilt hearing solely to negate appellant’s intent to kill and since appellant argues that its exclusion was erroneous, the testimony must, perforce, be judged on its relevance to that issue. After the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas had found, without this testimony, that appellant was guilty of first degree murder, the psychiatrist’s testimony was admitted as it related to sentencing. The parties in this P.C.H.A. proceeding have agreed that the testimony so received was of the same nature the expert would have given at the degree of guilt hearing. N.T., P.C.H.A. Hearing, at 6-7. We are, therefore, able to examine it in detail to determine its relevancy for the offered purpose. Upon such examination we find that defendant’s psychiatrist was unable to give an opinion speaking to the presence or absence of specific intent, but only to the issue of irresistible impulse arising from defendant’s uncontrollable sexual urge to continue strangling his victim till that strangulation climaxed in death. His argument necessarily implies that psychiatric testimony that he acted under an irresistible impulse is relevant to negate specific intent to kill and that the right to present such relevant testimony must be retroactively applied in his case.</p>

      <em>Walzack </em>does not recognize irresistible impulse as a test on either diminished capacity or specific intent.

Rather it merely recognizes that competent psychiatric testimony which speaks to a defendant’s ability to plan, deliberate and premeditate is relevant.</p>

In so holding this Court critized our earlier line of cases holding that psychiatric opinion was so fraught with scientific uncertainty that the expert testimony of its practitioners was incompetent on the issue of specific intent. Examining <em>Walzack, </em>in the light of <em>McCusker, </em>it appears this Court has rejected the notion that the unreliability of psychiatric testimony is so great that expert psychiatric opinion adds nothing to the lay knowledge of the fact finder. <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>Hence, <em>Walzack </em>stands for the proposition that psychiatric testimony relevant to the cognitive functions of deliberation and premeditation is competent on the issue of specific intent to kill.

Following <em>Brawnier </em>by four years, the <em>Bethea </em>Court rejected the asserted analogy in <em>Brawnier, </em>noting the significant evidentiary distinctions between psychiatric abnormality and recognized incapacitating circumstances such as intoxication and epilepsy. <em>See </em>3 West. New Eng.L.Rev. 583, 598 (1981). The latter conditions differ significantly from a psychosis which causes an irresistible impulse to kill. The rejected <em>Brawner </em>test for relevancy to specific intent, like the ALT test for the defense of insanity, relates to an illness which so distorts or confuses an individual’s mental processes that he is unable to control his actions and thus is robbed of his freedom to adhere to the right and eschew the wrong. The M’Naghten test, which remains the law of Pennsylvania, deals on the other hand with knowledge of right from wrong and appreciation of the nature and quality of the act.</p>

At trial for murder generally, the Commonwealth must establish (1) that a human being has unlawfully been killed, (2) that the person accused did the killing, (3) that the accused is of sound memory and discretion, knows right from wrong and appreciates the nature and quality of his act, i.e. sane under Pennsylvania’s M’Naghten standard, and (4) that the killing was done with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought is the general intent prerequisite to a finding of murder. It distinguishes murder from any other type of homicide and includes cruelty, recklessness of consequences and a mind regardless of social duty. At trial or in a degree of guilt hearing, to establish murder in the first degree the Commonwealth must also prove that the defendant specifically intended to kill. Thus, in addition to the four requirements noted above it must prove premeditation and deliberation; otherwise the offense can rise no higher than second degree murder under applicable provisions of the 1939 Penal Code.

This requirement of moral culpability presupposes a freedom to turn from the wrong and to seek the right, an innate human ability to act in a rational manner.

For this reason, it is an alternate test of sanity in those jurisdictions, not including Pennsylvania, which accept it.

The refusal of jurisdictions such as Pennsylvania to accept it is based not on such logic, but on policy. Within the determinist assumptions of a large and influential school of psychiatry, the negation of intent is an entirely logical corollary. The assumptions of the law — rationality, free will <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>and choice — are otherwise, and within its system the application of irresistible impulse to determine sanity poses deeply troubling contradictions. The attempt to use it all too often finds the legal and medical professions talking at each other about different concepts designed for different purposes.</p>

Such an admission proceeds imperceptibly to the absurd result that the more strange and brutal the act the more likely the actor is to be relieved of its criminal consequences. Along the psychoanalytic continum the outrageous proves the innocence. In an oddly circular fashion the act establishes its cause as mental illness and the mental illness determines the act. Such analysis may be medically useful.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> It is not legally useful. As etiology is not congruent with proximate cause, mental illness is not congruent with insanity. Although we do not exclude expert medical testimony on causation because its definitions differ from ours, we do require that medical testimony speak to us in our language and we accept it only where the two concepts overlap. The same should be true of psychiatric testimony on mental illness as it relates to the various distinct issues on which sanity is legally relevant.</p>

It sweeps away as irrelevant all proferred evidence which cannot say that by reason of a disease of the mind the defendant did not and could not know the difference between right and wrong at the time the crime was committed. Hence, “irresistible impulse,” “diminished responsibility” are irrelevant, as is any evidence that is not offered to satisfy the structure of the <em>M’Naghten </em>Rule, including the litany recited by Justice Horace Stern in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neill, </em><a href="/pa/362/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="362 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="477351" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0507-01">362 Pa. 507</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%20276" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="67 A.2d 276">67 A.2d 276</a> (1949):</p>
