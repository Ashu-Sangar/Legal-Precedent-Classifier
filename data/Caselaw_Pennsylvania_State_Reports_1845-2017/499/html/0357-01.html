Appellant seeks a new trial, both on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective and on the contention that an inculpatory statement which he gave to police was the product of an unlawful arrest and hence inadmissible. After an evidentiary hearing with new counsel on post-verdict motions raising these claims, the court denied relief and sentenced appellant to a term of life imprisonment for murder of the first degree and a concur<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>rent term of five to ten years for criminal conspiracy.

The Commonwealth’s case against appellant was established largely through the testimony of Marjorie Hightower, an eyewitness to the killing. She testified that she had been sitting in her father’s car listening to the radio from approximately 11:00 to 11:30 p.m. on the day of the victim’s death. At some point during this period, she saw a man pursued by three others running toward her. At trial she identified one of the pursuers as appellant and one as “Butch,” both of whom she had previously known. She stated that she had not recognized the third pursuer or the victim.</p>
    <p id="b530-7" data-blocks='[["BL_530.7",530,[265,1152,1144,836]]]'>Marjorie Hightower testified that the victim fell to the ground at the corner of York and Napa Streets, whereupon Butch stabbed him and appellant kicked and punched him. The victim then got up and ran to the next corner, fell again, and was again stabbed by Butch and kicked and punched by appellant. She then went into her house and called the police. When she returned, she saw the victim lying on the sidewalk where he had fallen the second time. She then saw the victim get to his feet and run one block farther, at which point the concerted attack on him resumed, this time with appellant using a long iron pipe to beat the victim on the side of the head. The victim was later found lying on the sidewalk by a police officer responding to the telephone call. An autopsy revealed that the victim had died as a result of multiple head injuries and stab wounds in the back.</p>

However, the Commonwealth established through the testimony of Marjorie Hightower that the killing took place between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m., within six blocks of appellant’s home. Ebo’s testimony, therefore, could not have rebutted the inference that arose from the testimony of the Commonwealth’s eyewitness that appellant had left his home sometime after 11:00 p.m., met with Butch and another person about six blocks from appellant’s home, and then participated in the killing of Adolph Cooper.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The Commonwealth’s medical expert testified that in his opinion the cause of death had been “the combined effects of the head injuries and the stab wounds to the back.” He also stated that although the stab wounds “penetrated through the muscles of the back and ended up in the areas of the right kidney, where there was some bleeding,” the head injuries, which caused a crushing of the bony structures of the right side of the skull, were “more severe” than the stab wounds. In the face of this testimony, trial counsel’s decision not to cross-examine the medical expert on the issue of causation had a reasonable basis, as this decision avoided the possibility that the medical expert would reemphasize the severity of the <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>blows to the victim’s head.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Because the evidence at trial would not have justified such an instruction, counsel’s failure to make such a request cannot be deemed to have been ineffective. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant alleges that because trial counsel was court-appointed, his failure to utilize a court-appointed investigator to help locate Ebo constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Because we conclude that Ebo would not have been able to advance appellant’s alibi defense even if called to testify, appellant’s claim must be rejected.</p>

Appellant also asserts that, even though his mother did not actually see appellant, she should have been called instead of appellant’s stepfather, Vincent Taylor, the alibi witness called by the defense, because Taylor’s testimony was subject to impeachment through his prior criminal record. Notwithstanding Vincent Taylor’s prior criminal record, it was reasonable for trial counsel to conclude that the testimony of Taylor, who claimed to have seen appellant during the critical period, would be more helpful to appellant than the testimony of appellant’s mother.</p>

We note that even if counsel could have established that the stab wounds had. been the sole cause of death, such a showing would not have relieved appellant of liability. The Commonwealth’s eyewitness, Marjorie Hightower, testified that throughout the chase appellant had been an active participant, kicking and punching the victim each time the victim had fallen. This conduct would have rendered appellant liable as an accomplice for the stabbing of the victim. See 18 Pa.C.S. § 306(c); <em>Commonwealth v.
