    <p id="b479-11" data-blocks='[["BL_479.12",479,[170,1780,1144,555]]]'>The Commonwealth appeals from an order of the Superior Court granting appellee, John Ronald Dello Buono, post-conviction relief from judgments of sentence entered in 1975 after appellee pled guilty to charges arising from a series of robberies. The Superior Court granted appellee a trial on the theory that previous counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to object to a defective guilty-plea colloquy. Because the record establishes that appellee was informed of those constitutional rights essential to an understanding and voluntary waiver of a trial, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and reinstate the judgments of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[274,298,1144,529]]]'>
      <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>On March 5,1975, appellee tendered a plea of guilty to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County. In the presence of the court, appellee’s counsel conducted an on-the-record colloquy with appellee. At that time, appellee’s counsel failed to inform appellee that, if tried by a jury, a jury’s verdict of guilty would have to be unanimous and that appellee would be presumed innocent until found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The trial court adjourned the hearing and continued the matter until a pre-sentence report could be prepared.</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[275,860,1145,691]]]'>On May 2, 1975, the hearing resumed and the trial court conducted a second colloquy with appellee. In this colloquy, the court informed appellee of those rights which appellee’s counsel had failed to discuss during the March 5th colloquy and then asked appellee whether he adhered to his March 5th decision to enter a plea of guilty. After this second colloquy, the trial court determined, in light of both colloquies, that appellee’s plea of guilty to all charges was “knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily” entered. Accordingly, the Court accepted the plea and sentenced appellee to a term of ten to twenty-five years’ imprisonment. Appellee did not file a petition to withdraw his guilty plea and did not file a direct appeal.</p>

After an evidentiary hearing, the PCHA court denied relief and an appeal was taken to the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b481-5" data-blocks='[["BL_481.5",481,[169,580,1145,418]]]'>In granting appellee a new trial, the Superior Court proceeded on the premise that appellee’s plea had been accepted on March 5th. Thus the Superior Court concluded that only the March 5th colloquy, and not the subsequent colloquy of May 2nd, could be considered in determining whether appellee had voluntarily and understanding^ waived his right to trial. We granted the Commonwealth’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b481-6" data-blocks='[["BL_481.6",481,[168,1039,1145,684]]]'>Contrary to the Superior Court’s premise, the record establishes that the trial court did not accept appellee’s plea on March 5th, but instead expressly “continued” the matter until a later date. On May 2nd, prior to sentencing, the trial court stated that the determination of the voluntariness of appellee’s plea had been deferred pending a pre-sentence investigation and then proceeded to conduct a colloquy with appellee. During this colloquy, the court several times referred to the March 5th colloquy, asking petitioner if he recalled and understood the rights that had been explained to him by his counsel at that time. In addition, the trial court fully explained the juror-unanimity requirement and the presumption of innocence:</p>
