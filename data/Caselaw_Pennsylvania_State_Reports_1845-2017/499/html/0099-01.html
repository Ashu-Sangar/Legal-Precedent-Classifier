Accordingly, on December 30, 1980, she appeared at the intake office of the Erie County Domestic Relations Department and filled out a Complaint for Support which was dated and marked filed December 30, 1980. This complaint was taken to the Prothonotary in order to receive a civil number on January 29, 1981, fifteen days after the applicable six year statute of limitations had expired. The trial court held that the governing rule at the time required the complaint to be filed with the Prothonotary, not with the Domestic Relations Department. For this reason, the trial court concluded that the complaint was not timely filed, and the alleged father of appellee’s child, appellant Robert Susmarski, moved for dismissal of the complaint. Dismissal was denied, however, as the court declared the statute of limitations invalid.</p>

Since support for a child born in wedlock may be sought at any time during its minority, while support for a child born out of wedlock may, due to the statute of limitations on establishment of paternity, be sought during only the first six years of a child’s life, a disparity of treatment is alleged to exist in violation of equal protection guarantees.

Unlike <em>Mills, </em>wherein certain birth-related financial and emotional factors were cited as encumbering a mother’s filing of a paternity suit within twelve months of her child’s birth, the present case involves a period of limitation of such greater duration as to negate birth-related encumbrances. Furthermore, as pointed out by Justice Rehnquist in <em>Mills, </em>the existence of greater impediments to recovery of support for an illegitimate child than for a legitimate one is justified by the fact that the cases differ in one crucial respect: a suit on behalf of an illegitimate child contains the element of proof of paternity, while a suit on behalf of a legitimate child does not. While the passage of twelve months could not be regarded as appreciably increasing the likelihood of fraudulent claims, a lapse of more than six years may reasonably <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>be expected to coincide with prejudice to the defense through loss of evidence, the death or disappearance of witnesses, and the fading of memories.
