Mrs. Lila Fox, the operator of the agency, was interviewing Mrs. Loretta Collier when Howard entered. Shortly thereafter, appellant entered the office, spoke briefly with Howard, and left. Appellant later reentered the agency, showed Mrs. Fox a gun under his coat, and then ordered her into the rear office where, after being forced to undress, she was blindfolded, bound, gagged, and raped twice. Mrs. Collier was robbed, and company checks and other items were stolen. Appellant and his brother were arrested in their West Philadelphia apartment at approximately 9:00' p. m. that evening.</p>

Shortly after the arrest, the police placed appellant and his brother in a line-up of seven black males of similar age, height, weight, and complexion. Appellant was first and his brother sixth in line. Mrs. Fox, the rape victim, selected both brothers from the line-up; Mrs. Collier, however, identified only Howard. Mrs. Fox repeated her identifications at a preliminary hearing, at which Mrs. Collier again identified only appellant’s brother. After a suppression hearing, the trial court ruled that the procedures employed at both the line-up and the preliminary hearing were impermissibly suggestive, and suppressed the identifications resulting therefrom.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The court went on to determine that there were independent bases for in-court identifications of both brothers by Mrs. Fox and of appellant’s brother by Mrs. Collier.

Appellant’s second argument, also relying on Pa.R.Crim.P. 323(h), is that the admission of Mrs. Collier’s identification was error because the Commonwealth failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence at the suppression hearing that there would be an independent basis for that identification at trial.

Pa.R.Crim.P. 323 provides a single procedure for seeking the suppression of evidence alleged to have been obtained in violation of a defendant’s rights. Because Mrs. Collier had not identified appellant prior to the suppression hearing, there was no evidence appellant could have moved to suppress, nor any for which an independent basis could have been shown. Thus, under Pa.R.Crim.P. 323, the suppression court properly declined to rule on the admissibility of a possible identification of appellant by Mrs. Collier at trial. Similarly, the Commonwealth was not required at the time of the hearing to establish an independent basis for such an identification. The fact that it did not do so, therefore, cannot be said to amount to an implied representation as to Mrs. Collier’s testimony at trial. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v.

In the instant case, the issue of reliability did not become ripe for consideration until Mrs. Collier identified appellant at trial. When this occurred, defense counsel immediately moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied that motion and a motion to suppress the identification. During a subsequent <em>in camera </em>discussion with counsel, however, the trial court made an on-the-record determination that Mrs. Collier’s testimony at trial and the pre-trial suppression hearing, over which the same judge presided, established the existence of an independent basis for her in-court identification of appellant. Defense counsel had full opportunity to cross-examine Mrs. Collier on both occasions, and was permitted to argue the legal issues surrounding the identification during the <em>in camera </em>discussion. <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>For all practical purposes, therefore, a suppression hearing did take pla,ce.</p>

Having reviewed Mrs. Collier’s testimony, we are convinced that the trial court’s determination is supported by ample evidence. Applying the <em>Biggers </em>test to that evidence, we discover the following: The employment agency was well-lighted. The witness sat within two to three feet of appellant for two to three minutes as he spoke with Mrs. Fox, the rape victim. While initially inattentive and unable to observe appellant from the front, Mrs. Collier became frightened and attentive when she saw appellant pull a gun from his coat and force Mrs. Fox into the rear office. Mrs. Collier further observed appellant as he reentered the main office. From the testimony describing the layout of the employment agency, it is clear that she would have had a frontal view of appellant as he walked from the door of the rear office toward his brother, who was standing near her. In addition, the description Mrs. Collier gave the police shortly after the crime, while lacking in detail, was accurate. She expressed certainty as to her in-court identification, and was able to distinguish appellant from his brother by their respective roles in the crime. Only the fact that the trial began six months after the date of the crime fails to support the reliability of the in-court identification.</p>

The fact that neither pre-trial confrontation between Mrs. Collier and appellant gave rise to an identification is clearly relevant in assessing the suggestiveness of those confrontations. Further, it cannot be inferred from the mere fact that the same witness made an in-court identification that <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>those two brief exposures had a cumulative effect sufficient to trigger a delayed identification.

At some point where there are a number of identifications of an accused by persons witnessing an event, the improper admission of one of those identifications may properly be treated as being harmless. However, such is not the case where there are only two eyewitness identifications. In spite of the Commonwealth’s characterization of Mrs. Fox’s identification evidence against appellant as positive and unequivocal, it was within the province of the finder of fact to accept or reject it. <em>Commonwealth v. Arms, </em><a href="/pa/489/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="489 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1762385" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0035-01">489 Pa. 35</a>, <a href="/pa/489/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="489 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1762385" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0035-01">413 A.2d 684</a> (1980); <em>Commonwealth v. Rose, </em><a href="/pa/463/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="463 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1708024" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0264-01">463 Pa. 264</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="135" data-cite="463 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1708024" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0264-01">344 A.2d 824</a> (1975). It cannot be said that the concurring testimony of Mrs. Collier did not come to play in the jury’s acceptance of Mrs. Fox’s identification of appellant. Moreover, the remaining evidence linking appellant to the offense was circumstantial in nature and not as conclusive as an eyewitness identification, if believed. It, <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>therefore, cannot be said that the in-court identification did not contribute to the verdict and was therefore harmless.</p>

We note the majority vainly attempts to undercut the impermissibly suggestive quality of the lineup and preliminary hearing confrontations. However, by conceding the necessity of establishing the independent basis, they admit the impermissibly suggestiveness of the earlier confrontations. Moreover, we have recognized that confrontations wherein the accused is identified by his participation in the proceedings are highly suggestive. <em>Commonwealth v.
