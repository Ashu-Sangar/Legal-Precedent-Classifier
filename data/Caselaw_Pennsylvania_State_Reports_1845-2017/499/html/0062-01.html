    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[271,585,1144,1443]]]'>The instant case is here on appeal by allowance from a final order of the Commonwealth Court entered on July 13, 1979, affirming the December 30, 1977 order of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County. Common Pleas had reversed a Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (PLRB) order determining that the Bald Eagle Area School District (Appellee School District) committed an unfair labor practice when it refused to submit to arbitration a grievance filed by the Bald Eagle Area Education Association (Appellant Education Association). Without deciding the merits, the PLRB held that the matter was a proper subject of compulsory arbitration. Both the Common Pleas and Commonwealth Courts determined the issue in the case was not arbitrable because, in their view, any decision favorable to the Appellant Education Association would violate the policy prohibiting payment to public employees for any period in which they engaged in a strike. That policy is articulated in Section 1006, Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, No. 195, 43 P.S. § 1101.1006 (PERA). Bearing in mind the importance of prompt disposition of disputes and resolution of grievances under a collective bargaining agreement and the concomitant strong policy articulated in the PERA requiring the submission of such disputes to arbitration in the first instance, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court, 44 Pa.Cmwlth. 254, <a href="/citations/?q=403%20A.2d%201038" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="403 A.2d 1038">403 A.2d 1038</a>, and reinstate the order of the PLRB to proceed to arbitration.

Bald Eagle Area School District started the 1975-76 school year on Wednesday, September 3, 1975. On Friday, September 12,1975, the school district buses delivered the area pupils to school. Seven teachers arrived and looked after the pupils until they <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>were sent home, but the great majority of teachers were on strike.
