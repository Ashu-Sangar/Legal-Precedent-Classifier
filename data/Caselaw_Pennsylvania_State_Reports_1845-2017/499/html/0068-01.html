    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[188,409,1145,889]]]'>The appellants, Lawrence J. Fierst and his wife, Betty G. Fierst, (hereinafter “Fiersts”) conveyed certain real estate to appellee P. M. McArdle Land Development Co. (hereinafter “McArdle”) on February 27, 1976. On that same date, McArdle gave back to Fiersts a mortgage on the property in the amount of $330,000, which mortgage was duly recorded. The mortgage provided that it shall be “subordinate to the lien of any mortgage at any time whatsoever given by Mortgagor to any banking or lending institution <em>for the purpose of the development or further development of the property </em>...” (Emphasis added). Also on February 27, 1976, as a means of conferring authority to perform the provided-for mortgage subordinations, Fiersts executed and delivered to appellee Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Co. (hereinafter “Commonwealth”) an irrevocable power of attorney, deemed coupled with an interest, and duly recorded, granting Commonwealth power as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="AR4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.6",241,[234,1313,1100,573]]]'>to execute, acknowledge, deliver and record any and all documents necessary to postpone and subordinate that certain Mortgage dated February 27, 1976 from P.

An attorney for McArdle informed Commonwealth of the proposed mortgage, and proffered his opinion that the proposed financing was for “development or further development of the subject premises.” Regarding this statement as to the purpose of the proposed loan as an adequate assurance of compliance with the McArdle-Fierst mortgage’s conditions upon Commonwealth’s duty of postponement, yet choosing to ignore a demand made by Fiersts that no further mortgage postponements be performed,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Commonwealth responded that it would execute its agency to subordinate the McArdle-Fierst mortgage to the McArdle-Sentinel/Concord mortgage. Thus, on November 22, 1977, a closing was held on the $250,000 loan, Sentinel and Concord disbursing to McArdle all of the loan funds. Fearing that their security would be severely impaired by subordination of the McArdle-Fierst mortgage to the McArdle-Sentinel/Concord mortgage, and asserting that proceeds of the $250,000 loan were applied to payment of defaulting institutional mortgage debts owed’by McArdle rather than to “development or further development” of the property, Fiersts sought to prevent the proposed postponement. Hence, prior to Commonwealth actually executing the postponement, Fiersts filed a complaint in equity seeking to restrain Commonwealth from subordinating the McArdle-Fierst mortgage. A preliminary injunction was issued, which, following a hearing, was dissolved. The Court of Common Pleas, sitting en banc, sustained dissolution of the <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>injunction as well as dismissal of the complaint, a decision which was affirmed by the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[194,413,1145,1165]]]'>On appeal, the sole issue is the extent to which the power of attorney held by Commonwealth could properly be executed to effectuate the mortgage postponement in question. The Fiersts, averring that proceeds of the mortgage-secured loan from Sentinel and Concord were not in fact applied to development of the subject property,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> assert that Commonwealth lacks power to execute postponements favoring non-development mortgages. Appellees contend that although the McArdle-Fierst mortgage is, in express terms, subject to postponement only in respect to mortgages issued for development purposes, the absence of such an express restriction in the power of attorney held by Commonwealth, upon which reliance was placed in disbursing loan funds, empowered Commonwealth to execute postponements in favor of non-development mortgages. The courts below, viewing the issue presented as one necessitating a balancing of equities between Sentinel and Concord and the Fiersts, held that the more innocent of the parties were Sentinel and Concord, who, in issuing the loan to McArdle, relied upon the power of attorney, which, although making reference to the particular mortgage to be subordinated, did not expressly set forth the restriction in question.</p>

See also Restatement (Second) of Agency, § 167 (1958).

Furthermore, the existence of a limitation upon the authority conferred by the power of attorney issued to Commonwealth must be determined in light of the rule that such powers are to be strictly construed.

Junio, </em><a href="/pa/441/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="441 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1933841" data-case-paths="/pa/441/0222-01">441 Pa. 222</a>, 226, <a href="/citations/?q=272%20A.2d%20508" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="272 A.2d 508">272 A.2d 508</a>, 510 (1971). Without question, Sentinel and Concord had notice of the restriction upon Commonwealth’s authority to execute mortgage postponements. Indeed, the power of attorney upon which they relied made <em>express </em>reference to the McArdle-Fierst mortgage which contained the restriction. The recorded mortgage, a public document, provided notice to all concerned. Sentinel and Concord, as lending institutions contemplating a loan transaction, undoubtedly examined the McArdle-Fierst mortgage instrument, thereby acquiring unequivocal notice of the restriction therein. If, in fact, the mortgage document was not examined by appellees, they cannot be deemed faultless for neglecting to discover the extent to which the mortgage may be postponed. Strict construction of the grant of power, so as to incorporate the limitations upon lien subordination recited in the McArdle-Fierst mort<a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>gage, is consistent with a rule, long recognized by this Court, governing interpretation of powers of attorney: “Powers expressly granted will not be restricted by implication nor will a construction be made which will effectively defeat the very purpose of the agency.” <em>Nuzum, </em><a href="/pa/357/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="357 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="472056" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0531-01">357 Pa. at 533</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20402" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="55 A.2d 402">55 A.2d at 403</a>. To no extent is the restriction upon the scope of the power granted Commonwealth regarded as arising by implication. Rather, the power <em>expressly </em>authorized postponement only of “that certain Mortgage dated February 27, 1976 from P. M. McArdle . . .,” and, having unequivocal notice of the terms governing subordination of that mortgage, appellees are bound thereby. In addition, the very purpose of the agency, videlicet to facilitate postponement of a certain mortgage in the interest of obtaining <em>developmental </em>financing for the property, is defeated by the construction accorded the instant power of attorney by the courts below. Hence, we reverse and remand to the Court of Common Pleas for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

Subsequently, the McArdle-Fierst mortgage was subordinated to an additional $25,000 mortgage held by the same institution. In June of 1977, Fiersts informed Commonwealth that these two institutional mortgages, as well as the McArdle-Fierst mortgage, were in default. In addition, Fiersts notified Commonwealth that real estate taxes on the property were unpaid, and that execution procedures had commenced upon liens against the property obtained by certain contractors. Fiersts demanded that, under these circumstances, no further exercise of the irrevocable power of attorney be made.</p>
