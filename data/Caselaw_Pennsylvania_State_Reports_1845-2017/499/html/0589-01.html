Russell Kolins, a court-appointed investigator, testified that he was a licensed private detective and that, in order to obtain his license, he was subjected to an investigation by the district attorney’s office as to his character, integrity and standing in the community. He was called by the defense to testify that, <em>inter alia, </em>one prosecution witness who was an off-duty policeman refused to sign a statement identifying appellant as the assailant, and that the district attorney’s office pressured another witness to implicate appellant and this witness gave a false statement to the police and lied about his identity.</p>

Early in the trial, the court ruled evidence of this charge was inadmissible. Despite this ruling, the district attorney subsequently announced her intention to use evidence of this charge to impeach Kolins’ credibility, whereupon the court correctly reiterated the inadmissibility of such evidence, <em>Commonwealth v.

Despite the court’s ruling, the prosecutor asked <em>five </em>questions regarding this charge. Although repeated objections were sustained and limiting instructions given, the unavoidable effect of such conduct was to raise in the minds of the jurors the inference that the defense was harboring an unreliable witness — a witness who would suppress the truth and pervert the criminal justice system by tampering with witnesses. This Court has said, “Where counsel persists in intentionally seeking to inject incompetent evidence into the case such misconduct prevents a fair trial and warrants reversal.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Arguing appellant had thus put his character in issue, the prosecutor announced her intention to impeach appellant’s “reputation” evidence by prior convictions. These crimes were not crimen falsi and, thus, could not be admissible to impeach appellant’s credibility.

Notwithstanding, the careful trial judge sustained objections even to questions that might inferentially expose that conviction. Again the jury had no direct knowledge of his previous conviction.</p>
    <p id="b767-5" data-blocks='[["BL_767.5",767,[181,695,1145,678]]]'>The learned trial judge, who carefully, patiently and skillfully sat through four weeks of spirited trial was of the opinion that these and other occasions were de minimus. To read the over three thousand pages of testimony, replete with the care and patience Judge Geisz exercised, leaves no doubt that this defendant received a fair trial and was convicted by overwhelming credible evidence. To suggest that the passage of time dulled the trial judge’s memory of the texture and fabric of that trial is an arch gratutity. To make his careful admonitions to counsel, admonitions that he never conceived as subjected to scornful disobedience, a basis for a new trial, is to my mind unsupportable and accordingly I dissent.</p>
