On April 26, appellee failed to appear at a preliminary hearing on the charges, and a bench warrant for appellee’s arrest was issued. On May 3, the bench warrant was withdrawn and a new date for the preliminary hearing was scheduled. At two subsequently scheduled preliminary hearings the complaining witness failed to appear. On June <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>16, when the complaining witness failed to appear for a third time, the Commonwealth requested a continuance.

Appellee was rearrested on the basis of this second complaint on November 4, and a preliminary hearing was held on November 10, at which the complaining witness did not appear. Appellee was bound over for trial on the basis of the testimony of one of two police officers who claimed to have witnessed the alleged offenses.</p>

See Mental Health Procedures Act, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 817, § 402, 50 P.S. § 7402 (Supp.1982). On February 7, appellee was examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist and determined to be incompetent to stand trial because of his inability to assist in the preparation of his defense. On February 22, the court ordered a second examination, which indicated that appellee had regained the ability to assist in the preparation of his defense. A final determination was entered on May 5, 1977, when the court concluded that appellee was competent to stand trial. A non-jury trial commenced the next day, at which the Commonwealth proceeded solely on the basis of the testimony of the second police officer who had witnessed the alleged offenses. Appellee was found guilty of simple assault and possession of an instrument of crime, and acquitted of all other charges.</p>

Since the Superior Court’s decision in the present case, this Court has held that Rule 1100 should be tolled between the dismissal of a first complaint and the filing of a second complaint, except where “there is an obvious attempt to evade the requirements of Rule 1100(c) [ (governing applications of the Commonwealth for extensions of time) ] through the use of the <em>nolle prosequi </em>procedure.” <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth stresses the importance of the victim’s testimony in a robbery prosecution, but does not contend that it was not in possession of sufficient evidence to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case without such testimony on June 16, 1976. In light of the fact that the testimony of only one of the two arresting officers at the <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>November 10, 1977, hearing was ruled sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case against appellee on all charges, it seems clear that the Commonwealth could have proceeded at the June hearing. Instead, the attorney for the Commonwealth appeared with no witness for a third time and requested still another continuance so that he could again attempt to contact the complaining witness, explaining that the witness worked in a travelling circus, could be notified only through his family, and could appear only when he was “in the area.” The Commonwealth gave the court no assurance that it could secure the complainant’s attendance at any given time. Further, even with such assurance, the court would have been constrained by local rules of criminal procedure. Philadelphia Criminal Rule 800(III)(C) provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[302,1013,1100,98]]]'>III. Continuances may be granted in a preliminary hearing only as follows:</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b624-6" data-blocks='[["BL_624.6",624,[303,1178,1101,141]]]'>(C) In all preliminary hearings, including homicides, the Commonwealth, for valid cause, will be granted up to two continuances.</blockquote>
    <p id="b624-7" data-blocks='[["BL_624.7",624,[261,1344,1143,97]]]'>The Rules of the Philadelphia Municipal Court, in which the hearing was listed, are equally clear:</p>

    <p id="A8m" data-blocks='[["BL_624.10",624,[263,1729,1143,148]]]'>It is obvious that the Commonwealth had no reasonable expectation that a continuance would be granted and a dismissal avoided when it appeared at the scheduled hearing.</p>

Appellee cannot be faulted for objecting to a third continuance and moving for discharge under such circumstances, nor should he be prejudiced thereby in computing the time for trial under Rule 1100. This dismissal, moreover, worked to the Commonwealth’s obvious advantage. Its effect was to remove the proceedings from judicial <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>control, leaving the Commonwealth free to delay its prosecution of appellee indefinitely before filing a second complaint on identical charges. Had the Commonwealth gone forward with its evidence on June 16, 1976, and established its case, any delay in securing the complainant’s attendance at trial would have been subject to Rule 1100(c)’s due diligence requirements, and no extension would have been available without leave of the court. Since the Commonwealth offers no explanation for its four-month delay in filing a second complaint, or for its failure to make use of the complaining witness’s testimony in any proceeding, there is no support in the record for the notion that the prosecution exercised due diligence in bringing appellee to trial.</p>
    <p id="b625-4" data-blocks='[["BL_625.5",625,[173,982,1145,461]]]'>Thus I would hold that, because the Commonwealth acted with the intent to circumvent the operation of Rule 1100 in engineering the dismissal of the first complaint, the period between the dismissal of that complaint and the filing of the second must be included in the Rule 1100 computation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em><a href="/pa/467/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="467 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1717283" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0436-01">467 Pa. 436</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="467 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1717283" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0436-01">359 A.2d 174</a> (1976). The order of the Superior Court vacating appellee’s sentence and ordering his discharge should therefore be affirmed.</p>
