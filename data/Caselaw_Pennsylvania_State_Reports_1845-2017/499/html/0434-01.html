Our conclusion that the scope of the duty to employ competitive bidding imposed by section 2001(a) is limited to contracts involving expenditures of public funds is reinforced by the wording of section 2001(d). Section 2001(d) specifies “[t]he contracts or purchases made by the Commissioners involving an <em>expenditure </em>of over two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) which shall not require advertising or bidding as hereinbefore provided....” (emphasis added). The use of the word “expenditure” in this context demonstrates that section 2001 contemplates contracts involving the spending, and not the receipt, of money.</p>
