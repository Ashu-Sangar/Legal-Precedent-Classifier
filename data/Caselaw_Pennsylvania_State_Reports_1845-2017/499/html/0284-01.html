Hearings were held before Hearing Committee 1.02 [hereinafter cited as “Committee”] on August 4 and 5, 1981, and on January 20, 1982, the Committee unanimously recommended that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law. Exceptions were filed to the recommendation of the Committee, and a three-member panel of the Board heard oral argument. On June 11, 1982, the Board issued its report and recommendation, which adopted the Committee’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and concurred in the Committee’s recommendation that Respondent Tumini be disbarred from the practice of law.</p>

Through his activities in The Order of Brotherly Love, a fraternal organization, respondent met Anthony D. Pirillo, a formerly admitted attorney who was then president of the organization. Pirillo became Tumini’s closest friend and mentor, guiding him <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>through college and law school, and eventually hiring him to work in his law firm; first as a law clerk and later, in October, 1975, when Tumini was admitted to the bar, as an associate. In 1974 or 1975, Pirillo introduced Mr. Tumini to Augustine A. Salvitti, who was the Executive Director of Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority [hereinafter cited as “Authority”] at the time. In fact, at Pirillo’s request, Salvitti hired respondent to work at the Authority while Tumini concurrently was employed by Pirillo.</p>
    <p id="b457-4" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[180,794,1145,414]]]'>Respondent’s association with Pirillo and Salvitti led to his being involved in illegal activities. In late 1975, respondent “laundered” checks for Salvitti which totaled approximately $10,000.00. The checks were drawn on the accounts of various contractors with the names of the payees left blank. Respondent cashed and delivered the money to Salvitti in such a way as to leave no record of Salvitti’s receipt of the money.</p>
    <p id="b457-5" data-blocks='[["BL_457.6",457,[180,1227,1145,843]]]'>Another transaction arose out of litigation between the City of Philadelphia and Penrose Industries, Inc. [hereinafter cited as “Penrose”]. In December, 1973, Salvitti was appointed Executive Director of the Authority. At that time Philadelphia was involved in litigation with Penrose over a substantial piece of commercial property leased by Penrose. The Authority brought foreclosure proceedings against Penrose based upon Penrose’s default on the lease. Penrose sued the Authority and the city claiming there were mitigating circumstances for the default. The Authority proposed to make a monetary payment to Penrose in order to settle the litigation and obtain clear title to the property. Salvitti told William Sylk, president of Penrose, that settlement would be facilitated if Pirillo was hired as counsel for Penrose. Once Pirillo was retained by Sylk, Salvitti and Pirillo conspired to inflate the settlement.</p>

Pirillo received $93,500.00, representing his share from the settlement. Because of adverse publicity, Pirillo and Salvitti agreed that Pirillo would declare the money as a legal fee <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>for federal income tax purposes, pay the taxes on it, and thereafter evenly divide the remainder with Salvitti. On March 30 and May 7, 1976, Tumini, at Pirillo’s request, delivered cash payments of $15,000.00 and $12,500.00 to Salvitti. Respondent admitted knowing that the payment constituted a bribe of a public official.</p>
    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[272,637,1145,793]]]'>The Penrose transaction became the subject of a federal grand jury investigation for which respondent was subpoenaed. After invoking his privilege against self-incrimination, Tumini was granted immunity from prosecution by the United States District Court. At Pirillo’s request, respondent gave perjured testimony in which he denied knowledge of the fee-splitting arrangement between Pirillo and Salvitti, and of the March 30 and May 7 deliveries of cash to Salvitti. Afterward, respondent learned that Sylk, who had also given perjured testimony, had recanted his previous testimony and told the truth about the Penrose transaction. Under threat of prosecution for perjury, respondent recanted his own perjured testimony and cooperated with the grand jury investigation and the federal government’s subsequent prosecution of Salvitti.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
