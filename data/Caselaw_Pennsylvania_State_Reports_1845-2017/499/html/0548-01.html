    <blockquote id="b720-4" data-blocks='[["BL_720.5",720,[303,554,1104,1160]]]'>In September, 1977, a collective bargaining agreement was entered into between the District and the Union City Education Association (Association), collective bargaining representative of the District’s professional employees. That agreement remained in effect until June 30, 1979. Prior to the expiration of the agreement, however, negotiations for a new agreement began. On June 25, 1979, the Association submitted a written offer to the District to continue working on a day-to-day basis under the terms of the extant collective bargaining agreement. On August 13, 1979, the District’s Superintendent responded to that request, stating that the District would continue the. salaries, fringe benefits, and all other conditions and terms of employment, as provided in the last “teacher contract,” for an indefinite period of time under the condition “that the Union City Education Association agree to give the [School] Board a written notification five days before any work stoppage” by the teachers. The Association did not send a reply to the District’s letter; however, in a negotiating session the Association advised the District of ite intent to work under the existing agreement until September 15, 1979.</blockquote>

On that date, the claimants received their first paychecks from the District. The amount of each check was computed on the basis of the annual salary which each claimant had received during the 1978-79 school year. Despite a provision in the expired agreement for a “longevity raise,” an increment bestowed upon the employees at the beginning of the school term for their <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>extra year of service, the paychecks did not reflect an increase in salary.

    <blockquote id="b721-5" data-blocks='[["BL_721.6",721,[228,717,1103,630]]]'>At the start of the work stoppage, the claimants filed applications for unemployment compensation benefits. The Office of Employment Security denied claimant’s applications for the compensable weeks ending September 22,1979; and after a hearing, that denial was affirmed by a referee. The claimants appealed to the Board, which on April 24, 1980, affirmed the referee’s decision. Subsequently, the claimants filed a Petition for Review with this Court and the matter was remanded to the Board for reconsideration of its decision. On October 7, 1980, the Board vacated its earlier ruling and reversed the referee’s decision, thereby awarding claimants benefits.</blockquote>
