The Legislature charged the Department of Health (Department) with fostering a sound, coordinated health care system. This litigation concerns the validity of the Department’s ruling that a certificate of need must first be obtained by the Shenango Valley Osteopathic Hospital (Hospital) before purchase and use of a Computerized Tomography scanner (C.T. scanner). The principal question on appeal<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> is whether the hospital had a clear right to the special relief from the Department’s ruling afforded it by the Commonwealth Court.</p>

The Hospital accepted delivery of the C.T. scanner on August 20,1981 and made an additional payment leaving a balance of 10% due upon installation. The Act required certificates of need for new institutional health services,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> including (at that time) capital expenditures in excess of $150,000.00, and/or an operating <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>expense in excess of a $82,200 threshold.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The Act mandates the filing of a notice of intent prior to the institution of a project for services or the acquisition of equipment which require a certificate of need.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> On August 4, 1981, the Hospital supplied the Department and Health Systems Inc. of N.W.

      <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>Almost two months later (September 29, 1981), the Hospital sought to withdraw without prejudice its letter of intent. The letter of withdrawal assumed that the new thresholds of $600,000 for capital expenditures and $250,000 for operating expenses established under the federal Omnibus Budget Reconcilation Act of 1981, P.L. 97-35, § 936 (effective October 1, 1981) (Omnibus Act) automatically negated the necessity of a certificate of need review for this transaction. The letter, ignoring the reality that the contract had been entered into and substantially performed prior to the increase of those thresholds, implied that an intended acquisition would be made under the new thresholds. The Department, relying on the facts set forth in the letter of withdrawal, nevertheless contended that the obtaining of a certificate of need was still required under section 701(a)(3), <em>supra, </em>relating to a capital expenditure which results in the addition of a health service not provided in the previous 12 months. Moreover, the Department did not address the applicability of the new Omnibus Act thresholds to completed transactions because the Hospital had withheld the fact of its completed purchase of the C.T. scanner. On November 2, 1981 the Department learned for the first time the true facts surrounding the purchase of the scanner.</p>

On November 19, 1981 the Department notified the Hospital that under the circumstances its acquisition of the C.T. scanner was a violation of the Act and operation of the scanner would be deemed a wilfull violation subject to penalties. On December 17,1981 counsel for the Department informed the Hospital that in order to cease violating the Act, the Hospital should divest itself of ownership and possession of the scanner or obtain a certificate of need. Thereafter, on January 25, 1982 the Hospital filed an application for a certificate of need and also moved for a continuance of its appeal from the determination of reviewability. The motion for continuance was granted.</p>

The thrust of the Hospital’s constitutional objection was that the delegation of authority to the Department under the Act contravenes Art. 2, Section 1 of the Pa.
