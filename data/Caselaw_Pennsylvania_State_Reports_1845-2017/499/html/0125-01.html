    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[290,554,1144,458]]]'>However, the record is insufficient in this regard, primarily as a result of the earlier misconception of the standard to be employed. Additionally, the referee did not rule upon the Supervisors’ claim of ineligibility under section 401(d). In the event that additional testimony fails to establish ineligibility under section 402(b)(1), the Supervisors would be entitled to a determination under section 401(d). Thus, we agree with Judge Craig that the appropriate disposition is to remand the cause to the Board.</p>
