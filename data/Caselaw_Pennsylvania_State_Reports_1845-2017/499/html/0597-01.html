This is an appeal by the Commonwealth from the Order of the Superior Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> granting the defendant a new trial on the determination that two color slides of the victim depicting the injuries sustained were erroneously admitted at trial.

They walked in the general direction of the crime scene. Later, the fifteen-year-old defendant, no longer wearing the yellow jacket, was seen entering a taproom where he washed his hands. At approximately 10:30 P.M. that evening, the battered body of the victim was found in a dark, abandoned area behind a vacant factory within blocks of where he was seen with the defendant. Slacks around his ankles, undershorts pulled up around his waist, the boy was pronounced dead at the scene. His shirt, stained with feces and semen, was on the ground four feet away. Near the boy’s shirt was a large black, “bush type,” comb with <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>“Shank” scratched on the handle. A yellow jacket with a round, blue emblem was found one and one-half days later not far from the scene. Stained with both blood of the victim’s type and semen consistent with the defendant’s type, the jacket was identified as the one worn by the defendant when he was seen calming the victim and walking in the general direction of the vacant factory.</p>

The second slide shows the buttocks of the victim, spread by the fingers of the examiner to reveal the four tears of the anal area, ranging from one-half to five-eighths of an inch in length. Both of these slides are clinical in nature, taken during the course of a postmortem examination, and after the body was cleansed of all blood, dirt and fecal matter.</p>

After viewing and considering the slides, we conclude that the value of this evidence in establishing both sodomy, as a motive for the killing, and the brutality of the beating, thus allowing an inference of an intent to kill in support of the verdict sought by the Commonwealth of murder of the first degree, fully compensates for any likelihood that such clinical evidence may inflame the passions of the jury.</p>

In assessing the intent of the actor in a case of criminal homicide, be it to inflict serious bodily injury or to kill,'the fact finder who deals in such an intangible inquiry must be aided to every extent possible. In this light, then, the use of the image of the victim which depicted a large gaping deep gash on the top of the head, rendered with such force as to splay the skin of the <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>scalp apart, a similar though smaller gash above the right eye, as well as extensive bruising of the left side of the face, was essential as evidence of intent beyond mere infliction of bodily injury. The second slide demonstrates the brutality and forcefulness of the sodomization of the child, thus establishing the motive to forever silence the crying, indignant victim.</p>
    <p id="b773-5" data-blocks='[["BL_773.5",773,[169,648,1144,650]]]'>The essential nature of the evidence is further established by the absence of any evidence of intent aside from the condition of the body. This type of evidence is conveyable to the jury only to a limited degree by verbal testimony of a technical nature by the medical examiner. The availability of alternate evidence, thus, does not obviate the admissibility of photographs, and, here, the absence of alternative evidence a <em>fortiori </em>commends the court’s admission of the slides. Accordingly, the trial judge’s admission of the slides was clearly proper due to the essential evidentiary value of the images as balanced against the limited degree of likelihood of inflaming the jury.</p>
