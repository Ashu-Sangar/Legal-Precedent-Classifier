    <p id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.6",174,[286,721,1146,884]]]'>The instant action resulted from the Department’s attempted termination of the 1981-1982 contract and withdrawal of recognition of EMSC. The underlying basis was a dispute between the Department and EMSC over the designation of one of two area hospitals to serve as the area’s “trauma” center. In August 1981, the Department signed and returned to EMSC the 1981-1982 contract, with a retroactive effective date of July 1, 1981. However, at the same time, the Department informed EMSC that it intended to terminate the contract as of October 1, 1981. The purpose of the October 1, 1981, termination date was to reimburse EMSC for first quarter expenditures. On September 1, 1981, the Department notified EMSC that it was withdrawing EMSC’s recognition as an emergency health services council. EMSC requested a hearing on the termination of the contract and the withdrawal of recognition, to which no response was received.</p>
    <p id="b174-6" data-blocks='[["BL_174.7",174,[283,1623,1145,467]]]'>On September 29, 1981, EMSC filed a petition for review and application for special relief requesting the Commonwealth Court to enjoin the Department from terminating the contract or withdrawing recognition. After an <em>ex parte </em>hearing, the court temporarily enjoined the Department from terminating the contract or withdrawing recognition pending a hearing scheduled for October 9, 1981. Thereafter the court held the hearing on preliminary relief, and granted such relief by order dated October 9, 1981.</p>

The second order granted the same relief as the first, but required EMSC to post bond and submit certain information to the Department. The Department discontinued its appeal from the dissolved order and filed the instant appeal from the order of November 10, 1981. Initially, the Department claims the Commonwealth Court lacked jurisdiction over the instant action because EMSC’s claims flowed from a contractual relationship existing with the Department and therefore jurisdiction was lodged exclusively with the Board of Arbitration of Claims.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

However, in this lawsuit, the continuing eligibility of EMSC for grant status is not being questioned, rather, the controversy focuses upon the right of the department to terminate an existing contract before the expiration of the contract term. The legal consequences that flow from recognition and a grant of a contract is not ancillary to the contract, but rather requires a determination <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>of the nature of the obligations created by the contract. Appellee has attempted to create the illusion that derecognition and termination offended some ephemeral statutory right distinct from the contract and thereby attempts to disguise what in essence is no more than a request to specifically perform a contract.</p>
    <p id="b176-4" data-blocks='[["BL_176.5",176,[276,633,1145,681]]]'>An analysis of the statute clearly reflects the fallacy of the proffered jurisdictional argument. Section 3(a) provides that the Secretary of Health may enter into contracts with “eligible entities” to organize emergency health service councils. The definition for an “eligible entity” is set forth in section 7(a) which, in turn, includes <em>“any </em>non-profit entity.” <em>See </em>Section 7(a)(4). The non-profit status of EMSC is not here being challenged. Once a contract is entered into “no other ... contract may be entered into ... for the same area...” Section 3(b). The exclusivity of the operation flows from the entering into the contract with the department, not as appellees would suggest a declaration of recognition.</p>
