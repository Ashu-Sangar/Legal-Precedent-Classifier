    <p id="b539-4" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[191,385,1144,1046]]]'>Appellant was employed by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (“Department”) as a construction inspector. His designation was “C.I. II,” under which he was eligible to perform both office and outdoor work. For approximately nine and one-half years, until the age of 65, appellant continued to be classified as C.I. II, performing mostly office duties. On December 18, 1977, appellant was informed that he would be reassigned to outdoor work. In order to challenge this reassignment, appellant obtained medical certificates showing that he had paralysis and circulatory problems which inhibited his capacity to perform physical labor. As a consequence of his physical problems, appellant took sick leave on January 1, 1978. During the following February, appellant was offered a position to work at a construction site in Downington, Pennsylvania, approximately 39 miles from his home. Appellant refused this offer, claiming that he could not drive long distances due to his circulatory problems. On May 3, 1978, appellant submitted a form stating that he voluntarily resigned from the Department.</p>

The referee denied his application and appellant then appealed to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (hereinafter “Board”) which affirmed the referee’s ruling. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board, resulting in the instant appeal. <em>Steffy v.

Secondly, by rejecting the possibility that appellant’s own testimony and the supporting medical documents he produced may have been adequate to sustain the burden of proof, it implicitly requires a physician’s testimony, notwithstanding the fact that appellant offered four medical documents in support of his claim that health problems justified his termination.</p>

Because only “competent evidence” is required, the court below, misapplied <em>Deiss.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b541-7" data-blocks='[["BL_541.8",541,[172,1226,1146,1107]],["BL_542.1",542,[272,303,1140,143]]]'>The second major flaw in the opinion of the court below is that it discounts the value of the documentary evidence which appellant offered in addition to his own testimony. This evidence consisted of four medical documents containing statements of treating physicians concerning appellant’s health problems. <em>See </em>Record, Item # 5. <em>See also, </em>Employee’s Exhibit No. 1. Together with appellant’s testimony, these documents were offered in support of appellant’s claims that he had suffered a stroke which caused circulatory problems and partial paralysis of his left hand. Appellant did not have a physician testify, but through his own testimony and through the submission of medical documents, he claimed that these medical problems inhibited his capacity to perform outdoor work or drive long distances. <em>See </em>Notes of Testimony at 10, 14. In reviewing this evidence, the court below reasoned that the absence of “competent medical evidence,” i.e., the testimony of a physician, despite appellant’s presentation of numerous medical documents, barred his claim under 402(b)(1). Not only, as we have already observed, is there no absolute requirement of competent <em>medical </em>evidence under <em>Deiss, </em>but it is likewise unneces<a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>sary that every applicant present a physician’s testimony to support his claim for health-related unemployment benefits. <em>See Deiss.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[271,518,1145,752]]]'>The distinction between “competent evidence” under <em>Deiss </em>and the “competent medical evidence” requirement articulated in the opinion of the court below is vital. The former is a broader standard which allows an applicant to meet the burden with his own testimony and supporting documents. The latter is a more stringent requirement which could result in the denial of benefits simply because an applicant fails to provide the expert testimony of a physician even where such testimony would be superfluous or cumulative. The broader standard more effectively comports with this Court’s view that the Unemployment Compensation Law must be liberally and broadly construed. <em>See Gladieux Food Services, Inc. v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa/479/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="479 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1742098" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0324-01">479 Pa. 324</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="479 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1742098" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0324-01">388 A.2d 678</a> (1978).</p>

On the contrary, there may appear before the Court cases where the applicant’s testimony and supporting documents are inadequate. <em>See Shearer v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>26 Pa.Cmwlth. 444, <a href="/citations/?q=364%20A.2d%20516" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="364 A.2d 516">364 A.2d 516</a> (1976) (an applicant’s claim of nervous exhaustion caused by harassment from, co-employees unsupported by medical testimony was not a necessitous and compelling reason under § 402(b)(1)). <em>See also, Kernisky v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>10 Pa.Cmwlth. 199, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20181" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="309 A.2d 181">309 A.2d 181</a> (1973); <em>Tollari v.

Our objection to the “competent medical evidence” standard fashioned by the court below is that it establishes an inflexible rule which demands that all applicants with health-related unemployment claims comply with the same <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>requirement of producing expert medical testimony, regardless of the individual circumstances of each case.
