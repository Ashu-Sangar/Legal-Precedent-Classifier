If they do not, then the principle of democratic government embedded in the common law prevails. We must presume the Legislature knows so elementary a rule and would clearly act to alter it where they see a need. That they have done so in specific instances is witness to their knowledge and intention. The majority obviously desires to believe the Legislature intended to alter the rule and to prove the point has sailed around the Horn to reach Lake Erie. We are treated to analogies from the body politic, the parsing of adjectival clauses and the admittedly inconclusive view of text writers and popular manuals of parliamentary procedure. The majority became so entrenched in their own labors that they overlooked the proofs they present. Indeed they do prove that the Legislature knows the uses of specific language to alter the common law rule. Mr. Justice Hutchinson has marshalled the instances where they could not be clearer. When one contrasts the section in question with his examples, the difference is conclusive. In all examples offered the Legislature said “all the members,” in Section 413(a), 53 P.S. § 41413(a) they simply said “the members”.

They chose that <em>all </em>the members originate a resolution and that <em>the </em>members under the common law rule, vote by two-thirds to override a veto.

The majority points out with misgivings, that a resolution vetoed can be passed upon re-consideration by a lesser number than required to pass it originally. While that is true, it is also true that the will of six ought not be stymied by one who deliberately or otherwise absents himself. That the Legislature saw the problem is clear because they raised the proportion of votes necessary to override a veto from a majority to a two-thirds vote.
