In 1978, a newly elected mayor appointed an individual in the position of Superintendent of Police for the City of Scranton who, although well qualified for the position, did not come from the ranks of the Scranton Police Department. The collective bargaining representative for the city’s police officers, the Fraternal Order of Police (F.O.P.) instituted an action in mandamus requesting the removal of the mayor’s appointee and the appointment of a person in accordance <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>with the clause in question. Subsequent to the filing of an answer, the F.O.P. filed a motion for preemptory judgment. After hearing upon the motion, the trial court issued an order dismissing the mandamus action.

In reaching this conclusion, we observed that the collective bargaining process was applied to the public sector on the premise that it would further harmonious relationships between the public employer and the employe and thereby result into a more effective and efficient operation for the taxpayer.

Thereafter the provision was continued in effect through calendar years 1975-76, 1977 and 1978, as part of the collective bargaining agreement and subsequent binding arbitration awards between the parties. Until the instant complaint was raised, the legality of the provision was not questioned. For the year <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>1973, wherein the contested provision was first agreed upon, the police officers accepted a contract which did not provide for any increase in wages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It would be difficult to envision a more appropriate case for imposing this concept of estoppel.</p>

That principle is directed to the bad faith effort on the part of an outgoing administration to attempt to handcuff their successor. The instant facts are clearly distinguishable. The term in question was agreed upon long before the newly elected mayor’s administration was contemplated. Moreover, we are not here faced with the selection of an individual by a preceding administration, but rather a designation of the class from which that individual is to be selected. It is to be noted, there is nothing in this record that would suggest that the new administration could not obtain from this class an appointee of the competence it sought and possessing the political philosophy it desired. It also must be remembered that the provision was only binding for the year of 1978, which would have permitted the newly-elected mayor, who was entering a four-year term, to delay the selection of a new chief until the expiration of that contract. At the end of that contract period, the new administration was obviously free to decline to agree to this or any other provision it determined to be in conflict with its policy. Thus, through the bargaining process, the withdrawal of this term would be accommodated by some other concession by the governmental unit employer which would produce an agreement where each party is provided an equal opportunity to fashion <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>an agreement in their best interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellant claims that it agreed to a pay freeze for the 1973 year as consideration for the concession from former mayor Eugene Peters with regard to the selection of <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>the chief of police.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> In fact, as appellant acknowledges, the 1973-74 agreement between appellant and Mayor Peters was performed according to its terms: the chief of police was selected from within the ranks of the Scranton Police Department. From 1975 through 1977, the remaining years of the Peters administration, contracts between appellant and the City of Scranton were reached through arbitration awards, not by collective bargaining. In each of those years the police of Scranton were granted a pay raise, and throughout the period Mayor Peters, in his discretion, continued to accord the police the “benefit” of a chief selected from within their ranks. Surely, having received the benefit of its 1973-74 bargain through 1977 in addition to subsequent pay raises, appellant cannot reasonably claim that a new mayor assuming office in 1978 is legally bound by appellant’s forgoing of a pay raise in 1973 or by the previous administration’s gratuitous acquiescence from 1975 to 1977 in a contract term for which it did not bargain.</p>

It is also clear that the court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion in concluding that appellant Fraternal Order of Police failed to establish a clear legal right to the relief sought and the existence of a corresponding duty on the part of the mayor to act, essential requirements for the issuance of the extraordinary writ of mandamus.
