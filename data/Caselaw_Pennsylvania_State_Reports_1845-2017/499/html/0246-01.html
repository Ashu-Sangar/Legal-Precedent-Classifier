The fact that such parcels of land are exempted from the definition of the “subdivisions” that may be regulated pursuant to Article V, however, does not infer that such parcels are to be exempted from the separate and distinct general power conferred by Article YI of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10601, enabling municipalities to enact zoning regulations.</p>

Article V contemplates regulations governing the <em>process </em>of land development commencing with requirements for obtaining approval of subdivision plats. Subdivisions of land, for agricultural purposes, into parcels of ten or more acres were exempted from the scope of municipal regulatory authority under Article V in order to excuse such subdivisions from compliance with the requirement of filing, for approval, plats setting forth proposed subdivisions.

To no extent is the ordinance merely a regulation of the <em>process </em>of subdividing land within the Township to assure that adequate improvements are planned to satisfy the needs of development.

On appeal to Commonwealth Court from the decision of the Court of Common Pleas holding the zoning ordinance unconstitutional, Commonwealth Court held this legislative limitation of the scope of judicial review to be invalid as an unconstitutional transgression of the separation of powers. <em>See Marbury v.

The essence of appellees’ allegations as to the constitutional infirmity of the ordinance in question, however, could aptly be summarized as being that the zoning provisions, in the words of Section 1011(l)(b), are “not reasonably related to the municipality’s authority” to enact land use restrictions promotive of the goals set forth in that Section. Since the reasons given by the Court of Common Pleas and by Commonwealth Court for invalidating the ordinance, i.e., that its provisions are arbitrary, unreasonable, and not substantially related to agricultural preservation, and that the provisions produce <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>“irrational results unrelated to lawful land use control purposes”, respectively, are encompassed within the grounds set forth in Section 1011(l)(b) for invalidation of zoning ordinances, the limits on judicial review set forth in that Section do not, as applied to this case, constitute an unconstitutional restriction. Specifically, the reasonable relation to municipal authority required of an ordinance under Section 1011(l)(b) does not allow regulations to be sustained which are irrational, arbitrary, or <em>unreasonably restrictive. </em>The determinations of the courts below that the instant zoning ordinance lacks a substantial relation to the preservation of agricultural land, and that irrational results are incurred by application of the ordinance, are the equivalent of findings that the zoning provisions are not reasonably related to Hopewell Township’s authority to determine its physical growth pattern in such a manner as to protect the agricultural character of that community. Thus, ordinances which too severely, or indiscriminately, restrict landowners’ rights violate Section 1011(l)(b). Irrespective of the potential for Section 1011(1) to unconstitutionally transgress the separation of powers when applied to hypothetical allegations of an ordinance’s invalidity not here presented, we believe the Commonwealth Court erred in presently holding the provision to be invalid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

A conclusion that an ordinance is valid necessitates a determination that the public purpose served thereby adequately outweighs the landowner’s right to do as he sees fit with his property, so as to satisfy the requirements of due process.

In the instant case, no significant doubt may be entertained as to the worthwhile nature of the objective of Hopewell Township’s effort to preserve agricultural land. The Zoning Hearing Board, and the courts below, were amply supported by evidence of record in concluding that the Township’s agricultural lands are worthy of preservation, that the goal of preserving prime agricultural land is a sound one, consistent with national, regional, state, and local needs, and that zoning ordinances designed to achieve preservation of that land are appropriate subjects for municipal enactments. However, the restrictions on landowner rights imposed by the ordinance in question are too severe to be regarded as “clearly necessary” when their burdens are balanced against the public interest sought to be <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>protected; hence, they do not meet the standard constitutionally required of municipal zoning ordinances.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[281,411,1146,1635]]]'>The zoning scheme of Hopewell Township unquestionably has <em>some </em>relationship to the goal of preserving farmland, merely by reason of the fact that tracts of such land are restricted in the extent to which they can be diverted to non-agricultural uses. The infirmity of the ordinance, therefore, arises not from a perception that its effect is unlikely to be promotive of agriculture; rather, the deficiency is the failure of the municipality to use less restrictive means of furthering the goal of agricultural preservation. By limiting residential subdivisions in the prime agricultural zone of the Township to a maximum of five IV2 acre plots <em>regardless </em>of the size of the original tract, an unreasonably severe limitation is placed upon permissible land uses. As applied to the 140 acre tract of appellees, the ordinance would permit creation of a 7*/2 acre residential development with a residual agricultural lot comprising 132V2 acres. The need to preserve an agricultural tract as large as 132y2 acres, and the detriment to agriculture to be incurred by allowance of further subdivisions, are not so clearly established as to necessitate the zoning restrictions imposed. With regard to the correlation between lot size and efficiency of land utilization, the Zoning Hearing Board made the following finding of fact: “Productivity of farms and efficiency of farming operations would be decreased by the division of productive farms into ten (10), twenty (20) or less than fifty (50) acre tracts ...” Notwithstanding a relationship between tract size and efficiency of production, the public interest in preventing irretrievable loss of agricultural land does not presently warrant overriding appellees’ interest in using the land in a less restricted manner, including their right to use property in less than the most efficient manner.</p>

The tract size in existence on the effective date of the ordinance was <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>selected as a tract size to be preserved and which would be permitted to absorb subdivision to the extent of developing a “minor residential land development” comprising “five or fewer . . . dwelling units” without regard to the size of the tract so regulated. Such an arbitrary designation of tract size is argued to be consistent with the goal of maintaining tracts as large as possible with the auxiliary benefit being a likelihood that the tracts will continue to be used for agricultural purposes. However, an ordinance which does not bear alike on all persons living within the territory zoned, without a reasonable basis for the disparity of treatment, is discriminatory in application and cannot be justified under the police power. See <em>White’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/287/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="287 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1099652" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0259-01">287 Pa. 259</a>, 268, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.%20409" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="134 A. 409">134 A. 409</a> (1926). Under the scheme of the Hopewell Township ordinance, the owner of a small tract of land may devote a greater percentage of his total acreage to single-family dwellings than the owner of a large tract. Landowners of smaller tracts, therefore, bear a lesser burden of regulation in that a lesser percentage of their tracts are irretrievably devoted to agricultural uses than the percentage of tracts so devoted of landowners of large tracts. The public interest in preservation of farmland is insufficient to justify such a great disparity of treatment between large and small landowners; thus, the disparate burdens lack a reasonable basis. This discriminatory effect results from the mere circumstance of tract size on the effective date of the ordinance and from the limit of five residential lots which may be established without regard to the overall size of the tract. Were the ordinance to permit the dedication of one IV2 acre lot to a single-family residence per each x number of acres in the tract, this scheme would have a more equitable effect and would avoid impacting landowners on an arbitrary basis. Hence, because of the discriminatory effect between different landowners, we conclude that the ordinance, by limiting development to an arbitrary number of dwelling units without regard to the size of the original tract, is invalid.</p>
