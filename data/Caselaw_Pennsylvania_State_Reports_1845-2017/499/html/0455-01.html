Sess., P.L. (1937) 2897, as amended, 43 P.S. § 802(b)(1) (Supp. Pamphlet). Thereafter, a hearing was held before a referee and the denial of benefits was upheld by both the referee and the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review.

Accordingly, we conclude that appellant left his work with Engineered Masonry based upon cause of a necessitous and compelling nature and that the Commonwealth Court erred in holding to the contrary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In this regard, we note our disapproval of the Commonwealth Court’s reliance upon the “common knowledge” that “the nature of the construction business requires workers to change job sites periodically and that the jobs may not necessarily be in the same town. It is also the very nature of construction work that many of the jobs are of short duration.” <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Pa.%20Commw.%20418" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="54 Pa.

Judges may not substitute their version of “common knowledge” for evidence of record in the case. There was no evidence to support the Commonwealth Court’s assumptions in this case; to the contrary, there was evidence that appellant did not know when he began working for Engineered Masonry that he might have to move when the construction in Shamokin was completed.</p>

Our determination under § 402(b)(1), that appellant voluntarily left his work with Engineered Masonry based upon cause of a necessitous and compelling nature, included a consideration of those factors which define suitable work. The same facts which support our determination under § 402(b)(1) also support a finding that Engineered Masonry’s offer to appellant of work in Darby did not constitute an offer of suitable work. Thus, appellant would not be ineligible for unemployment compensation under § 402(a) for refusing to accept an offer of suitable work.</p>
