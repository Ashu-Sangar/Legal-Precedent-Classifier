The van either broke down or was parked on the right hand side of Route 61. Shortly after 6:30 P.M., a passing motorist saw the van and two men, one of whom she identified as Webber, who was hitchhiking at that time. The van was again observed in the early morning hours of February 2 in the same location by a state trooper who confirmed that it was registered in Webber’s name.</p>

The victim, who normally would have reached the volleyball game at about 7:00 P.M. or 7:15 P.M., never arrived.</p>

The car straddled the obstacle which lodged beneath the car between the left and right tires. They drove the car to the side of the road, dragging <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>the obstacle beneath the car.

At about 1:30 A.M. on February 2, defendant, Webber, and the four men left the bar and drove the victim’s car and a van to the coal strippings outside Nanticoke where they drank beer and smoked marijuana in the van. While there, Webber attempted to sell the victim’s car. No one present being capable of paying even the nominal sum Webber sought, Webber was asked why he would sell it for so little. In response, Webber and defendant admitted that the car was stolen and that they had shot a man. At trial, three of the four other men testified that defendant repeatedly said “ <em>We </em>shot a guy.” Following the admission as to the shooting, and apparently sensing disbelief from the group, Webber pulled the handgun from his belt, displayed it and removed the clip which still contained two live cartridges. He ejected a third cartridge from the chamber, and counted these three remaining cartridges, implicitly noting the absence of three already-fired cartridges. When one of the four, Cyron, <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>asked to handle the gun, Webber was reluctant but was persuaded by another who stated “Go ahead and let him see it because he was in prison for firearms already.” Thereafter, Webber again attempted to sell the car, and, there being no offers received, asserted that he would just “blow it up” as it was of no use to him. After careening through the banks of the stripping area and leaving the car stranded, Webber returned to the van, sold the car’s citizen band radio to one of the four, and the group planned means of aiding Webber and the defendant in stealing another car. They left the area, eventually heading toward Wilkes Barre.</p>

Eventually, these three attracted police attention and were arrested in Wilkes Barre and taken to police headquarters, the defendant and Wilushewski riding in a police van, Webber in a police cruiser. During the ride to headquarters, the defendant was quoted as saying: “I hope you know we are both in trouble now, so if you want to, stick up for yourself, or if you want to, help us out because we stole a car tonight and we shot a guy, we wasted a guy.” The defendant then explained that he and Webber were hitchhiking when they were picked up by the victim, and that they compelled him to drive north on Interstate 81, ordered him to take an exit, told him to get out of the car, and that Webber shot him. Defendant then asked Wilushewski to aid him in fabricating an alibi that he was with the defendant in the bar in Nanticoke all afternoon and evening. Wilushewski refused and relayed this entire conversation to the police when he was removed from the police van.</p>

To determine the kind of homicide of which the accomplice is guilty, it is necessary to look to his state of mind; the requisite mental state must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to be one which the accomplice harbored and cannot depend upon proof of intent to kill only in the principal. LaFave and Scott, <em>Criminal </em>Law, 1972. “[A] person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to each material element of the offense.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 302(a). The trier of fact found that the defendant had the requisite mental state to convict of murder of the first degree and other charges.

      <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>Proof of mental state is quite often difficult, and the evidence here, relevant to whether defendant bore the intent requisite to murder of the first degree, is circumstantial. In the context of the events and conversation in the van, defendant’s repeated boasting statements that <em>“We </em>shot a guy,” constitute an admission of complicity in that act; one who revolted from the act would not attempt to vaunt oneself in the eyes of peers by admissions of complicity. Furthermore, defendant’s admissions in the police van to Wilushewski again ratify defendant’s earlier participation in the murder. Specifically, he said to Wilushewski, “I hope you know we are both in trouble now, so if you want to, stick up for yourself, or if you want to, help us out because <em>we </em>stole a car tonight and <em>we </em>shot a guy, <em>we </em>wasted a guy.” (Emphasis added.) At this point, aware of the imminence of interrogation, a time at which we might expect that an accomplice would begin to reassess earlier events, view them in a different light, and assert a lack of complicity, the defendant still admitted that he participated in and shared responsibility for the murder. These admissions of participation, declarations against penal interest, permit an inference, by the jury, of the existence of the requisite intent to kill.</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[184,1532,1144,795]],["BL_578.1",578,[260,282,1141,88]]]'>Accordingly, the absence of direct evidence as to what occurred in the victim’s car prior to and at the time the victim was forced out and shot, does not preclude a finding by the jury of culpability in the defendant, as inferred from his acts and words subsequent to the murder. Culpability as an accomplice is established by proof that the defendant, with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the offense, did aid or attempt to aid in the commission of the offense. 18 Pa.C.S.A. 306(c). Presented with defendant’s admissions that “We stole a car” and “We shot a guy,” admissions of participation, it was reasonable for the jury to infer that defendant’s participation was, at a minimum, with the intent of facilitating the commission of the murder. Thus, that part of the order of the Superior Court vacating the judgement of sentence as to murder of the first degree, <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>and remanding for a new trial, is reversed, and the judgement of sentence of the trial court is reinstated.</p>
