The permit was issued pursuant to an application received by the DER on September 11, 1979. It allowed and authorized the permitee to “stabilize and dispose of (using the ‘Stabatrol Process’ as described in the approved Facility Design and Operations Plans) neutralized inorganic sludges/residues with a solids content of 12% or greater, by weight, which do not contain (1) organic solvents, (2) sodium salts of arsenate, borate, phosphate, iodate, and/or sulfides, (3) more than 1% oil and grease.” The baneful deposits sanctioned by this license are acknowledged to be toxic wastes which perpetually retain their hazardous toxicity.</p>

However, a township and a county are more than abstract entities; each is also a place populated by people. They can be identified by fixed and definable political and geographic boundaries. These boundaries encompass a certain natural existence — land, water, air, etc. collectively referred to as environment. Whatever affects the natural environment within the borders of a township or county affects the very township or county itself. Toxic wastes which are deposited in the land irrevocably alter the fundamental nature of the land which in turn irrevocably alter the physical nature of the municipality and county of which the land is a part.

The cooperation between DÉR and local units of government mandated under the Act reflects the legislature’s recognition of the concerns of these communities and establishes the parameters of their participation. However, conspicuously absent from the Act are any provisions enabling the local units of government to exercise potential vetoes over DER’s judgment as to when issuance of permits furthers the statewide goal of environmental protection. The majority would rewrite the Act to enable local government units to intrude upon the ultimate authority vested in DER to establish a statewide solid waste management plan.</p>

In <em>El Rancho Grande, </em>this Court held that appellants, liquor licensees, had standing to challenge a determination of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board to grant a liquor license, notwithstanding the fact that appellants did not come within any of the sections of the Liquor Code, Act of April 12, 1951, P.L. 90, art. I, § 101 <em>et seq., </em>as amended, 47 P.S. § 1-101 <em>et seq., </em>which set forth specific classes of persons and institutions who may appeal from the Board’s determination to grant or refuse a license. The underlying ration<a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>ale for the grant of standing in <em>El Rancho Grande </em>was that without standing, appellants would have had no <em>input </em>in the decision-making process. However, in the instant case, the legislature has specifically provided (albeit not to the majority’s satisfaction) for the input of appellants in its scheme. 35 P.S. § 6006(2) and (4). Therefore, the reasons for extending the traditional rules of standing which justified the result in <em>El Rancho Grande </em>do not exist here.</p>

In providing for cooperation between DER and local government units, the legislature determined the respective roles of the various interests involved. Today’s decision has upset that balance.</p>
