The facts as alleged by appellants’ complaint establish the following. Developer is <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>constructing an apartment complex in the Township on a 47 acre tract of land situated between three roads, one of which, Stenton Avenue, is a state highway. Appellants’ residence lies directly across Stenton Avenue from the construction site. Developer’s predecessor in title sought to have the 47 acre tract rezoned from an R-l (single-family) classification to an R-3 (multi-family) classification to permit construction of residential rental units. At the hearing on rezoning of the tract, the then owner stipulated that a 300 foot buffer would be provided from the right-of-way line of Stenton Avenue, and further specified that no access road from the apartment complex to Stenton Avenue would be built. In 1973, the requested zoning change was adopted by the Township. In 1979, however, construction of an access road from the apartment complex to Stenton Avenue commenced, and appellants became aware that the land development plan finally approved by the Township had, at the insistence of the Township, included a provision for access to Stenton Avenue, and that in 1978, a driveway permit authorizing construction of the access road to Stenton Avenue had been issued by PennDOT.</p>

In particular, it is not sufficient for the person claiming to be <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>“aggrieved” to assert the common interest of all citizens in procuring obedience to the law.</blockquote>
    <p id="b672-5" data-blocks='[["BL_672.5",672,[276,428,1150,750]]]'>(footnotes omitted). This rule respecting standing is not intended to bar from relief persons injured by breach of a public duty merely because many others have incurred similar injuries as a consequence of that breach; rather, the “concern is to distinguish those who have suffered some <em>individual injury </em>from those asserting only the common right of the entire public that the law be obeyed.” <em><a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">464 Pa. at 203</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">346 A.2d at 287</a> (emphasis added). Since the instant complaint, although containing a broad assertion that deficiencies in the access road will “have a unique impact” on appellants, fails to specify any <em>individual injury </em>attributable to deficiencies in the roadway itself and in preparatory studies, appellants must be regarded as lacking standing to raise such objections to PennDOT’s action.</p>
    <p id="b672-6" data-blocks='[["BL_672.6",672,[278,1212,1148,1121]]]'>Appellants further challenge PennDOT’s grant of the driveway permit on grounds that presence of the access road immediately adjacent to their property will cause inconvenience and annoyance, thereby impairing the value of their property in a manner not compensable in damages. We regard this assertion as inadequate to state a cause of action. In <em>Wolf v. Department of Highways, </em><a href="/pa/422/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="422 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1901686" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0034-01">422 Pa. 34</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20868" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="220 A.2d 868">220 A.2d 868</a> (1966), an eminent domain case, an owner of business property abutting a state highway alleged that highway improvements had diminished the property’s value by necessitating a circuitous route of ingress, thereby reducing the number of business customers willing to enter the premises. Denying the owner’s claim for damages insofar as property value diminution occasioned by such a diversion of traffic, this Court held that owners of properties abutting state roads have no cognizable legal interest in preserving a particular flow of traffic on those roads. Thus, in <em>Wolf, </em><a href="/pa/422/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="422 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1901686" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0034-01">422 Pa. at 47</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20868" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="220 A.2d 868">220 A.2d at 875</a>, quoting <em>State of Missouri ex rel.

Since appellants’ contention that the access road in question will cause inconvenience and annoyance is, in essence, an assertion of right to maintain the existing traffic conditions on Stenton Avenue, and since the existence of such a right has been negated by our holding in <em>Wolf, </em>appellants’ claim against PennDOT fails to state a cause of action.</p>

The police power of municipalities cannot be subjected to agreements which restrict or condition zoning district classifications as to particular properties. We are in accord with the position adopted by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, in <em>Houston Petroleum Co. v. Automotive Products Credit Association, Inc., </em><a href="/nj/9/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="9 N.J. 122" data-case-ids="1325565" data-case-paths="/nj/9/0122-01">9 N.J. 122</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20319" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="87 A.2d 319">87 A.2d 319</a>, 322 (1952), wherein the Court stated: “Contracts thus have no place in a zoning plan and a contract between a municipality and a property owner should not enter into the enactment or enforcement of zoning regulations.” In <em>Houston, </em>covenants and restrictions agreed to by a landowner as a means of effecting a zoning change were held invalid on grounds that the purported contract thereby made, was, with regard to the municipality, ultra vires and contrary to public policy. In so holding, the Court relied upon its decision in <em>V.F. Zahodiakin Engineering Corp. v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/nj/8/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="8 N.J. 386" data-case-ids="122267" data-case-paths="/nj/8/0386-01">8 N.J. 386</a>, 394-395, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20A.2d%20127" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="86 A.2d 127">86 A.2d 127</a>, 131 (1952), setting forth the following principle, with which we agree, governing exercise of municipal zoning power:</p>

It is elementary that the legislative function may not be surrendered or curtailed by bargain or its exercise controlled by the considerations which enter into the law of contracts.

The potential flames of opposition were doused quickly and efficiently by the soothing nectar of promises, stipulations and representations publicly and officially made by township officials and the then owner of the premises. There is nothing before us to suggest that the Carlinos were other than completely assured that the threats to the public health and safety, which they perceived, were effectively minimized by the establishment of a 300 feet buffer zone and the committment that no access road to Stenton Avenue would be built. The appellants’ good faith beliefs in this regard were derived directly from the pacifying actions of the township and the former property owner. The Carlinos, who were cajoled into giving up valuable and legally protected rights, should not be left without a remedy when they discover that they were deceived.</p>

In such instances, our courts have said that negligent or wrongful official conduct which misleads an aggrieved party to his detriment can be equated to fraud. <em>See: Appeal of Girolamo, </em><a href="/pa-commw/49/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="49 Pa.
