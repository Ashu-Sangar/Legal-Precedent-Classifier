At the hearing de novo no evidence was introduced to show that the District superintendent’s calculation of a substantial difference in rating points was arbitrary or capricious and therefore an abuse of discretion. This Court has previously construed the term “substantial difference” to mean a real, considerable or important difference. <em>Gabriel v.

Furthermore, the Commonwealth Court’s standard of review is limited to a determination of whether the hearing court’s finding of fact was supported by substantial evidence.

Appellant Carmody received an unweighted rating of 85, whereas the lowest unweighted rating among the retained teachers was 108, a difference of 23 points.

The majority today rules that the failure to <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>produce anecdotal data justifies the vacation of a suspension.

The Commonwealth Court found the posture of the case to be “as though it were a de novo local agency hearing appeal” although the lower court specifically stated “this case is not on appeal under the local agency law.” The majority agrees with the Commonwealth Court that “the posture of this case when it was brought to the common pleas court was a de novo hearing pursuant to an appeal from an adjudication of a local agency” (p. 966). It is interesting that the majority ignores the fact that the action in the court of common pleas was brought more than thirty days from the denial of a hearing and over 100 days after suspension.</p>

The majority based its opinion on dealing with 8 points out of a <em>possible </em>160 points because the unweighted efficiency rating was computed by (1) rating the teachers twice a year on a scale of 0 to 80 points with 80 being the highest possible rating and (2) adding the totals of both ratings. Slip Op. n. 7, n. 8, pp. 4, 6. We do not agree that a “substantial difference” can be determined by choosing a designated number from the highest possible score. Rather the difference between the lowest <em>actual </em>rating and the highest <em>actual </em>rating of those being considered for suspension should first be obtained. Then a number reflective of quality of performance as well as a quantitative comparison of score should be used as the guide for determining a “substantial difference” between the scores of the suspended teacher and the retained teacher. In this case, appellant Holmes had the lowest unweighted score of 48 + 47 or 95 while Mrs. Ross had the highest unweighted score of 61 + 57 or 118. The <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>lowest retained teacher, Mr. Semion, had an unweighted score of 106. Out of an actual difference of 23 points between the highest and lowest unweighted scores, the difference between Ms. Carmody and Mr. Semion of 11 points must be said to be substantial.</p>
