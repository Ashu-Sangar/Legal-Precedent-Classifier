First, prior to the 1968 amendment, Section 4321 of the Code provided for payments to widows of members retired on pension or killed in the service on or after January 1, 1960, only if council elected to pay. Section 4321, <em>as amended </em>in 1968, removed council’s elective function and mandated payments to widows as follows:</p>

      <em>Id., </em>§ 2. (Emphasis added).

      <em>Id., </em>§ 3. This section tells us that the amount to be paid is the amount the member would have received “had he been retired at the time of his death.” The section does not, as appellee asserts, discuss eligibility for retirement; instead, it treats the deceased member as hypothetically retired, solely and merely for the purpose of <em>calculation of the amount oí </em>benefits rather than for the purpose of <em>determining eligibility </em>for benefits. Had the legislature intended to exclude payments to widows of those members not yet eligible for retirement at the time of death, presumably the language of the statute would have indicated that benefits would be payable only if the member were actually eligible for retirement at the time of death. We agree with appellant, therefore, that a firefighter’s widow’s right to pension benefits is not derivative, and a deceased firefighter’s ineligibility for retirement benefits does not affect his widow’s independent, statutorily conferred right to benefits.</p>
    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.6",324,[270,1327,1144,838]]]'>Whether the widow’s right to benefits is affected by the fact that her husband dies in a non job-related accident, turns on the meaning of the phrase in Section 4321 providing for payments to the widow of a “member . . . who dies in the service.” Assuming the language to be ambiguous, viz., that the phrase could mean members who die while on duty, members whose deaths are job-related, or members who die while employed by the fire department, we perceive this assumed ambiguity to be clarified, by implication, in Section 4327. Prior to the 1968 amendment, Section 4327 provided, <em>inter alia, </em>for the refund to the estate of a member of the fire department of all contributions paid into the pension fund by the member in the event of the death of the member, not in the line of service, before the member became entitled to his pension. However, Section 4327 <em>as amended </em>in 1968, provides in pertinent part, as follows:</p>

    <p id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[177,498,1145,578]]]'>
      <em>Id., </em>§ 5. (Emphasis added to indicate amendment). As Judge Craig points out in his dissenting opinion in the Commonwealth Court, Section 4327 contemplates the situation in this case: the non job-related death of a member of a fire department before the member is entitled to a pension. In such a case, if the member is not survived by a widow or eligible family members, his contributions to the pension fund are paid to his estate. But what if the member <em>is </em>survived by a widow? Section 4327 is silent on this possibility except to refer us to benefits for widows and families “hereinbefore provided.”</p>
    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.6",325,[175,1094,1147,1105]]]'>Presumably, then, we are directed to Section 4321 to re-interpret the meaning of the provision mandating payment to the widow of a “member .. . who dies in the service” in light of the provisions of Section 4327. Because the legislature amended Section 4327 to provide for <em>refund of contributions </em>to the member’s estate <em>where the member is not survived by a widow or family entitled to payments, </em>where the member’s death was not job-related and the member was not entitled to a pension, leaving conspicuously unaddressed the situation where a member <em>is </em>survived by a widow, we conclude that widows of such members are not to be excluded, and that a member “who dies in the service” should be understood to mean a member who dies while employed by a fire department. Further, this interpretation is bolstered by the observation that had the legislature intended “dies in the service” to mean “job-related death,” it would have used specific language of the sort used in Section 4327, where the phrase “in the line of service” appears. When the legislature wanted to specify activity related to firefighting, it knew how to do so, but it did not do so in the case of the language in Section 4321.</p>

Such a result is totally foreign to the concept of a contributory pension and is in effect a gratuity ultimately born by the public without a corresponding public benefit. <em>Such an interpretation ignores the underlying concept of a contributory pension scheme, in that the only justification for a deviation from the eligibility requirements is the hazardous nature of the employment and the causal connection between the employment and the death which prevented the member from reaching a vested status.</em>

      <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>The majority’s insistance that the phrase “in the service” does not require a causal connection between the death and the employment forces the irrational conclusion that between 1960 and 1968 the legislature preserved a distinction between an <em>unrelated traumatic death </em>for which the surviving spouse would receive benefits and an <em>unrelated non-traumatic death </em>for which no benefits would be received by the surviving spouse. <em>See, </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1) (The General Assembly “does not intend a result that is absurd ... or unreasonable.”) If it is to be accepted that no causal relationship between the employment and the death was intended to be required, the nature or character of the death, i.e., traumatic or non-traumatic, would be clearly irrelevant to the entitlement to benefits. Our previous decision recognized this obvious fact, and properly interpreted “killed in the service” as a legislative judgment that the spouse of a member killed as a result of the performance of his duty was entitled to these benefits even though the member had not reached pension eligibility. <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Wilkes-Barre, </em><a href="/pa/418/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="418 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1896141" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0089-01">418 Pa. 89</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=209%20A.2d%20852" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="209 A.2d 852">209 A.2d 852</a> (1965). The 1968 legislative decision to expand the protection to non-traumatic deaths causally connected to the employment does not offer a basis for ignoring the predicate for the entitlement, i.e., a death resulting from the employment. This is particularly true since the legislature in each instance used precisely the same words of limitation, i.e., “in the service.”</p>

Acceptance of the majority’s definition of “in the service,” guarantees a surviving spouse’s receipt of benefits regardless of whether the deceased member had reached pension eligibility and without consideration of the cause of death. Thus, the three categories have been eliminated and protection is now accorded to all surviving spouses without qualification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> The majority attempts to support its interpretation by an equally strained construction of Section 4327.</p>
    <p id="b331-5" data-blocks='[["BL_331.5",331,[168,885,1144,1329]]]'>The only justification for this extraordinary result is the purported ambiguity created by Section 4327. First, it is to be noted that Section 4327, by its own terms, does not purport to define the benefits to a surviving spouse, but rather refers back to those earlier provisions of the Code, i.e. Sections 4321, 4322 and 4324. Secondly, Section 4327 is concerned, not with pension benefits, but rather with the entitlement of a non-eligible member or his estate in the event that service is terminated prematurely. The majority uses this section as its sole predicate for the extraordinary interpretation it adopts. It is argued that in view of this language we should conclude that “in the service” does not require the death to be non-job related. I suggest that an equally reasonable interpretation, which is infinitely more acceptable in view of the history and the rules of statutory construction, is that this section merely reflects a recognition that if there is a surviving spouse, where the death was not causally connected with the employment, the contributions are to be made to the surviving spouse and not the estate. Thus the inclusion of the surviving spouse in Section 4327 was not for the purpose of conferring benefits which had “not hereinbefore” been extended, but rather to indicate that the spouse, if one survives a non-pension eligible deceased member, is entitled to the member’s contribution as opposed to the estate of the deceased member.</p>

      <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>Equally strained is the majority’s attempt to note the difference in the phrase “in the service” which appears in Sections 4321, 4322 and 4324 and “in the line of service” appearing in Section 4327. Although the majority correctly notes that Section 4327 was modified in 1968, it omits mentioning that the clause which includes, “in the line of service” was a carry-over from the 1957 provision, and was, of course, inserted in the Code prior to any provision for a surviving spouse. The disparity caused by the legislative failure to conform its earlier language to the 1959 and 1968 amendments creating the surviving spouse’s benefits certainly does not warrant the conclusion that the majority seeks to establish.</p>
