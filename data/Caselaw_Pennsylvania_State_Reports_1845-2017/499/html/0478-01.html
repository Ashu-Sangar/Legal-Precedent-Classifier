The permits, issued by the Department of Licenses &amp; Inspections of the City of Philadelphia (hereinafter Department), were revoked in March, 1972, when a determination was made that the thirty unit structure would not be in compliance with applicable ordinances. Consequently, appellant altered the design of the building to provide for twenty-three units, rather than the original thirty, thereby achieving full compliance with all applicable land use regulations. In response to this design change, the Department issued new zoning and build<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>ing permits on September 27, 1973. On November 1, 1973, however, an ordinance was introduced in the Philadelphia City Council seeking to rezone the subject building site to prohibit multi-family structures. This ordinance was adopted on December 14, 1973, and, on January 3, 1974 and January 4, 1974, respectively, the Department, citing the change in zoning classification, revoked appellant’s zoning and building permits.</p>

The trial court ordered reinstatement of the zoning and building permits, and awarded damages in the amount of $3,500.00 against the Department’s Commissioner, Dominic Sabatini, the appellee herein (hereinafter Commissioner). The Court of Common Pleas, sitting en banc, affirmed reinstatement of the permits, but increased the damage award to $35,245.00. Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that appellant’s remedy was to have appealed the permit revocations to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, and that, due to the availability of that remedy, mandamus was improper.</p>

Township of Hampton, </em><a href="/pa/437/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="437 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="1927830" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0399-01">437 Pa. 399</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20385" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="263 A.2d 385">263 A.2d 385</a> (1970) announced a new standard by which the availability of mandamus is to be determined.. Specifically, it is asserted that mandamus has been eliminated as a remedy in every case where the party denied issuance of a land use permit has declined to utilize an available administrative appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. We disagree. In <em>Unger, </em><a href="/pa/437/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="437 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="1927830" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0399-01">437 Pa. at 405</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20385" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="263 A.2d 385">263 A.2d at 389</a>, the continuing viability of mandamus, in accordance with long-standing precedents of this Court, including <em>Lhormer, </em>supra., was expressly recognized. The decision in <em>Unger, </em>to the extent that it restricts the availability of mandamus, is limited in application to cases where a proposed land use does not comply with an existing ordinance, and, hence, where invalidity of the ordinance itself must be established before a landowner’s right to a permit becomes clear. Since validity of a zoning ordinance is not at issue in the present case, the rule set forth in <em>Unger, </em>requiring that the issue of an ordinance’s validity be raised in an administrative appeal, is inapplicable. Extension of the <em>Unger </em>rule, so as to discard mandamus in favor of protracted administrative appeals, where entitlement to issuance of land use permits is <em>clear, </em>would unduly burden landowners with an inadequate, and inefficient, remedy, while facilitating municipal abuse of the licensing power. See <em>Baldwin Borough v. Matthews, </em><a href="/pa/394/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="394 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1280933" data-case-paths="/pa/394/0053-01">394 Pa. 53</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.2d%20698" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="145 A.2d 698">145 A.2d 698</a> (1958).

    <p id="b653-4" data-blocks='[["BL_653.5",653,[197,447,1145,1038]]]'>In the instant case, the Commissioner does not even allege there to have been such non-compliance with ordinances in effect at the time of issuance of appellant’s permits as would support their revocations; rather, the revocations were occasioned solely in response to the purported change in zoning classification of appellant’s property adopted subsequent to issuance of the permits. It is well established that a zoning ordinance cannot be retroactively applied to effect revocation of permits obtained by a landowner prior to <em>pendency </em>of that ordinance. <em>Id.; Lhormer v. Bowen, </em>supra.; <em>Lened Homes, Inc. v. Philadelphia Department of Licenses, </em><a href="/pa/386/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="386 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1268328" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0050-01">386 Pa. 50</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.2d%20406" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="123 A.2d 406">123 A.2d 406</a> (1956). Nearly five weeks elapsed from the date of issuance of appellant’s permits, September 27, 1973, until the rezoning ordinance was first introduced, on November 1, 1973, in the Philadelphia City Council; hence, it is clear that the permits were issued before the rezoning ordinance became pending,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and that the ordinance was improperly applied to appellant’s property.</p>

We find no merit in this assertion, since the building permit in question was issued on September 27, 1973, and, quite plainly, six months did not then elapse before January 4, 1974.
