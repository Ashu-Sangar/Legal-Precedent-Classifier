First, appellants argue that, notwithstanding the admitted constitutionality of the statutory prohibition against a party’s substitute nomination of “any person who has already been nominated by any political party . . . for the same office,” the Legislature may not constitutionally bar a party’s substitute nomination of “any person who has already been nominated ... by any other <em>political body </em>for the same office.” According to appellants, “[b]y treating political parties and political bodies identically, the prohibitions of Section 979 are ‘over-inclusive’ and hence violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Second, appellants argue that application of the challenged provision of the statute to the Republican Party in the Second Congressional District unconstitutionally burdens the First Amendment associational rights of the Republican Party and its members to nominate the candidate of their choice. In appellants’ view, because a substantial majority of the voters in the Second Congres<a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>sional District are enrolled in the Democratic Party, the statutory prohibition has “the impermissible effect of fostering the domination of [the Democratic] party” by “preventing] any fusion of an independent candidate and [the Republican] party.” As we agree with the Commonwealth Court that appellants’ claims do not establish a violation of appellants’ First or Fourteenth Amendment rights, we affirm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
