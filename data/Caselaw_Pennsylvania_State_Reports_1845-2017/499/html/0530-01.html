Appellee’s statutory argument is equally without merit. Section 504 of the Administrative Agency Law states: “No adjudication shall be valid as to any party unless he shall have been afforded reasonable notice of a hearing and an opportunity to be heard.” As the statutory definition of “adjudication” makes clear, see 2 Pa.C.S. § 101, section 504 does not affect the authority of an administrative agency to take preliminary action with respect to persons within the agency’s jurisdiction. Section 504 merely provides that a party subjected to such action is entitled to reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard on the permissibility of the action taken. See <em>Callahan v.
