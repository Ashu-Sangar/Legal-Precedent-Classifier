It included quarrying operations as a permitted use in the district where the subject property was located, within specific setback requirements. At all times prior to December 13, 1971 appellant operated its quarry within the township’s original setback lines and had at that time quarried at one point to within one hundred thirteen feet of an adjoining property. On December 13, 1971 the Township adopted a new zoning ordinance pursuant to the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code of 1968, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, § 101 et seq., 53 P.S. 10101 et seq.

The term “preempts,” contained in the second sentence of section 17, ordinarily refers to an act which precludes action on the same subject by another in the future.

From this new section, it is clear that the Legislature could not have intended in 1971 to displace all existing and future local regulation of surface mining. The challenged zoning ordinance of Wrightstown Township is manifestly valid; as it was adopted pursuant to the Municipalities Planning Code and before the effective date of the Surface Mining Act of 1971, it is neither superseded nor preempted by either section 17 or section 17.1. Appellant, therefore, cannot prevail on its theory that the ordinance is invalid under the Act.</p>

It thus argues the application of the township’s setback lines to the business of quarrying “takes” the quarry property within those more expansive lines and so cannot be justified under the police power. The difficulty with this argument is it proves too much. Were we to accept it, neither zoning ordinances nor state statutes could provide setback lines for minerals suited to extraction solely by surface mining methods, since setbacks so applied would preclude extraction and thus constitute a taking of the mineral involving eminent domain, and hence not supported under the police power. All zoning involves a “taking” in the sense that the owner is not completely free to use his property as he chooses, but such a taking does not entitle the owner to relief, unless the owner’s rights have been unreasonably restricted. <em>See Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Company, </em><a href="/us/272/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="272 U.S. 365" data-case-ids="1501273" data-case-paths="/us/272/0365-01">272 U.S. 365</a>, <a href="/us/272/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="47 S.

Reasonable restrictions are valid exercises of the police power and not unconstitutional takings under the power of eminent domain. Restrictions are not <em>per se </em>unreasonable simply because they limit the extraction of minerals. The fallacy of appellant’s argument is clear. If a municipality can create a use zone excluding surface mining altogether, then it must surely be able to impose the lesser burden of requiring setbacks for such use in zones in which it is permitted.</p>
