The confusion has been compounded by the fact that courts have also cited as authority cases dealing with burdens of proof and the production of evidence in cases where the issue is how to instruct the jury.</p>

Wiley, supra, </em>do not adequately deal with the issue of instructing the jury. If there really is “little if any difference between the rule which holds that a person killed in an accident is presumed to have used due care and the more general rule that the burden of proving contributory negligence is upon the defendant,” then the presumption affords no benefit whatsoever to the decedent, since the burden of proving contributory negligence always rests upon the defendant, even in cases where the presumption does not apply. <em>See Stegmuller </em>v. <em>Davis, </em><a href="/pa/408/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="408 Pa. 267" data-case-ids="1308424" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0267-01">408 Pa. 267</a>, 269, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.2d%20745" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="182 A.2d 745">182 A.2d 745</a>, 747 (1962).</p>

One of its purposes is to put another to proof overcoming the ancient belief in self-preservative acts. The presumption is a filter through which contrary evidence must pass before it is accepted by the fact finder. Evidence offered must be examined, along with other considerations, in the light thrown upon human actions by this presumption. The presumption does not vanish simply because contrary evidence is offered; that evidence must be accepted before the presumption evaporates, and that one does not lightly put his life at hazard is one of the tests to determine the acceptability and credibility of the evidence proffered to contravene it. It is not simply a vestige of ancient law, but rather a viable test of conflicting evidence and as such has continuing meaning and usefulness. It should be accorded the dignity of its reasons, to wit, that love of life and fear of pain should be weighed against the charge that one flouted due care for his safety. Hence, in this case I would review the charge of the court below and consider whether the presumption can be dispersed so ambiguously as reported:</p>

As has been indicated, this is probably founded on the desire for self-preservation for the individual to avoid pain; but, this presumption is not evidence and does not take the place of evidence. If you find by a prepon<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>derance of the evidence, as I have described it to you, that the decedent was not exercising such care you will so state in your verdict as I am going to later discuss it with you.</blockquote>
