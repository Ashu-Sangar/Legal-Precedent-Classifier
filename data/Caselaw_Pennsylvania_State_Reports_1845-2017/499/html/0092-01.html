On February 11, 1980, the chancellor ordered that Malaneeki return one-half the money deposited in the joint bank account to Banko. The chancellor further ordered that Malaneeki return one-half the furniture or one-half its value to Banko plus interest from July 1974.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On March 31, 1980, the equity court en banc denied the exceptions filed by both parties, and Banko filed a direct appeal to the Superior Court.
