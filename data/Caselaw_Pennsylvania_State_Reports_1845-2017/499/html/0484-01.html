The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County dismissed Mrs. Jacqueline Mason’s complaint and sustained preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer filed by defendants Dr. Robert Block-stein and Western Pennsylvania Hospital. On appeal, the <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>Superior Court sitting en banc reinstated the complaint. <a href="/pa-super/286/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="286 Pa.

However, the members of the Superior Court were divided as to the nature of the damages which should be recoverable if proven at trial. Allowance of appeal was granted to all parties, and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[263,616,1145,566]]]'>The complaint alleges that in June, 1974, Mrs. Mason was admitted to defendant West Pennsylvania Hospital where she underwent a bilateral tubal ligation performed by defendant Dr. Robert Blockstein. According to the complaint, the defendants negligently performed the sterilization operation and breached express and implied warranties that the operation “would prevent [Mrs. Mason] from incurring future pregnancies.” Mrs. Mason subsequently became pregnant and, on January 2, 1977, gave birth by caesarean section. The child is not alleged to be in other than good health.</p>
    <p id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.6",656,[259,1227,1146,897]]]'>I. The Superior Court properly determined that the complaint alleges facts which, if proven, would entitle the plaintiff to relief under basic principles of the law of contract and tort. The alleged breach of warranties and negligent performance of the sterilization operation are asserted to be a direct cause of Mrs. Mason’s pregnancy. It follows, therefore, that the costs associated with the pregnancy and delivery would be within both the contemplation of the parties to an express or implied warranty and the range of reasonably foreseeable consequences of the negligent performance of the surgical procedure. See <em>Speck v. Finegold, </em><a href="/pa/497/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="497 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="1775318" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0077-01">497 Pa. 77</a>, <a href="/pa/497/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="439 A.2d 110" data-case-ids="1775307,1775318" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0076-01,/pa/497/0077-01">439 A.2d 110</a> (1981). Thus, if the' plaintiff sustains her burden of proof, she is entitled to recover all medical expenses and lost wages related to pre-natal care, delivery, and post-natal care, as well as compensation for pain and suffering incurred during the pre-natal through post-natal periods.</p>

Judge Price dissented and claimed that the plaintiffs complaint did not set forth causes of action for breach of contract and the negligent performance of the tubal ligation. He therefore did not reach the issue of the appropriate measure of damages. The other six Superior Court judges were equally divided on the issue of whether or not plaintiff could seek damages for the support and maintenance of the child. Judges Spaeth, Cavanaugh and Brosky would permit Mrs. Mason to seek damages for the cost of rearing the child, offset by the value of the child’s aid, comfort and society. President Judge Cercone and Judges Hester and Hoffman would have denied plaintiff’s right to seek these damages.</p>

I also agree with the concurring and dissenting opinion of Chief Justice O’Brien that “Mrs. Mason should be permitted to seek damages for emotional distress incident to the birth and raising of her third child” and that “the benefits of joy, companionship and affection which a healthy, unplanned child may provide [do not] outweigh, as a <em>matter of </em>law, the cost of raising such a child.” However, I would go even further and hold that Mrs. Mason may recover the entire cost of raising her unplanned child to the age of majority; I disagree with any application of the “benefit rule” to the computation of damages for the support and maintenance of Mrs. Mason’s child.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

Feeding, clothing and educating an unplanned child entails a certain amount of expense, and it is this expense for which parents must be compensated in order to be made whole. Whatever those expenses are determined to be, they are simply not reduced by the satisfaction, love, joy and pride which an unplanned child may provide his parents. The “benefit rule” would reduce the damages awarded to parents of children who possess these <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>endearing abilities, thus preventing the parents from being fully compensated and made whole.</p>

Society favors and supports those families in which children — including those whose births were unplanned — receive from their parents the love and support they need to grow and develop into loving and supportive adults, yet with the application of the “benefit rule,” “a great anomaly becomes apparent; the more loving the parent, the smaller the damage award and the more the entire family will suffer as scarce economic resources are spread over a greater number of family members.” Kashi, <em>The Case of the Unwanted Blessing: Wrongful Life, </em><a href="/citations/?q=31%20U.%20Miami%20L.%20Rev.%201409" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="31 U.

I agree with the opinion of Chief Justice O’Brien that defendants should be able to deduct the emotional benefits of child rearing from the emotional trauma of raising a child.
