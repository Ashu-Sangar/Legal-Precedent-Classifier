        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from a decree dismissing a bill for specific performance of a contract for the sale of land. The Chancellor found that there was no \u201cmeeting of the minds of the parties\u201d and therefore no contract. The court in banc agreed Avith him and the decree nisi Avas made absolute. The reason given by the court for this order Avas that \u201cthe contract in question was not signed by the vendor or grantor\u201d and that there was not sufficient evidence in writing of the contract to remove it from the Statute of Frauds and that the authority of the appellees\u2019 agents to bind the corporation was not shown. This appeal followed.\nJohn W. Neth and Dale A. Neth, his wife, the plaintiffs in the court beloAV, filed a bill in equity against St. John\u2019s Reformed Church, alleging a written contract between the parties for the sale of a piece of real estate. An answer was filed by the church, a corporation of the first class (and by section 3 of Article I of the \u201cNonprofit Corporation Law\u201d of 1933, P. L. 289, 15 PS 2851-3, subject to the provisions of that Act) ; that there is no contract in writing sufficient to avoid the Statute of Frauds and no authority to bind the church shown in Rev. John A. Kleinginna, the minister of the church, and ex-officio President of the congregation and the Board of Consistory, and C. W. Walthour, Secretary of the church. The facts leading up to the cause of the action were that on May 9, 1936, the church held a mortgage in the amount of $3,000 against the property of the appellants. This property comprised ten acres and on it there were a two-story frame dwelling house, a garage and other improvements. The mortgage being in default as to both principal and interest on that date, the church foreclosed and the property was sold at sheriff sale, and a three-quarter interest was taken over by the church. The other one-quarter interest was in the Estate of Peter Moore, deceased. The appellants then entered into negotiations to secure the repurchase of the property and \u201capproached various members of the consistory . . . with regard to obtaihing the said premises back unto themselves.\u201d The bill sets forth \u201cthat finally after many conferences and many changes of conditions the . . . church . . . entered into a written agreement on the 8th day of November, 1937, through their duly authorized officer and president of the Board of Consistory, John A. Kleinginna with your orators, wherein and whereby they agreed for the consideration therein mentioned to return to your orators, their certain properties known and described as \u2018those certain properties in Rostraver Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, formerly owned by\u2019 John W. Neth and Dale A. Neth, his wife, and which are the properties described by metes and bounds as aforesaid. Said agi\u2019eement was immediately and duly accepted by your orators. A copy of said agreement is annexed hereto, made part hereof and marked Exhibit \u2018A.\u2019 Said agreement as aforesaid was orally accepted by the Neths. ...\u201d The answer by the church to this averment is a specific denial \u201cthat any contract was entered into between\u201d the parties, \u201cand it is denied that any agreement was made through the President of the Board of Consistory, John A. Kleinginna, in regard to the property . . .; and it is denied that plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit \u2018A,\u2019 attached to the bill of complaint, was an agreement or contract ...\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit \u201cA\u201d was eleven separate letters, communications and writings, beginning with the dates February 6, 1937, and ending December 1, 1937, and they were all offered in evidence as Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibits 1 to 10, with the exception of a letter dated August 28, 1937, addressed to \u201cMr. C. W. Walthour\u201d and signed \u201cJohn W. Neth,\u201d advising him that \u201cwe may need a little more time. I will let you know just as soon as I have something more definite, and in the meantime please bear in mind we are just as anxious to get settled up as you folks are. I will write again in the next week or ten days.\u201d\nDo these papers and exhibits constitute sufficient evidence in writing of a contract for the conveyance of this real estate? Exhibits Nos. 1 and 2 are letters addressed to \u201cMr. John W. Neth\u201d and signed \u201cJohn A. Kleinginna.\u201d They appear to be purely personal notes in which the minister expresses a desire to cooperate with Mr. Neth in getting him his \u201cproperty back\u201d and asking Mr. Neth to keep him \u201cposted on the progress that you are making.\u201d The letters are dated February 6, 1937, and March 4, 1937. These letters could in no way bind the church corporation, and apparently were not relied upon by appellant. The next exhibits are two notes one addressed to \u201cMr. Neff\u201d and the other to \u201cDear Sir,\u201d dated \u201cJuly 28, 37\u201d and \u201cAug. 2, 1937,\u201d signed \u201cArt A. Kennan,\u201d and marked plaintiffs\u2019 Ex-Mbits Nos. 8 and 9 respectively. The first letter expresses a desire that Mr. Neff \u201cmeet the church officers,\u201d at a suitable time \u201cnext week.\u201d The second letter says: \u201call arrangements are satisfactory for Thursday at 7 o\u2019clock at church.\u201d Apparently Thursday was August 5, 1937, and on that date Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 3 was executed by the parties. This agreement is dated August 5, 1937, and states that \u201cthe following tentative agreement was entered into . . . between the consistory . . . and John W. Neth and Dale A. Neth, his wife . . .:\n\u201c1. That in consideration of the sum of $3,400.00, the party of the first part agrees to sell to the party of the second part all of the interest which the party of the first part now owns in those certain properties in Rostraver Township . . ., formerly owned by the party of the second part.\n\u201c2. That the above agreement is dependent upon the following (A) that the congregation of St. John\u2019s Reformed Church, Harrolds, shall endorse this agreement; (B) that the party of the second part shall be successful in securing the above amount within the next thirty days.\u201d\nThis is signed \u201cParty of the First Part Consistory of St. John\u2019s Reformed Church, John A. Kleinginna, President, C. W. Walthour, Secretary. Party of the Second Part, John W. Neth, Dale A. Neth.\u201d This agreement was next followed by a letter, dated \u201cAug. 18, 1937\u201d addressed to \u201cMy dear Mr. Neth\u201d saying \u201cthat the Harrold Congregation has authorized the consistory of the church to carry out the agreement that had been entered into between the consistory and (John W. Neth and Dale Neth) so I guess the next move is up to you. Let us know when you will be ready.\u201d This letter was signed by C. W. Walthour, Secretary of the church, and was offered as Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 6. Then follows the letter of August 28, 1937, referred to above, which was not offered in evidence but which is part of Exhibit \u201cA\u201d attached, to the bill. It was written in answer to the letter of August 18, 1937. The court in banc found that \u201cExhibit No. 3 which designates itself a \u2018tentative agreement\u2019 under the date of August 5, 1937, and which was signed by the parties, admittedly was not complied with by the plaintiffs, and was attempted to be replaced by Exhibit No. 10 under date of October 21,1937, which latter exhibit, while signed by the plaintiff, was no more than a proposition inasmuch as it was not executed by the defendant church or anyone on its behalf.\u201d The court in banc also found that \u201cthe only contract attempted to be signed or executed by the vendor or grantor was the so-called \u2018tentative agreement\u2019 under date of August 5, 1937, as evidenced by plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 3. On this agreement plaintiffs defaulted and do not even now contend that they could comply with it. Consequently it would be futile for the court to enforce specific performance of it if we could or should.\u201d These findings were not assigned for error.\nAppellants\u2019 brief states: \u201cThe final agreement and the one which the appellants seek to enforce arose out of a proposal by the Neths, appellants, as contained in Exhibit No. 10, which is a proposal on the part of the Neths to turn over a $4,000 mortgage on an apartment house owned and inherited by Mrs. Neth, subject to certain conditions in return for which the appellee herein was to satisfy the judgment it held against the appellants and to deed over or back to Mrs. Neth, the three-quarter interest it had acquired at the sheriff sale aforesaid. This proposal was accepted by the St. John\u2019s Reformed Church by letters of the President thereof dated November 1st, 1937, and marked Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 5 and letter of C. W. Walthour, Secretary, dated December 1st, 1937, and marked Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 7.\u201d The appellants having defaulted on the contract signed by the vendor church\u2014the party to be charged\u2014 which is Exhibit No. 3, this court can only come to the same conclusion as the court below, to wit, that this contract is not a part of the contract sought to. he enforced and does not qualify for specific performance.\nWhat then is the contract sought to he enforced? The appellants state in their brief that they \u201crely upon the following exhibits to base their contract in writing to be sufficient to take their case out of the Statute of Frauds, viz.: Exhibit No. 10, which constitutes their proposal, Exhibits Nos. 4, 5, and 7, which constitute the acceptance, together with the testimony on the part of themselves, that they were ready and did comply with the request of the appellee as to clearing taxes and encumbrances listed against them.\u201d\nExhibit No. 10 is merely a proposal by the appellants to the church that Mrs. Neth \u201cwill give you a new mortgage on her apartment house for $4,000 with payments to be made as follows: $30.00 on the principal, plus interest at 6% on deferred payments, at the end of each month. ...\u201d This proposal was signed by Dale A. Neth and John W. Neth and is followed by \u201cSt. John\u2019s Reformed Church, by- (Seal).\u201d On the bottom of this page is the following writing in ink: \u201cThis agreement is not binding until the above conditions have been complied with and the property (apartment house) is free of all debt.\u201d On November 1, 1937, upon the personal stationery of Rev. John A. Kleinginna, the latter wrote to Mr. Neth stating that \u201cat a meeting of the consistory of the St. John\u2019s Reformed Church, Harrolds, which was held yesterday, the following motion was passed: \u2018Moved by Mr. A. A. Keener and seconded by Mr. Wilbur Taylor, that Mr. John W. Neth be advised that when all taxes and liens against the apartment house belonging to Mrs. Dale Neth are satisfied, St. John\u2019s Reformed Church, Harrolds, will accept the $4,000 First Mortgage, as agreed, the same to be affected within fifteen days from the date of this letter. Mr. Neth is to notify the secretary of the consistory, Mr. Charles W. Walthour, when he is ready so that a meeting can be arranged at an appropriate time with a committee from the consistory and the legal representatives for both sides.\u2019 Please notify me at once as to your plans so that we will know what you expect to do. We hope this matter can be settled without any further delay.\u201d This letter is not signed by the church corporation but is merely signed by \u201cJohn A. Kleinginna.\u201d The appellants contend that it was signed by him as president of the consistory. The testimony on the part of the plaintiff shows that he is president ex-officio. What the duties and authority of the president ex-officio are, is not disclosed in the testimony, and the by-laws of the church corporation were not offered in evidence. There is absolutely nothing to indicate that this letter is or was intended to be a corporate instrument. It was not signed in the name of the corporation. It does not come within the Act of Assembly of May 12, 1925, P. L. 615 (15 PS page 131, sec. 61). That there is a distinction between the consistory and the congregation becomes evident in the consistory\u2019s agreement of August 5 and designated Exhibit No. 3. There, while the consistory entered into the agreement, it was \u201cdependent upon . . . the congregation of St. John\u2019s Reformed Church, Harrolds, ...\u201d endorsing the agreement. Section 308 of Article III of the \u201cNonprofit Corporation Law\u201d of 1933, 15 PS 2851-308, expressly provides that \u201cunless its articles or by-laws provide for the approval of another body, a non-profit corporation shall not . . . sell ... or otherwise dispose of any real estate, unless and until a resolution authorizing the same shall have been approved by a majority of the members of the corporation at a regular or special meeting, duly convened upon proper notice of this purpose. ...\u201d This express mandate of the legislature is not shown to have been complied with. Exhibit No. 4 shows only \u201ca meeting of the consistory\u201d of the church, and this body, \u201cunless its articles or bylaws provide for the approval\u201d by it, could not sell this real estate, \u201cunless and until a resolution authorizing the same shall have been approved by a majority of the members of the church corporation.\u201d No such resolution is in the record. Exhibit No. 5, relied upon by the appellants as part of the final agreement which they sought to enforce, is an answer by John A. Kleinginna to Mr. John Neth. It is dated November 8, 1937. It is apparently an answer to a letter written by Mr. Neth, which involved \u201ca question\u201d which \u201cwas discussed\u201d in the consistory. What this letter contained is not known for it was not offered in evidence. It was presented, however, to the consistory,' for Rev. Kleinginna writes \u201cthe point in question was discussed, after which I was' instructed to write you.\u201d The consistory interpreted \u201cthis point\u201d relating to default in payments on the Mrs. Neth\u2019s apartment house mortgage. Rev. Kleinginna then writes as follows: \u201cIt is further agreed and I was instructed to make this point emphatic: settlement of this matter is to be made on or before November 23, 1937. That will give you fifteen days from the date of this letter . . ..\u201d This letter, like others above referred to, does not bear the imprimatur of the corporation or any other evidence that it was intended to be a corporate instrument. On November 29, according to the Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 7, Mr. and Mrs. Neth made a visit to Mr. Walthour and on December 1st, which is the date of the Exhibit No. 7, the latter wrote them that he \u201csaw and called members of our consistory and they told me to make arrangements for meeting and settlement.\u201d He further advised them that the attorney for the church would arrange a suitable date and he would let them know. He then wrote \u201cof course now this will be according to agreement in our last motion and last letter that Rev. Kleinginna sent you.\u201d\nBoth Exhibits No. 5 and No. 7 are in law as ineffective to support \u201cthe final agreement\u201d as is Exhibit No. 4 and for the same reason. The power of the consistory to sell the real estate of this non-profit corporation came into being only if the church articles or by-laws so provided. The duty to prove the consistory\u2019s power was affirmatively upon the appellants. The articles of incorporation which presumably are recorded in Westmoreland County were not offered in evidence by the appellants, and neither were the church corporation\u2019s by-laws. It cannot be presumed that this power is vested in a body other than that provided by law. It must be presumed that this power is vested only in \u201ca majority of the members of the corporation at a regular or special meeting, duly convened upon proper notice of this purpose,\u201d unless it is shown that \u201cthe articles or by-laws provide for the approval of another body.\u201d Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, sec. 434, page 614, note (d), says: \u201cWhen a company or public body is incorporated or established by statute for special purposes only, and is altogether the creature of statute law, the forms prescribed for its acts and contracts are imperative and essential to their validity.\u201d.\nThere being failure of proof of the due acceptance by the consistory of the Neths\u2019 offer, the offer stands unaccepted. In this state of the record the plaintiffs below had no standing to ask a court of equity to decree the specific performance of the alleged contract pleaded.\nOur conclusion makes it unnecessary to discuss the admissibility or competency of the plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 4, containing the alleged motion of the consistory, which appears to be clearly secondary evidence of this motion, with no attempt on the part of the appellants to explain away the absence of the best evidence, namely, the original motion: see Peoples Tr. Co. et al. v. Consumers Ice & Coal Co., 283 Pa. 76, 82, 128 A. 723; or the authority of a \u201cpresident ex-officio,\u201d to legally consummate a real estate contract for a corporation, Avithout some evidence of his authority to do so; or to discuss the uncertainty of the substantial terms of this contract; or whether this contract could be enforced by the use of parol testimony to establish its essential parts.\nHere the appellants set up a contract prima facie nonenforceable because of its unconformity to the Statute of Frauds. The appellee-church corporation, \u201cthe party to be charged thereon\u201d denies \u201cthat any contract was entered into between\u201d it and the appellants. It was then entitled to interpose the statute: Brown v. Aiken, 329 Pa. 566, 579 (n3), 198 A. 441; Sferra v. Urling, 328 Pa. 161, 195 A. 422. A proper party having invoked the statute, the courts must be obedient to its prescriptions.\nThe decree is affirmed, at appellants\u2019 cost.",
