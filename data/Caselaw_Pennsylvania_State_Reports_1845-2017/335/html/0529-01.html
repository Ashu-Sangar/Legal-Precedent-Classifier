It related to the construction of a sanitary sewer system of approximately three miles in the township, as a W.P.A. project. It required that the labor be furnished by the Federal Belief Administration, and the materials were to be furnished by the township. The work was divided into three parts. Items 1 and 3 were awarded to the appellee. These two sections were connected by a section known as Item 2, which was awarded to another contractor. The Bancroft Company, which received the award of Items 1 and 3, agreed on its part to furnish skilled supervision of the work allotted to it, in accordance with the plans and specifications, which included the construction of collection manholes and two pump stations, and to furnish for the job all necessary tools, equipment, fuel, a shelter building and shoring materials necessary for bracing trenches. The contract called for the construction work to begin “within five days after written notice to do so shall have been given to the contractor, and shall be carried on at a rate to insure its full completion within four and a half months thereafter, the rate of progress and <em>the time of completion being essential conditions </em>of the agreement.” (Italics supplied.) The contract price was based upon unit bids per lineal foot of different depths of sewer1 actually dug and laid. Maps, plans, profiles and specifications, containing designations of the line of the pro<a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>posed sanitary setver, its grade and depth, as well as the sizes and kinds of pipe to he used, were furnished by the township to bidders, and are incorporated and are part of the contract. Provision was written into the “General Specifications” and into the body of the contract for changes as the work progressed. In Article III, the parties provided “that the unit quantities shown are only approximate and may not represent the actual amount of work to be performed. . . . The prosecution of this work is dependent entirely upon labor furnished by the Federal Relief Administration, and in case the Relief Administration fails to furnish the labor, or is discontinued, or for any other reason the labor supply from the relief administration is discontinued, the township or the supervisors thereof shall not be liable to the contractor for any damages or for any payments except for unit payments of the amount of work actually completed.”</p>

It provided that “authorized extra work shall be included in progress payments,” and in paragraph numbered 13 of the “General Specifications,” which forms a part of the contract, it is provided that “the engineer can make any alterations to, or omissions from the work . . . that he may find necessary and the same shall be acceded to by the contractor. The value of such alterations, additions or omissions shall be added to the schedule of prices contained in the proposal for this work, or in case the work . . . is not embraced in said schedule a price shall be agreed upon in writing between the council and the contractor before such alteration is made, otherwise no allowance shall be made thereof.” In the “General Specifications” is also found the provisions that “in case any dispute arises . . . or in case any claim shall be made by the contractor . . . including any claims for damages for delay in the completion of this agreement, in every such <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>case the disputed claim shall be submitted to the engineer for decision and his award or decision thereon shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto; and such award or decision in case any question shall arise, shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to receive any money hereunder.’?</p>

The contractor had received from the township $7,495.72, in “progress payments,” on the engineer’s estimate of work completed, the final estimate being dated November 20, 1936. However, on June 11, 1936, the contractor brought this suit against the township to recover a balance of $20,603.99, which it alleged was due. A statement of claim was later filed and the parties soon after agreed to a voluntary arbitration, reserving the right of appeal on questions of law, in accordance with the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 715, 5 PS 1. The authority in the township supervisors to submit to arbitration under the Act of 1836 can be found in the Act of May 13, 1925, P. L. 670, sec. 2, 5 PS 181.</p>

From this testimony the court below found, and an examination of it sustains the court’s findings, that “the following are some of the cliánges required by the engineer.- The plans of Item No. 3 showed pipe on the top of the ground at a designated location. This pipe plaintiff [contractor] was required- to lay three feet deep ori trestle work through a swamp. Between stations 57-0 and 62-50 the proposal called for 550 feet of sewer 8% to 10% feet deep. This section was required to be laid from 12 feet to 14 feet deep. The final 4,000 feet of the sewer was lowered. At least on one occasion the engineer changed the grade after the ditch had been dug and some pipe laid. Along the Algeria Farm the location of the sewer was moved so near a large barn that the work had tó be done .by hand, 40 to 50 men consuming seven weeks, whereas the plans called for a location where the sewer could have been dug efficiently and expeditiously by the special machinery and power equipment furnished by the plaintiff. Sections of Item No. 3 were to be built5 over definite private rights-of-way. These rights-of-way never were acquired by the defendant and the route of the sewer was therefore changed to adjacent public roads, greatly increasing the length of the ■ sewer and adding to the amount of supervision and time consumed; : In one section of the work, 1,000 yards of fill were required due to change of location. In another the contractor was required to build a corduroy road. Near Eaglehurst Pump Station the depth was increased 3% feet for a distance of 861 feet and 1.9 feet for a distance of 275 feet. Many other changes were directed by the engineer deviating more or less from the plans and specifications. All of these changes added to plaintiff’s <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>costs. The estimated labor cost of $25,000 was only one-fourth of the actual cost and increased the premiums which plaintiff had to pay on its bond. The contract contemplated completion of the work in <em>4y2 </em>months. It actually took 17 months, during all of which time plaintiff’s machinery was on the project.” During a large part of the time there was no work being done, and for a full month, March, 1935, the testimony shows it was due to the fact that the government discontinued the labor. Yet the contractor filed its claim for this time and the arbitrators apparently awarded it to the contractor. Continuing the court’s findings, it said: “Deepening the sewers added greatly to the time consumed in construction, for the ditch must be wider with broader slopes and the excavated material must be handled at a disadvantage, and additional lumber is required for increased shoring. Often the deeper the trench the more water and quicksand is encountered; more pumping is required and the operation of lowering and laying the pipes is slower.”</p>

But the matters of law were reserved for the decision of the court. The case was tided throughout on a cause of action based on an implied contract in parol. The written contract was declared to have been abandoned. In the trial before the arbitrators, counsel for the township again reserved the “substantial legal question” of whether “the contract which was entered into between Willis Bancroft, Inc., and the Millcreek Township has been abandoned.” The report of the arbitrators set forth the finding “that the <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>changes and delays for which the contractor was not responsible were sufficient to set the original contract aside.” To this legal conclusion specific exception was taken by the township. The basis of the opinion of the court in banc and its decree is “. . . that the original written contract was abandoned and in law an implied contract in parol was substituted for it, and, therefore, judgment should be entered for the amount of the awai'd.”</p>

In that case the contractor agreed to construct a conduit for the city and to do such extra work as the engineer of the city might require. The engineer required material changes in the line of conduit for the last mile from comparatively level ground to a course requiring the construction of an extensive cut stone and concrete dam and through hills and on embankments over ravines, the lining of the tunnels with concrete and cut stone masonry, the laying of heavy iron pipes therein, for which extra work they asked to recover $97,007.61. The court found that these <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>“extras” were “not contemplated by the parties when they made their agreement, and were not within and governed by the contract. . . .” In other words, the contract and the work <em>and the pleadings of the contractor </em>in that case, “materially differ from the contract and work and pleadings of the parties involved in the case before us.” The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in the ease of the <em>City of Mobile v.

In the last cited case, the plaintiff’s pleadings were similar to those before Us. In that case, as here, the plaintiff pleaded that the writings <em>“were wholly set aside, </em>and the work, so far as any work was done, was prosecuted, and settlements therefor made under a verbal contract which did not stipulate for definite prices, but left parties at large to settle on the basis of a reasonable value of the work, materials, labor- and transportation used,” (italics supplied).

Phila., </em><a href="/pa/201/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="201 Pa. 632" data-case-ids="925573" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0632-01">201 Pa. 632</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20A.%20322" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="51 A. 322">51 A. 322</a>, filed the same day the opinion in the first McManus Case was filed, this court, in an opinion by Justice Dean, said: “Without such interpretation the Act of June 1, 1885 [relating to contracts for public <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>improvements entered into by tbe city of Philadelphia under its charter] in that section is useless; that a contract solemnly entered into between a municipal corporation in writing can- be altered, added to or amended by the mere say. so,, of a subordinate officer and his subordinates, leaves the corporation subject to the very abuses which flow from the unchecked fraud, falsehood and dishonesty the statute seeks to guard against. And there is no hardship to-the contractor in enforcing this rulé. He can protect himself by proper stipulations in his first written contract from unforeseen increased expenditures. If he does not do this then, he must and ought to take the risk. He is not bound to accept a contract from a city any more than he is forced to make one with an individual.” To the same effect is <em>Union Paving Co. v. Phila., </em><a href="/pa/263/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="263 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="1047489" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0577-01">263 Pa. 577</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20A.%20370" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="107 A. 370">107 A. 370</a>. In that case the judgment'of the court below was affirmed by this court per curiam. In-the opinion of the court below appears the following statement: “The reason for exacting a strict compliance with this most salutary requirement of the city’s organic law [i. e., all contracts relating to city affairs shall be in writing, signed and executed in the name of the city] is thus stated by the late Chief Justice Sterrett in <em>Hepburn v. Phila</em>delphia, <a href="/pa/149/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="149 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="832642" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0335-01">149 Pa. 335</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20A.%20279" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="24 A. 279">24 A. 279</a>; ‘To hold otherwise would defeat the very object that the-legislature had in view in’thus specifically prescribing the manner in which all contracts relating to city affairs shall be executed, and expose the public funds to raids of every conceivable form.’ ” - ■ ■</p>
