Mrs. Rosenthal received 1,000 shares by her husband’s will, which, with 494 shares then owned by her and 34 shares which she bought at $140, constituted the 1,528 shares, the subject of the contract in suit. Other shareholders were officers and employees of the corporation: Archie Rosenthal, Louis Rosenthal and John Fitzpatrick; Dr. Schless, as executor of the estate of his wife, Mrs. Rosenthal’s daughter, held 200 shares. Mrs. Rosenthal was active in the management of the business of the corporation, having been vice president, and for three or four years treasurer; she was elected President in July, 1937; no sales of new metal by the corporation could be made without her approval. She was not in good health, and was unaware that intestinal cancer was the cause of her illness. In May, 1937, an exploratory operation was performed to ascertain the exact nature of her ailment and on June 27th a second operation was found necessary.

The stress of appellant’s objection is that Behring was the optionee. In 1914, at the age of 18 years, he was engaged by the Rosenthals to teach their daughter to drive a car. The master’s report states: “Having worked at this job of driving instructor for a few months, he was employed permanently to drive the car for the Rosenthal family. One year later, he began to work for Joseph Rosenthal’s Sons, Inc., where he stayed until he entered the army in 1917. After the war, [he] worked for the corporation until about 1922 when he went to work for the State Bank of Philadelphia at the request of Henry Rosenthal to discover a Teak’ in the bank’s funds. At no time did Behring live with the Rosenthal’s but he saw them often in their home over weekends. He also took night school courses in banking, stenography and bookkeeping. He married a school teacher in 1924. The cause of the Teak’ in the State Bank having been discovered about a year after [he] had worked there, Behring re<a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>turned to the plant for a short while hut, after a nervous breakdown about 1925, he started to work for the Rosenthal family almost entirely, only going to the plant at ‘rush’ periods. Altho he drove the ear for the family, he also acted as a secretary, keeping Mrs. Rosenthal’s books and attending to the payment of taxes and insurance and collecting the income from their real estate investment; Behring acted in this capacity until the death of Henry Rosenthal in January of 1937. During this period, he received from $30 to $40 a week. . . .</p>

Her niece testified Behring was treated like a son by decedent. There was evidence to the same effect given by disinterested witnesses, relatives, neighbors, by decedent’s securities’ broker, by her first cousin, who was a medical doctor in the United States Navy, by Fitzpatrick, an officer of the corporation and trusted by decedent’s husband; by MacGregor, Trust officer of the First National Bank who had advised decedent dur<a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>ing the last months of her life.

In the many conferences which you say you had with Mrs. Rosenthal, subsequent to her husband’s death, what knowledge did she exhibit regarding the affairs of her husband’s estate? A. I would say a very thorough knowledge. She was a very keen, intelligent woman, and all the problems of the estate were discussed with her in detail.

Did you have any later conversations with her regarding the value of the stock? A.

She discussed it with Behring before she went to the hospital and after she returned. The final result of her conversations on the subject with him was that, at her request, he prepared the option which she executed and delivered. She was then about 65 years of age. She left legacies to a sister, nephews, nieces, and to charities, which, with $5,000 to Behring, amounted in all to a sum in excess of $27,000.

Behring notified his co-executors that he would be prepared to make settlement on January 10, 1938, and requested that they be prepared to make delivery. Notice was given to others interested who objected to the executors’ carrying out the agreement, whereupon, Behring’s co-executors, Sidney Driefus and First National Bank of Philadelphia, on the 6th of January, 1938, wrote him acknowledging his notice but stating that they had been advised by counsel they could not make the settlement because of the objection of the grandchildren’s guardian. This refusal to perform led to Behring’s application to the court, which, on January 21, 1938, made a decree authorizing the executor to waive tender until further order. The learned judge was entirely right in authorizing the executor to make the waiver for the reasons given; the court had jurisdiction of the parties, and the best interest of the decedent’s estate required it. We quote that decree, which was dictated by the learned judge in the presence of counsel for appellant, because it shows on its face that even if cash had been then tendered the objection made on behalf of appellant would still have been pressed.</p>

Another of these witnesses was Mr. Fitzpatrick, Vice-President of the Rosenthal corporation. He had been employed by that company for 11 years. He referred to the investments in stocks and bonds held by the company and other matters involved in its business. He testified that after Mr. Rosenthal’s death, Mrs. Rosenthal “came down to the office nearly every day until she got sick.” After that “I used to go up to see her quite frequently . . . and talk with her on the phone.” In July of 1937 she was elected President of the company. “She was very active. She signed all checks up until the time she got sick.” He said: “A. She was a very keen woman. She knew about copper and she knew about prices of everything, and followed the stock market very closely. I know on our copper I never sold a pound of copper— we started to sell copper in February, and sold it clear up to May—I am speaking now of new copper—everybody knows what it is—we never sold a pound without her approval. We had lots of offers for it, because it was on the rise, and I would ask her or I would call her up if she didn’t come down, that so-and-so wants to buy a carload.

She told me all about what took place at the meeting in July, whom we should have as directors and officers, how much salary they should receive, how much I should receive, how much Archie and A1 and everybody else should receive.

In fact, I did, about the salary and so forth, and she said no, she wanted so-and-so, and I said, ‘All right.’ She told me Avhat she wanted, and that is the way it went through, according to her wishes.” Between July 7th and August 20th, Mr. Fitzpatrick says that he “would probably go up maybe once a week or sometimes a little more frequently.” In measuring the importance properly attributable to Mr. Fitzpatrick’s evidence, reference may be made to a letter dated December 26, 1934, written by Henry Rosenthal and addressed “To my dear wife and executors.” After other instructions for the conduct of the business of the corporation, and for her election as president, he wrote: “As President of Jos. Rosenthal’s Sons, Inc., you should personally arrange to sign all checks, notes, legal documents, etc., and if you feel like giving this power to anyone else, give the same to John. E. Fitzpatrick as Secretary. Should you decide to dissolve the said Corporation, arrange with your co-executor The First National Bank . . . along <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>with John Fitzpatrick and dispose of all of the Assets existing and distribute the proceeds . . .”</p>

He was asked: “Q. As an expert in the securities business, what was your opinion of Mrs. Rosenthal’s business judgment as to stocks and bonds? A. Mrs. Rosenthal, I would say, she had very good judgment of stocks and bonds. In fact, she had better judgment than I did on some things, because I can remember one time I tried to get her to sell some Montgomery Ward at a very low price, and I think she sold it at 100 points higher. She used to kid me about that. Q. From your observation of Mrs. Rosenthal, would you say she was the type of woman that might easily have become the object of a designing person? A. I wouldn’t think so.” Testimony consistent with this was given by relatives and neighbors of Mrs. Rosenthal.</p>

Dr. Michael would not definitely describe her mental condition, but from what he saw between July 3d and July 11th, he said “her condition was fair enough to discuss things of a serious nature, but I wouldn’t, even during that period, have advised it.” As to the period after the 11th, he said, “In other word, if I had been asked by anyone, as medical advice, ‘Should I discuss anything very serious with this patient?’ I would say, ‘No, not to her benefit.’ Not being a mental expert, I couldn’t say whether she could have or not.

      <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>Dr. Schless appears an interested witness. He said that during July and August, 1937, he “saw . her on an average of four times a week.” Asked whether he would have permitted “any discussion with her about serious matters or serious affairs,” he said, “I didn’t think the woman was in a condition to know what it was all about . . .” At another place in the evidence he said “she was never a business woman.” His testimony is not always consistent. He was apparently not as well informed of the extent of her participation in the business of the corporation as other witnesses, some of whose names have been mentioned, who were directly connected with it and, therefore, in a position to know* from personal observation. The doctor of course cannot be blamed for not having this information but, on the other hand, his lack of information will not permit the court to disregard the obviously credible evidence of other witnesses possessing direct knowledge and to rely on his alone. The doctor’s evidence must also be considered in another aspect. There appears to have been a marked antipathy to Behring; the doctor testified that “for a number of years” he “wouldn’t speak to” Behring. He had suggested to Mr. Rosenthal “that he should get rid of Mr. Behring.” It may be that this antipathy was dissipated before the trial of this case because there is a letter dated October 8, 1937, from the doctor to Mr. Behring addressed “Dear Frank” and signed “Bob S” in the course of which he says—“I have expected to have seen you long before this. I don’t know your address or phone number (this letter will have to wait until I get the former.)</p>

The physical weakness of this woman who was over sixty years of age is most apparent. She was suffering from an incurable cancer and was forced to undergo two severe operations. Large doses of morphine were constantly administered to her, and during the greater part of the time after the death of her husband, she was confined to her bed. The majority opinion also points out that Behring kept all her books and records, managed her mortgages and real estate, helped to settle her husband’s estate, took complete charge of the house and the expenses incident thereto, managed all her personal affairs, and had power to draw checks on her bank account. In addition, the testimony is uncontradicted that Mrs. Rosenthal told her broker that anything Behring did with respect to her investment account would be all right. Furthermore, she had Behring made Treasurer of the company so “he would have complete control of the checks that were issued.” There is not the slightest doubt from the evidence that he was her adviser in all business affairs. He was also made executor of her will and in fact prepared a codicil to it. He took care of her personal needs during her illness and was permitted to see Mrs. Rosenthal when even her relatives were excluded because of her serious condition.

The woman managed his property, and he constantly confided in her with respect to both his personal and business affairs. The court there held that a confidential relation existed. In <em>Corrigan v. Conway, </em><a href="/pa/269/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="269 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="1063598" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0373-01">269 Pa. 373</a>, the only evidence discussed by this court in sustaining a finding of confidential relationship was that the donee of certain property was the brother of the donor, that he had transacted her business and had been consulted by her relative to her affairs, and that the deeds were prepared by an agent of the donee. In <em>Allen v. LaVaud, </em><a href="/ny/213/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="213 N.Y. 322" data-case-ids="68829" data-case-paths="/ny/213/0322-01">supra,</a> the evidence disclosed that the grantor was suffering from a fatal disease, that stimulants were systematically administered to him, that he conveyed a large part of his property to his daughter who nursed him and whose advice he sought. The court held that a confidential relation existed. The recent case of <em>McCown v. Fraser, </em>supra, presents a close analogy to the situation in this case. There the donor was an aged woman who had implicit confidence in the donee, a young man who lived with her. The donee took care of the donor’s securities, and had power to draw on her bank account. As in the present case, the donee was there made an executor of the donor’s will, and she repeatedly told others of the confidence she placed in him. We <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>there held that a confidential relation existed, and since all the factors there present are apparent in this case in even a stronger degree, it seems to me that there is not the slightest doubt that such a relation existed here.</p>

It appears to me that this conclusion ignores the heavy burden which the law places upon Behring to overcome the presumption of invalidity. As I read the record the facts not only fail to overcome this burden, but on the contrary raise a strong suspicion that he took advantage of the inability of this dying woman to manage her own affairs.</p>

In 1917 Behring had been employed by the Rosenthals as a chauffeur. During Mr. Rosenthal’s lifetime, he served the family in various other capacities and also did work for Mr. Rosenthal in connection with the latter’s business. But throughout this entire period his wages never exceeded |10 per week, and <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>when he worked for the corporation he did so only as an ordinary employee. The majority opinion states that even during Mr. Rosenthal’s lifetime Behring managed Mrs. Rosenthal’s property in New Jersey and handled her books and records, but it admits that there is no testimony that his advice was followed as to the action to be taken in regard to these matters and that his duties relative thereto were purely ministerial. When Mr. Eosenthal died, leaving an estate of several hundred thousand dollars, he gave Behring a legacy of $500. Upon his death a letter was found which gave explicit and detailed advice to his wife in reference to what should be done concerning his estate. In the letter he directed her not to dispose of the stock unless it was paid for in full. If she should see fit to dissolve the corporation he directed her to consult John E. Fitzpatrick and the First National Bank; no mention is made of Behring. He advised her to give the power of signing checks to Mr. Fitzpatrick; again no mention made of Behring. If she desired to make any investments, she was directed to seek the advice of her banker, and was expressly cautioned not to listen to anyone else concerning these matters. These facts leave no doubt as to Behring’s status prior to Mr. Eosenthal’s death.</p>
    <p id="b126-5" data-blocks='[["BL_126.5",126,[300,1716,1150,696]]]'>Upon Mr. Rosenthal’s death in January, 1937, Behring’s importance in the Eosenthal family acquired a new aspect. Only ten days after her husband’s death Mrs. Eosenthal’s only daughter died. There can be no doubt that these two deaths had a severe effect on Mrs. Eosenthal and caused her to lean heavily for advice and comfort upon anyone whom she believed she could trust. From the end of January until her death in August, Behring became the dominating influence over her affairs, both personal and business. As has already been indicated he had complete dominion over her investments and finances and controlled her interests in the corporation.</p>
    <p id="b127-3" data-blocks='[["BL_127.4",127,[165,352,1152,1130]]]'>
      <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>During all this period Mrs. Rosenthal was slowly dying as a victim of cancer and this fact was known to Behring. In May, 1937, she was taken to the hospital for an exploratory operation and was found to have an inoperable cancer. From that time until her death she was given comparatively large doses of morphine daily to alleviate the constant pain from which she suffered. On June 27, 1937, she underwent a second operation at which time a colostomy was performed. It was just three weeks after this last operation and only a month prior to her death that Behring obtained the option. The very day following the execution of the agreement she suffered a severe heart attack. Such was the condition of the person from whom Behring obtained the option. These facts are of utmost significance, for in determining whether the burden of proof has been met the degree of infirmity of Mrs. Rosenthal and her ability to understand the nature and consequences of the acts done on her behalf are of prime importance: <em>Wilson’s </em>Appeal, <a href="/pa/99/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="99 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="446076" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0545-01">99 Pa. 545</a>; <em>Ten Eyck v.

    <p id="b127-4" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[165,1503,1152,972]]]'>Furthermore, the circumstances relating to the actual execution of the written option are strongly suspicious, and the evidence fails to sustain the burden of showing that the transaction was free from the slightest trace of undue influence. The majority opinion stresses the testimony of various witnesses that Mrs. Rosenthal had a keen knowledge'of the business. But in her own letters to a friend she stated that she did not understand the business. The majority opinion also states that $150 a share was a fair price for the stock. Yet in the letter which Mr. Rosenthal left for his widow on his death he advised her not to sell for less than 10% over book value, and when the option was granted the book value was $180 per share and the actual value was in excess of this amount. When Mrs. Rosenthal was offered $150 a shai’e by the minority shareholders, she refused the offer because the pxfice was wholly insufficient.</p>

      <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>Even if the book value is taken to be the actual value of the stock, the value of the option exceeds $45,000. For this, the option agreement, drawn up by Behring himself, recites that the consideration given is the faithful services rendered by him and $1. It is likewise significant that the option was suggested to Mrs. Rosenthal by Behring and, according to Behring’s own testimony, she did not know what an option was. No independent advice was received by Mrs. Rosenthal and it is not clear that anyone else was aware of the execution of the option. Nor can we ignore the fact that Behring drew up the agreement himself. The courts, in considering whether a person in a confidential relation has met the burden cast upon him, lay great stress on whether independent advice is given and on whether the instrument is drawn up by the recipient of the benefits of the transaction: <em>Yeakel v. </em>McAtee, <a href="/pa/156/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="156 Pa. 600" data-case-ids="844903" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0600-01">156 Pa. 600</a>; <em>Bauman v.

He also wrote a codicil to that will giving himself a one-half interest in the income of a trust fund which had been set up for the benefit of Mrs. Rosenthal’s grandchildren, and this codicil was produced by Behring after Mrs. Rosenthal’s death. Although the benefits he thus secured for himself under her will are independent of the option, nevertheless they cannot be ignored in considering the relation between the parties and the circumstances surrounding this transaction. The option was to continue for six months, and Behring was well aware that when that time arrived she would be dead and he would be an executor of her estate. The fact that the value of the stock comprised almost half of the total value of Mrs. Rosenthal’s estate is likewise <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>important, for where the property involved in the transaction comprises a large part of the total estate, there is more occasion for viewing the transaction with suspicion: Ha<em>sel v.

    <p id="b129-5" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[174,783,1153,638]]]'>The majority rely somewhat on the principle that the facts found by the Master have the binding effect of a verdict of a jury.

This court is not bound to accept his inferences and conclusions, <em>(Kline’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/280/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="280 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="1084452" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0041-01">280 Pa. 41</a>, 44), but on the contrary must draw from the admitted facts its own inferences and conclusions.
