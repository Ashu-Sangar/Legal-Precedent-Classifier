Defendants, husband and wife, claim title thereto by virtue of a written agreement executed and delivered to them by Christian Binkley on November 6, 1936, and recorded subsequently to his death. On the day following the execution of this instrument, Binkley delivered possession of the premises to the defendants, whose occupancy has been continuous since that time. It is conceded that defendants have faithfully performed the terms of the agreement.</p>

They further stress the use of the word “agreement” by the parties, rather than the terms “deed” or “conveyance” customarily employed to designate an instrument creating a fee simple estate. The omission of the words “grant and convey,” and of any reference to “heirs and <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>assigns” is also regarded by the plaintiffs as fatal to the construction urged by the defendants.</p>

Nor is any prescribed form essential to the validity of a deed; and a deed informally drawn will convey the fee.’ ”</p>

      <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>It is not necessary that the words “heirs and assigns” he used in granting a fee simple title, as the Act of April 1, 1909, P. L. 91, Section 7, dispenses with the formal requirement of words of inheritance in such conveyances. While a cursory perusal of the separate terms of this writing suggests many apparent contradictions of purpose, we are convinced, that it vested in the defendants an estate in fee simple, deferring their complete enjoyment thereof until the death of the grantor, for whose benefit a monthly rent was reserved for life.</p>
    <p id="b629-4" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[168,957,1155,699]]]'>That the agreement passed a present and irrevocable interest in the property is clear from the paragraph conferring upon the defendants the right “to remain in said premises during their lifetime or so long as they desire, or if any time they choose to sell said property they may do so.” There is no merit in plaintiffs’ contention that the instrument is testamentary. The reservation by the grantor of a life interest in rents is not inconsistent with the immediate conveyance of title, inter vivos, to the grantees. See <em>Eckman v.

Any implication of an intention to lease the premises arising from the words “does rent” is completely negatived by the absolute power given to the grantees to sell the premises. A pertinent analogy is found in <em>Krider v. Lafferty, </em><a href="/whart/1/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Whart. 303" data-case-ids="1829020" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0303-01">supra,</a> where a deed reciting that “John Lentz hath <em>let </em>unto the said D.

Similarly, the creation of an estate for life cannot be inferred, because of the provision that “the property becomes the property” of the grantees “without any obligations” upon the death of the grantor.</p>
