Forsyth, who died on June 3, 1932, was bequeathed the sum of $5,000 and certain portraits. The testatrix then made other pecuniary bequests to other persons. The will was executed May 20, 1931. On May 4, 1932, the testatrix made a codicil to her will, the third paragraph of which reads as follows : “None of the bequests I have made in any of the clauses of my said last Will and Testament are to be paid out of my real estate or the proceeds thereof, but wholly out of my personal estate, nor is any of the jewelry to be sold or disposed of for this purpose, as X <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>have made other disposition thereof, nor is any of the furniture, dishes, glass ware, silver or other personal effects or pictures, except the stocks and bonds, to be used to pay the personal bequests, as they are to go to my beloved niece Bethed Pershing Hartshorn under the residuary clause herein.”</p>

It is, as the auditor stated it, as follows: '“Are the pecuniary legatees named in the first eleven clauses of the Will of decedent entitled to have their legacies paid out of the whole of the personal estate that came into the hands of the Executor, or are they limited to the stocks and bonds?”</p>

He said: “We are fully convinced that testatrix unquestionably expressed a contrary intention when she said that none of the pecuniary bequests are to be paid out of her real estate or the proceeds thereof and that no personal property should be used for the payment of <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>these personal bequests except the stocks and bonds. This language is clear. . . . While it is true that a testator’s intention must be gathered from the language of his will, nevertheless, it is also the established law of this state that the intention is not to be gathered from a possible but unexpressed intent. <em>French’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/292/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="292 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="1109692" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0037-01">292 Pa. 37</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.%20549" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="140 A. 549">140 A. 549</a>]; <em>Ludwick’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/269/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="269 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1063475" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0365-01">269 Pa. 365</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=132%20A.%20543" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="132 A. 543">132 A. 543</a>].

    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[267,937,1157,1348]]]'>In his paper book appellant says: “If, in the case at bar, there were a direction to pay the legacies out of the personalty, without anything more, these bequests would undoubtedly be demonstrative, but the language of the Will is: ‘None of the bequests I have made in any of the clauses of my said last Will and Testament áre to be' paid out of my real estate or the proceeds thereof, but wholly out of my personal estate, . . . ’ and directs that the bonds and stocks should be sold for that purpose and that other articles of personal estate are not to be sold. Under the law as contained hereinabove, these legacies áre specific, but whether they be specific or demonstrative, they should have been paid in full, together with interest, as will be hereinafter shown. In <em>Crawford’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/293/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="293 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1111109" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0570-01">293 Pa. 570</a> at 574, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.%20214" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="143 A. 214">143 A. 214</a>, the court, quoting from <em>Walls v.

But where the gift if [is] of the fund itself, in whole or in part, or so charged upon the object made subject to it as to show an intent to burden that object alone with the payment, it is esteemed specific.” ’ ”</p>

This construction appears to counsel for the appellee to be correct—it was a specific bequest of the proceeds of the sale of stocks and bonds. A specific legacy is the gift by will of a particular thing or its proceeds. <em>Balliet’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/14/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="14 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="405891" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0451-01">14 Pa. 451</a>; <em>McMahon’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/132/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="132 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="970520" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0175-01">132 Pa. 175</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.%2068" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="19 A. 68">19 A. 68</a>]; <em>In re Snyder’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/217/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="217 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="953718" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0071-01">217 Pa. 71</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20157" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="66 A. 157">66 A. 157</a>]; <em>In re Wood’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/267/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="267 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="1057736" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0462-01">267 Pa. 462</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.%2090" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="110 A. 90">110 A. 90</a>].

    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[170,946,1155,1140]]]'>The contention of the appellee must be sustained by us, as it was sustained by the court below. It is clear that under the terms of the third paragraph of the codicil, the appellant is not entitled to have his legacy paid out of any other estate of the decedent. The testatrix bequeathed the appellant $5,000, but restricted its payment to the proceeds of the sale of “stocks and bonds.” The record shows such net proceeds have been applied proportionately to appellant’s claim. . The cash in the estate has been used for administration expenses, There is nothing more in the estate which is available for the payment of appellant’s legacy. There was a sum amounting with interest to $63,125.10 realized from the sale of certain real estate which had been condemned by the School District of Shamokin Borough, the condemnation proceedings having been instituted on February 2, 1925. On August 13, 1927, Mrs. Forsyth agreed with the School District to convey this property to it. for $49,000, payable upon six months’ notice at any .time after August 1, 1930, the vendor meantime to remain in possession.</p>

Appellant insists that the debts, funeral expenses and administrative expenses are payable out of the residuary estate. Since the cash in the estate was used to pay debts and expenses and since the net proceeds of the sale of stocks and bonds was used to pay specific legacies proportionately, no money could be obtained for the payment of the balance of appellant’s legacy unless the money realized from the sale of the real estate was so applied, and this was devised and bequeathed to Bethed Pershing Hartshorn, her heirs and assigns.</p>
    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[282,958,1151,1456]],["BL_343.1",343,[143,347,1154,638]]]'>When all the parties were before the court at the time of the audit of the first and second accounts, the present appellant made no objection to the use of the balance of cash then in the hands of the executor in payment of creditors under the auditor’s report. According to appellant’s present contention, the legatees at the time the first and second partial accounts were filed (January 7, 1933, and August 26, 1933, respectively) had the right to demand that all the debts and expenses of the estate should be made out of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate so that the cash assets first in the hands of the executor could be preserved intact and thus appellant’s bequest of $5,000 (in the eighth paragraph of the will) be paid. This demand, if acceded to, would have been tantamount to paying appellant’s bequest out of the proceeds of the real estate and this would have been contrary to testatrix’s testamentary intention as expressed in paragraph 3 of her codicil of May 4, 1932 (supra). Appellant did not <em>then </em>demand the stocks and bonds in kind or the proceeds thereof. He made no objections to the accounts. The auditor’s report on these two partial accounts was confirmed absolutely on February 19, 1934. Now appellant demands that the full amount of his bequest be paid out of the estate, though admittedly, in order to do this, some of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate would have to be used.
