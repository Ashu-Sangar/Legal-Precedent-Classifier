    <p id="b178-11" data-blocks='[["BL_178.16",178,[277,1598,1151,316]]]'>The question is whether a nonresident executor of a decedent who resided outside of this Commonwealth may be made a party defendant in an action pending in a court of this state, by the service upon it of a writ of scire facias by publication, where such executor has qualified and is acting under the laws of another state.</p>
    <p id="b178-12" data-blocks='[["BL_178.17",178,[278,1925,1150,480]],["BL_179.1",179,[164,341,1151,201]]]'>The facts upon which the question arises are as follows: On September 30, 1934, the minor plaintiff was injured by an automobile operated by the defendant, Samuel W. Taylor, who was a resident of Kent County, Delaware. The accident occurred in Philadelphia, and the present action of trespass was instituted in the court below to recover damages for the injuries so sustained. The writ of summons was served upon defendant by deputizing the sheriff of Dauphin County to make sery<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>ice, in the manner provided by tbe Motor Vehicle Act of May 14, 1929, P. L. 1721, as amended. Shortly thereafter a general appearance was entered by attorneys on behalf of defendant.</p>
    <p id="b179-3" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[164,561,1153,920]]]'>While the suit was pending, defendant died on September 29, 1936, and subsequently the plaintiffs filed a suggestion of his death and of the appointment of the National Bank of Smyrna, Delaware, as his executor, letters testamentary having been granted by the Register of Wills of Kent County, Delaware, on November 5, 1936. Plaintiffs then caused a writ of scire facias to issue against the executor to show cause why it should not be made a party defendant in the present action, and by order of the court below, leave was given to make service of the writ by publication in a local newspaper in Smyrna, and by mailing a copy thereof to the executor by registered mail. The order was predicated upon the provisions of Section 35(h) of the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, P. L. 447, 505, (20 PS Sec. 778). Proof of publication and an affidavit of service of the copy of the writ by registered mail were duly filed.</p>
    <p id="b179-4" data-blocks='[["BL_179.6",179,[165,1493,1159,907]]]'>The executor subsequently filed its petition under the Act of March 5,1925, P. L. 23, raising preliminarily the question of jurisdiction of the court upon the ground that the provision in question of the Fiduciaries Act is in conflict with the due process clause of the Federal Constitution if it purports, in an action for a judgment <em>in personam, </em>to confer jurisdiction by publication upon a nonresident executor or administrator whose authority is derived from a state other than Pennsylvania, and whose decedent was a nonresident of this state. Plaintiffs in their answer admit the averments concerning the nonresidence of decedent and of his executor, and the latter’s appointment as such in the State of Delaware. It is further admitted that plaintiffs seek to recover a judgment against the National Bank of Smyrna in its representative capacity as executor of the decedent.</p>

      <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>A practical basis for the rule is found in the difficulty of enforcing a judgment rendered against an executor in a foreign state. Such judgment cannot be collected in the state in which it was obtained because of the absence of an estate therein out of which the judgment is to be paid; it cannot be collected in the state wherein the executor was appointed, for there no recognition or effect will be accorded the judgment because of lack of jurisdiction over the executor.</p>

Pendleton, </em>4 S. &amp; R. 389, and in <em>Evans v. Tatem, Admx., </em>9 S. &amp; R. 252. These decisions were criticized in <em>Magraw v. Irwin, </em><a href="/pa/87/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="87 Pa. 139" data-case-ids="1057860" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0139-01">87 Pa. 139</a>.

There suit was instituted against a foreign executor of a nonresident decedent, and service was made in this state upon the executor. In an opinion by Mr. Justice Mitchell we sustained the jurisdiction of the court, and said (p. 179) : “The general rule as stated in the text books is that an executor can only sue or be sued in his own forum: . . . But in Pennsylvania the rule cannot be stated so broadly. . . . as an executor or administrator’s right to act for his decedent <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>depends on Ms representative character conferred by letters testamentary, these latter cannot of course give authority beyond the jurisdiction of the officer granting them. Hence the deduction is plain that a foreign executor cannot sue in another tribunal by virtue of his foreign letters alone. <em>But it is quite another step to say that he cannot be sued there”; </em>and (p. 183) : “. . . it must be taken as the rule in Pennsylvania that a foreign executor within the jurisdiction of our courts is liable to suit by a resident creditor of his decedent, and such suit will be sustained unless it trenches unduly on the jurisdiction of another court already attached, or would expose parties subject to such jurisdiction to inequitable burdens.”</p>
    <p id="b182-4" data-blocks='[["BL_182.5",182,[286,1055,1151,261]]]'>We have also held, apparently contrary to the weight of authority, that the voluntary appearance in a court of this state by a foreign executor or administrator in a suit brought against him in his representative capacity will confer jurisdiction: <em>Evans v.

Subsection (h), as we have seen, provides for the service of the writ of scire facias where such executor or administrator resides without the jurisdiction of the court, in another county of the state, or resides in some other state of the United States. A review of the eleven subdivisions of Section 35 fails to disclose in any one thereof an intention that its provisions shall apply to an executor, administrator or other <em>fiduciary appointed outside of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</em>
