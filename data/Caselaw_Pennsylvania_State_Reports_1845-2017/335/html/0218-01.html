      <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>It is obvious that whether the phrases “expiration of lease” and “termination of lease” mean exactly the same thing depends entirely on the circumstances which occasioned their use. Webster’s New International Dictionary defines '“expiration” as “termination or end” and defines “termination” as “that which ends.” The testatrix might have used with verbal accuracy either word in the now questioned clauses of her will, and we would still have before us the problem whether she meant the trust to come to an end when the lease had run its full course of 50 years from January 1, 1905, or had come to an end by the lessee’s breach of its covenants.</p>

Chief Justice Fullee, in writing the opinion for the Supreme Court of the United States in Y. <em>W. C. H. v. French, </em><a href="/us/187/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="187 U.S. 401" data-case-ids="6141247" data-case-paths="/us/187/0401-01">187 U.

E. 859</a>, the Court of Appeals of New York held: “When [a testator] has expressed himself in ambiguous or doubtful language, the law will impute to his words such a meaning as, under all the circumstances, will conform to his probable intention and be <em>most agreeable to reason and justice </em>[italics supplied] .” In 69 C. J., page 63, section 1120, there is laid down this principle: “In determining the testator’s intention the court should place itself as nearly as possible in his position, and hence, . . . should take into consideration the situation of the testator and the facts <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>and circumstances surrounding Mm at the time the will was executed, . . . the state of the property devised,” the amount and character of the property of the testator when he made his will <em>(McGlathery’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/311/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="311 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1146311" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0351-01">311 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20886" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="166 A. 886">166 A. 886</a>) and <em>“the testator’s relation to the beneficiaries, their condition or necessities </em>[italics supplied].”</p>
    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[155,730,1155,1404]]]'>We cannot assume that when the testatrix made her will, she had any reason to believe that the lease in question would be terminated before it had run its allotted course. Up to the time the will was made in 1909, the lessee, it must be presumed, had faithfully performed his covenants and certainly the lessor could not have contemplated that 25 years later the lease would be breached and a forfeiture declared. It is clear to us that when the testatrix employed in her will the phrase “expiration of the present lease of my real property in Easton,” she had firmly in her mind the year <em>1955, when according to the lease’s own provisions, </em>it would come to an end. Had the testatrix desired an earlier termination of the trust she created, she could easily have so provided. Obviously, she did not intend that the trust whose creation she carefully provided for by will in 1909 and which was to come into legal being at the moment of her death (which occurred October 18, 1915) should last <em>either </em>one day <em>or </em>two days <em>or </em>any other period short of <em>50 </em>years from January 1, 1905, as the <em>vicissitudes of a tenancy might determine. </em>An individual who creates a trust normally chooses to have its lifetime fixed by his own resolve and not by some happening over wMch he will have no control and which will bear no relation whatsoever to the trust’s raison d’etre.</p>
    <p id="b279-6" data-blocks='[["BL_279.6",279,[157,2156,1152,259]],["BL_280.1",280,[316,364,1153,1135]]]'>The court below aptly said: “The testatrix contemplated and intended a fixed and not a variable period of time. It is clear that the testatrix at the time the will was written would not have desired that the trust terminate before Evalyn had attained the age of 25 years. <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>Yet, had the testatrix died shortly after executing the will and had Dalrymple then defaulted the trust would have been terminated almost immediately, before the education of Evalyn had been completed, if the words ‘expiration of the lease’ meant any termination of the lease. At the same time it is evident that the testatrix desired Evalyn to enjoy one-half of the income from the trust either for the period of her life or if she and Robert lived that long until the expiration of the lease. Can it reasonably be assumed that the testatrix intended the period during which Evalyn should enjoy one-half of the income of the trust to depend upon the faithful performance of a lessee, a stranger to the estate? . . . In the context of a thoughtful and solemn devise of property the court can only conclude that the testatrix in measuring time by the duration of a lease contemplated the full period of the agreed term of the lease, intending, as testators habitually intend, that the efflux of time and the survival of issue, and not the irrelevant and self-interested act of a stranger, should determine the ultimate disposition of her estate.”</p>
