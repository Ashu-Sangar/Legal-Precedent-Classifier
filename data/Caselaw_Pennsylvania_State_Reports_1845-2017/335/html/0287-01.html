He therefore had ample sources of information. June 4, 1937, he filed a petition asking that the testimony of himself and certain witnesses in Germany be taken there because the condition of his health disabled him from <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>coming to this state to prove his claim and, in addition, that he conld not require the presence of foreign witnesses here. The petition was opposed by others interested and was ultimately withdrawn, apparently because petitioner considered himself unable to bear the expense involved. Nearly two years later, on February 17, 1939, he filed the present petition for letters rogatory. It appears to be based on the same ground as was alleged in the former application. When it was filed, appellant was 85 years of age. We assume, for the purposes of this discussion, that he cannot come here without taking the risks stated in his physicians’ affidavits.

B., said: “The Court must take care on the one hand that it [order to take testimony] is not granted when it would be oppressive or unfair to the opposite party, and on the other hand that a party has reasonable facilities for making out his case, when from the circumstances there is a difficulty in the way of witnesses attending at the trial. All the circumstancés of each particular case must be taken into consideration. With regard to the case of a plaintiff asking for a commission to examine himself, that also appears to me to be a matter of discretion, but the discretion will be exercised in a stricter manner, and the Court ought to require to be more clearly satisfied that the order for a commission ought to be made.” Now, not only do we agree with the principle announced by the learned Master of the Bolls that when a plaintiff asks to have himself examined abroad, he must submit his petition to a stricter scrutiny than would be exercised in passing on a petition for the examination of <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>witnesses only, but we all agree that, in addition, if a foreign plaintiff is claiming against the Commonwealth,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> his petition must show a situation against which no reasonable objection can be suggested.</p>

      <em>Nadin v. Bassett, 25 </em>Ch. Div. 21 (1884), involved an application for the appointment of special examiners to take testimony of a plaintiff in New Zealand who claimed property in England. The application having been granted below, the Court of Appeal imposed a condition : “On his own showing, he has been absent from England twenty-four years, and it is by no means an improbable supposition that he may be some person unconnected with the family, who having heard of this property, has come forward alleging himself to be the heir of the devisee. Justice requires that he should appear at the trial in order that his identity may be tested. I think, therefore, that the order must be qualified by inserting a proviso that the depositions of the Plaintiff are not to be read if the Defendant requires him to appear at the trial to be examined and cross-examined.” (p. 30) Lindley, L. J., said: “Our order in fact comes to this, that the Plaintiff’s depositions on his own behalf are not to be read without the consent of the Defendant.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Div. 764, (1881) note, the ground of plaintiff’s application was that he was afflicted by heart disease which would render a sea voyage perilous to him. The appeal was from an order granting the application; it was reversed for abuse of discretion. The question was whether, under the wording of a rule of court, it was “for the purposes of justice” so to take the plaintiff’s testimony. Baggallay, L. J., said “Of course, Tor the purposes of justice’ does not mean in the interest of either party to the litigation, but in the interest of all the parties to the litigation.” After considering the nature of the issues involved, he said: “And I think that, even in the extreme case where the refusal of a commission might prevent the evidence of the witness from being given at all, yet, if the Court was satisfied that the non-attendance of the witness before the tribunal which had to decide the case would lead to injustice to the Defendant, the commission still ought to be refused. I do not, however, so regard the evidence in the present case.” In <em>Chase v. Northern Trust Co. </em>[1932] 4 D. L.

The petition shall be signed and sworn to by the petitioner, except in cases where this is impracticable, the reason therefor to appear in the petition or affidavit.” The Commonwealth’s brief calls attention to the violation of this rule and asserts that it does not appear that it was impracticable to have had a petition sworn to by appellant, himself, especially in view of the long period of time available for that purpose, and that, in a case of this nature, the court and the parties interested should have the affidavit of one with personal knowledge of essential facts averred.

All the other claimants have an equal interest in the administration of justice. Even if we assume, in accord with the doctors’ affidavits, that appellant is now unable to travel, that fact will not determine that the administration of justice will fail, because, as we have already said, the Commonwealth and a number of other claimants are equally interested that justice be done; they have claims of their own, and may rightfully insist on the same scrutiny by cross-examination of appellant and witnesses sup<a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>porting Ms claim as Ms counsel here may make of evidence offered in support of appellees’ claims.

It is not a sufficient answer to this demand to say that written cross-interrogatories may be filed. It is common experience that answers in oral cross-examination and the manner in which they are given, suggest other questions ; that such lines of inquiry cannot be anticipated, and that frequently the discovery of truth is dependent on the exercise of the right immediately to pursue the examination. In such circumstances we cannot accept the position taken in appellant’s brief that “to grant the petition would work no real injury to appellees.” Action under the rule of the court below referred to by appellant, that on the return of the commission, adverse parties may “file exceptions to the form thereof, to the manner of swearing the witnesses or to any acts or omissions of the officer taking the testimony or of any other officer in or about the execution thereof” does not supply the advantages lost by the limited nature of the scope of cross-examination permissible by written cross-interrogatories.</p>
