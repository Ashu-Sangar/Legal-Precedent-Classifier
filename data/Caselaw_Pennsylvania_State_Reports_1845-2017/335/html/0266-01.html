The sum of $5,109.48, with interest, <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>was claimed, based upon the weekly wages of $30.78 from December 15, 1934, to the time of suit brought.</p>
    <p id="b325-3" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[176,445,1154,1182]]]'>The position taken by defendant in its affidavit of defense, and relied upon before us, is that the alleged contract, upon which plaintiff bases his cause of action, is null and void under the Workmen’s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, as amended, 77 PS Sec. 1 et seq., which was in effect at the time the alleged contract was entered into. Section 407 of the act provides: “On or after the tenth day after any accident shall have occurred, the employer and employe or his dependents may agree upon the compensation payable to the employe or his dependents under this act; but any agreement made prior to the tenth day after the accident shall have occurred, or permitting a commutation of payments contrary to the provisions of this act, or varying the amount to be paid or the period during which compensation shall be payable as provided in this act, shall be wholly null and void.” We thus see that an agreement permitting a commutation of payments contrary to the provisions of the act or varying the amount to be paid or the period during which compensation shall be payable “shall be wholly null and void.”</p>

To adopt plaintiff’s view, would be to ignore the legislative mandate: <em>Ashland Lumber Co. v.
