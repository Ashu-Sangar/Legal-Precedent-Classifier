His wound was treated by Dr. Bigelow, the appellant, who described it as “entirely sub-cutaneous . . . not deep” and “just under the skin.” He treated it in the following manner: after being cleaned externally with alcohol, it was “swabbed all the way to the bottom” with a swab soaked in alcohol and it was also swabbed with tincture of iodine. He then placed in the wound a loose gauze drain which had been soaked with alcohol and he then applied a sterile dressing. On three succeeding days he repeated the treatment. During this course of treatment the condition of the wound impressed the physician as “very satisfactory.” He detected “no signs of the onset of any infection of any serious nature.” On the fifth day after the injury, the physician did not see the boy. On the sixth day, the latter was brought to the physician’s office and the same treatment as previously given was administered. On that occasion the doctor was told by the boy’s stepfather that the child had complained about his jaws hurting him or being stiff.” Upon examining the boy, the doctor described the condition of his jaws and mouth as “perfectly normal.” He found “no rigidity of his neck muscles.” At 3 a. m. of the following-day the doctor ivas summoned to the boy’s home and he found him to be suffering with “definite stiffness of the masseter muscle and some of his neck.” The boy was immediately taken to the Jefferson Hospital. There, after Dr. Fry saw the child in the defendant’s presence, the latter left the hospital and never again saw the boy professionally. Dr. Shallow, whose assistant Dr. Fry was, testified that when he first saw the boy the latter was suffering from “tetanus and an infection of his leg . . . the smear of which showed <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>a staphylococcus infection. . . . His neck was stiff, he was unable to open his mouth more than about half an inch, the muscles of his abdomen were rigid, and he had generalized rigidity of all the voluntary muscles.” Dr. Shallow “ordered the injection into the patient of a tetanus anti-toxin ... of 15,000 units.” A few hours later, he operated on the boy, and “excised the wound tract and the adjacent tissue down to the deep fascia, leaving the wound wide open.” He took out “the tract which was infected” and removed “all of the devitalized tissue and some of the sound tissue.” His operation he described technically as a “debridement—an incision for the extent of the tract.” He added: “I take that entire area out because that tract is where the tetanus organism is lodged.” “Tetanus,” he said, “is a local disease, and the toxins spread and the effect of that [incision] is that they do not get into the blood stream.” Twenty-three days later Dr. Shallow performed a second operation known as a “closure.” He said that the boy “had a gap in his leg . . . and in order to bring the tissue together you have to undermine the sound skin on that side and undermine the sound skin on the other side and sew them together.” This “shortens the convalescent period.” The boy was in the hospital about four weeks; a total of 750,000 units of anti-tetanus serum was administered to him. The boy’s mother expended over $1,500 for the medical attention and hospital care given him. The boy and his mother by proper proceedings brought suit for the damages sustained.</p>

Every punctured wound is to be incised to its depths and thoroughly cleaned and drained. In a very suspicious wound, such as a Fourth of July injury or a wound from a dung fork, or the entrance into the tissues of a splinter from a stable floor, after the removal of foreign objects a thorough antiseptic cleansing, give a sub-cutaneous injection of 1,500 U. S. A. units (9 cm. of horse serum) of tetanus antitoxin and repeat within ten days. It is certain that tetanus anti-toxin has prophylactic power. Prevention is not always assured. Many cases have been reported in which prophylactic injections fail to prevent the disease. When in spite of such injections the disease does arise, it is apt to be mitigated in violence.” Dr. Bigelow admitted that he did not incise this boy’s wound to its depth, though he knew that “implements that have been in contact with street dirt and dirt in general, are apt to be infected” and that “such a wound is a suspicious wound.” When asked how he justified his treatment in the face of the accepted teaching of Dr. Da Costa in this class of cases, he answered: “Because in the treatment of a wound it is a matter of personal judgment in the experience of that one, as to how you treat it.” He was asked this question: “So the wound when you finished treating <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>it was still a puncture wound rather than an incised wound?” and he answered: “Yes.”</p>

The court in banc allowed plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial, saying: “Among the reasons assigned in support of plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial are some directed at the comments and rulings of the trial judge. After a careful review of the entire record we are of opinion that perhaps some of the rulings and remarks may have been prejudicial to the plaintiffs, and principally for that reason grant the motion. . . . Both parties called a number of medical practitioners. On behalf of plaintiffs all their witnesses agreed that the correct method of treatment of a wound of the type described was that adopted and followed by Dr. Shallow after the symptoms of tetanus developed. Those medical witnesses called on behalf of defendant, on the other hand, agreed that the proper method of treatment was that employed and followed by defendant. . . . Plaintiffs’ contention appears to be that there was negligence in the selection or determination of the method to be pursued. This we regard as a close question and defendant’s position seems to be supported by the language used in <em>Remley v. Plummer, </em>79 Pa. Superior Court 117, wherein it was said, among other things: ‘Thus practitioners of a reputable school of medicine are not to be harassed by litigation and mulcted in damages because the course of treatment prescribed by that school differs from that adopted by another school: <em>Force v.

W. 1114</a>; 21 R. C. L. 383; 5 Thompson on Negligence, Section 6715. As was said in <em>Patten v. Wiggin, </em>supra, “The jury are not to judge by determining which school, in their judgment, is the best.’ ‘If the treatment is in accordance with a recognized system of surgery, it is not for the court or jury to undertake to determine whether .that system is best, nor to decide questions of surgical science on which surgeons differ among themselves”: 30 Cyc. 1588, section 8. . . .’ If the testimony offered from the plaintiffs’ medical experts had shown a division of opinion (or different schools of .thought) regarding the method to be pursued in the treatment of the wound described, we would unhesitatingly reach the conclusion suggested in <em>Remley v. Plummer, </em>supra, and <em>Patten v. Wiggin, </em>supra, i. e.; ‘The jury are not to judge by determining which school, in their judgment, is the best.’ In this case, however, all of plaintiffs’ medical experts agreed that the method pursued by defendant was not in accord with the proper treatment of the wound. The contrary opinion was asserted by all the medical experts who testified for defendant. These witnesses, in our judgment, were as reputable and as abreast of the progress in the science of medicine as those for the plaintiffs. We think, therefore, that since the experts on one side are in conflict or disagreement with the experts on the other side the case presents an issue of fact for submission to a jury. . . . We conclude, however, that this question is so close that plaintiffs should not be deprived of the right to recover unless and until an appellate court has said that a physician is liable, notwithstanding that in his judgment and the judgment of a number of physicians called on his behalf one course of treatment is proper, Avhereas on behalf of the plaintiffs a number of physicians are of the opinion that a different method should haAre been employed, without showing more than that they differed from one school of thought as to the prop<a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>er method to he pursued in the treatment of a certain type of injury.”</p>

Defendant’s witnesses, however, say that this wound was <em>not </em>a puncture wound. This raised a factual question for the jury. The defendant himself referred to the boy’s wound as a “large puncture wound” and described it as “about five inches long.” Defendant’s witness, Dr. Arthur P. Keegan testified: “That is a big lacerated wound. . . . I disagree that the wound you [plaintiffs’ counsel] describe is a puncture, because he has a big opening, he can put a pledget of cotton in it, it is not made by a needle point or a sword point.” Another witness for the defendant, Dr. W. O. Livingstone was asked these questions and made the following answers: “This is <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>what you would call a puncture wound, is it not, what the child had? A. Not strictly a puncture wound, no. Q. Why is it not strictly a puncture wound? A. Because it had a large external opening. . . . Q. Referring to this definition of a punctured wound, and also bearing in mind what the minor plaintiff in this case had, can you now tell me whether you agree with Dr. Da Costa’s statement on page 143 that every punctured wound is to be incised to its depths and thoroughly cleaned and drained? A. I believe this wound was not what Dr. DaCosta refers to as a puncture wound. Q. In what respect does it differ? A. A puncture wound is one that goes deeply into the tissues with a tendency for the wound to heal up on the surface and leave certain raw places down deep in the tissue where a germ that cannot live on air can multiply and, conceivably, produce tetanus.” Another witness for the defendant, Dr. E. L. Keyte, a police surgeon, testified: “Q. What is the type of wound which existed in this case? How would you define it? A. I cannot agree that it is a punctured wound, it is more of a tunneling wound, where something tunnels in the subcutaneous area between the shin and the more important elements beneath.” On cross-examination, the following questions were asked of this witness and the following answers given by him: “Q. When a person’s life depends upon your skill and care, don’t you feel you are doing the safe thing when you give it [anti-tetanus serum] to a fireman who has stepped on a rusty nail? A. We give it in a puncture wound, that is right. Q. A puncture wound is one in which air is not apt to get, isn’t that true, sir? A. That is correct, I believe, air can’t get to all parts of the damaged tissue. Q. You say Dr. Owen is one you have talked to on the subject of the treatment of wounds, and one of those from whose practice you form an opinion as to what the average practitioner of ordinary ability does? A. Right. . . . Q. Now I show you a copy of a paper called, ‘Treat<a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>ment of Tetanus’ by Hubley R. Owen and J. Wesley Tomlinson, M. D., in which it is set forth, ‘The question of which cases should receive tetanus antitoxin often arises. Of course all punctured wounds, gunshot wounds, devitalized wounds, deep lacerations, compound fractures and extensive burns should receive it. In the borderline cases it is a safe rule to follow that when in doubt, always administer antitoxin.’ Would you agree with Dr. Owen’s statement to that effect, when in doubt administer it? A. In police work I would. I believe anybody would do it when they are in doubt.” Another witness for defendant, Dr. R. S. Davis, made the following answers to the following questions: “Q. Dr. Davis, Mr. Ferguson just asked you about puncture wounds; can you describe this as a punctured wound? A. Absolutely not. Q. What kind of wound would you call this? A. According to the testimony which I heard, this was a wound which only penetrated the skin, with a wide opening, like a blister, a traumatic blister, it simply was an elevation of the skin from the muscular tissue. Q. Is that in your opinion the kind of puncture wound the textbooks and the literature talked about when they referred to puncture wounds? A. Not at all.” Dr. John W. Klopp testified for defendant that the boy’s wound was not a puncture wound because “this wound had a large mouth, according to your description [i. e., the description of defendant’s counsel in his hypothetical question] which provided for adequate exposure to the air and an adequate means of putting in and taking out a drain and swabbing it with antiseptic solutions.” On cross-examination, he admitted that “any wound, no matter how made, might possibly be infected with the tetanus germ.” He also said on cross-examination that he agreed with this statement from Ashurst’s textbook: “Punctured wounds, as the term indicates, are those produced by pointed instruments, and their importance arises from the fact <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>that infection (not rarely tetanus) is frequent, as no free drainage exists.”</p>

Defendant’s own testimony on cross-examination, standing alone, would support the contention that it was a puncture wound, for he admitted it so. to be. Likewise, the description of the wound would support an inference that it was a puncture wound, as the physicians called on behalf of plaintiffs testified it was.

In entering judgment for defendant, Judge <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>Keller well said: “The question actually passed upon by the jury was not whether the defendants, in their handling of the case, had been guilty of negligence in not following a well-recognized and established mode of treatment, but rather, which of two methods, both having their respective advocates and followers of respectable authority, was the safer and better from a surgical standpoint.” In other words, a physician has a right to choose between two professionally recognized methods of treatment of an injury or a malady. Because unfortunate results follow the use of one of two or more of such methods, it does not make out a prima facie case of malpractice against the physician or surgeon who made the choice. Judge Keller said further in the Plummer Case: “If there is a reasonably general agreement as to what is the proper medical treatment for a disease or the proper surgical treatment for an injury and there is a dispute as to whether the physician or surgeon in charge of the case used the method or means thus generally prescribed, a question of fact is presented which is for a jury to determine. Or if the symptoms of a disease or the effects of an injury are so well known that a reasonably competent and skillful physician or surgeon ought to be able to diagnose the disease or injury, his negligence in failing to do so is likewise a matter of fact on which a jury of laymen may pass judgment.” An examination of the testimony in the Plummer Case shows that there were three surgeons called by the plaintiff, that the testimony of one of them (whose qualifications to testify as an expert were doubtful) amounted to not much more than a “guess,” it being a personal opinion not based on any recognized standard; that the testimony of another physician was that a local anesthetic should have been used, instead of a general anesthetic (a mere choice between two established methods) ; and that the testimony of another surgeon was an expression of his opinion that it was “not good surgery to administer an <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>anesthetic without first fortifying the patient by the use of a heart stimulant.” This testimony obviously fell short of making out a prima facie case of malpractice.

If it was <em>not </em>a punctured wound, there was a difference of professional opinion as to whether or not the treatment administered by the defendant was proper. This fundamental issue the trial judge did not make clear to the jury. In plaintiff’s petition for a new trial it was correctly said: “The court gave the jury no light whatever in respect to the extremely simply scientific facts at issue, which were (1) whether or not the minor plaintiff had had a puncture wound; and (2) whether defendant had treated it as a physician of average ability would have done; contenting himself only with telling the jury, in substance and effect, that if they believed the witnesses for one side they should find for that side, etc.” This court has declared that “it is a primary duty of the trial judge —a duty that must never be ignored—in charging a jury to clarify the issues so that the jury may comprehend the issues they are to decide.” We have decided that “a trial judge’s charges which are inadequate or . not clear, or which tend to mislead are well recognized grounds for réversal”: <em>Sears v.

The case.is turned upon the narrow question whether the wound was in reality a' puncture w.Ound, Whether or not it was, is -a matter not for laymen to -decide, but for physicians. Herd competent physicians, in number exceeding those called by plaintiffs, said, in their judgment, it was not a puncture wound. The-term “puncture wound” is á technical scientific. terifi, and means something entirely different to the physician from- what it might mean to the, layman. As physicians use the term, it means a wound with a small opening, in comparison with its depth, which is liable to close and thus , prevent the entry of air into the wound. The. bacillus of tetanus cannot live in the presence of air and the closing of the orifice of the wound, and the consequent shutting off of air, leads to the multiplication of the tetanus bacilli if present. -Here the wound, which was underneath the skin and parallel with the surface of -the skin, and did not penetrate the deeper tissues, had an-opening half:an inch wide, which enabled the appellant to probe to the bottom and to apply medication, and, by the insertion of gauze, to keep it open to the air. This being the con<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>dition, the nine physicians called by him, said it was not a puncture wound, and therefore did not require to be opened up or demand the use of anti-tetanus serum. When the defendant said, as noted in the majority opinion, that it was a punctured wound, he meant one caused by a puncture, not by a cut or incision. His explanation shows that he did not mean it was a puncture wound in the surgical sense. I can see no distinction between this case and any other in which competent physicians differ as to conditions present in the patient, and when they do, and when the physician charged with malpractice has, as this defendant has, reputable surgical opinion supporting what he did, he should not be held liable, in my judgment.</p>

In other words, in the face of conflicting reliable expert evidence as to what was the proper course to be pursued by the surgeon in charge of the case, twelve laymen, with no knowledge of medicine and surgery wei*e called upon to decide a disputed scientific medical and surgicál question upon which eleven physicians and surgeons of standing and experience could not agree, and as to which there is a wide divergence of competent authority, and were permitted to mulct the defendants in damages for following a course of conduct which by far the greater number of expert witnesses testifying said was in accordance with that indicated by the best modern surgical practice. . . . where competent medical authority is divided, a <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>physician will not be held responsible if in the exercise of his judgment he followed the course of treatment advocated by a considerable number of his professional brethern in good standing in his community. ...

Both sides gave medical evidence, plaintiffs’ witnesses testifying that defendant should have treated the wound by a different method than was adopted, while defendant’s witnesses testified that the treatment applied was prop<a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>er.
