This interpretation is borne out by the ninth, tenth and eleventh items of the second codicil which show that in his gifts of life interest, testator had in mind persons he knew and whom he expected to be alive at the time of his death. These latter three items support the argument that the time of vesting could be only after the death of the survivor of the beneficiaries of the said ninth and tenth items and the grandchildren of the testator living at his death, because the life benefits of the said ninth and tenth items are imposed on the stock trust by the said eleventh item.” The eighth item of the codicil creates yearly annuities, payable out of the stock trust, of $20,000 for each of his grandchildren, Eodman Arturo Heeren, John Eodman Wanamaker, Fernanda Wanamaker, Gurnee Munn and Fernanda Munn. The beneficiary of the ninth item is Eodman Wanamaker, 2nd, a nephew, who was given an annuity of $20,000 per year, and of the tenth item is Mary Brown Warburton, a sister of decedent, who is given an annuity of $100,000 per year. The eleventh item contains spendthrift trust provisions covering all the annuitants.</p>

Munn, John Wanamaker, Jr., Marie Louise Munn and such grandchildren of testator as may have been living at the time of his death, and that, therefore, the trust does not violate the rule against perpetuities. We are unable to agree with this conclusion so far as the remainders are concerned. We conclude that the confused language used by the testator defers the vesting of the remainder interests until twenty-one years after the date of the death of the last survivor of his grandchildren as a class, irrespective of whether or not the grandchildren were living at his death. The language used does not limit the life estates to grandchildren living at the death of the testator, but to grandchildren generally.

In considering this subject in <em>Quigley’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/329/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="329 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="1181434" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0281-01">329 Pa. 281</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%2085" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="198 A. 85">198 A. 85</a>, speaking through Mr. Justice Stern, who recited the appellant’s contention that the whole trust failed because of certain void remainders, we said (p. 289) : “The general doctrine is definitely opposed to this position. Ordinarily the validity of prior limitations is not affected or disturbed by reason of ultimate ones which transgress the rule against perpetuities. There is a well nigh continuous current of authorities in Pennsylvania establishing this principle.” What was observed in a footnote in that case strikingly embodies the thought which rises and should be given effect where the question of the maintenance of valid provisions of a trust is to be decided: “It was said, somewhat picturesquely, in <em>Landram v. Jordan, </em><a href="/us/203/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="203 U.S. 56" data-case-ids="8290327" data-case-paths="/us/203/0056-01">203 U.

Under such circumstances, a void limitation is viewed as merely incidental ; it may fall, but it cannot alter or destroy a precedent life estate.” In the Restatement of the Law of Trusts, See. 65, it is set forth: “Consequences of illegality. If a provision in the terms of the trust is illegal, the intended trust fails altogether if, <em>but only if, </em>the illegal provision cannot be separated from the other provisions without defeating the purpose of the settlor in creating the trust.”' (Italics supplied.) In the Comments, appears (p. 204): “(b) Remoteness. An intended trust fails altogether if there is no beneficiary who is definitely ascertainable within the period of the rule against perpetuities. If an intended trust is created for several beneficiaries, and the interest of one or more of them will not necessarily vest within the period of the rule against perpetuities, the trust fails so far as that interest is concerned. Whether the intended trust fails altogether depends upon whether the provision which failed can be separated from the other provisions without defeating the purpose of the settlor in creating the trust.”</p>

He provides in the second codicil for annuities to be paid out of income of the trust to his nephew, his sister and his living grandchildren. He further provides that as his children die, one-half of the income which they have been enjoying shall be accumulated for charity, until a fund of $2,000,000 is raised, which he directs shall be used to found a school in memory of his father, John Wanamaker, devoted to the training of artisans, and directs that the other half shall be paid to his grandchildren. All of these provisions are valid.

As the life estates to the grandchildren must vest within the period, since they must start on the death of a life in being when Rodman Wanamaker died, to wit, the lives of his children, these life estates are good, even though they may extend beyond the period prohibited by the statute, since the prohibition is against postponing the vesting of estates, and as the life estates vest within the period, they are good, even though the remainders over upon the deaths of the grandchildren are void as violating the rule: <em>Price’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/260/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="260 Pa. 376" data-case-ids="1040240" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0376-01">260 Pa. 376</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.%20893" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="103 A. 893">103 A. 893</a>; <em>Friday’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/313/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="313 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1152626" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0328-01">313 Pa. 328</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.%20123" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="170 A. 123">170 A. 123</a>; <em>Lippincott’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/333/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="333 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1187930" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0048-01">333 Pa. 48</a>, 3 A.

On the contrary, we are of opinion that the testator was endeavoring to meet the perpetuities rule, but failed to do so. It is manifest from the will that the testator’s dominant purpose was the protection of his children, the annuitants and grandchildren whom he knew. Furthermore, his primary charitable gift would fail if the whole trust were stricken down.</p>

This agreement is dated June 11, 1928, three months after the death of Rodman Wanamaker. It recites the paragraphs of the will and codicil relating to the trust in question. Annexed to the agreement are full copies of the will and codicils. It is set forth that there is some doubt as to when the trusts created by the will terminate, “it being alleged that the provisions of the will and codicils violate the rule against perpetuities.” It is recited that in consideration of the execution of the agreement by the other children, each child of Rodman Wanamaker, <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>naming the three, agrees that the period, for distribution of the principal of the trust of the capital stock of John Wanamaker Philadelphia, shall be twenty-one years after the death of the last survivor of Mary Brown Warburton, Rodman Wanamaker, 2nd, Fernanda W. Munn, John Wanamaker, Jr., Marie Louise Munn and such grandchildren of Rodman Wanamaker as may have been living at the time of his death, at which time the principal of the trust shall be distributed to and among the descendants of Rodman Wanamaker then living, in equal shares per stirpes. The three children expressly ratified and confirmed the will and codicils “as hereby agreed to be construed and interpreted” and conveyed and assigned to the trustees designated in the will all of their right, title and interest in the capital stock of John Wanamaker Philadelphia, in trust for the same uses, and with the same powers and the same limitations and remainders, as are set forth in the will, except as to the period of final distribution. The agreement then goes on to provide, “Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, it is understood and agreed by Fernanda W. Munn, John Wanamaker, Jr., and Marie Louise Munn, that should any of the provisions of the will and codicils of Rodman Wanamaker be void or declared to be void under the laws of any State of the United States, in whole or in part, or as to any specific part of such estate, this agreement and the trust hereby created, shall nevertheless, be valid. This agreement shall be construed as an indenture of trust inter vivos under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania where this instrument is to be performed.” At the time of executing this agreement, all of the children were of full age, John Wanamaker, Jr., being thirty-eight years old.</p>

This later agreement was approved by the Orphans’ Court, and the court in its adjudication of the account of the trustees when filed, awarded the stock of John Wanamaker Philadelphia to the trustees. John Wanamaker, Jr., made no claim at the audit that he was entitled to one-third of the stock and took no exception to the adjudication awarding it to the trustees. Counsel then representing him specifically approved the award by signing the schedule of distribution. On May 25, 1934, John Wanamaker, Jr., having become dissatisfied with the management of the Wanamaker Stores, brought suit against the trustees in New York. He swore to the bill of complaint which was brought against the trustees “individually and as trustees under agreement dated June 11, 1928.” It is specifically recited in this proceeding that the trustees are sued as trustees of a trust inter vivos under the 1928 agreement. This suit was compromised and settled under an arrangement which provided, among other things, that John Wanamaker, Jr., would not file any objection to the account of the trustees out of which this proceeding grows. Shortly after this litigation was settled, John Wanamaker, Jr., died November 29, 1934.</p>

In fact, by the agreement of 1931 and by the position which he took in the New York litigation, he expressly ratified it. If he were living, he would not be heard to nullify it. Those claiming through him have no standing to set it aside and are bound by it. If it were to be set aside, his second wife would receive one-third of the corpus of the trust, as she is the sole beneficiary under his will, and his two <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>children would receive nothing. .We think it is a fair inference that he did not provide for them in his will because he knew they were provided for under the will of his father, as confirmed by his agreement.</p>
