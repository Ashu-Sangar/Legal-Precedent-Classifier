The action is in trespass for personal injuries and the circumstances out of which it grows somewhat unique. The injur/ to plaintiff was inflicted more than nine years ago, on December 19, 1929. Suit was not brought until a few days before the statute of limitations had run.</p>

It sold one of them to Daniel Yollmer, a florist. The sale was made by an agent of defendant. Yollmer purchased it for the purpose of defending himself and his property against persons who might attempt to rob him, upon the representation made by the agent that the tear gas would not permanently injure or harm the human body, but, on the contrary, would produce burning sensations or irritations of a harmless character, enduring not more than twenty-four hours. On the side of the instrument there was an attachment resembling a clasp, which was in reality a trigger, controlling the discharge of a cartridge, thereby inducing the emission of the tear gas. Plaintiff, while lawfully in the shop of Yollmer, upon a business mission, believing the contrivance which was exposed <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>in the store was a fountain pen, was examining or inspecting it and was injured thereby. The negligence charged against defendant was: (a) In manufacturing and selling a preparation intended, to be discharged upon the human body, which it knew or should have known would permanently and grievously injure the tissues of the body, particularly the face, eyes and lungs; (b) in representing as harmless an article through the intended use of which it knew or should have known permanent injury might result to innocent persons; (c) in manufacturing and selling in the guise of a harmless fountain pen, intending it to be mistaken as such, an article dangerous and harmful; (d) in placing at the disposal of innocent third persons an article which looked harmless but which it knew would inflict great injury; (e) in failing to equip it with proper safety appliances; (f) in manufacturing and selling a preparation capable of inflicting great harm concealed in a contrivance resembling a fountain pen, calculated from appearance to invite inspection under a belief that it was harmless; (g) in manufacturing and selling a contrivance which it knew would be placed within the reach of innocent persons whose inspection thereof would be invited by its appearance and who might be seriously injured thereby; (h) in rendering it possible for an innocent person such as plaintiff to suffer serious injuries in a manner that might reasonably have been anticipated; (i) in failing to label a dangerous instrumentality as such or to give notice of its dangerous character when it knew that the instrumentality was likely to be exposed to examination and inspection by the public; (j) in failing to notify the purchaser of its dangerous characteristics; (k) in failing to warn or notify the purchaser that the gas gun might be discharged inadvertently if allowed to remain where innocent persons would have access thereto, when it knew or should have known that the gun was likely to be exposed to inspection by innocent persons.</p>

Plaintiff’s counsel evidently recognizes this as one of the weaknesses in their case, because in their brief they say: “As Vollmer had been advised that the weapon was not dangerous to life or limb he placed it where it was intended to be placed, and where alone it would best serve its purpose—on his counter beside his cash register.” There is no allegation in the statement as to where the gun was placed by Yollmer. Not a word about its being placed “on his counter beside his cash register.” The brief goes on to state: “While the latter [Yollmer] was busy with another customer plaintiff was attracted to the unusual looking fountain pen lying on the counter.” There is nothing of this kind set forth in the statement.</p>

The determination of the questions here presented must rest upon general principles. It is conceded that defendant may only be fixed in damages if the allegations of the statement of claim reveal some act of negligence on its part. The test of negligence is whether the wrongdoer could have anticipated and foreseen the likelihood of harm resulting from his act or omission: <em>Paulscak v. Hoebler, </em><a href="/pa/330/0184-02" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="330 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1182937,1182949" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0184-02,/pa/330/0184-01">330 Pa. 184</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%20646" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="198 A. 646">198 A. 646</a>; Restatement, Torts, Sec. 284. “Before an act can be held negligent it must reasonably be foreseen that the doing of it is attended with such probabilities of injury to another that a duty arises either to refrain from the act altogether, or to do it in such manner that harm does not result. It is well settled that conduct is negligent only if the harmful consequences thereof could reasonably have been foreseen and prevented. ... In <em>Venzel v. Valley Camp Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/304/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="304 Pa. 583" data-case-ids="1132392" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0583-01">304 Pa. 583</a>, we said (p. 590) : ‘Liability for negligence depends on antecedent probability, not the mere possibility, of harmful results therefrom.

Giving full effect to all the averments of the statement, it cannot be said that defendant’s representative who negotiated the sale could have foreseen that the sale of the gun under the circumstances alleged involved any probability of injury to Vollmer’s customers. When the gun was sold to Vollmer, he was fully informed of its nature and purpose. Defendant’s representatives would be justified in relying upon the supposition that Vollmer would keep this disguised weapon for his own purpose and out of the hands of other per<a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>sons. They cannot be charged with knowledge that he would permit the gun to remain in such a position in the store as to constitute an attraction to others. If Yollmer saw fit to allow the weapon to remain in his store accessible to prying customers and harm resulted, the fault lies with him and not defendant.</p>

Obviously it had reference to the effect of the tear gas if discharged from the gun in the normal way. The agent could not have intended these representations to be applicable if the gas was discharged by an individual directly into his own face.</p>

It seems quite clear that defendant’s negligence was the substantial factor in causing the harm. The defendant cannot escape liability because of intervening human actions which were easily foreseeable as the normal responses to defendant’s negligent act: <em>Shaffer v.

It is certainly foreseeable that if the manufacturer does not warn the purchaser of the damage it is capable of doing, the purchaser will not take necessary precautions to prevent others from handling it. Obviously, the principal value of a tear gas gun disguised as a fountain pen lies in the fact that it may be placed where one would ordinarily place a fountain pen, within easy reach, so that its use may be resorted to without attracting suspicion. Under the circumstances it was not at all unusual that plaintiff, a normally inquisitive person, should pick up the pen to examine it and be seriously injured.</p>

The doors were well beyond the plaintiff’s line of travel, but he seized hold of them to save himself as he slipped on the ice. We quite properly held that the defendant was not bound to anticipate the sequence of events leading up to that injury. In <em>Paulscak v.

In affirming a verdict for the plaintiff in the Paulscak case, supra, this court said (p. 192) : “The question whether a person charged with negligence or negligent acts or omissions should have foreseen the injuries resulting from these acts or omissions is for the jury, if there is any credible evidence from which a reasonable conclusion can be drawn in support of the claim of neglect of duty.” Yet, the majority cite this case to support a decision, which deprives plaintiff of the opportunity to produce credible evidence in support of his allegations of defendant’s negligence, and of having the jury pass upon the question of foreseeability.</p>

In my judgment, averments as to the exact circumstances under which plaintiff handled the pen, and the different effect, if any, which the tear gas would produce when discharged at a very close range as distinguished from what the majority term a discharge “in the normal way” are properly evidential facts for the jury and are not required to be set forth with meticulous detail in the statement of claim. By section 5 of our Practice Act <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483, it is provided: “Every pleading shall contain, and contain only, a statement in a <em>concise and summary form </em>of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim, . . . <em>but not the evidence by which they are to be proved, </em>or inferences, or conclusions of law . . ..” (Italics added.) The Act requires that only the ultimate material operative facts constituting the plaintiff’s cause of action be alleged. Evidential facts should not be pleaded: <em>Davis v.
