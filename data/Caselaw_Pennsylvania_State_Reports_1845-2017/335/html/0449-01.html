Grant, now Bigelow Boulevard, was constructed in 1898 on the face of a steep hill at the base of which appellee’s tracks were located, approximately 250 feet perpendicularly below, and 450 feet surface-measurement from, the boulevard. A large ravine, known as Jones Hollow, occupied the intervening space, and the boulevard passed over it. This was done partly by cutting into the side of the hill and partly by a fill. In the original filling operations in 1898 and 1899, earth and stone slipped downward from the boulevard, spreading over properties in the Hollow. Further filling was enjoined until the land in the Hollow was purchased by the City, and a large retaining wall of masonry, 60 feet high, 15 to 22% feet thick, and 140 feet long, was erected south of appellee’s property to withhold any movement of the fill. Between it and the boulevard a timber.crib was built across the Hollow, and French drains were constructed by appellant near the base of the hill to take off percolating and subterranean water.</p>

Pilings were placed on Jones Avenue in 1905, but another slip occurred in that vicinity the following year. In 1919 an ordinance of the City Council authorized the widening and improvement of Bigelow Boulevard in this location. Two contracts were awarded and the work started in 1920. In the course of it, 20,000 additional cubic yards of earth were deposited on the fill in the Hollow west of Jones Avenue and the Boulevard, and 13,300 cubic yards east of that intersection., A terracotta sewer pipe located under Jones Avenue, broke, saturating the filled ground. On September 22, 1920, large cracks appeared on the surface of Jones Avenue and a portion of that street subsided. Appellant’s engineers Avere notified, and emergency operations to divert the sewage were begun. On September 28th, the entire <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>fill in Jones Hollow was discovered to be in' motion, and cracks appeared in" tbe masonry retaining wall. Notwithstanding tbe notice given appellant of tbe movement-of tbe fill, the contractors continued dumping in tbe Hollow, pursuant to their contracts. Large quantities of.earth slid over and around tbe retaining wall, wbicb bad been forced outward, onto tbe tracks and yards of appellee. Appellee’s “Car Wash Building,” was in the direct path of the slide and was demolished. Tbe slide continued, until tbe earth at its head bad reached a height of approximately 55 feet on appellee’s property, covering two main passenger tracks, and several tracks in tbe yards' - Traffic was diverted by appellee and emergency crews were rushed to the' scene. Steam Shovels, cranes, ditching machines, a derrick, and hundreds of trains were used to remove this great accumulation of 178,860 cubic yards of earth. Tbe main tracks were opened December 5th. Tbe slide temporarily stopped, but resumed motion on June 27, 1921, and again tbe property of appellee was covered by approximately 35,000 cubic yards of earth, tbe removal of wbicb occupied appellee’s emergency forces until August.</p>

When it was called, appellant requested a continuance, to wbicb appellee agreed. It was again listed in November, 1924. Tbe parties discussed: settlement in 1925, but reached no agreement. In November of that year, tbe case was again called, and again placed on tbe deferred list at appellant’s request, with tbe stipulation that it be put down for trial “later at some convenient time.” On October 14, 1926, appellant filed its affidavit of defense with a counterclaim. Appellee promptly filed á demurrer to tbe counterclaim wbicb was sustained. Nothing further was done until April 12, 1935, when tbe case was placed upon the trial list by-appellee. During this interval there had been <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>some negotiations between the parties regarding this case and other matters of litigation, but no attempts at settlement were made.</p>

On May 4, 1936, the case was discussed with William B. Secrist, newly appointed city solicitor, who asked time to familiarize himself with the facts. On June 22nd, he executed a stipulation for trial during the week of November 2, 1936. City Solicitor Secrist died in August. The new city solicitor, Gregory Zatkovich, appointed September 4, 1936, entered into a stipulation for an extension to January 18, 1937. On November 6, 1936, his successor filed a petition and rule for judgment of non pros. This was dismissed by the court en banc on December 27, 1937. An appeal to the Supreme Court was quashed on January 12, 1938. In February appellant petitioned the court below for reargument, which was refused.</p>

Although additional damages in the form of detention money for the delay were asked by appellee, the jury specifically excluded this item from the verdict. Appellant moved for judgment n. o. v. and a new trial. From the refusal of these motions this appeal was taken.</p>

It is urged that the delay of more than eight years from the action on the counterclaim to the listing of the case for trial on April 12, 1935, and the subsequent delay of approximately three years before the case was heard, constitute laches on the part of appellee.

Appellant contends that these stipulations do not operate <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>as a waiver because City Solicitor Secrist was deliberately misinformed by appellee as to the cause of delay, and because he and City Solicitor Zatkovich lacked authority to surrender appellant’s fight to a non pros. Even if misrepresentations were made to City Solici: tor Secrist, there is no evidence that the stipulation was executed in reliance upon them. It is clear that the city solicitor had at his disposal all the necessary records to inform himself of the actual situation. ' The stipulation was not executed until more than a month after the conference with counsel for appellee.

Appellant assumes, from the failure to use the word “negligence” in the description of the dumping operations, that appellee’s claim is in trespass quare clausum fregit, and is a separate and distinct cause of action from trespass on the case for negligent injury to land. This is an unwarranted assumption. Under the Act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 271, Section 2, and the Practice Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483, Section 1, there is only one action of trespass, embracing all of the former proceedings ex delicto at common law.</p>

The operations were admittedly of such a nature that in their ordinary course no injury would have occurred in the absence of negligence. The slope of the hillside was at a ratio well within the angle of repose for dry earth, which, it was testified, is one-and-a-half to one.

The break in the sewer occurred during the course of the filling operations. The city was bound to know of its presence under the filled surface. The testimony as to the break was part of the details of the manner in which the dumping was done, and there was evidence from which the jury might have inferred that the break was caused by the dumping of earth directly above it. Regardless of the cause of the break, its location and contribution to the hazards of the operation, made it one of the conditions existing at the time the acts complained of were being performed, and cannot be separated from the general description of the filling operations. Unquestionably it was a contributing cause of the slide, and the conduct of appellant with reference to it must be considered part of the operation of widening Grant Boulevard.
