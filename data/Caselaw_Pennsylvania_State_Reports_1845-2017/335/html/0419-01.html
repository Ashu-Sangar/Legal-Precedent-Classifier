They involve three proceedings in equity to foreclose three first mortgages, each indenture being given to secure an issue of first mortgage bonds. The actions are entirely independent, but the questions raised in each case are substantially the same. The mortgages were secured respectively upon three parcels of real estate in the city of Philadelphia, known as the Aquila Apartments, the Wynnefield Apartments, and the Oak Lane Towers Apartments. The foreclosures proceeded to sales of the properties, which were purchased in each case by a committee representing bondholders who had deposited their bonds under a plan of reorganization. The foreclosure decrees provided that deposited bonds might be accepted on account of the purchase price of the mortgaged premises. The sales were duly confirmed by the court below, subject to the determination of the question in each proceeding whether all the bonds of a particular issue are upon a parity, so that the holders thereof are entitled to participate and to share pro rata in the fund before the court for distribution. The question so reserved is the fundamental issue of each case.</p>

The reason assigned is that these pledgees were charged with notice of default in payment of the bonds at their maturity, and with knowledge that bonds belonging to the guarantor-pledgor then became subordinated if the mortgage security proved to be insufficient. This subordinated status, it is contended, Avas not changed by the subsequent pledge of the bonds, but was retained Avhen they passed into the hands of the pledgees.</p>

As we have seen, it is based upon equitable considerations which deny to an insolvent assignor, liable over to assignees secured by the same fund, ■ the right to share equally with them in its distribution, in respect to any retained or repurchased interest in the obligation. Here the pledgees are not within the scope of the exception to the rule, as obviously they have no liability over to the purchasers of the bonds, which would give rise to special equities in favor of the latter. Therefore unless there is some equitable ground which justifies a departure from the general, rule, the principle of pro rata distribution must be applied. We can see no reason why the pledge of bonds for value after their maturity creates an equity in favor of bonds purchased prior to maturity, that requires the subordination of the pledged bonds.</p>

They cannot be said to have had knowledge that the bonds would not ultimately be paid by the mortgagor, or that the Philadelphia Company would default upon its contracts of guarantee at the expiration of the eighteen months’ grace period. They cannot be charged with knowledge that the proceeds of the foreclosures of the mortgaged properties would be insufficient to satisfy all the bonds secured thereby.</p>
