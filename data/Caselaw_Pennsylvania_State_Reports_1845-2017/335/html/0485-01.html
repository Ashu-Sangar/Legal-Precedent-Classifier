Number 242 is an appeal from the refusal of a preliminary injunction to restrain holding the annual meeting of the shareholders of defendant corporation on the day specified for that purpose in the by-laws. In his bill, filed March 24, 1939, appellant averred that he owned 3,589, out <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>of the total of 14,720, shares of preferred stock of Philadelphia Record Company, a Pennsylvania Corporation, and 46, out of a total of 81,414, shares of common stock; that he had been elected a director on the 20th of January, 1939, and on February 7, 1939, had filed a petition for a writ of peremptory mandamus to obtain inspection of its books and records; that defendant filed a return to which he had demurred; and that, on March 9, 1939, the peremptory writ had been refused with leave to him to reply to the return within fifteen days. The bill averred that defendant’s by-laws provided that the annual meeting of the shareholders should be held on the last Monday of March of each year; in this year, March 27th. He averred that performance of his duties, as director, required that he inform himself of defendant’s financial condition and, for that purpose, he required access to its records within a reasonable time prior to the annual meeting. He asked that defendant be restrained from holding the meeting until after the mandamus proceeding was disposed of, and for other relief. The application for the preliminary injunction was heard on Saturday, March 25th, and the injunction was refused. The stockholders’ meeting was held on Monday, March 27th, and appellant was not reelected a director.</p>

Appellant had been elected by fhe board of directors to fill a vacancy on January 20, 1939.' He desired to inspect its books and records to be advised of the condition of defendant’s affairs; for the purpose of performing his duties as di<a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>rector.

Defendant averred that appellant was offered an examination by himself and by Lybrand Boss Bros. &amp; Montgomery, Price Waterhouse &amp; Co., Ernst &amp; Ernst and Haskins &amp; Sells, Avell-known public accountants, and “through his attorney, Robert T. McCracken, Esq., or through any competent, qualified, disinterested and generally recognized firm of public accountants.” In the return the averments of paragraph 6, quoted above, were denied and it was averred that proper credits had been made to the preferred stock sinking fund. The return also contains vague averments, apparently made for the purpose of challenging the good faith of appellant’s request for information. These averments were treated by the learned court below as properly pleaded facts that were admitted by the demurrer to the return; as we must quash the appeal, it is unnecessary to consider Avhether the averments should have been held sufficient for that purpose: cf. <em>Hodder v. George Hogg Co., </em><a href="/pa/223/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="223 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="960946" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0196-01">223 Pa. 196</a>, 198, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="72 A. 553">72 A. 553</a>.

He was entitled at any time to make such inspection of its records as he considered necessary to inform himself for the proper performance of his duty to the stockholders; the statute did not limit him, in the examination, as it limited the stockholder whose right is defined by section 308B (P.
