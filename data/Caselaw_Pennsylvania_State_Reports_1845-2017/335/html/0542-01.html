Transfer,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> in both instances in which it is used in the by-law, means a change of ownership : compare <em>Hill v.

For reasons deemed sufficient, when the by-law was adopted, it was considered wise, in the first instance, to limit the market for the shares; one obvious purpose may have been to prevent competitors from becoming shareholders. This restriction was accomplished by stating it at the beginning of the by-law, but the restriction was not absolute or unconditional; it was expressly limited by the exception, a part of the same sentence restricting sales or transfers. In addition, there was the implied limitation that if neither corporation, nor stockholders or employees would purchase, a sale might be made to anyone else, for, of course, the parties were not creating an unreasonable restraint on the right to sell. The exception was that a stockholder might transfer stock to an employee in recognition of his services and ability. The purpose of an exception<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> is to exclude from the operation of certain words what would otherwise be included in them: <em>Lauderbach-Zerby Co. v. Lewis, </em><a href="/pa/283/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="283 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="1090493" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0250-01">283 Pa. 250</a>, 254, <a href="/citations/?q=129%20A.%2083" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="129 A. 83">129 A. 83</a>; <em>Riefler &amp; Sons v.

It is immaterial that, in the sentence, the exception comes after the words dealing with the general subject. As the parties intended to state both the restriction and the exception to the restriction, one of the two statements had to precede the other. The by-law would have meant the same thing if the two separate parts of the whole had been transposed in position, and it had begun: “Except that stock may be transferred by any stockholder to an employe of the corporation in recognition of his services and ability ... no stock shall be sold or transferred by any stockholder to any person not already a stockholder until ...” etc., as provided. That is not only the plain meaning of the by-law but <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>it is. a meaning which was acted on by the corporation in the lifetime of the testator, with the participation of the appellants, as the evidence shows that he gave shares to each of the appellants: compare <em>Schutte v. B. &amp; L. Assn., </em><a href="/pa/146/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="146 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="827897" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0324-01">146 Pa. 324</a>, 327, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.%20336" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="23 A. 336">23 A. 336</a>.</p>

The phraseology of the by-law not only is not inconsistent with an interpretation which would permit such practice, but is consistent with it and the possibility of it may- very well have been in the minds of the parties responsible for the adoption of the by-law. As has been pointed out above, appellants, in their reply added words after “services” and “ability” to sustain their contention. The addition of those words restricts what was otherwise a perfectly clear meaning. The interpretation suggested by appellants must also be rejected as leading to- impossibility of application, which certainly was not intended, for if the transferring stockholder cannot select his transferee from those employed at the time he confers the right to reeéive the shares, who is to sit in review of the selection? Who is to say whether services and ability shall be recognized and what quantum shall require recognition? The by-law does not say “past services” or “services rendered”; it may be just as important for the corporation to recognize “services” to be rendered <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>and “ability” to be shown. It does not appear that any inquiry was held or that the transferor was not the sole judge when the shares of the stockholders, other than decedent, were transferred to them; the evidence indicates that Mr. Garvin alone determined the fact.</p>
    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[180,614,1159,1197]]]'>Appellants also contend that the provision<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> in paragraph 7 of the will authorizing public or private sale, in the contingency specified, is in “total disregard of the by-law or a complete forgetfulness of its existence.” But the by-law does not prohibit such sale after the opportunities specified in it have been accorded without success. The by-law was not intended to make sales impossible; sales generally may not be made “until an opportunity has first been given” etc. In any event, this record, as we understand it, does not now involve the construction of this part of paragraph 7; all decedent’s stock appears to have been oversubscribed by employes. We cannot now assume that if it ever becomes necessary to consider the point the Orphans’ Court will not reach a proper interpretation. Paragraph 7 of the will and section 2 of the by-law together control the disposition of testator’s stock; accordingly, the beneficiary must have two qualifications: 1, under the will, he must have been an employee at the time of testator’s death; 2, under the by-law, he must be an employe at the time when the schedule of distribution is in fact approved by the Orphans’ Court.</p>
