By agreement of the parties, however, seven separate elements composing the entire operation were valued in ascertaining the total. In the triennial assessment for 1937, appellant’s property was valued at $723,214, and January 15, 1937, was fixed as the day for appeal. On that day an informal bearing was held, as a result of which an official written notice was sent to appellant stating that the Board of Bevision bad revised and fixed the assessment at a total of $717,964, a reduction of $5,250.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the seven items separately valued in computing the total assessment were shown. An appeal was taken to the court of common pleas. the county moved to strike off this appeal because the valuation of the two items specifically complained of had not been objected to at the bearing before the Board. The court declined to quash the appeal, but at the trial limited the evidence to that relating to what took place at the bearing before the Board. County officers, who <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>served upon the Board, testified that appellant had complained only of the valuation placed upon the colliery improvements^ and that no appeal had been made concerning the valuation of the coal in place and the 3070 acres of coal lands. The court below dismissed the appeal on the ground that it was limited to these last two items, holding that appellant’s failure to raise objections to these items before the Board precluded their consideration by the court. This appeal followed.</p>
