Hoerner, a constable, for an unlawful distraint. The action resulted in a verdict for plaintiff for $6,500. While motions for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v. were pending, by agreement of counsel, the verdict was reduced to $5,750, the motions were withdrawn, and the court <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>entered judgment on the verdict as reduced. Thereafter, on petition of the- Trust Company, a rule was granted on plaintiff to show cause why the lien of the judgment should not be released from all real estate, title to which is in the name of the Trust Company, or its liquidating trustees, the basis of the application being that, before the verdict was rendered, the Trust Company went into liquidation, and conveyed, to liquidating trustees, all real estate it owned in its own right, and retained in its name only such as it held as trustee, the beneficial interest belonging to others. The hearing on this petition was held before a judge, specially presiding, who did not conduct the trial. He entered an order, discharging the rule, without prejudice to the right to move for an entry upon the record in conformity with the theory of the parties at the time of the entry of the judgment. It is important to note that, in his answer to the petition for the rule to show cause, plaintiff admitted thajt “prior to verdict and judgment, the plaintiff’s claim was a common or secondary claim against the trusteed assets of the Commonwealth Trust Company only.” His position now is that, through the alchemy of entering judgment on the verdict, he has secured a preferential lien, ahead of depositors, upon such of the trusteed assets as are real estate, and also upon real estate in the name of the Trust Company, notwithstanding it has no interest therein, but holds title for others.</p>

The hearing on this rule was held before the judge who had tried the case, who in his opinion says: “The judgment directed to be entered by this court in favor of the plain<a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>tiff, and in the agreed sum of $5,750.00, on May 31,1938, or more than three years after the closing of the Commonwealth Trust Company for the purposes of liquidation, was merely an adjudication of the claim of the plaintiff against the Trust Company in an action in trespass for damages growing out of an illegal distress proceeding for rent. It was a common claim against said company while in process of adjudication and did not become a preferred claim against any of the assets of the company, real or personal, which were, on the date of said adjudication, and now are, being liquidated —both trust and commercial department assets—merely because it was reduced to judgment, and it was never the intent of this court when, on May 31, 1938, it directed that judgment be entered on the verdict, that said judgment should become a lien on real estate in the process of liquidation pursuant to an Act of Assembly (the Act of May 4, 1933, P. L. 271, No. 95, as supplemented by the Act of May 26, 1937, P. L. 886), and thereby, not only, create a preference in favor of the judgment creditor, but also thereby delay, prevent and interfere with the legal and orderly liquidation of the real estate of the insolvent.” The court concluded that under the Act of May 26, 1937, P. L. 886, it had power and authority to amend, modify and restrict the verdict and judgment thereon, and added, “We conceive it to be our duty to give practical effect to what we intended when we directed the entry of the judgment in this case.”</p>

It is denied that the appellant, through his counsel made any agreement to that effect.” Even if appellant’s counsel did not make any agreement, if the court mistakenly thought they had and acted upon this mistake, it was justified in correcting it.</p>

The securing of a judgment on such a claim could not give it a higher status than it primarily had. The liquidating plan of the Trust Company provided for payment: first, of expenses incident to the liquidation; second, of the debts to the Eeconstruction Finance Corporation; third, of deposits; fourth, of claims of other creditors; fifth, balance, if any, to stockholders. This follows the order of distribution provided by the Banking Code of May 15, 1933, P. L. 565, as amended, 71 PS Secs. 733-1011. The assets of the company are being liquidated pursuant to the Act of May 4, 1933, P.

It has been repeatedly pointed out that the Act of 1901 has application only to one particular type of trust, that which arises by reason of a payment of the purchase money by one person and the taking of title in the name of another: <em>Rosa v.

    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[281,1805,1151,544]]]'>Appellant bases its claim that the verdict and judgment as originally entered binds all of the real estate of the Trust Company upon Section 1 of the Act of March 23, 1877, P. L. 34, 12 PS Sec. 861, which provides that when a verdict is rendered, the verdict shall be a lien upon the real estate situate within the county of the party against whom the verdict shall be rendered, the lien to remain unless the court grant a new trial or arrest the judgment. Here, the court has arrested the judgment by limiting its lien.</p>

      <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>There are other reasons than those argued why appellant’s position cannot be maintained. The real estate transferred to the liquidating trustees was transferred in accordance with the plan of reorganization for the purpose of liquidation and for the joint benefit of the depositors and creditors of the Trust Company. It had been transferred prior to the rendition of appellant’s verdict and of course prior to the entry of judgment thereon. There is no question that the real estate had been transferred in good faith. This being so, the judgment was not a. lien on the real estate so transferred. A judgment is not a lien against real es-state which'the judgment debtor had previously transferred in good faith: <em>Benson </em>&amp; <em>West v. </em>Maxwell, <a href="/pa/105/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="105 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="454295" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0274-01">105 Pa. 274</a>; <em>McCleery v.

J. 588. Appellant argues that the liquidating trustees are merely voluntary assignees for the benefit of creditors, and not purchasers for value, and that under such circumstances the judgment is a lien against the real estate transferred to them. Without assenting to the proposition that the liquidating trastees were merely voluntary assignees, it may be pointed out that, even if it were correct, the judgment would not bind the real estate transferred to them: <em>Hodenpuhl v.
