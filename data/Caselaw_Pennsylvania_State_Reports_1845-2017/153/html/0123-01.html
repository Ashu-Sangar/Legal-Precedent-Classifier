    <p id="b149-5" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[216,690,1165,604]]]'>In Long v.

Rapp, <a href="/pa/121/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="121 Pa. 593" data-case-ids="561255" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0593-01">121 Pa. 593</a>, in which the contractor covenanted “for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, that he will not suffer or permit to be filed .... any mechanic’s lien or liens against the said building for the period of six months after its completion.” The lien in this case, as in Long v. Caffrey, was filed by the contractor himself, and we held, as in that case, that he was debarred by his own covenant from filing the lien.</p>

This was an inevitable and logical conclusion from the doctrine laid down in the prior cases. As was held in Schroeder v. Galland, the only connection between the owner and the subcontractor, being through and by means of the contract between the owner and the principal contractor, the subcontractor is chargeable with notice of all its terms and stipulations, and is bound thereby. He cannot have the benefits of the builder’s contract without accepting its conditions. The only ground upon which the contractor can bind the building for either materials or labor is by virtue of the authority delegated to him by the owner, and where no such authority is delegated, but, on the contrary, is expressly withheld, and he covenants that no liens shall be filed against the building, he cannot file a lien himself nor can his subcontractors do so.</p>

Galland, was, that the subcontractor cannot file a lien where the contractor has expressly covenanted not to do so, or where such covenant appears by necessary implication from the contract itself. It is believed that the words, “ necessary implication ” have not been understood as we intended them to be, and that most of the confusion arising in this class of cases grows out of this misunderstanding. It is possible we have not been sufficiently explicit upon this point. Hence, we have had case after case, in which the contention has been, whether the peculiar language of the contract between the owner and the contractor amounts to a covenant not to lien a building. If I am right in this it is quite time that the law upon this subject should be defined so clearly that it cannot readily be misunderstood. It should be so plain that every mechanic and material man, though of limited education, can understand it at a glance, and not be compelled to submit its interpretation to a lawyer, with the risk of a decision against him in the court of last resort.</p>

Galland, the contract between the owner and the principal contractor stipulated that the building should be built, finished, and delivered over to the owner “ free of all liens and incumbrances or any claims whatever that might arise under any action of the party of the second part or his legal representatives under this contract.” It was further provided, as is usual in such contracts, that all wages of artisans and laborers and all persons furnishing materials to the contractor on account of the contract, shall be paid by the contractor. These are the essential features of the contract, and we held in that case that the stipulation against liens was not only obligatory upon the principal contractor, but also upon the subcontractors, and that they could not recover.</p>

On the contrary, there is a recognition of the right of subcontractors and material men to lien the building. The provision of the contract that before the contractor shall receive his last payment he shall furnish releases from all persons entitled to file liens, is a recognition of the right to file them.</p>

It will be noticed, however, that this provision is at least as strong as the one in Schroeder v. Galland, which was held sufficient to prevent the subcontractor from filing a lien.

It is not the contract that subjects the building to liens, but it is the law which renders it so liable, and the contract should have expressly prohibited the filing of any liens. This case stands upon the very border, and goes further in sustaining an implied covenant against filing liens than we are now prepared to go.</p>

The court below held that it was not essential that the stipulation referred to should be in writing, but it must be definite and explicit. This ruling was affirmed by this court. We could not say as a matter of law that the agreement between the owner and contractor must be in writing, although few prudent business men would be willing to trust to the uncertain testimony of witnesses for the details of such an important transaction.</p>
    <p id="b153-5" data-blocks='[["BL_153.5",153,[217,1653,1162,197]]]'>The learned judge below held, as has been already stated, that the case in hand was ruled by Dersheimer v. Maloney, <a href="/pa/143/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="143 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="978533" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0532-01">143 Pa. 532</a>. It remains to consider that case with Tebay v. Kirkpatrick, <a href="/pa/146/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="146 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="827884" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0120-01">146 Pa. 120</a>, which was ruled upon the former case.</p>
    <p id="b153-6" data-blocks='[["BL_153.6",153,[215,1857,1163,551]],["BL_154.1",154,[262,377,1168,340]]]'>The contract in the case in hand, so far as this question is concerned, is substantially the same as in Dersheimer v. Maloney, and was evidently prepared in accordance therewith. The controlling portions of the contract in that case, as we find from the report of it in 143 Pa., is as follows: “ Eighty-five per cent will be paid as the work progresses on labor and materials, in monthly payments, according to and upon the estimate of the architect. The proprietor reserves the right to pay bills, deducting fifteen per cent until completion: Provided, that in each case of payment a certificate shall be obtained from the architect; . . . and, provided further, that in each case a cer<a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>tificate shall be obtained by the contractor from the clerk of the office where liens are recorded, signed and sealed by the clerk, that he has carefully examined the records and finds no liens or claims recorded against said work; neither shall there be any legal or lawful claims against the contractor in any manner, from any source whatever, for work or materials furnished on said works.”</p>
    <p id="b154-4" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[260,734,1167,349]]]'>“ 7. The proprietor will not, in any manner be answerable or accountable for loss or damage that shall or may happen to said work or any part or parts thereof respectively, or for any of the materials or other things used and employed in finishing and completing said works; or for injury to any person or persons, either workmen or the public, or for damage to adjoining property.” . . .</p>
    <p id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.5",154,[257,1090,1170,848]]]'>This was held to be an implied covenant against the filing of liens. That it was a close case may be inferred from the language of this court, where it was said: “ While the language of the contract in that case (Schroeder v. Galland) differs from that employed in the agreement before us, we have no doubt the parties intended to provide against the filing of <em>liens; </em>and while they have not done so in express, terms, we think that by fair intendment the words used necessarily include both liens and personal liabilities. The owner is not to “ be answerable or accountable ... in any manner ” for any liabilities, etc. If this is not an implied covenant against filing liens, then the owner is “ answerable or accountable ” in at least one mode or manner; not liable in person, it is true, but in property, which is equally efficacious. Again, in the second clause, the inhibition is: “ neither shall there be any legal or lawful claim against the contractor in any manner, from any source whatever for work or materials. ”</p>
    <p id="b154-6" data-blocks='[["BL_154.6",154,[257,1955,1167,450]],["BL_155.1",155,[204,376,1160,84]]]'>While it may be true that the parties to this contract intended to provide against the filing of liens by subcontractors, the stronger light which has been thrown upon this question leads us to the conclusion that it is not as explicit as it might and ought to have been. Nor do we attach much importance to the words that there shall not be any legal or lawful claim against the contractor. It was not in the power of the owner or contractor, or of both of them, to prevent claims being brought against the contractor. It is the owner, or rather his <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>building, which is intended to be protected by this and similar covenants.</p>
    <p id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[201,480,1162,654]]]'>The other ground, upon which this decision was based, is, that the owner is not to “ be answerable or accountable . . . . in any manner ” for any of the materials, etc., is not free from criticism. An examination of that clause of the contract shows that it is at least capable of another interpretation, and that the owner was stipulating, not that he would not be accountable for materials furnished to the building, but, that he would not be responsible “ for loss or damage that shall or may happen to said work, or any part or parts thereof respectively, or for any of the materials or other things used and employed in finishing or completing said work; or for injury to any person or persons, either workmen or the public, or for damage to adjoining property.”</p>
    <p id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[199,1143,1161,348]]]'>We think this language may fairly be interpreted to be a covenant that the owner shall not be responsible for any loss occasioned by the injury or destruction of the building, or the materials composing it, during the erection and construction. And the further covenant, that the owner will not be responsible to any person or persons, either workmen or the public, or for damage to adjoining property strengthens this view.</p>
    <p id="b155-7" data-blocks='[["BL_155.6",155,[196,1499,1161,295]]]'>The essential portions of the contract in the case in hand are as follows: “ VI. The owner will not in any manner be answerable or accountable for any loss or damage that shall or may happen to the said works, or any part or parts thereof, respectively, or for any of the materials or other things used and employed in finishing and completing the said works.</p>
    <p id="b155-8" data-blocks='[["BL_155.7",155,[194,1802,1160,544]]]'>“ VII. The said parties of the second part agree to take, use, provide and make all proper, necessary and sufficient precautions, safeguards and protections against the occurrence or happening of any accidents, injuries, damages or hurt to any person or property during the progress of the entire work, and for all such accidents, injuries, damages or hurt the said parties of the second part alone to be responsible, and not the said party of the first part, or the architect; it being agreed that the work to be done shall be entirely under the control of the parties of the second part, except so far as provision is herein made for the instruction thereof of the architect.”</p>
    <p id="b155-9" data-blocks='[["BL_155.8",155,[238,2364,1113,44]],["BL_156.1",156,[302,383,1167,299]]]'>The two paragraphs above quoted must be read together. <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>Thus considered, it is a covenant that the owner will not be responsible for any “ loss or damage ” that shall or may happen to the said building or to the material or other things used and employed in erecting it, and that the contractor shall be responsible for all accidents, injuries, damages or hurt to any person or property during the progress of the entire work.</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[302,690,1166,448]]]'>That the contract in question is fairly subject to this construction is a sufficient reason why it should not be held to bar the right of the subcontractor to file a lien. An examination of this class of cases creates a feeling of surprise that if parties intended to covenant against the filing of liens, they should employ such ambiguous language, when three lines, clearly expressed, would remove all doubt upon this subject. It is sufficient to say that no lien shall be filed against the building by either the contractor or subcontractor.</p>
