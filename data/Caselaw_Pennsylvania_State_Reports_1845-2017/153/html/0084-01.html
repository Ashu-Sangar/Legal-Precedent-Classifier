They do not deny that the partnership existed as alleged at the time the deposits, except the last two, aggregating $330, were made; nor do they deny that the deposits were made and received in the course of the business of the copartnership, but they contend that, for reasons that will be noticed, they have been discharged from liability to the plaintiff.</p>

The articles of association of this firm contain some provisions looking to the continuance of the partnership by the survivors in case of the death of a member, as well as by the remaining members in case of a sale and transfer of the interest of any of their fellows. It is, however, unnecessary to decide whether, in view of these provisions, the death of John Floyd had or had not the ordinary effect in this respect of the death of a partner. It may be conceded for the present that it had.</p>

It is the right of each partner to have the assets of the firm applied to the discharge of its debts, and the residue, if any, divided among those entitled thereto; and it is the duty of those having custody of the assets to so apply them; they cannot in good faith to their fellows run away and leave them. And when one, in whose keeping the assets are, assumes the duty of liquidating partner, good faith equally requires that the others shall hold themselves bound by what is done, or object promptly and show why it ought not to be done. “ The authority to act as a liquidating partner does not require an express and specific appointment.

Thus a liquidation to that extent would be accomplished, and it has not been pointed out that it was not in this case and would not ordinarily be the most advantageous mode of liquidation — especially advantageous to the non-liquidating partners. Indeed, if these appellants believed the partnership dissolved by the death of John Floyd and knew the bank to be insolvent, as they now allege it was, it would not be a strained presumption that they looked with quiet satisfaction upon what their late partners were doing. Enough appears in their conduct as it is represented in their affidavits to hold them to have given authority to the others to act as liquidating partners, and they are consequently bound by all the acts of the latter within the scope of the business committed to them.</p>

The substantial effect, in one respect, of such borrowing is to renew a debt which may be about to be barred by the statute of limitations, and thus toll the statute.

The appellants do not deny the payment of interest or the making of the entries thereof in the book by some of the defendants; their denial in this respect being simply that the affiants made the entries. Taking the affidavits in connection with the statement and its accompanying account, they must be regarded as admitting payment of interest by the liquidating partners.

It contemplates that liabilities might be enforced by action against the associations primarily liable more than six years after they accrued, otherwise there was no need of the legislation, and it does not bar such actions. The statute is therefore clearly applicable to the shareholders in a corporation who are by its charter made individually liable to any extent whatever upon its contracts. But an unincorporated association has no capacity to be sued as an entity distinct from its members. The name which it adopts merely stands for the names of its members as a matter of convenience. Suits at law can be main<a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>tained upon its contracts only by and against the persons composing it, except where and to the extent to which it has been otherwise provided by statute. Story on Partnership, sec. 241 and cases cited in note. So necessary at common law was the joinder of all the members of a partnership in a suit upon a partnership liability that it required a statute in Pennsylvania to take away the right to plead a nonjoinder in abatement, and it may still be pleaded if the partnership has complied with the provisions of the 18th section of the act of April 14, 1851, P. L. 615. As a consequence, when an action against the members of a partnership is barred, all remedy is gone. There is no such thing as a secondary liability of the members of a partnership to be barred by the statute without affecting the remedy upon the primary liability of the firm. Therefore the members of such an association as the American Bank was, which is conceded to have been a partnership, are not within the purview of the act of 1867, but the word “ association ” must be held to have been used by the legislature as a synonym for corporation.</p>

He follows this with a formal denial of the existence of a partnership at and during the time the deposits were made. This denial, however, is so inconsistent with the implied admission of the existence of the partnership running through all the specific averments of the affidavit that it must be disregarded. And so must be the averment that the plaintiff continued to transact business with and loan his money to the new partnership, because it is <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>not a distinct averment that he “ agreed to loan to the new partnership ” the particular money to recover which this suit was brought.</p>

A release by contract upon any consideration moving from the affiant to the plaintiff is not alleged. If, then, the plaintiff is precluded by the facts stated from recovering from this appellant what is admitted to have been a debt owed by him and his codefendants jointly, it must be upon the theory that when he retired from the partnership and the remaining partners assumed the debts thereof his relation, ipso facto, changed from that of principal debtor to that of surety for his late associates, or that the continuance of the deposit with the new firm and acceptance of interest from it with knowledge of the facts was a novation of the debt. The theory of a shifted relation in the case of a retiring partner, when the remaining partners assume the debts, has direct or indirect sanction in many cases collected in the note to section 158 of Story on Partnership, to which cases may be added Shamburg v.

And even if a stranger had been introduced into the new firm, the payment of interest would not have been sufficient to charge it with the debt: Shamburg v.

That could he done at common law. It seems rather to have been rendered necessary by a practice which, from a small beginning in harmony with the common law, had come to produce incongruous results. In Lewis v. Smith, 2 S. &amp; R. 142, it was held that when the plaintiff’s demand is in the nature of a debt which may be ascertained by calculation, or arises upon a note or other writing, or on an account, and the defendant confesses the action, a judgment entered generally without stating the amount was a final judgment. This doctrine was subsequently extended to judgments by default in actions where the claim is for a sum certain, or can be ascertained by calculation from the demands set forth in the declaration, or accompanying writings required by rules of court, upon the principle that a default is a confession of the action.

But when in an action against numerous defendants judgment is taken against one in default of an appearance, against another in default of an affidavit of defence, against a third ^ in default of a plea, and against the remaining defendants upon the verdict of a jury, results are produced which could not have been in contemplation of the court when judgments by default in the class of actions referred to were declared to be final. The severance of the plaintiff’s demand by the entry of the first of such final judgments was fatal at common law, and no statute had authorized it. But it was desirable upon the one hand that such several judgments should be sanctioned for the purpose of lien, and on the other hand that the symmetry of the common law proceeding should be restored by blending them into one for all other purposes upon the final determination of the cause.

It was not necessary for the purpose of lien. The 3d section of the act of March 29, 1827, P.
