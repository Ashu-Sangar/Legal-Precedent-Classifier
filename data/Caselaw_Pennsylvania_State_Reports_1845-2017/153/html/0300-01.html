J., it appeared that plaintiff, a boy eight years old, was injured on Oct. 23, 1889, by falling or stepping from the front platform of one of defendant’s cars. At the time of the accident plaintiff was on his way'from Fairmount Park, and had been transferred at the company’s depot from one car to another. He took his place on the front platform, and when the conductor demanded his fare a dispute arose as to whether he had been transferred from the other car. There was evidence that the conductor approached him in such a way as to frighten him, and that he stepped back and fell from the car.</p>

The plaintiff was a minor child of tender years at the time the accident occurred, too young to be charged with contributory negligence. There was evidence sufficient to go to the jury that the conductor knew that the child was upon the front platform; that he approached him to demand his fare in a manner calculated to frighten him, that he jumped off the car by reason thereof. There was a conflict of evidence, as is usual in such cases, but that was for the jury. The case was given to them in an accurate and careful charge by the learned trial judge, and we have been unable to discover any error in his rulings.</p>
