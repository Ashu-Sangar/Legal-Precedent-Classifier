J., of the 36th judicial district, specially presiding, the evidence for the contestants tended to show that the testator George Van Dyke, for a few days before his death on Jan. 13, 1888, was in a weak and depressed condition of body and mind, and that he was induced by the urgent request and persistent importunities of the proponent to make the will in dispute, which he executed a few hours before his death. It was also alleged that proponent <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>procured the services of John Graham, a justice of the peace, to draw the will.</p>

If the jury are satisfied from the evidence that Hiram Van Dyke was present at the making of the will, and wrote the will; or assisted in making it, these are suspicious circumstances which are to have weight as the quantum of the legacy therein given to Hiram bears to the amount of the whole estate. <em>Answer: </em>Gentlemen, if Hiram assisted in the making of this will under which he undoubtedly tabes a devise of very considerable value, or if he volunteered to assist in writing the will,, either of these circumstances would be a matter of some suspicion in itself. It would not necessarily set the will aside, but might be considered in connection with the other evidence, undoubtedly, when you are looking at the case. If he merely copied the will at the instance of ’Squire Graham, if he penned it under these circumstances, and there is nothing else in the case to excite suspicion, I cannot see that that, in itself, would be a suspicious circumstance. Thus qualified, this point is affirmed.” [2]</p>
