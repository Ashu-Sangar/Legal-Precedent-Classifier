Bard, as defendants’ manager, had authority to bind them by making notes in the firm name, etc. This she undertook to do, and after bearing all the testimony that was offered on the subject, the learned court entered a judgment of nonsuit and afterwards denied plaintiff’s motion to take it off. This is the subject of complaint in tbe specifications of error.</p>
    <p id="b599-10" data-blocks='[["BL_599.13",599,[212,1500,1170,862]]]'>It is a well settled principle of practice that refusal to take off a peremptory nonsuit is in the nature of a judgment for defendant on demurrer to plaintiff’s evidence; and hence, in testing tbe correctness of such refusal, the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of every fact and inference of fact which might have been fairly found by the jury, or drawn by them from the evidence before them: Hill v.

It is immaterial that the evidence in support of plaintiff’s claim may be very slight, provided it amounts to more than a mere scintilla.

When any note was signed for the firm, he signed it, did he not ? A. Yes, sir; he signed it for the firm. Q.

Who signed checks for the firm ? A. He did. Q. Who bought and sold ? A. He did.” In answer to other questions the witness testified, in substance, that his brother William was the sole manager of the business, kept the bank account, bought, signed the notes given for purchases, determined when money was needed, borrowed money, etc.; that both the body of the note, where it is filled up, and the signature, are in his handwriting, — “ he wrote the whole note.”</p>

The next preceding clause appears to have been intended to operate merely as a restriction on the general authority of the partners themselves, and their subsequent course of action in devolving nearly everything on their manager, as appears by the testimony, is in harmony with that construction.</p>
