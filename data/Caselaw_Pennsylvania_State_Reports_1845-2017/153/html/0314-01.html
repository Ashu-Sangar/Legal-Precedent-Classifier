She was married in a home prepared for her and elegantly furnished by a lover, who thought he had been the sole participant in her secret love. At that wedding the o.) rriage of the girl’s employer played a prominent part. Horses, carriage, coachman and employer’s wife and son were at the wedding. The preacher was brought in another cab. Pretty high toned wedding for a young man, who only three months before was said to be on his uppers because he lost his last ten dollars at the Oresona races, when a man with a little black ball and the halves of an English walnut shell pulled in the multitude.</p>

None of the parties referred to occupy qny public position, nor had either of them been charged before a magistrate or other public officer with any offence. known to the laws. The contention, that because the rumors referred to had been for some time floating about in the neighborhood, and were known to a number of persons, was a justification of this publication, is not sustained. It cannot be too strongly impressed upon reporters and publishers of newspapers, that the law does not sanction the publication of all the low scandal they can gather up in the streets or alleys of a city or town.
