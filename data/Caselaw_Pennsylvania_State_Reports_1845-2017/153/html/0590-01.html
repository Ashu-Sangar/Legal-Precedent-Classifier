On June 15, 1892, defendant presented his affidavit setting forth the fact that he owed plaintiff the amount of the judgment when the bond was given, but that the debt had been attached in his hands May 26, 1892, by proceedings before alderman DeLong, setting forth the fact that plaintiff had claimed his exemption and that a judgment had been entered there against him (the plaintiff) June 2, 1892. Whereupon the court stayed the fi. fa. upon payment by defendant into court of the amount of money admitted by him to be due, which was the same amount for which plaintiff had entered judgment. Plaintiff had notice that this application would be made to court and was there represented by his attorney of record when the application was made. On June 16, 1892, defendant paid into court the sum of §72.43. On June 24, 1892, on the petition of plaintiff the court granted a rule to show cause why the. money paid into court by defendant should not be withdrawn <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>by the petitioner, notice of the rule to be served on the plaintiff in the judgment against the petitioner in attachment execution proceedings before alderman DeLong.

    <p id="b616-6" data-blocks='[["BL_616.6",616,[279,600,1171,1113]]]'>In May, .1892, judgment was rendered by alderman DeLong against Andrew Boland, the plaintiff in this case, for $94.26 and costs. Execution thereon having been returned “ no goods,” an execution attachment was issued May 26, 1892-, and George Spitz, defendant in this case, was summoned as garnishee and answered. At the hearing, June 2, 1892, Boland claimed the benefit of the exemption act, but his claim was ignored by the alderman and judgment against said garnishee was entered for more than the amount of the original judgment. Prior to the hearing of the rule in this case, that judgment was never challenged by appeal, certiorari or otherwise, and had therefore become as final and conclusive, on all the parties thereto, as the judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction : Lacock v. White, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Pa.%20496" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="19 Pa. 496">19 Pa. 496</a>. Boland’s claim of exemption was a species of defence, personal to himself, in the execution attachment proceeding; and, the alderman having decided against him, his only remedy was by appeal or certiorari. Having failed to avail himself of either, the judgment of the alderman became absolutely final and conclusive; and, remaining so at the hearing of the rule in this case, the learned court was clearly right in holding that its validity could not be questioned in this proceeding.</p>
