Although there may not have been any intention to kill — if there was no willful or premeditated killing — then was the killing done under such circumstances as would constitute murder of the second degree, by both or either of these defendants? Was it done “ under circumstances of depravity of heart and a disposition of mind regardless of social duty, but where no intention to kill existed or could be reasonably and fully inferred ? ” If so, then your verdict should be murder of the second degree, as to both or either of these defendants, as you find their participation in the commission of the crime. If you find that the circumstances do not exhibit wickedness of disposition, depravity of heart, recklessness of consequences or cruelty, your verdict should be that of manslaughter as to both or either of these de<a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>fendants, as you find their participation in the commission of the crime. But, as I have said to you, the burden of reducing the crime from murder of the second degree to manslaughter rests upon the defendants, that is, if you find that murder has been committed.</p>

The first question will be, are they, or 'either of them, guilty of murder? [If they, or either of them, formed the design to kill Helmstetter, and in pursuance of this purpose they, or either of them, prepared the weapon, carried it with them and used it on the occasion, then that is murder.] If, at the time, they, or either of them, thought of this purpose to kill, and had time to-think that they, or either of them would execute it, and formed fully in their minds the conscious design of killing, and had time to think of the weapon they had prepared, and that they would use, and so did use it, that would be murder of the first degree.] [7] But if, although they had prepared the weapon intending to use it, the attack was made upon them and they' had no real intention of killing Helmstetter, did not deliberate upon the act, but in the suddenness of the occasion, and impetuousness, intending only to cut or wound, or do some bodily' harm, that would be murder of the second degree. If, however, you believe that the weapon was not prepared at all for the occasion, that there was no previous purpose or intention to kill or to do great bodily harm, but that it was done under the impulse of passion caused by the blows, as I have said, upon Angelo Zappe, and the blow was struck without any malice at all, the crime would be manslaughter.”</p>

The first five specifications of error either do not conform to the rules of court or refer to matters not assignable as error. The sixtli and seventh specifications allege error in certain portions of the charge of the learned judge. The portions of the charge thus assigned as error are isolated sentences wrenched from their position and connection in the general charge. When read in their proper connection they are free from error.</p>
    <p id="b525-7" data-blocks='[["BL_525.12",525,[193,1697,1174,607]]]'>The eighth, ninth and tenth specifications allege that the learned judge erred, not in what he did say to the jury, but in what he did not say. We think the charge was sufficiently full and accurate. If the judge fails to charge upon some point which the prisoner’s counsel regard as essential to the defence, it is only fair to the trial judge that his attention should be called to it before the jury leave the bar, in order that he may correct any omission, if any has been made. It would require a very strong case to induce us to reverse a judgment after a trial upon the merits for any such reason as is set forth in these specifications. We have not the case before us of a wholly inadequate charge.</p>
