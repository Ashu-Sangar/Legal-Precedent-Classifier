Defendants agreed to purchase the soda-ash, provided they could induce their customer to take it and provided the delivery of the soda-ash should be promptly made to them at the 48d Street station of the Pittsburgh J unction Railroad in the city of Pittsburgh. The goods were not such goods as could be disposed of in the market. On the same day defendants consulted their customer and found him willing to purchase, and telegraphed to plaintiffs their acceptance of the proposition of sale. On May 13, the goods had not yet been delivered to them at the 43d Street station of the Pittsburgh Junction Railroad, and defendants notified plaintiffs in writing <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>that the contract was rescinded on account of their failure to deliver. In the meantime defendants’ customer had made demand upon them for the goods, and compelled them to purchase elsewhere to fill his order. The witnesses differed as to the place at which, under the contract between the parties, the goods purchased by defendants were to he delivered, and to whom they were to he delivered, plaintiffs claiming that the delivery was to be made at Rankin station, and not at the 43d Street station aforesaid.</p>

I decline to say that there could be no recovery in this case if you should find that the contract called for a delivery at Forty-third street. In such ease it would, in my opinion, be your duty still to inquire from all the evidence whether or not the plaintiffs had made a delivery of the goods at that point, and that the goods were there awaiting removal by the defendants, or were negligently detained by the railroad at the place of delivery.” [1]</p>

I leave as a fact to be found by you, if you find the contract to be one of ‘ prompt delivery,’ whether or not under the evidence such delivery by the plaintiffs has taken place. Prompt delivery has no definite or fixed meaning, but will depend for its construction upon the circumstances and the extent of the delay complained of.” [2]</p>

In that event, however, the law would cast upon the plaintiffs the burden of a delivery at Forty-third street within a reasonable time, either as an ordinary delivery or a prompt delivery, according to the agreement and circumstances of this case. If the goods were at the appointed place, in proper time, and in the hands of the carrier agreed upon for delivery of goods, I take it to be the case that the delivery by the plaintiffs is completed, and the goods thereupon became the property of the purchaser, and for any delays in delivery, or loss sustained, as the owner of the goods, his remedy would be against the carrier and not against the vendor.”] [4]</p>

The evidence tended to prove that such was the contract between the parties. No delivery at that point was shown. On the contrary, it appeared that neither the plaintiff nor the railroad company delivered or offered to deliver them there when defendants were <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>entitled to receive them. In view of the evidence, from which the jury would have had no difficulty in finding those facts, or at least would have been warranted in finding them, defendants requested the court to charge :</p>

In such ease it would, in my opinion, be your duty still to inquire, from all the evidence, whether or not the plaintiff had made a delivery of the goods at that point, and that the goods were there awaiting removal by the defendants, or were negligently detained by the railroad company at the place of delivery.”</p>
    <p id="b467-5" data-blocks='[["BL_467.6",467,[218,1240,1170,1114]]]'>There was no evidence that “ plaintiff had made a delivery of the goods at that point,” or “ that the goods were there awaiting removal by the defendants,” at least not at the time they should have been delivered there. It was therefore error to submit to the jury these inquiries, of which there was no sufficient evidence. Still more was it error to permit them, in the circumstances, to inquire whether the goods “ were negligently detained by the railroad company at the place of delivery.” This instruction ignores the recognized principle that where goods are to be carried by the vendor to a certain place and there delivered to the vendee, the carrier is the agent of the former and not of the latter; and that the vendor is responsible for the negligence or misconduct of his agent: McNeal v.

The coal was selected by plaintiff from his stock, loaded in a barge selected by him, and, reaching Burlington safely, was moored alongside defendant’s wharf for the purpose of unloading, just before usual quitting-time in the evening. During that night the barge sank, and the coal was lost. In an action to recover the contract price of the coal it was held that, when vendor contracts to deliver goods to vendee at a particular place, the carrier selected by vendor is his agent to perform the contract to deliver; and the vessel in which the goods are carried is pro hac vice the vendor’s vessel, and he must bear the responsibility for the carrier’s negligence, and for the condition of the vessel.</p>
