The driver testified that just before the accident occurred he unloaded a barrel of porter, and undertook to tap it, as he was instructed to do for all his employer’s customers. In doing so he broke a wooden faucet, when the saloon keeper for whom he was unloading the porter asked him to go to a street some distance off, and buy a faucet, giving him the money to pay for it. In driving rapidly on this errand, he ran into and injured plaintiff. Plaintiff testified that on the day following the accident defendants came to his house, and told him that they would pay his doctor’s bill and expenses, and stated that they had discharged the driver the night before. This conversation was denied by defendants. The court charged that if the jury believed plaintiff’s testimony, defend<a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>ant’s liability was fixed; but in other parts of the charge and in answer to several points, the question was distinctly left to the jury to determine whether the driver was acting within the scope of his employment. <em>Held, </em>that there was no error which justified the reversal of the judgment.</p>

    <p id="b432-5" data-blocks='[["BL_432.7",432,[276,724,1178,1672]]]'>It is practically conceded that the injuries suffered by plaintiff were directly caused by the reckless negligence of Thomas Carroll, who, at the time they were inflicted, was employed by the firm defendants in delivering beer, etc., to their customers. For that purpose he drove their beer wagon by which plaintiff was struck and injured. It is also conceded that if Carroll was acting within the general scope of his said employment, at the time plaintiff was injured in consequence of his negligent driving, defendants would be liable; but it is alleged that, notwithstanding he was actually driving their wagon, he was then in the temporary service of Patrick Loftus, one of their customers, to whom he had, a few minutes before, delivered a barrel of porter. Carroll testified that, on the afternoon in question, he drove out from the brewery, in company with one of the defendants, with several barrels of ale and a barrel of porter ; that, after delivering some of the ale, he went to Patrick Loftus’s place, unloaded the barrel of porter, and undertook to tap it as he was instructed to do for all his employers’ customers. In the language of the witness, Loftus “ had a wooden faucet and I busted it in tapping the porter. It was very lively porter, very wild, and it was leaking, and he asked me if I would go to Lackawanna avenue and bring him back a faucet, and he gave me a two dollar bill, and I paid $1.75 for a brass faucet. ... I drove pretty lively to Lackawanna avenue; I came down Penn avenue; . . . . and there was a couple of teams ahead of me, and I was in a hurry to get the faucet and get back and put in this other faucet, and I went to pull across, my team got a little excited, I think they did, and they went across the track, and my wagon striking Mr. Guinney that is something I never seen, and don’t believe it; I don’t see how it could.” The witness proceeded to say that after being informed of plaintiff’s injury, etc., he drove on, got the faucet, returned to Loftus’s place and tapped the barrel of porter.</p>

    <p id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[220,764,1163,338]]]'>In their fourth point, which was also affirmed, they asked the court to charge : “ That it was not in the scope of Thomas Carroll’s authority as a servant or employee of the defendants to drive the team of defendants about the streets of Scranton on errands for Patrick Loftus, and if the jury believe that, at the time of the accident, he was on such an errand, the plaintiff cannot recover in this case.”</p>

He says he was obliged to tap ale or porter as he delivered it; that he swears was within the scope of his employment. Now, does it follow as a natural deduction from that, that this porter was not tapped when this faucet broke, and that he started back at the instance of Loftus to procure another faucet? We submit that as a question of fact for you, gentlemen of the jury, whether he was within the legitimate scope of his employment. If you find he was not, that is the end of the case.”</p>

In saying, “ Now, if you believe that testimony, that fixed their liability, because by that admission it shows that this man was in their employ, and by their further admission, that he was acting within the scope of his employment,”— we cannot think the learned judge intended to do more than to convey the idea that defendants’ admissions were evidence of, and tended to fix their liability. If more than that was intended, it was a mistake, because the question whether Carroll was acting within the scope of his employment, etc., was clearly a question of fact for the jury: Brunner v.
