It appeared that, on Nov. 22, 1873, Clarence M. Johns executed and delivered the mortgage in question to David Ilobinson to secure repayment of loan of $4,000 in two years. On Nov. 24, 1873, Robinson assigned the mortgage to Lincoln University. On December, 1875, a sci. fa. was issued on this mortgage upon an affidavit filed setting forth that default had been made : and that the mortgage contained a proviso “that in case default be made in the payment of the aforesaid mortgage debt for a period of twenty days after the same should become due,” a writ of sci. fa. might issue. To this Johns filed an affidavit of defence, setting forth: (1) That in the sci. fa. clause as shown in the recorder’s office, the time was left blank. (2) That if the material words twenty days were now in the mortgage they were inserted since its execution and delivery. Pleas of non est factum, and the special matter set forth in the affidavit of defence, were filed. Upon trial, a verdict was rendered for C. M. Johns. By subsequent conveyances, title to the property became vested in plaintiff.</p>

    <p id="b376-5" data-blocks='[["BL_376.6",376,[273,563,1168,906]]]'>Upon the facts as set forth in the case stated, we are of the opinion that the law is with the plaintiff. The mortgage was altered in a material part by the mortgagee, and this alteration avoids it absolutely. The mortgage is but a security for the payment of money with a right of lien upon the mortgaged premises to enforce payment. It is not stamped with the- character of real estate, but is a bare incumbrance or charge. In Wilson v. Schoenberger’s Executors, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20Pa.%20299" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="31 Pa. 299">31 Pa. 299</a>, it was said: “ It is settled law in Pennsylvania that though in form a conveyance of the title, it is in reality, both at law and in equity, only a security for the payment of money or performance of the alleged contract.” There is no analogy between this case and that of a grantee of land who alters or destroys his title deed. In such case his title to the land is not gone, because the estate vested in him by virtue of his deed, and can only pass from him by some mode of conveyance known to the law. The instrument is avoided, but not the estate: Rifener v. Bowman, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20Pa.%20313" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="63 Pa. 313">63 Pa. 313</a>.</p>
