Hamer v. Humphrey, 2 Miles, 28; Johnston v. Ballentine, 1 <em>W. </em>N. 626. This long established practice it is not desirable, nor is it intended, to disturb. But it is plainly in relief of the defendant, as it tends to excuse him from what is now in the appropriate actions, a statutory requirement. Being for his benefit therefore, he may waive it, and we are of opinion that he has done so here. This point was not brought to the notice of the court below when the rule for judgment was argued, and it is admitted that it is first presented here. It comes too late. There has been no loss or hardship to the defendant but merely a failure to get the benefit of a technical advantage by failing to claim it at the proper time. Though the judgment, in strict law, is irregular in this respect, the appellant has no right now to complain of it.</p>
