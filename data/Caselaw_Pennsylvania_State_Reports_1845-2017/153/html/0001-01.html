The contract for said macadamizing was awarded to Edward Shantz. By and under the authority of the said ordinance of 1869 the centre of this street was laid with macadam, to a width of twenty-five feet between Fifteenth and Sixteenth streets, wdthout any curbing or paved gutter being placed on the sides thereof.</p>
