      <em>Agreement to assignpatent </em>— Partnership—Responsive <em>answer </em>— Evidence. On a bill to compel an assignment of a half interest in a patent, plaintiff alleged that, in consideration of his admitting defendant into a half <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>interest in Ms business defendant agreed to assign to Mm one half interest in a machino, and in the letters patent that should be granted for the machine, and for improvements upon it. Defendant denied that any such agreement had been made. The master found that plaintiff’s testimony was corroborated by the fact that defendant was allowed, without objection by plaintiff, to uso the firm’s money, property, employees’ time and room space, and also his own time, for the purpose of perfecting the machine, and securing patents for it. It also appeared that when foreign patents were taken out on the machine, plaintiff was allowed to participate in them without any question being raised as to his right of ownership. A number of witnesses testified that they always understood that the machine belonged to the firm. Defendant and wife contradicted the testimony of plaintiff, and a number of witnesses for defendant stated that they understood that the machine belonged to him. The master found as a fact that the agreement set forth in the bill had been made. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the master’s finding.</p>

Defendant’s counsel argued the case largely on the theory that the bill was intended to vary a written agreement by parol evi<a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>dence of a contemporaneous oral agreement. Plaintiff’s counsel, however, contended that the bill simply sought to enforce an oral agreement to assign a one half interest in a patent, the consideration for the oral agreement being the execution by the plaintiff of the partnership articles, and that the two agreements were collateral to each other, and that the oral agreement was in no way intended to modify or change the partnership articles. The importance of the distinction lies in the fact that the quantum of proof required in the first instance would be greater than that required in the second. The difficulty lies not so much in the averments of the bill as in the condition of the proofs. The bill avers : ‘ It was orally agreed between the plaintiff and the defendant, in consideration of entering into said articles of agreement and in consideration of other matters, that the plaintiff should be the owner of one-half interest in said machine, and in the letters patent which should be granted therefor.’ These words seem clearly to imply that the execution of the written articles was merely a consideration for the agreement to assign 'one half the patent. [The plaintiff’s testimony, in the main, supports the words of the bill.] [1] He says : ‘ Seeing Mr. Henshall frequently, and believing that this was a pretty good machine he was working on, I made this proposal to him: That in case I can succeed in raising enough money to buy out both my partners, I have a proposal to make to you. He says : “ What is it ? ” I says: “ I will give you half the business for half your machine.” He said: “ It is a go.” I said: “ All right.” ’ The plaintiff also testified that William Hill, who was preparing the agreement, came to him and said: ‘ “Well, John, look here about this agreement, what is Henshall going to put as an equivalent to your capital ? ” I says : “ Why, I am getting half this machine.” Henshall spoke up and says: “Yes, I have got no money, and, of course, I am giving John half this machine for half his business.” ’ On cross-examination the plaintiff was asked this question, relating to matters just prior to the bringing of the suit: ‘ Q. Before you became dissatisfied, then you found fault with your partnership agreement, did you? A. No; I did. not find fault with the partnership agreement. I only asked him to put up his half of the agreement, and he did not choose to do it. Q. At the time the verbal contract <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>was made, yoir say you were to have one half of this machine in consideration of going into partnership with Mr. Henshall; that is right, is it? A. Not exactly. You are getting a little out of the road. I was to have one half of the mach ne for taking him in partnership with me. This is the way. I had the business. Q. Why do you say to me that Mr. Henshall has no right to the partnership? A. Because he has not put up the part he was to put up to get the partnership. Q. What do you mean by that? A. He promised to give me one half of the machine. Q. According to your understanding that he has no right to the partnership, it is because he has not assigned you one half of that machine, which is now in controversy ; is that it ? A. Certainly.’</p>

There was also an account in the firm books against the machine, and a number of firm checks were drawn to' pay expenses connected with it. It must be remembered, however, that the firm consisted only of Hepworth and Henshall, and, if the plaintiff’s story is true as to the oral agreement', it is not particularly strange that no distinction was made between property actually in the business, and that which was owned in common by the two partners. [Assuming the plaintiff’s testimony to be true, it seems to be reasonably certain that the real contract between the parties was that the defendant should assign to the plaintiff one half interest in plaintiff’s business, and that everything was put into the partnership articles that the parties intended.] [4]</p>

In this case the plaintiff has offered to establish the averments of his bill by his own testimony, by that of William Hill and by certain circumstances which tend to corroborate the testimony of himself and Hill. The defendant, on the other hand, has, by his own testimony, denied the facts alleged by the plaintiff and Hill. He has also seriously impeached the veracity of Hill, and has offered in evidence certain circumstances, which, he claims, tend to prove his side of the case. Over one thousand pages of testimony were taken. Some of it is wholly irrelevant to the issue, and much of it is absolutely contradictory. The plaintiff tells one story and the defendant contradicts it and tells another wholly inconsistent with the former. In such a condition of the evidence, the only way to ascertain the truth as-to the one fact in issue in the case is to carefully marshal the evidence on one side against that on the other; to weigh the inherent probabilities of the conflicting stories, and to consider with due caution the credibility of the witnesses.

The plaintiff, by his own testimony, supported all of the main averments of the bill. In his story there was no improbable elements, and he did not contradict himself. He was subjected to a cross-examination which covers eighty-five pages of the record of testimony, and he was in no way shaken in the evidence which he gave in his examination in chief. An attempt was made to impeach his veracity by showing that a statement which he made on cross-examination was untrue. He was asked on cross-examination by defendant’s counsel whether he had engaged in any other business-during the continuance of the partnership, and in violation of the partnership articles. He replied that he had not. The defendant subsequently offered a witness to prove that the plaintiff had actually been engaged in the bicycle business. The offer was refused on the ground that the evidence as to-the breach of the partnership article was irrelevant, and that <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>an offer to contradict statements made by a witness on cross-examination as to collateral matters is improper. Evidence that the plaintiff engaged in another business would have been proper in an accounting between the partners, but it was clearly irrelevant to the present case. In Fry on Specific Performance, 2d ed., § 917, the rule is stated as follows: ‘ Where that, on the nonperformance of which by the. plaintiff the defendant relies, is in its nature a collateral and separate contract, though between the same parties and entered into at the same time, and having relation to the same subject-matter as to the contract which the plaintiff seeks to enforce, the court will not consider the default by the plaintiff in respect of the one contract as any bar to the specific performance of the other, though such default may give the defendant a cross right of action on iegal or equitable grounds.’ If it be conceded that the evidence offered was irrelevant, it was improper to attempt to impeach the plaintiff’s veracity by the use of it. In Greenleaf on Evidence, 14th ed., § 449, it is said : ‘ It is a well settled rule that a witness cannot be cross-examined as to any fact which is collateral and irrelevant to the issue, merely for the purpose of contradicting him by other evidence, if he should deny it, thereby to discredit his testimony. And, if a question is put to a witness which is collateral or irrelevant to the issue, his answer cannot be contradicted by the party who asked the question, but it is conclusive against him.’ See also to the same effect: Griffith v.

The plaintiff relied upon William Hill as the second witness necessary to establish his case against the sworn answer.

Twenty-eight witnesses testified that they were acquainted with his general reputation for veracity in the neigh<a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>borhood where he did business or resided, and that that reputation was bad.

Eleven of the thirty-two persons named as sources of information were also witnesses. Five persons who were named as sources of information appeared before the master and contradicted the alleged statements and testified that they would believe him under oath. Nineteen witnesses testified that they would believe Hill under oath, but it appeared, on cross-examination, that most of them based their opinion as to his veracity, not on his general reputation, but upon their personal relations with him. The master is clearly of the opinion that Hill’s reputation for veracity is bad, and that his testimony should not be given much <em>weight; </em>certainly not the weight of a second witness to sustain a bill against a sworn responsive answer. His testimony, however, as it was presented, corroborates plaintiff’s testimony, and is itself corroborated by the circumstances which tend to confirm the plaintiff’s story and by the probabilities of the case. Under these circumstances [it might possibly be given a slight weight as an additional corroborating circumstance in favor of the plaintiff.] [8]</p>

The articles of copartnership contained a provision that in consideration of the skill, knowledge and experience of the defendant as a machinist, he should have an undivided one-half interest and ownership in all the goods, wares, debts and property delivered as stock to the firm by the plaintiff. The actual net capital put into the firm by the plaintiff was $11,000. Each of the partners was credited on the books of the firm with $5,500. Henshall was a good mechanic, but he had no special knowledge of ‘ Loopers ’ and ‘ Balmorals1,’ which machines were the principal products of the firm’s factory. The plaintiff was also a mechanic and had practical knowledge of the making of the machines ir anufactured by the firm.</p>

The master cannot but think that if the plaintiff entered into such an agreement for no other consideration than for the help which he was to receive from the defendant, ho ran a serious risk, and did a very foolish thing. It is true that Mr. Beatty testifies that the plaintiff was very anxious to get rid of his old partners, who were apparently worthless, and to obtain some one who could adequately help him in the practical part of his business; and it also appears from the evidence that the new firm was fairly prosperous during the whole of its existence.

However this may be, it is affirmatively shown and practically conceded that the defendant did spend a very considerable portion of his time during business hours in working upon the seamless machine.

For a considerable time no record was kept of the time thus spent. Subsequently, however, and after the third machine was begun, the men were in-structed to mark their time upon.the patterns. The plaintiff testified that this was done so that the cost of building the machine might be ascertained. The defendant claimed that he expected to pay for his work, and that he supposed that it was all charged to his private account in the firm books.

Various bills offered in evidence, and attached to tbe checks, show that the checks were drawn for these purposes. It appears from the books that the amounts of the checks were all charged to the expense account of the firm. The defendant claims that be expected to pay these expenditures out of his individual funds, and that he supposed that they were charged to his private account, but it does not appear, even from his own testimony, that lie made any serious attempt to have them so charged. The plaintiff drew the checks and directed Mr. Winkler, the bookkeeper, to charge them to the firm’s expense account. He knew that they were not charged to the defendant’s private account, and, of course, made no objection to the expenditure of the firm’s money for this purpose. In so doing he must have been a more foolish man than the other evidence in the case discloses him to be, or he was acting on tbe supposition that he had a joint ownership in the patents for which the payments were made.</p>

The judgment was paid by the firm and charged as a firm expense. The plaintiff stated that the reason he had agreed to pay the judgment out of the firm’s moneys was owing to the fact that he had a half interest in the machine, and that the money for which the judgment was recovered had gone into the machine.

If it be assumed that Hepworth had no interest whatever in the seamless machine, there is no reason disclosed by the evidence why his name should have been inserted in the foreign patents. He paid no portion of the costs of procuring the patents. There is no evidence that he bought any interest from Henshall, and there was no agreement with Hen-shall by reason of which he should have a one third interest.

He says : “ If I can get shut of my partners ” (the word he made use of) “ will you go with me ? ” We walked across the room, the machine was at the window, and we walked across the room; and he was just about going and I says to him : “ What do you mean ?

I says : “ You can see what you can do with them, and then you can let me know.” He testified that subsequently he agreed to go into partnership with Hepworth on the terms stated, but that the machine had nothing to do with the partnership, and that he retained his individual ownership in it. He explained that the expenditures made on the machine in the way of wages, fees and payments for patterns were to be paid by him personally, and that he supposed that these items had been charged against his personal account.

There is a significant circumstance in the case which tends to show that the defendant did know that the expenditures made on account of the seamless machine were not charged to his private account. In the spring of 1890, when Mr. Hepworth was in Europe and after the quarrel between the partners had begun, the defendant directed the bookkeeper to enter a charge of $17.00, paid out on account of the seamless machine, to his private account.

    <p class="author" id="AK1" data-blocks='[["BL_635.9",635,[494,1817,453,39]]]'>Mr. Justice Stekrett,</p>
    <p id="AWJ" data-blocks='[["BL_635.10",635,[215,1868,1157,94]]]'>This contention, in the court below, hinged mainly on the alleged oral agreement recited in the third paragraph of the bill.</p>
    <p id="b635-7" data-blocks='[["BL_635.11",635,[213,1970,1161,449]],["BL_636.1",636,[288,386,1168,299]]]'>Among other things, the bill avers, in substance, that, on November 30, 1886, plaintiff and defendant entered into a written agreement of copartnership, for the term of five years, for the purpose of carrying on the business of machinists in the name of John W. Hepworth &amp; Co. The defendant had theretofore applied for letters patent for a seamless knitting machine, not then completed. Those letters were issued July 31, 1888, and the fees therefor were paid by the firm. Other letters, for improvements on said machine, etc., were issued March 20, <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>1890, and August 8, 1890. During a considerable portion of the time, after formation of said partnership, defendant Hen-shall was engaged, with the assistance of employees of the firm and aid of the firm’s capital, in completing and making improvements on said machine. The oral agreement, above referred to, is set forth in the third paragraph of the bill thus:</p>
    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[287,692,1166,392]]]'>“ It was orally agreed between the plaintiff and the defendant, in consideration of entering into said articles of agreement and in consideration of other matters, that the plaintiff should be the owner of one half interest in said machine and in the letters patent that should be granted therefor, and in all the improvements in said machine and in all letters patent which should be thereafter granted for improvements in said machine.”</p>
    <p id="b636-6" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[288,1101,1168,348]]]'>It is further averred that the defendant refused to assign said interest to the plaintiff as provided for in said oral agreement. The prayers are for <em>(a) </em>an injunction restraining defendant from assigning or otherwise disposing of a one half interest in said machine and letters patent; (5) a decree ordering him to assign to the plaintiff a one-half interest in said machine and letters patent; and (c) general relief.</p>
    <p id="b636-7" data-blocks='[["BL_636.6",636,[288,1457,1168,297]]]'>In his answer defendant admits the partnership, but expressly denies “ ever having entered into an agreement, either at the time, or before, or after formation of said partnership by virtue of which the plaintiff was to have one half, or any interest whatever, in any of said machines, improvements thereon or letters patent.”</p>
    <p id="b636-8" data-blocks='[["BL_636.7",636,[290,1762,1167,247]]]'>The burden of overcoming this responsive answer and making full proof of the alleged oral agreement according to equity practice, was thus cast on the plaintiff. He assumed that burden, and succeeded in proving to the satisfaction of the learned master and court below that said alleged agreement was made.</p>
    <p id="b636-9" data-blocks='[["BL_636.8",636,[292,2016,1167,399]],["BL_637.1",637,[216,379,1168,248]]]'>After a careful review and properly discriminating consideration of all the testimony bearing on the subject, the learned master states bis conclusion thus : “ that the plaintiff has sustained the averments of the bill by his own testimony and sufficient corroborating circumstances, and that the plaintiff’s proof is sufficient without taking into consideration in any way the testimony of William Hill. The master therefore finds as a fact that it was orally agreed between the plaintiff and de <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>fendant, in consideration of entering into the articles of co-partnership of November 30, 1886, that the plaintiff should be the owner of a one-half interest in the automatic seamless knitting machine, owned by the defendant, and the letters patent which protect the machine.”</p>
    <p id="b637-5" data-blocks='[["BL_637.4",637,[217,635,1168,710]]]'>This conclusion is so fully vindicated by the master in his clear and convincing report that further discussion of the testimony is deemed unnecessary. An examination of the proceedings before him fails to disclose any error in his findings of fact. The only criticism that was suggested by that examination is his ruling in relation to cross-examination of witnesses called to impeach the credibility of William Hill, one of plaintiff’s witnesses. Speaking for myself, he appears to have held plaintiff to an unduly rigid rule in that regard. In such cases, it is not only due to the impeached witness, but also to the party who called him, that some latitude should be allowed in cross-examination of the impeaching witnesses, excluding, however, such details as would create collateral issues; but of that the defendant, of course, does not complain.</p>
    <p id="b637-6" data-blocks='[["BL_637.5",637,[216,1354,1172,701]]]'>The oral agreement, established by the proofs, does not, in terms, entitle the plaintiff to an interest in improvements on the machine other than those made during the existence of the copartnership aforesaid; nor do we think that any other or further right is implied. Construed in the light of the relation existing between the parties when the agreement was made and their subsequent course of dealing in relation to the subject, we are of opinion that plaintiff’s claim should be restricted to an undivided oue-half interest in the machine, and a like interest in all improvements made thereon during the continuance of the partnership, and in the letters patent, protecting the same, whether applied for or granted before or after the expiration of said partnership. It therefore follows that the decree should be modified to read thus :</p>
    <p id="b637-7" data-blocks='[["BL_637.6",637,[220,2072,1169,298]]]'>1. That a perpetual injunction issue enjoining and restraining the said Samuel Henshall from assigning, selling or in any manner disposing of more than a one undivided half interest in the automatic seamless knitting machine, and in the various letters patent referred to in the third and fourth paragraphs of plaintiff’s bill.</p>
    <p id="b637-8" data-blocks='[["BL_637.7",637,[265,2379,1122,44]],["BL_638.1",638,[257,372,1173,340]]]'>2. That the said Samuel Henshall assign to the said John W. <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>Hepworth a one undivided half interest in said automatic seamless knitting machine and in the letters patent numbers 386,819, 386,820 and 386,821, issued July 31, 1888, and in all improvements in said machine made prior to November 30, 1891, and in all letters patent for said machine and for said improvements whether applied for or granted before or after said last mentioned date.</p>
    <p id="b638-4" data-blocks='[["BL_638.4",638,[258,729,1171,147]]]'>As thus modified, the decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed ; and it is further ordered that the costs of this appeal be paid by the appellee.</p>
