The judgment was for #7,292, and some cents. [If you wish to retain the lien of a judgment yon must issue what is called a scire facias to revive it, at the end of five years. Fox some reason no sci. fa. was issued upon this until lately.] [2] In the meantime, in 1885, the old gentleman died. During his lifetime he took no proceedings to revive it. After his death the administratrix issued a sci. fa. and now wishes to revive the judgment. She has a right to do that, and unless there is something in the case made out by the defendant, would be entitled to your verdict for #10,432.74, if this calculation of interest is right, and it is not disputed. That brings us to the defence, which, if made out to your satisfaction by the evidence, is a complete one in equity; that is, if you believe it, and that is entirely for you. [The defence is that this note was given by the defendant in good faith, that he owed the money, but was unable to pay it:] [3] he was unfortunate or became insolvent through misfortune, or in some way. [After selling what they could in another county they brought the judgment here, and while his mother was living, levied on his interest in his father’s estate in Manchester, or somewhere in this county. That interest was bid in by old Mr. Fowler. It is alleged that was in 1876, before the old gentleman was paralyzed, and while he was able to attend to his own business.</p>

There is no dispute that the $2,100 was paid by the old lady, and that she paid the costs. [In investigating that, it is for you to consider, the old gentleman living until 1885, and having done nothing, having acted upon this matter in the way he did, whether that is not some-evidence in favor of an arrangement being made of that kind.] [8] But you will remember that the defendant must satisfy you of the defence he sets up.

Such practice is not to be encouraged. The charge as a whole presents to the jury the nature of the controversy, the claims of the respective parties, the burden of proof, and the province of the jury. These are the substantial elements of the case, and though presented very briefly and in the most general way, we cannot say that <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>the presentation was either inadequate or erroneous. As held in Borham v.

The only point upon which Ave have had any doubt was the statement that “it was alleged ” by defendant that the agreement for satisfaction was “in 1876 before the old gentleman was paralyzed, and while he was able to attend to his own business.” The time of the alleged agreement was only a collateral fact, but it bore very strongly on the credibility of the main fact in issue, the making of the agreement at all. It would have been desirable therefore that the conflict of evidence, if there was any, as to the time, should be brought out strongly so that the jury should see its bearing. The learned judge however was not stating the result of the evidence but the defendant’s claim in regard to it. On this point the affidavit of defence avers that the sheriff’s sale to Fowler was in Sept. 1876. L. H. Smith says Fowler called several times in reference to settling the judgment, and the arrangement was made prior to this sale. He is positive the arrangement was with James Fowler, and Mr. Woodward testifies also, though not so positively, that he thought he saw Fowler Sr. about the matter. While on the other hand some answers of L. H. Smith seem to be at variance with this date, yet the repugnance was for the jury. The judge was stating in the most general way what the defence was, and we cannot say in view of the evidence, that his expression “ it is alleged that this was in 1876,” etc., was a material error.</p>

Whether there really was such a mortgage existing as a valid lien on this land was unimportant. The only bearing of the fact was upon the credibility of the agreement set up in defence, and for that purpose the effect of a supposed mortgage, upon the parties, was the same as if it were real. Any contest on such a point would have served only to divert the attention of the jury from the fact whether the agreement of satisfaction was made or not, to the consideration of whether it was wise or prudent to rna'ke it, a matter not within their province to decide.</p>

Any matters which have arisen subsequent to a judgment, and which amount to payment in fact or in law may be pleaded in bar as a defence, and may be proved by parol: Savage v. Everman, <a href="/pa/70/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="70 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="1028222" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0315-01">70 Pa. 315</a>; Hendrick v. Thomas, <a href="/pa/106/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="106 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="455551" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0327-01">106 Pa. 327</a>. And the reason that payment of money in discharge of a larger amount presently due is not a good accord and satisfaction (Mechanic’s Bank v. Huston, 11 W. N. 389), is that the debtor gives nothing he was not already bound to give, and the creditor receives nothing he is not already entitled to receive, and there is therefore no consideration. But if there is any advantage to the creditor the law will not weigh the adequacy of the consideration: Hendrick v. Thomas, <a href="/pa/106/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="106 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="455551" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0327-01">supra;</a> Grayson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/108/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="108 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="539238" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0581-01">108 Pa. 581</a>. In the present case the payment- of money was by the defendant’s mother out of her own estate on which Fowler had no claim whatever. It was therefore a new consideration from a new party and not within the rule that the receipt of a smaller sum is not a good accord and satisfaction of a larger one, and the learned judge was entirely right in charging that the facts made a good defence if believed by the jury.</p>
