The subscriptions were based upon the condition that defendant would lease five acres of his land to the proposed company for the period of five years for oil and gas purposes. Defendant was to furnish boiler, engine and fuel, and to give his personal attention to the drilling of the first well. The consideration to defendant was that the company should pay him one third of all profits realized from oil or gas found on the said five acres. The company was organized, and on Nov. 1, 1890, defendant leased to the company the said five acres of land for the term of five years for the annual rental of one dollar and other considerations, with a covenant in the lease entitling the lessor, for a breach of any of the covenants therein contained, to immediately re-enter and repossess the premises.</p>
