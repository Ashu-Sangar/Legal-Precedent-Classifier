Leisenring in a sum exceeding $6,000, took out a policy of insurance on his debtor’s life, in the defendant company, for the sum of $6,000. The annual premium was $153.90. Jacob Riegel died on Jan. 4, 1880, and after his death the premiums continued to be paid by his administratrix, the present plaintiff, until April, 1889. Leisenring, the debtor, on whose life the policy was taken out, left Philadelphia in 1876, after which his whereabouts were unknown to the plaintiff, but the defendant appears to have learned that he was living in Texas not long before the exchange of policies.</p>

The policy being the last asset of the estate left undistributed, it was troublesome to apportion the annual premiums among the numerous representatives of the estate. The plaintiff therefore dispatched her agent, Thomas J. Roche, to the office of the company, to surrender the six thousand dol<a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>lar policy, and take out a paid-up policy. She gave him no authority to deal with the company on the basis that Leisenring was dead, or might be dead. Roche visited the office of the defendant, and inquired of a clerk what sized paid-up policy would be given for the six thousand dollar policy, which he showed the clerk. The latter figured on it and answered, $2,500. Roche said he would report to Mrs. Riegel, and left, taking the six thousand dollar policy away with him. There was no further conversation than the above, and no discussion whatever as to Leisenring being alive or dead. A few days later on Roche called again at the company’s office and announced that Mrs. Riegel would take the twenty-five hundred dollar paid-up policy, and thereupon the exchange of policies was made. At the time of this exchange, Mrs. Riegel supposed Leisenring to be alive. She says, ‘ We never made any efforts to find him; we supposed him living.’ This is evidently so, for she continued to pay the premiums yearly up to the time of the exchange of the policies; and it is not alleged, and no proof is offered by the defendant, that she ever demanded the payment of the six thousand dollar policy, which she would certainly have done had she believed Leisenring to be dead.</p>

I do not think they would accept them if he was dead.’ She seems to have had the idea many persons, even more experienced in business than Mrs. Riegel have, that the insurance company keeps track of all persons whose lives are insured. Her agent, Roche, had the same idea, for just after the formal exchange of policies, and at the same interview, he asked the clerk or officer of the company ‘if he knew of Leisenring’s present whereabouts; ’ the clerk replied, ‘ No, but the last we heard of him he was in Texas.’ Both interviews of Roche were with one of the clerks or subordinate officers, and at neither was there any doubt expressed about Leisenring being alive, nor was any question of making a settlement of any claim which Mrs. Riegel had or might have against the insurance company, by reason of his being then dead. It was the usual transaction of exchanging an ordinary policy for a paid-up policy of proper value. The fact was established by the de<a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>fendant company’s consulting actuary, that a paid-up policy for twenty-five hundred dollars would have been substantially the amount of paid-up insurance to which Mrs. Riegel would have been entitled, or which ordinarily would have been issued, if the insured had been known to have been alive at the time of the exchange.</p>

The bill set forth that ‘ Leisenring, on whose life the policy was taken out, left Philadelphia in 1876, after which his whereabouts became unknown. The payment of the annual premiums having become burdensome to the plaintiff, and the fact being unknown whether Leisenring was living or dead, the plaintiff, on March 20,1889, made an agreement with the defendants, whereby the original policy was surrendered by her, and the company, in consideration thereof, issued to her in lieu thereof a paid-up policy for $2,500. Some time after this it was ascertained by the plaintiff that Leisenring had died on or about March 10, 1889, before the new agreement had been made or the new policy issued, and the plaintiff therefore prayed to have the old policy reinstated.’</p>

We were unable to acquiesce in that view of the law, and gave judgment for the defendants on the demurrer. Our reasons for <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>doing so are fully stated in <a href="/citations/?q=140%20Pa.%20195" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="140 Pa. 195">140 Pa. 195</a>. Afterwards, when the case came into the Supreme Court upon appeal from our decree, the plaintiff’s counsel, seeing, apparently, the defective character of their case, adroitly filed at the bar of that court, before proceeding with the argument, an amendment of their bill, in which amendment they made the averment that ‘ the parties acted in respect to the transaction on the basis that the said Leisenring was still alive ’ (<a href="/citations/?q=140%20Pa.%20201" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="140 Pa. 201">140 Pa. 201</a>). In the opinion of the Supreme Court much stress is laid upon the fact that the defendants had not filed any answer to the averment contained in the amendment filed at bar, and that, therefore, the argument being upon the demurrer, the fact averred in the amendment must be taken as admitted, and for this reversed the decree below, the court saying at the same time: ‘ This case goes back to enable the defendants to take defence upon the merits.’ If the defendants, when the amendment was filed at the bar of the Supreme Court, instead of proceeding with the argument, had withdrawn their demurrer and put in an answer denying the fact averred in the amendment to the bill then made, the case must necessarily have been sent back without argument to this court in order to determine the issue of fact thus raised. But the argument before the Supreme Court went on without any answer being put in to the amended bill, and thus it happened that the demurrer argued in the Supreme Court was a different demurrer from the one argued here, and that judgment was rendered in the Supreme Court upon pleadings which had never been seen by this court.</p>

After the most careful examination of the evidence thus taken, we are of the opinion that the plaintiff has altogether failed to make good her declaration that the agreement, whereby the first policy was surrendered and the new one issued, was made under any mutual mistake of facts by the parties. The plaintiff herself being examined, admitted that, having no knowledge whatever as to the fact whether Leisenring was alive or dead, she could not have acted under any mistake of fact in regard to it when she asked to have the old policy exchanged for a new paid-up one. All the evidence shows that both parties were equally ignorant and equally in doubt upon the subject of Leisenring being alive or dead; that both acted in view of that doubt, and came to an agreement which was at the time entirely satisfactory to both. The defendants possessed no information which the plaintiff did not possess. They held out no inducement to the plaintiff to abrogate the old contract and enter into a new one. The proposition originated with her, and was agreed to only at her request. And she voluntarily released the company from the first contract for the purpose of obtaining one which, at that time, she conceived to be more advantageous to herself. [The case, therefore, falls, as we said in our former opinion, directly within the decision in Perkins v. Gay, 3 S. &amp; R. 331, that where the parties treat upon the basis that the fact which is the subject of agreement is doubtful, the contract is to be held valid,] [2] there being no concealment or unfair dealing. So far as we can see, there was no evidence whatever before the master to show that the new contract was founded upon any mutual mistake of the parties whatever. At the time of the substitution of the new contract for the old one not one word was said, on either side, in regard to Leisenring being alive or dead, or the probability of either event. Both parties considered the new contract advantageous. She rid herself of the burden of future premiums. The defendants diminished the <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>amount of the insurance by surrendering the future premiums. Both were willing -to take their chances with the doubts surrounding the facts. [The new contract was not a contract induced by a mutual mistake about the facts, but a contract made in view of doubtful facts, and because of the doubtful facts.] [3]</p>

The master has proceeded in his report upon the theory that the burden was upon the defendants to sustain the answer. On the contrary, the burden was upon the plaintiff to overthrow the answer, and that she has wholly and signally failed to do. The fact found by the master that the parties dealt, at the time of the new agreement entered into, on the basis that Leisenring was then alive, is not supported by any adequate evidence. It is denied by the answer, and the answer has not been overthrown by any adequate proof whatever, for it does not matter at all that the plaintiff now says that she supposed at the time of the new contract that Leisenring was alive. That does not prove any mutual mistake of the parties. She admits that she had no knowledge whatever upon the subject, and that therefore she could not have acted under any. The fact is, as is shown by all the evidence, that both parties acted in perfect good faith; that both were equally ignorant of the facts, and that the contract for a new paid-up policy and the surrender of the old one was deliberately and fairly entered into by both parties, and in full view of all contingencies which might subsequently appear. Under such circumstances a contract deliberately and fairly entered into ought not to be ripped to pieces and blown away under the pretence of an equity which does not exist.

The amount of the paid-up insurance issued is exactly the amount that would have been issued if Leisenring was alive. The conclusion is imperative that the company acted on the basis that he was alive; otherwise, if there was doubt in the minds of the parties, or in the mind of the insurance company, the amount of the paid-up insurance issued would have been in excess of the usual amount, so as to produce a consideration for the settlement of the doubtful right.

The officers of the insurance company, who were cognizankof those transactions, were the proper persons to deny, if they could of their own knowledge, the averments of the bill, and thus make the answer responsive.

That clearly appears in the opinion, wherein, after reciting the facts averred in the bill, it is said :</p>
    <p id="b169-3" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[218,726,1164,1517]]]'>“ The case presented on these facts was that of a contract entered into under the influence of a mutual mistake, and a claim for relief from such contract. The mistake was in relation to the fact of Leisenring’s death. Both parties evidently supposed and acted on the supposition, that he was alive, and that the annual premiums upon his life, which had become burdensome to Mrs. Riegel, must be continued indefinitely until his death should take place. As it had become difficult for her to pay these premiums, the only way in which she could be relieved from them was to surrender her policy and accept a paid-up policy for such smaller sum as the premiums already paid would purchase. Rather than take the risk of losing the entire amount of the policy, by her inability to keep up the annual payments, she surrendered her policy for six thousand dollars and accepted in lieu of it a paid-up policy for two thousand five hundred dollars. This was the contract she made while in ignorance of Leisenring’s death. At the time she made it she was already relieved from the burdensome premiums, and the entire amount of the policy was honestly due her from the company. What was the effect of the mistake upon her ? Simply to take from her the difference between the two policies and give her absolutely nothing for it. She surrendered a policy for six thousand dollars, on which the liability of the company was already fixed, and received one for two thousand five hundred dollars to secure relief from a burden already removed. The company parted with nothing. She secured nothing. The whole transaction was a mistake, and, if the decree of the court stands, the result will be to take three thousand five hundred dollars from Mrs. Riegel and give it to the insurance company.</p>

He treats the arrangement made between Mrs. Riegel and the company on the 20th of March as a compromise of a claim against the company for the alleged death of Leisenring, which Mrs. Riegel was unable to establish, because unable to show the death. As the fact of the death, and the consequent liability of the company on the policy, were uncertain, it was a case for the application of the doctrine that the adjustment of a doubtful claim constituted a valid consideration for the surrender of the policy, and the acceptance of the new one, and upon this theory the decree was entered. But it nowhere appears that Mrs. Riegel made any claim on the company, or supposed that she had any. She was asking relief from future payments of premiums on a policy on which she supposed future payments would have to be made, and to get this relief she was willing to sacrifice more than one half of the sum insured. The company was willing, in consideration of the large reduction of its liability, to give her a policy for what her payments would purchase, and relieve her in future. This is an exchange often made, and adjusted by well settled rules. It was a compromise of nothing. We do not doubt the correctness of the rule applied by the learned judge in cases to which it is fairly applicable, but this is not one of them. The plaintiff distinctly avers that she did not know of the death of Leisenring until some ten days after the exchange of policies was effected, and that ‘ both parties to the transaction were acting, in respect thereto, on the basis that Leisenring was alive.’ She distinctly avers that the object of the arrangement was to secure relief for herself from the indefinite payment of premiums that had become burdensome to her, that the new policy was accepted for that reason, and the old one surrendered, at a time when, had she known the fact, she was entitled to demand the entire sum upon which she had so long and so steadily paid the burdensome premiums.”</p>

    <p id="b171-3" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[218,769,1161,1567]]]'>Sufficient reference to those principles is made in our former opinion; but it may not be amiss to revert to some of them. The general rule is that an act done or a contract made, under a mistake of a material fact, is voidable and relievable in equity. The fact must, of course, be material to the act or contract; for though there may be an accidental mistake or ignorance of the fact, yet, if the act or contract is not materially affected by it, relief will not be granted. Thus, A. buys from B. an estate to which the latter is supposed to have an unquestionable title. It turns out, upon due investigation of the facts — unknown at the time to both parties — that B. has no title (as if there be a nearer heir than B., who was supposed to be dead but is, in fact, living) ; in such a case equity would relieve the purchaser and rescind the contract. But, suppose A. buys from B. an estate the location of which was well known to each of them, and they mutually believed it contained twenty acres, when in fact it contained only nineteen and three quarter acres, and the difference would not have varied the purchase in the view of either party; in such a ease the mistake would not be ground for rescission of the contract: 1 Story’s Eq. Jur. §§ 140, 141. It makes no difference in application of the principle, that the subject-matter of the contract be known to both parties to be liable to a contingency which may destroy it immediately; for if the contingency has — unknown to the parties — already happened, the contract will be avoided as founded on a mutual mistake of a matter constituting the basis of the contract: 1 Story’s Eq. Jur. §§ 143 <em>a </em>and 143 <em>b. </em>The principle is illustrated by familiar examples, employed by text writers, thus: A. agrees to buy a certain horse from B. It turns out that the horse is dead at the time of the bargain, though neither party was then aware of the fact. The agreement is void.</p>

The house was <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>previously destroyed by fire, but the parties dealt in ignorance of that fact. The contract, not being for sale of the land on which the house stood, was not enforceable. So, too, A., being entitled to an estate for the life of B., agreed to sell it to C. B. was dead, but both parties were ignorant of the fact. The agreement was avoided.</p>

Merchants Life Assurance Society, 3 C. B., N. S. 622.</p>
    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[262,1135,1170,702]]]'>Mr. Pollock, in his excellent treatise on the “Principles of Contract,” *441, states the general principle thus: “ An agreement is. void if it relates to a subject-matter (whether a material subject of ownership or a particular title or right) contemplated by the parties as existing, but which in fact did not exist.” This is followed by an interesting discussion of the subject, with numerous illustrations of the principles involved. See Cochrane v. Willis, 1 Ch. 58; Allen v. Hammond, 11 Peters, 71; Hitchcock v. Giddings, 4 Price, 135; Hore v. Becher, 12 Simons, 465; Couturier v. Hastie, 5 H. L. C. 673.

Their every act in the transaction was predicated of that as an assumed fact. The new policy like the old one was a risk on a life assumed to be then in being. The difference between them was that the one carried with it an obligation on the part of the holder to pay annual premiums during the life of Leisenring; the other exempted her from that obligation. She purchased that exemption by surrendering seven twelfths of the original insurance, or §3,500. If the exchange was not made on the assumption by both parties that Leisenring was <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>then alive, the company stultified itself by issuing a paid-up policy on the life of one who was then in his grave; and the plaintiff was guilty of the supreme folly of paying $3,500 for exemption from liability which, by the previous death of Leisenring, had ipso facto ceased. In other words, at the time the exchange of policies was made, the plaintiff had a perfectly valid claim upon the defendant for the full amount of the insurance, $6,000, and surrendered $3,500 of that to secure exemption from a liability that had ceased to exist; but she and the company were both at that time ignorant of the fact that the life, on which the original risk was taken, had previously dropped. The supposed element of doubt as to whether Leisenring was then dead or not never entered into the contemplation of either party; nor did it form any part of the consideration for exchange of policies. The positive and uncontradicted proof by the actuary of the company was that the amount of the paid-up policy was ascertained and fixed, according to the established rules of the company, at the very sum that would have been required if Leisenring had been personally present in the office when the terms of exchange were settled. The central fact, underlying the transaction and to which every circumstance connected therewith clearly points, was the assumption by both parties that Leisenring was then in full life. When last, theretofore, heard from he was alive, and the presumption was that he continued to live. In the absence of any knowledge to the contrary, it was quite natural and reasonable that the parties, in making the exchange, should act upon that presumption and assume, as they evidently did, that he was still alive. Of course, they could not know positively that he was then alive, any more than any one can certainly know that a friend from whom he is far separated by distance is now living. In view of the undisputed facts as to the acts of both parties, and everything connected with the transaction, it would be wholly unreasonable and unwarranted to hold that the parties treated upon the basis that the fact which was the subject of their agreement was doubtful, or that the contract was made “ in view of doubtful facts and because of the doubtful facts.” In the light of the proofs, upon which the findings of the master are based, and of all the circumstances, the acts of the parties are not susceptible of any such construction as has <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>been put upon them by the learned judge of the common pleas. In short, the facts, established by the uncontradicted proofs and found by the master, are essentially the same as those admitted by the demurrer and upon which our former decree was based. Certainly they are not less favorable to the plaintiff now than then. It therefore appears to us that a proper consideration of the orderly administration of justice should have resulted in a decree in accordance with the views expressed in our former opinion.</p>
