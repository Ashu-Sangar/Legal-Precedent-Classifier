Hays died in 1878, testate, leaving a large estate, both realty and personalty. He bequeathed to his grandchildren, legacies amounting to $45,000, all payable in future, with interest in the meantime. The balance of his estate he devised to his five children, William B., Jr., Lida C., Curtis H., Maggie H. and Mary Eva Hays, and directed that the share of Wm. B. Hays, Jr., in the real estate be charged with and made subject to the payment to the estate by him of $40,000 capital of testator in the firm of Wm. B. Hays &amp; Co. The capital was to be retained by Wm. B. Hays, Jr., for five years, he paying interest at six per cent. The firm consisted of the testator and Wm. B. Hays, Jr. A. H. Miller and W. B. Hays, Jr., were named as executors, and the latter became acting executor. In 1876 Curtis H. Hays conveyed his interest in the estate to William B. Hays, Jr., and in 1879 partition of the real estate was made into five purparts, one of which was allotted to Wm. B. Hays, Jr., in his own right, and one in right of Curtis H. Hays, and one purpart was allotted to each daughter. At that time there was ample personal estate for the payment of all debts and legacies and a large surplus for distribution among the residuary devisees. Under the administration of Wm. B. Hays, Jr., however, the personal estate was dissipated and lost. The executor him<a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>self became insolvent and was discharged from his trust. Letters of adminstration c. t. a. were then issued by the register to W. N. Riddle, and the orphans’ court appointed W. A. Lewis trustee to collect and manage the legacies of $45,000 to grandchildren.</p>

Circuit Court on its mortgage, issued execution and exposed both purparts to marshal’s sale. Some time before the advertised day of sale, Lewis, the trustee, representing the $45,000 legacies, requested Riddle, the administrator, to join with him in his efforts to procure a favorable sale of the property in order that a sufficient fund might be raised for the payment of the legacies. This Riddle declined to do, stating, in effect, that his counsel had advised him that the legacies and charges under the will would not be discharged or affected by the marshal’s sale; that this advice agreed with the advice of the private counsel for the appellants; and that in so far as he, the administrator of the estate, was concerned, he would pay no attention to the sale. Lewis, then retained counsel, who coincided in his view of the case.</p>

Hays intended his grandchildren, represented by this petitioner, should receive legacies amounting to $45,000 out of his estate, and it is conceded that these legacies were charged on his lands. The question now presented is whether or not these legacies shall be paid without deduction for cost of administration. Had there been a personal fund brought into this court for distribution there can be no doubt but these legatees would have had a right to demand and receive the amount without deduction. And there is no reason why a different rule should prevail in respect of payment out of the <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>real estate. The whole, real as well as personal, was made assets for payment, and the interest of respondents was simply residuary. It is obviously immaterial how the amount was realized — whether through the executors or at the suit of a stranger — the legatees were entitled to the whole amount specified in the will, and the cost of realizing was simply part of the cost of administration for which the residuary estate was primarily liable.</p>

Without his suggestion there would probably have been no fund realized from the marshal’s sale of W. B. Hays, Jr.’s interest, and the whole burden of payment of these legacies have been thrown upon respondents’ lauds to their serious loss. It is conceded that this suggestion was beneficial to respondents; but it is insisted that when the administrator c. t. a. had been brought to act in accordance with it, the trustee’s duty was done. Suppose the trustee had taken no further action and the administrator had received the whole fund, the cost of recovery must have been correspondingly increased and paid out of the fund, and the net proceeds on account must have passed into the trustee’s hands as a credit on the legacies. But the court by its decree gave the administrator only half of the fund, and it must be conclusively presumed here that he was entitled to no more. The right to the other half was claimed by the individual mortgage creditors of Wm. B. Hays Jr., but the decree of the court justified the action of the trustee in continuing in the contest. So long as the*fund reached this petitioner it was practically immaterial to the respondents by which course; the cost would have been about the same by either. The trustee need not have entered the contest. The purpose of the notice given by respondents must have been to preserve their equity against Wm. B. Hays, Jr., on account- of his devastavit. But the waste of the personal estate had not affected the lien of the legacies, and he might well have waived claim on this fund and looked to the personal liability and lands of these respondents as residuary devisees of Wm. B. Hays, deceased. They were alike his debtors; the contest was theirs, and having successfully claimed the fund in their relief they should pay the cost. There is no principle better established or more just <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>than that those who receive a benefit must bear the incidental burthens: Shaffer v.
