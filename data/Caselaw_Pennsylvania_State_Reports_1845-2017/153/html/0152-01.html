Taking that definition, you Avill consider the testimony in this case. In the first place, public carriers of passengers are bound to provide reasonably safe means of entering upon and egress from their cars. They are bound to give the passengers whom they invite to their vehicles a reasonably safe mode of entering. They are bound to take reasonable care of passengers after they have entered, and, therefore, they are bound to give them a reasonable opportunity, not only to get upon the platform, but to get into and take care of themselves in the car. That is the extent of their duty; and the question whether or not in this case the driver of this car — for Avhom the company is responsible — did take reasonable and proper care, must depend altogether on the circumstances. . . .</p>

The only difference, as I see it, is that this may have some bearing upon your view of whether or not the driver had done his whole duty, because if the old lady had gotten in and the daughter had gotten in and the driver had closed the door, he might readily presume that the ladies had taken care of themselves before he started; Avhereas, if she had not gotten in, if he did not wait until Mrs. Vance got off the platform, it might indicate something else to your minds. I merely call your attention to this, because I believe that is the turning point of this case, <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>to a certain extent, aside from another question, which I will suggest, and that is this: The driver says that he started the horses off on a slow walk, whereas Mrs. Holmes and Mrs. Vance say that he started them with a jerk. That might have some bearing on the question of his care in view of the age of this lady. You will take into consideration her age, because, as I said, the driver of a car was bound to take more care of an old person or a young feeble person than he is of a person in full vigor, for the reason that they can take belter care of themselves. If you find that this car was started without pi'oper caution on the part of the driver, in view of the age of this lady, then you should find for the plaintiff. If you find that he did all that a reasonably prudent and cautious man would have done, and if it was a mere accident, then you would find for the defendant.”] [7]</p>
