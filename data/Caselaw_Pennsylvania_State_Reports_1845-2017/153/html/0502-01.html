The court affirmed a point presented by defendant to the effect that the sale of such tickets to members of the club was not an infraction of the law. In the general chai'ge the court said: “ The defendant could <em>not sell to </em>persons not members of the society; if he sold to them he is liable, for it is his business to know whether the person is entitled to buy.” <em>Held, </em>that there was no inconsistency between the charge and the answer to the point, and that a judgment on a verdict against the defendant should be sustained.</p>

The society has a membership of six or seven hundred. The lease stipulated that the picnic grounds for the <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>day should be under the possession and control of the organization.</p>

They had no badges, but when they came to the gate they declared they belonged to the party, or at least said they came from Philadelphia, and produced their return coupon of the railroad ticket.

The proceeds of the sale of these tickets went into the treasury of the society, and the beer was sold according to the testimony of the president at a profit. The money realized at these picuies over and above expenses went into the treasury and helped to maintain the society. Teachers were employed at its rooms in Philadelphia at considerable expense. We do not think it necessary to decide whether such a sale to a member constitutes a violation of the law, but for the purposes of this ease we charge you that a sale to members is not a violation. [If you believe the evidence then there were sales to persons other than members and such sales clearly constitute a violation of the law.] [6]</p>

When he undertakes to sell to a particular class he must see that he does not sell to a prohibited class. A licensed dealer is liable if he sells to a minor, although at the time of such sale he may think the person of full age. A dealer is liable to punishment if he sells to a person of known intemperate habits; although he may not know of such habits, it is his business to know if he has such a reputation in the neighborhood. So here the defendant could not sell to persons not members of the society. If he sold to them he is liable, for it is his business to know whether the person is entitled to buy.] [1]</p>

The point asserted that the uncontradicted evidence established certain facts, viz.: that the defendant was a member of the Germania Turnverein ; that this society was organized in good faith and for certain lawful purposes, and was the owner of a valuable club house ; that it was holding its annual picnic on Sunday, May 29, 1892, in Montgomery county; and that the act of the defendant was the sale of tickets on that day to fellow members which were to be used in payment for meals, for lager beer, or for admission to the games and amusements on the ground. Upon these facts it asked the court to say as matter of law that the sale of the tickets was not an infraction of the law and that the verdict of the jury should be “ not guilty.” The learned judge affirmed this point. But the commonwealth alleged that the defendant sold these tickets to persons who were not members of the society, and it was for this that his conviction was asked. This was the controverted question of fact upon which evidence was given by both parties, and to which it was the duty of the learned judge to direct the attention of the jury. He said: “ When the defendant undertakes <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>to sell to a particular class, he must see that he does not sell to a prohibited class; ” and then, after calling attention to restrictions placed by the law upon licensed dealers, he added: “ So here, the defendant could not sell to persons not members of the society; if he sold to them he is liable, for it is his business to know whether the person is entitled to buy.” This instruction is clearly right. It would have been better if the learned judge had qualified his affirmance of the point by calling the attention of the jury directly to this disputed question, but the defendant cannot complain that he did not. By so much as the unqualified affirmance imported beyond the rule laid down in the general charge, it was more favorable to the defendant than he had a right to ask. The error, if any, was in his favor and he was not injured by it.</p>
    <p id="b531-3" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[214,1080,1176,559]]]'>We do not consider the question of the right of a society to sell liquors to its members at a profit, for it is not raised on this record. The defendant’s case was submitted to the jury upon a single question of fact: Did he sell the tickets exchangeable for beer, among other things, to persons who were not members of the Germania Turnverein ? If he did, the jury was told that he might properly be convicted. If he did not, they were plainly instructed that their verdict should be one of not guilty. Upon this question their finding was against the defendant. The verdict convicts him not of selling to his fellow members but of selling to other persons.</p>
