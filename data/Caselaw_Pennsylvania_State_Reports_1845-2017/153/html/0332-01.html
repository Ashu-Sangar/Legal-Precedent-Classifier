But real estate may become an article of trade to be bought and sold like any other commodity. When this is done by an individual in his own name his purchases have all the ordinary incidents connected with the ownership of land. When it is done by a copartnership the artificial person owns the land as it would own the stock of goods bought for a firm, and the interest of the individual partners is in the net profits made in the business. For this reason a purchaser of the interest of one partner, in a firm of which he is a member, takes no part of the partnership property in kind, but only the proportionate share in the fund or property remaining after the business is closed and settled: Seibert v. Seibert, 1 Brewster, 531. And a purchaser at sheriff’s sale stands on no higher ground. One who buys at sheriff’s sale the interest of a partner buys only a right to require an account and a distributive share in the surplus, if there be any: Smith v.

The rule laid down in that case is a sound one. Its application is not to be confined to cases which present all the facts, and in the same mariner, as were found in that ease. On the other hand it is a rule of general application, where a trading company, whether incorporated or unincorporated, engages in the business of buying and selling land for profit just as well as where <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>the commodity dealt in is dry goods, or agricultural implements or live stock. The company owps its stock in trade. The members are entitled to share in the profits of the business while it lasts, and to a share in what is left after dissolution and payment of debts. The profits are income. A division of assets after dissolution is a return of capital, at least to the extent of the original investment.</p>

The titles were not made to the members of the association as tenants in common, but to the trustees who conducted by themselves or agents the business of making sales, executing and delivering deeds to purchasers, collecting purchase money, and doing such acts on behalf of their principal, the land company, as the nature of the business required. They rendered an account at stated or other intervals to the association of their receipts and disburse ments, and from the moneys made from sales or rents dividends were from time to time declared and paid. The evidence shows that the capital orginally invested has not been impaired. These dividends therefore represent the profits realized from the business done by the association in the line of trade for which it was organized and in which it has been engaged. As between the life tenant and the remainder-man the money so realized is income derived from the investment made in the capital of the unincorporated association, bearing the name of the Dennison Land Company. The capital itself belongs to the remainder-man, but the income cannot be distinguished from that-derived from an investment in ground rents or interest-bearing bonds.</p>

It is rather an opportunity to invest mouey in a new enterprise which originated with the stockholders in the Bell’s Gap Road, and which they limited to themselves. The whole arrangement was a gross violation of law, but it promised to bring gain to those who held the privilege of subscribing, and this promise or prospect was what gave value to the privilege. It was not money in hand but in the prospective, for if the new road could survive under its double load, the bondholders would have a good six per cent investment for <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>tbeir money, and they would also have the value that the stock might reach without paying anything for it. This gain when realized by the subscribers to the bonds of the Clearfield and Jefferson road is not income from the stock of the Bell’s Gap, nor is the price at which the prospect of realizing it was sold.</p>
