The train consisted of a number of cars, and was about one hundred and sixty feet long. In the southeast corner made by the intersection of the highway and the railroad was an engine house extending in length along the railroad fifty-eight feet, and along the highway twenty feet. From fifty to seventy feet south of the engine house on the east side of the railroad some works began called “ high works,” which some of the witnesses testified obstructed the view of the track from the middle of the bridge. Both plaintiff and her husband testified that when they stopped they saw no cars. Plaintiff’s husband testified that between the engine house and the high works he could see down the track for about sixty rods. Defendant’s witnesses denied this. From the middle of the bridge, the engine house partly obstructed the view of the track for about seventy-four feet. There was evidence that no signal was given as the train backed to the crossing. <em>Held, </em>that the case was a proper one to submit to the jury,</p>

J., it appeared that, on July 5, 1889, plaintiff and her husband were driving in an open market wagon along a public road, and that at a point in the middle of a bridge over a canal at a distance of about one hundred and thirty feet from defendant’s railroad, they stopped, looked and listened, and then drove on and their wagon was run into by a train of empty coal cars backing from the south. The train consisted of from ten to fourteen cars and was one hundred and sixty feet long. In the southeast corner, made by the intersection of the public road and the railroad, was an engine house extending in length along the railroad fifty-eight <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>feet, and along the public road twenty feet. To the south of the engine house from fifty to seventy feet were some works called “ high works,” which some of the witnesses testified obstructed the view of the track from the middle of the bridge. Plaintiff’s husband testified that between the engine house and the high works he could see down the track for about sixty rods. Defendant’s witnesses denied this. From the middle of the bridge the engine house partly obstructed the view of the «track for about seventy-four feet. Both plaintiff and her husband testified that when they stopped they saw no cars. There was evidence that no signal was given as the train backed to the crossing. The head of plaintiff’s horse was just over the nearest rail when the train came up the track. The horse threw back his head, turned in the direction in which the cars were going, ran around the end of the train, crossing the track ahead of it, and bringing the wagon and its occupants across the track uninjured by the cars. The train stopped on the crossing, the first two cars extending beyond it. The horse, having become frightened, ran away, and plaintiff was thrown out and injured.</p>

It having been shown by abundant and undisputed testimony on the part of both plaintiff and defendant that the train which approached the crossing at the time of the accident was made up of from ten to fourteen cars, the total length of which, together with the engine and tender attached, was not less than one hundred and sixty feet, and it having been shown by undisputed testimony that from the middle of the bridge, where plaintiff claims to have looked, the engine house obstructed only seventy-four feet of the track from view, it was therefore a physical impossibility for plaintiff not to have seen the approaching train if she had looked'properly. That, under those circumstances, she requested her husband to drive on, and attempted to cross the tracks, was contributory negligence on her part, and she cannot recover. <em>Answer: </em>This comes down to a very close question in this case, and one to which we have given careful attention, and we are impressed with the belief that it still remains a question for the jury. The case is not so free from doubt that the court can affirm the proposition of the defendant in this case. Perhaps if we hud <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>evidence that was precise as to the exact time when that train started we might be able to rule upon this question as a question of law. But we are not so satisfied from our recollection of the evidence that we can say to you as a matter of law that she was negligent in not having seen the approaching train under the circumstances.” [1]</p>

If, as is shown by undisputed testimony, it was a physical impossibility for the engine house to have shut out the view of the entire train at any time during its approach to the crossing, from a person anywhere on the bridge, the plaintiff and her husband are guilty of contributory negligence in driving to the crossing as they did, and she cannot recover. <em>Answer : </em>If this means to ask us to say as matter of law that it was such a physical impossibility, we cannot affirm it. If it means, and so we understand it to mean, that if you find that it was a physical impossibility for her not to see this train moving if she looked, we think the point is well taken. As we read the point, we think it asks us to say that it is shown by the undisputed testimony that it was a physical impossibility, and we decline to say that.

Such conduct was contributory negligence, and she cannot recover. <em>Answer: </em>This, again, asks us to take this case away from you and settle all these questions. That is the trouble with many of these points. While there is much in them that we would affirm, they end by asking us to say that the plaintiff cannot recover, and we think there are some things in this case that are not so clear that the court can decide them as a matter of law. If the plaintiff stopped and looked and listened at the point where she says she did, did she see the train ? If she saw that train moving towards the crossing, she had no right to proceed towards that crossing, and if she did so proceed, seeing the train when she stopped and looked and listened, she could not recover, because it was negligence on her part.” [3]</p>

Plaintiff says she kept looking up and down the track all the way from the middle of the bridge until they reached the end of the bridge, from which point on to the crossing the the engine house obscured her view. There is no allegation that she could not see as far down the track at any point between the middle and west end of the bridge as she could at the middle; no allegation that her view of the track was in any way obscured until it was obscured by tlie engine house ¡vítor she left the west end of the bridge. The track must have been practically straight, as was afterward shown by defendant’s maps and evidence, or plaintiff’s husband could not have seen down it for a distance of a thousand feet while at a point only one hundred and fifteen feet from the crossing. Certainly plaintiff must have been able, under these circumstances, to see down the track to approximately the same distance while she was passing through the sixty-five feet from the middle to the west end of the bridge. If no cars were in sight when she looked down the track from the west end of the bridge, then while she was passing through the remaining fifty feet to the crossing the train must have come up through the 1000 feet of track below the engine house and the eighty-six feet of track obscured by the engine house in order to meet them at the crossing. Suppose the horse walked at the slowest supposable gait, three miles an hour. Calling it an even thousand feet through which the train had to pass, it must have moved twenty times as fast as the horse, that is at the rate of 60 miles an hour. Now consider that this locomotive was pushing a train of empty coal ears ahead of it; that when it reached the crossing the train was going so slowly that plaintiff’s horse <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>was able to run alongside of it for a few feet, outrun it and cross the track ahead of it, taking the wagon and occupants with him, and that the train stopped on the crossing with only-two cars the other side of the crossing, and it is at once seen to be a flat absurdity to suppose that this train came up at the rate of a mile a minute.</p>

It appears that forty-two points for charge —fourteen by plaintiff and twice that number by defendant— were presented and fully answered by the learned president of the court. In the main, his answers appear to have been satisfactory to both parties, for tbe only subjects of complaint here are bis refusal to affirm defendant’s nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-third and twenty-eighth points, respectively, as presented. In the latter he was requested to charge: “ Under all the evidence in this case the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant.” This he very properly refused to do, for the very good reason that the evidence tended strongly to <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>show that defendant’s negligence caused the injury complained of, and there was no admitted or undisputed fact or facts in the case that would have justified him in declaring, as matter of law, that plaintiff was guilty of any negligence that contributed to her injury.
