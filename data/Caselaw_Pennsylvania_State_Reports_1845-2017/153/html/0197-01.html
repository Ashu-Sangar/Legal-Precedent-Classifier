Defendants executed orders for Bodmer for the purchase and sale of stocks on the Philadelphia and Now York Stock Exchanges, dividing the commissions when the rules did not forbid. There was a private wire between the two offices, which was used in sending quotations and orders. Plaintiff employed Bodmer to purchase through defendants some stock and bonds which were paid for by plaintiff’s check to defendants, and the stock and bonds were sent to Wilkes-Barre. Subsequently plaintiff gave a similar order to Bodmer for other securities, who transmitted it to defendants, sending also the first securities, to which were attached blank transfers signed by plaintiff. These securities were to be held by defendants to secure part of the purchase money on the new order. Defendants credited them in a general account with Bodmer. Before the purchase money had been fully paid, defendants failed, and the securities were subsequently sold by them or their receiver. <em>Held, </em>in an action for a wrongful conversion of the securities, that there was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury to determine whether defendants had sufficient notice of the real ownership of the securities.</p>

Henry Bodmer, who, although not a party of record, was an active party in the transactions resulting in this litigation, is a stockbroker with an office at Wilkes-Barre. Bodmer and defendants were correspondents in the stockbroking business; they executed his orders for the purchase and sale of stocks on both the Philadelphia and New York stock exchanges ; when the rules of either exchange did not forbid, they divided commissions; when they did, Bodmer charged the customer an additional percentage for his compensation. There was a private wire between the two offices, and over this quotations were received by Bodmer, and orders sent by him to Gerlach &amp; Harjes.</p>
    <p id="b226-6" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[243,1187,1176,500]]]'>On the 81st of May, 1889, Ryman, through Bodmer, ordered the purchase of 100 shares Texas Pacific Railroad stock; it was bought for him by defendants, the certificates made out in his —Ryman’s—name, transmitted to Bodmer and by him delivered to Ryman, who then delivered his check for the price, two thousand one hundred and sixty-eight dollars and seventy-five cents (12,168.75), payable to the order of Gerlach &amp; Harjes, to Bodmer, who transmitted it to them. This check included the commissions of both brokers, and the money was received •on it by defendants.</p>

Y., Susquehanna &amp; Western Railroad stock. After the delivery of this last stock, in November, 1890, Ryman wanted to buy Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe stocks; he proposed to Bodmer that a purchase he made of the Atchison stock, to be carried for him until the following 1st of January by Bodmer, he to secure Bodmer by a deposit, as collateral, of the 200 shares of the stocks first bought, Ryman to pay for the stock so purchased on January 1st, and lift the collateral. This was satisfactory to Bodmer, and agreed to by him; at the time the agreement was had, it was understood between them that the order was to be executed through Gerlach &amp; Harjes; Ryman asked Bodmer if they transacted a legitimate business; Bod<a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>mer assured him they did no other kind of business. Under this arrangement a purchase of 50 shares of Atchison stock was made, and ten thousand dollars ($10,000) of Atchison income bonds; there were some sales and purchases of the last named securities to get them, according to Hyman’s testimony, at a lower price, but, he avers, always for actual delivery and not as a wagering transaction.</p>
    <p id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[215,741,1166,910]]]'>So far as appears from the evidence the Texas Pacific, New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western, and the Atchison stock and bonds remained in possession of Gerlach &amp; Harjes at Philadelphia up to 30th of December, 1889, when they failed in business, and these stocks, without notice to either Bodmer or Ryman, were sold by defendants or their receiver, and the proceeds credited to Bodmer, with whom alone they had any account. It appeared as a fact at the trial, that not only Ryman’s stocks, but those of all others who did business through Bodmer, were entered on the books of defendants as Bodmer’s, and treated as his by them. Ryman, after the failure of Gerlach &amp; Harjes, wrote to them inquiring about his securities, but received no answer; in April following he came to Philadelphia and saw Harjes, one of the partners, and offered to pay for the Atchison stock and bonds and take up the collateral, but Harjes said the account was kept with Bodmer alone, and without his authority he would have no communication with Ryman in regard to the matter.</p>
    <p id="b227-6" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[216,1658,1163,352]]]'>We have stated the facts as alleged by Ryman; some of them are denied by defendants, but there was evidence tending to establish them, and from which the jury might have found them.

But Bodmer had mixed them with other securities of other customers, and deposited the whole with defendants to his individual credit; on the two hundred shares deposited there was a transfer in blank on the certificates. While this would not affect his right against Bodmer, it did estop him from asserting his claim as against purchasers without notice.</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[261,795,1170,145]]]'>As to the Atchison securities, there had never been an actual delivery; they were purchased on the order of Bodmer by defendants on the deposit of the other 200 shares.</p>
    <p id="b228-6" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[258,948,1173,1366]]]'>If Bodmer had placed these stocks to his individual account with other than these defendants, with a party having no such business relations with him, and no such connection with the transaction by which Ryman became the owner of the 200 shares, the presumption would be a fair one that the holders were innocent purchasers, or at most were accountable to Bodmer alone. But all the peculiar circumstances here, with the positive testimony of Ryman and Bodmer, must be considered. Bodmer, a broker in Wilkes-Barre, solicits for and directs orders to Gerlaeh &amp; Harjes, who are members of the stock exchange; defendants knew Bodmer was not buying and selling stocks for himself, but for customers; they knew they, by order of Bodmer, had purchased these 200 shares for Ryman, for they had them issued to him and received his check for them; when the certificates came back with the blank transfer on them, signed by Ryman, it was not for purpose of immediate sale, for they held them. Why was the transfer executed, and the stock delivered to Bodmer ? Ryman testifies that it was done that they might be held as collateral security in a purchase of Atchison stocks, which were to be carried for him until January 1st. Bodmer, not being a member of the stock exchange, had his orders executed through defendants; he testifies in substance that this order, as accepted by him from Ryman, was transmitted to defendants to be carried out. If all this be true, then they knew the 200 shares belonged to Ryman, and they held them and any purchases made on them as a security, subject to the same liabilities as Bodmer.</p>

They may have been able to prove that the agreement of Ryman with Bodmer was <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>not communicated to them; the letters or telegrams between them and Bodmer in reference to this transaction, when they were put in possession of Ryman’s stocks, would probably show just what knowledge they had. If their side of the case had been heard, this evidence of plaintiff might have had but little significance. But as the case appeared at the trial, we think the evidence ought to have been submitted to the jury to find whether defendants knew the stocks in dispute were in fact Ryman’s. If they did know, then their conversion of them was wrongful, and plaintiff ought to have had a verdict.</p>

We announce no such rule as the one deprecated nor any new rule; not a single case of the many cited by counsel for appellees lays down a different one from that adhered to here. Wood’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=92%20Pa.%20390" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="92 Pa. 390">92 Pa. 390</a>, one of the latest cases, and one in which a more significant effect is given to the blank transfer of a certificate than in any of the other cases, holds that: “ If the owner of stock voluntarily gives certificates with blank assignments and power to make transfers to his brokers, who betray the confidence reposed in them, such owner must suffer the loss rather than innocent strangers, whose money the brokers were thereby enabled to obtain.” If this were a suit by Ryman against the purchaser of his stock at the sale of Gerlach &amp; Harjes’ assets, Wood’s Appeal would be directly in point and rule the case in favor of defendant; but here the question is, is there competent evidence from which the jury may find that Gerlach &amp; Harjes are not “ innocent strangers ? ” If they are not, if they knew the securities credited to Bodmer were in fact Ryman’s, then the sale of them without authority from either Bodmer or Ryman was a wrongful conversion for which they are answerable. Nor is there any reason, founded on the peculiar necessities of stock dealing, why brokers should not be held to the observance of the same rule of morals and <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>law as men engaged in other avocations. The rule as we have stated it, seeks only to do this; and if thereby the business of wrongfully appropriating one man’s property for the benefit of another be hampered, obstructed, or wholly prevented, then the law accomplishes its very purposes.</p>

The general rule is conceded by Lord Watson (p. 343), “ appellant by his own acts had invested Mozley with an apparent dominion and authority which would have enabled him effectually to dispose of the securities to persons who had no occasion to suspect his limited title.” The case is entirely in accord with our own above cited.</p>

That is the way sales and transfers of stock are usually made, and the presumable intent of executing the power to transfer, is to put the holder in position to complete a sale by delivery of the certificate and transfer of the stock. Such transfer carries prima facie a good title. The business of a stockbroker is to buy and sell stock, and when a certificate and power to trans<a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>fer are put into a broker’s hands, the situation is exactly analogous to that of goods or merchandise of any kind, prepared for market, and put into the hands of a dealer in that particular article.

All the indicia were complete. There is no evidence that defendants knew plaintiff at all or his relations with Bodmer, nor was it their business to inquire. As between Bodmer and defendants these were actual purchases and sales made on Bodmer’s order. He was the only party that they knew and it cannot be pretended that any one else would have been responsible to defendants on his orders. Whether his orders were on his own account, or were in pursuance of directions from customers of his, whether such customers bought to hold for investment, or to sell on an expected rise, whether they held the stocks full paid, or had pledged them for advances on their purchase, or on other subsequent operations, were all matters beyond the business connection of defendants with the transactions, which defendants were not shown to have known or to have been under any obligation to inquire about. There was no privity of contract between plaintiff and defendants, nor were the stocks ear-marked with any trust or with any evidence of plaintiff’s ownership of which defendants were bound to take notice. It is argued that plaintiff’s name appearing on the certificates, together with the fact that some at least of the stocks bought through defendants were paid for by Bodmer by plaintiff’s checks transmitted to defendants, was sufficient notice of plaintiff’s title to put defendants on inquiry. But if the fact that the certificates showed the title to have been in an executor was not enough to put the purchaser on inquiry, as was held in Wood’s Appeal, then a fortiori the mere fact that the certificate was in the name of a customer of the broker for whom the stocks had previously been bought, would not have that effect. The first stocks were bought, sent to Bodmer, and by him delivered to plaintiff. That was the end of that transaction. When after the lapse of months they came <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>back to defendants from Bodmer with a blank power to transfer from plaintiff, defendants were not bound to remember that they had been paid for in the former transaction, by plaintiff’s check, and if by chance they did remember it, they were entitled if not bound to presume that he had made new dealings (as was the fact) with Bodmer before putting the certificates and power to transfer into his hands, and with those dealings it was not their business to meddle.</p>
    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[268,783,1173,759]]]'>Nor were the business arrangements between Bodmer and defendants shown to have been such as made them mutually agents of each other, so as to bring defendants into Bodmer’s relations with the plaintiff. Neither the furnishing of a telegraph wire nor the division of commissions was sufficient to constitute a joint business. The parties dealt with each other as principals, and Bodmer was nothing but a customer, who brought business to the defendants. That the latter in return furnished him with the facilities of a telegraph wire, and made him an allowance on their commissions, was nothing more than the allowance of discounts on prices, or other inducements which commercial houses very commonly offer to large and desirable buyers. I am of opinion that there was no evidence on which a verdict for plaintiff could have been supported and that the learned judge was right in directing it for defendants.</p>
