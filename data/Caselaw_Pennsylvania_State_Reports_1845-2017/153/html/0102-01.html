He described the accident as follows: “ A. There is a curve before you come to Boston street, and as soon as the car turned that curve, I told the conductor to stop and leave me off at Boston street. He rang the bell, and the car slowed up. 1 had my dinner bucket in my right hand, as I was going home from work. I got down on the step and got hold of the car handle, the car never stopped, and just as I happened to make a step, the car started. I held on a little bit and I swung around and fell straight up along the side of the ear and dislocated my arm from the shoulder. The car still kept going on, and I suppose 150 feet, less or more, the conductor and another man stopped the car and came back and picked me up and set me on my feet. Q. When you were going to get off the car, what throwed you off? A. Because they started up. Q. How did it start up ? A. Going ahead full speed again. Q. What caused that, do you know; you said it slackened up ? <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>A. Certainly it slackened up, but it started before I got off; when I was on tbe way of getting off. Q Started all of a sudden, did it? A. Yes, sir.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b127-3" data-blocks='[["BL_127.4",127,[276,542,694,43]]]'>The court charged in part as follows :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b127-4" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[227,593,1164,1052]]]'>“ The allegation of the defendant here is that he was guilty of negligence by either standing on this lower platform or undertaking to get off when the car was in motion. According to my recollection of the testimony he said distinctly that, at the time, the car started; the car didn’t come to a full stop at all — and at the time of the sudden start he was actually getting off. The question then for you to determine is whether it was negligence in him to attempt to get off in this way. If you should conclude that it was negligence in him to do it, you will probably hesitate very little in concluding that that negligence contributed to the injury. If he had been in some other position than alighting from the car, the probabilities are that he would not have got hurt. But was it negligence for him in that position to get off the car ? Ordinarily it would be considered negligence for a man to get off a moving car. We cannot say as a matter of law that it is an act which a careful man would not under any circumstances do, and, therefore, we must leave it to you to determine whether this plaintiff was in the exercise of due care when he attempted to get off this car while it was in motion. If he was not, you will find for the defendant.”</p>
