Karcb died intestate, May 22, 1886, leaving a widow; and a daughter, the appellant. Letters of administration on his estate were granted to his widow. She filed two accounts in the orphans’ court, which were referred to auditors on exceptions, whose reports have been confirmed absolutely, the last on Jan. 3, 1890. By these proceedings all the debts of the intestate were paid except a balance of $337.11 due the widow, a creditor of the <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>•estate, and a mortgage debt of $1,503.78, created by the intestate. . The assignee of the mortgage instituted proceedings, recovered judgment, and caused the mortgaged premises to be sold by the sheriff on May 19, 1888, at which sale the administratrix became the purchaser for the sum of $8,150. She paid ten per cent of the purchase money, and on June 9, following, received her deed for the property from the sheriff. On the same day the sheriff took a judgment bond from her for $7,335, payable July 9, expressed as follows: “being balance of purchase money of real estate, the distribution of which is to be determined by the court.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[265,945,1177,1467]],["BL_411.1",411,[199,387,1168,1014]]]'>On June 10,1890, she paid an additional $1,000 on the bond to the sheriff. On Oct. 4, 1890, the counsel of the sheriff, and for the estate of Joseph J. Karch, deceased, as well as the attorney for the guardian of the daughter, Rebecca Karch, who was then a minor, being all the parties in interest, agreed in writing that “ the amount due the sheriff on judgment entered in the court of common pleas of Lebanon county to No. 388, June term, 1890, together with such interest as may be due and owing thereon, if any is legally due thereon, is hereby considered in court, and A. Frank Seltzer, Esq., is hereby appointed auditor by consent to make distribution thereof.” Same day the court of common pleas appointed said auditor. When the auditor met the parties to distribute the fund, the attorney for the administratrix offered proof to establish two claims which the administratrix alleged were due her by the estate; these claims were <em>disputed; </em>and an issue was applied for in the same court which was granted, in which the widow Amelia S. Karch was made plaintiff, and herself as administratrix of said estate defendant. This issue was entered to No. 22, March T., 1891, and upon trial resulted in a verdict in favor of defendant, Dec. 7,1891. A new trial was granted. The case was again tried and resulted a second time in a verdict for defendant, upon which judgment was entered Oct. 27, 1892. After the issue was determined, the auditor met again and took additional evidence, after which the case was argued. The auditor made his report, exceptions to which were filed by Amelia S. Karch, and on behalf of Rebecca E. Shugar. The only contested question before the auditor was the liability of the administratrix to pay interest on the unpaid portion of the purchase money due <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>by her for the real estate which she purchased at sheriff’s sale. This the auditor decided against her for the whole amount claimed tobe due, except such interest as accrued on the money due on the mortgage upon which the property was sold from the day after the sale (when the fund ceased to bear interest for the mortgagee), up to the time it was actually paid by her. After the case had been fully argued, the court, in an opinion by McPherson, J., determined the amount of money in the sheriff’s hands; deducted therefrom the sheriff’s costs; costs of audit; amount due the mortgagee and another small claim of $8.76, and then decreed the balance of the money ($6,283.46) to Amelia S. Karch, administratrix of Joseph J. Karch, deceased, upon her giving bond in the sum of $12,500, conditional for the legal distribution of the money. The court also struck off the judgment and all proceedings in the issue above referred to, entered to No. 22, March T., 1891, on the ground that the court of common pleas had no jurisdiction, under the act of Feb. 24, 1834, § 33, P. L. 77, to distribute the fund, except to lien creditors; and consent could not give jurisdiction. Rebecca E. Shugar, the daughter, took this appeal.</p>
