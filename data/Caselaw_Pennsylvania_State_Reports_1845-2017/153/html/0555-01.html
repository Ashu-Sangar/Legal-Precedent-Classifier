And as a spur to the operator and to compel this development an annual payment of four hundred dollars for delay was imposed upon the defendant. Anticipating however that he might not only fail to put down a well, but, through insolvency or otherwise, might become unable to pay the money, the lessor provided in the contract for a forfeiture of the lease if payment was not made within sixty days after maturity. This clause of forfeiture was inserted wholly in the interest and for the protection of the lessor, and it was competent for him to dispense with its provisions and to affirm the continuance of the contract. His right was optional or elective, and when the defendant failed to commence a well and failed to pay the four hundred dollars, the plaintiff might either forfeit the contract or affirm its continuance as he chose. This question was definitely settled by our Supreme Court in Wills v. The Manufacturers Nat. Gas Company, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20Pa.%20222" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="180 Pa. 222">180 Pa. 222</a>. We cannot see, as was argued, <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>how the fact that the lease sued upon provides for a forfeiture only upon the nonpayment of the four hundred dollars distinguishes this case from the Wills case. The language of the two leases are not exactly the same but they are identical in meaning. They both provide for a forfeiture after there has been a failure to commence a well within a specified time and a failure to pay the money which became due and payable by reason of the failure to drill. Clearly the forfeiture in both leases was intended, as said by Mr. Justice Clark, ‘ as a spur to the operator.’ The enforcement of the payment of the money was intended as a means of enforcing the commencement of operations. A forfeiture upon a failure to drill a well or pay a sum of money is in effect the same as a forfeiture upon the failure to pay money which is only payable upon a previous failure to drill a well. Neither do we see anything in the suggestion that a failure on the part of the defendant to commence a well within one year necessarily fixes upon him a liability to pay to the plaintiff annually four hundred dollars for the remainder of the twenty years which the lease has to run, for the express terms of the lease are that the four hundred dollars are to be paid annually ‘ until work is commenced.’ But it is said that the defendant assigned the lease within six months after its date and that he no longer has a right to go upon the plaintiff’s land to drill a well and that there is no way for him to perform his covenants except to annually pay four hundred dollars until the lease expires. Suppose he does not have any control over the present holder of the lease and suppose he has parted with his right to enter upon the plaintiff’s land, does that relieve him from the performance of his express covenants ? Can a lessee voluntarily assign his lease and then set up that assignment as a discharge of his liabilities under the lease? Surely not. In Frank v. Maguire, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Pa.%2082" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="42 Pa. 82">42 Pa. 82</a>, Mr. Justice Strong, says: ‘ It surely is not necessary to cite cases to prove that a tenant is bound by his express contract to pay rent, even after he had assigned the term with his landlord’s assent and though the landlord has accepted the assignee as his tenant and received rent from him.’ In the Washington Nat. Gas Co. v. Johnson, <a href="/pa/123/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="123 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="967142" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0576-01">123 Pa. 576</a>, it is held that ‘ owing to his privity of contract, a lessee’s liability upon his covenants in an oil and gas lease continues after his assignment of the lease.’ The de<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>fendant knew or ought to have known that the law continued his liabilit}1- notwithstanding his assignment, and he cannot now set up the failure of his assignees to commence operations under the lease as a defence in this case.</p>

It appears that the defendant took this lease with a number of others in the same locality with the view of having the territory tested and developed by a company which he and some others were about to organize and have incorporated; that when the lease in suit was taken it was his purpose to assign it to the company when organized, and of this fact he informed the plaintiff; that the company was organized and the lease assigned in accordance with the understanding of the lessor and lessee when the lease was taken. It further appears that the plaintiff would not have leased his farm to the defendant had he not been assured that the defendant had arrangements made with other persons to assist him in developing the land and that the lease would be assigned to the company that the defendant and others were about to organize for that purpose. From these facts it is contended that the company which was afterwards incorporated under the name of the Ten Mile Oil and Gas Company and which took the lease by assignment is tbe real lessee, and tliat the defendant in executing the lease assumed no personal liability by reason thereof; that until the company was incorporated he held the lease as tbe trustee of the plaintiff Stephen Sanders, and when be assigned it to the company his trust was fully executed, and that the company was tbe party that was first liable under the covenants of the party of the second part, the defendant, by assigning the lease, having done all that the plaintiff expected him to do; and that to now hold him absolutely bound to perform the covenants of the written agreement would be against equity and good conscience.</p>

Donaldson, <a href="/grant/2/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Grant 459" data-case-ids="227779" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0459-01">2 Grant, 459</a>) we do not think they are sufficient to justify a chancellor in modifying the written contract sued upon so as to relieve the defendant from the performance of the covenants which he therein took upon himself personally and without condition. The fact that he told the plaintiff that a company would be organized to develop the land and that the lease would be assigned to it was nothing more than an inducement for the execution of the lease to the defendant. The plaintiff wanted his land developed, and having this in view he might not have been willing to lease to the defendant unless he knew or was assured that the defendant had backing. Such a precaution on the plaintiff’s part and his refusal to make the lease until he was assured that the land leased would be developed by a company cannot in any way affect the true interpretation of the written contract afterwards entered into by the parties and which is unambiguous in its terms.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[287,1450,1171,757]]]'>“ The language of the written assignment of this lease made by the defendant six months after its execution in no way suggests that he was the trustee of the plaintiff or that he was anything else than the bona fide lessee and owner of the estate therein created, or that under it the Ten Mile Oil and Gas Company took title except as an assignee. If the defendant was not the lessee and the company only held as assignee, then no one sustained a contract relation to the plaintiff which could be made the basis of a suit to enforce the performance of the covenants of his lease; only through the privity of estate could he call anyone to account in an action at law. It is hardly to be presumed that the plaintiff who appears, by the terms of the lease, anxious to have his farm developed would so contract for its development as to leave no one responsible to him as a lessee and with whom there was privity of contract.</p>

It simply avers that c said lease became and was forfeited to the said Stephen Sanders.’ Taking the whole affidavit it is clear that this averment of the defendant is but his opinion of the legal effect of the nonpayment of the four hundred dollars due February 1, 1889, and is not intended to convey the idea that Stephen Sanders in any way actually elected to forfeit the lease. The fact that it is stated in the affidavit that the Ten Mile Oil and Gas Company assigned the lease to the Prosperity Oil and Gas Company shows that it was not actually forfeited by the plaintiff while in the hands of the first named company, and the 8th paragraph sets out that the lease is still in the hands of the last named company and that it stands ready to formally surrender it.</p>

The Manufacturer’s Natural Gas Co., <a href="/pa/130/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="130 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="568992" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0222-01">130 Pa. 222</a>; nor can it be successfully maintained that the mere assignment of such lease by the appellant to the Ten Mile Oil &amp; Gas Company discharged him from liability on his covenants therein: Frank <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>v.

But it is claimed that certain matters are stated in the affidavit of defence which show the written lease ought to be reformed so as to admit of a construction which will release him. By the construction contended for, and based on the proposed modification of the lease, the only duty of the appellant thereunder was to transfer it to an oil and gas company, to be organized for the purpose of testing the adjacent territory, and his assignee acquired an option, for which it gave nothing, and incurred no liability to the lessor. It is very evident that a reformation which will accomplish such results, and practically destroy the written and sealed agreement of the parties, must have something more substantial to support it than inferences founded on equivocal averments. When a party to an action, in order to prevent judgment against him for the claim, is required to file his sworn answer to it, he is expected to state clearly and distinctly the facts which constitute his defence; and when the nature and character of the defence are such that the law exacts “clear, precise, and indubitable evidence ” to sustain it, the importance of a plain and concise statement of it becomes obvious. Injustice is not likely to result from the exaction of such a statement of the defence, especially where it is apparent, as in this case, that it was prepared by competent counsel, who knew what was required, and presumably presented it in as favorable light for their client as his recollection and conscience warranted. Certainly a party who seeks to set aside his written obligation on the ground that he entered into it on the faith of a contemporaneous parol agreement cannot justly complain if he is required to state such agreement with clearness and precision.</p>
    <p id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[255,1904,1176,502]],["BL_593.1",593,[203,382,1167,961]]]'>The affidavit of defence in this case does not sustain the claims that are made upon it, or authorize any material modification of the lease. It does not allege that the execution of the lease was induced by any fraud or misrepresentation of the lessor, or contain any distinct averment of an agreement by which the lessee was to be released from the liability imposed by its written terms. The lessor’s knowledge of his lessee’s intentions respecting the development of the property and the transfer of the lease does not destroy the latter’s express covenant to commence operations on the demised premises within <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>one year, or thereafter to pay, while in default, the sum of $400 per annum to his lessor. It is not stated in the affidavit of defence that the lessor at any time declared the lease forfeited for noncompliance with its terms, but it does appear therein that the appellant’s assignee, by its sale and transfer of the lease to Brown, recognized it as in full force. It is true that the appellant in his affidavit says that his lessor encouraged Brown and his associates to make a further test of the territory for the production of oil and gas, and that he “ waived to them the forfeiture of the said leasehold, and accepted from them the sum of four hundred dollars, and thereby gave to them the privilege of holding his land for another year.” This averment is, however, entirely consistent with the view that the lessor was so desirous of having the work done for which he contracted that he refrained from exercising his right to declare the lease forfeited for delay in the performance of its covenants. It will not be seriously affirmed, we think, that, by the lessor’s failure to forfeit the lease for the default of his lessee, he lost his right to enforce it.</p>
    <p id="b593-5" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[204,1352,1166,963]]]'>We might specify other defects and omissions in the affidavit which make it unsatisfactory, and clearly insufficient to justify the proposed modification of the written lease, but, as the whole subject is so intelligently presented and considered in the able and exhaustive opinion of the learned judge of the court below, we regard further specification of them as unnecessary. The affidavit appears to have been drawn with a view to create the impression that the execution of the lease was induced by certain agreements between the parties, which render its enforcement, according to its terms, unjust and oppressive, and that it has been forfeited by the conduct of the lessor. But a careful examination of the affidavit fails to disclose any specific averment of such agreement, or of any word or act of the lessor indicative of a purpose on his part to annul the lease. It is an ingenious and misleading affidavit, but it is clearly insufficient to prevent judgment for the claim founded on a breach of the appellant’s distinct covenant to commence operations on the demised premises within one year, or thereafter to pay the sum named therein as compensation for his default.</p>
