A. In taking the wagon to the Germania brewery at Broad street and Columbia avenue, I drove up with him on the wagon, and I asked him how it was that he had such a big load on. He allowed that his route was in Camden, and that he served beer at different points, and that, it being Monday, he collected the Saturday night and Sundajr barrels, and brought as many as he possibly could, being such a long distance from the brewery. That was the conversation I had with him. He told me that there were forty-three or forty-five half barrels that he had on . . , . Q. How high were they on the wagon ? A. I did <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>not notice, but they were piled up. Q. In how many rows? A. They were not piled in rows, but were lying on their side. Q. Clean up to the top ? A. Yes, sir; they were in a kind of a pyramid up to the skids on the side.”</p>

After I get on a car I generally go through and stand on the front platform. I went up there, and I happened to know the driver, and I spoke to him. Above Market street a beer wagon was in front of the car. He blew his whistle twice for it to get off the track, but the man didn’t get off. Then, as we got to Arch street, he blew again. When the beer wagon was on the upper side of Arch street he pulled to the left, and pulled out of the track, all except one hind wheel. But before we knew what he was going to do he had swung in again; then the driver blew for him to get out of the road, but he just kept on the track. There were some wagons that pulled out, but there were some carts that were in ahead of him. Then the driver blew again, and just before he got to the little street the driver pulled out, and as he pulled out he took his whip and gave the horses a crack with the whip. He was going at a pretty good gait at the time. Q. You say that he was going at a pretty good gait? A. Yes, sir; he whipped the horses, and by that he swung the hind part of the wagon into the curbstone. Then the first barrel went off and struck the boy on the back of the neck.”</p>
