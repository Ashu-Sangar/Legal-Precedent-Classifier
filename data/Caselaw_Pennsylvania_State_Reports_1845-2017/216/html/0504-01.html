You have heard a great deal of testimony about the power that was furnished for the running of this business, the printing establishment of the plaintiff company. In the lease from Bair &amp; Gazzam to the plaintiff company there was a provision fixing certain terms upon which they could use the power out of ordinary business hours, at night for instance, while they obtained no such privilege by the lease made in the new quarters. It appears, however, from the testimony, that they <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>were to be allowed the use of the power at night, or at any time outside of the usual working hours, on the payment of a larger sum of money,- — -instead of $1.00 an hour as in the old premises, it was $5.00 for the first hour and $1.00 an hour afterwards. That is claimed as a valuable provision in the first lease which they did not have in the lease for the new premises. From the testimony it appears that they did not use it at night in the new premises, and hence they have not suffered any loss. I think one witness said they used it two or three times, at any rate they used it very little, if any, so that an actual loss has not been incurred by this plaintiff company in the failure to. have this provision in the lease.' That illustrates.to you the mistake you would make if you would allow this plaintiff company for the loss of these various items, .the amounts that have been stated here as the amounts of the loss incurred to this plaintiff company. In other words, it shows the necessity of your not considering these various items of damages,, or items going to make up the measure of damages which you are to allow the plaintiff, but only to consider them in finding out, if j^ou can, what the fair market value of this lease was. Was that lease of value over and above the conditions which the tenant, the plaintiff, were obliged to perform; what was its fair market value? I only mention this matter in regard to the difference in the cost of the power to be furnished outside of the regular working hours, as illustrating to you the mistake you would make in allowing the plaintiff these items which he claims, ■ the various items he claims to have lost by reason of this destruction of the lease, except the item of actual expense incurred in moving. That is an item constituting a measure of damages, do not make a mistake in that. But as to the other items you are only to consider them in your efforts to ascertain what market value this lease had, if any. Counsel for plaintiff has properly said to you that he does not claim them as items going to make up the measure of damages, yet they are items for you to consider in ascertaining the market value of this lease, if any. I need not go over the other items, for they are all of the same nature, — one is the difference in the operation of this machinery on one floor instead of on two, as in the new building.] [3]</p>

This is, as you will observe, if you notice carefully its meaning, in the line of my instruction to you ; not that you are to take those items, except the item of the cost of removal, as a measure of damages, but only for your consideration in ascertaining what, if anything, was the fair market value of this lease, which the plaintiff has lost. Has he lost anything by it 1 It would seem, from the testimony, that the machinery is substantially as good as it was before the removal, but the loss there, as it turns out from the claim made afterwards, was not actual loss, or the injury to the machinery in moving, but the loss which they claim in the operation of the machinery on the two floors instead of the one.

The plaintiff conducted a printing establishment on the third floor of a building owned by H. C. Bair, who had leased the whole building to the Bair <em>&amp; </em>Gazzam Manufacturing Company for a term of ten years expiring April 1, 1907. The manufacturing company leased the third floor to the plaintiff for a term which expired April 1, 1903, and on January 28, 1903, extended the lease to April 1, 1907. A bond to secure the owner of the building was approved November 22, 1902. At this time municipal consent to enter the city of Pittsburg had not been obtained. Proceedings had been instituted by the city to enjoin the construction of the road and it was decided January 5, 1903, that municipal consent was necessary ; see Pittsburg v. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/205/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="205 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="929963" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0013-01">205 Pa. 13</a>.

That the cost of removing the machinery was submitted as a distinct item for which there could be a recovery and not merely as evidence of the value of the right of which the plaintiff was deprived, is a matter of which the appellant should not now complain. The case was tried by both sides on the theory that there could be a recovery of the cost of removal in addition to the value of the lease. The appellant’s counsel asked the court to instruct the jury that, there being no evidence of the value of the unexpired term of the lease, the measure of damages under all the testimony was the actual amount shown to have been expended in the removal of the machinery and other property from the building, and that the verdict should be limited to that amount.

The market value of the land taken is the test universally applied in an action by an owner, and it is as accurate a measure of his loss as any that can be set up. What he is entitled to is the value of the land ascertained by a fair appraisement, and of this value the selling price of land <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>similarly situated is prima facie the best evidence. But market value is an unsatisfactory test of the value to a tenant of a leasehold interest. It is really no test at all, because a lease rarely has any market value. Generally it is not assignable at the will of the tenant, and he pays in rent all that the right of occupation is worth. The right of which he is deprived and for which he is entitled to full compensation is the right to remain in undisturbed possession to the end of the term. The loss resulting from the deprivation of this right is what he is entitled to recover. The value of the right he is forced to sell cannot ordinarily be measured by its market price, for there is no market for it, nor can it always be measured by the difference between the rent reserved and the rental value if the lease should be a favorable one. If, as was the case here, a tenant engaged in a business requiring the use of heavy machinery and appliances should secure a new place equally well adapted to his business and at the same rent, he wonld still be at the expense of removal and at a loss because of the stoppage of his business. These are matters to be considered in connection with others, not as substantive elements of damage, but as tending to prove the value of the leasehold interest.</p>

Railroad Co., a case twice before this court, reported in <a href="/pa/105/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="105 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="454252" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0547-01">105 Pa. 547</a> and <a href="/pa/113/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="113 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="457597" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0214-01">113 Pa. 214</a>, in which a part of the leased property, used as a marble mill, was taken, compelling a removal of the tenant’s business. It was held that in ascertaining the damages to the tenant the value of the lease and also of the machinery and fixtures in place were to be taken into consideration and that, as tending to show the difference in value of the machinery and fixtures before the taking of the property and their value to be removed and applied to the same or other use, the expense of removal was evidence. In Kersey v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/133/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="133 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="812882" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0234-01">133 Pa. 234</a>, a part of the tenant’s coal yard was taken in building a railroad. Evidence was admitted to show the cost of reconstructing appliances used in the business, the increased cost of handling coal, and the increased waste resulting from breakage, as affecting the value of the leasehold. In Ebret v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/151/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="151 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="836725" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0158-01">151 Pa. 158</a>, the plaintiff used the leased premises in carrying out a contract to remove daily from the city gas works large quantities of coal tar, and evidence was received to show the <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>additional cost necessarily incurred in performing the contract. In none of these cases was there a departure from the rule that the tenant’s recovery is restricted to the value of the unexpired term. The evidence was admitted to show this value. Becker v. Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=117%20Pa.%20252" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="117 Pa. 252">117 Pa. 252</a>, is not in conflict with these cases. The plaintiff there was the owner of the building taken, in which he carried on the business of a merchant tailor. The attempt at the trial was to show the difference between the value of his goods in the store to be sold to his customers and their value if removed and sold elsewhere. This difference was the profit of his business and it had no bearing on the question at issue, the value of the real estate.</p>
