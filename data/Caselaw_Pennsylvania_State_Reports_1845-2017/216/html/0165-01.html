Orders were issued to the engineer to proceed to Altoona with the engine and tender alone, and while he was approaching Cress on station, owing to the escaping steam which filled the cab, he was unable to see along the line of the track and distinguish the passenger train standing at Cresson station. When quite near to the station he endeavored to bring his engine to a standstill, but found that the throttle would not work, and before he could apply the brakes successfully, the engine had passed through the station on the track between the one on which the passenger train was then standing and the station platform, striking the truck, and causing the death of the boy. This occupancy of the track by the engine was in direct violation of Rule No. 114, as follows: “ Trains approaching stations where a passenger train is receiving or discharging passengers must be stopped before reaching the passenger train.”</p>

The defendant’s fifth point was as follows : “ The defendant requests the court to instruct the jury that if they find for the plaintiff, to state in their written verdict whether the damages so found are for full compensation for both parents of the deceased.” This was answered as follows: “We instruct you, if you find for the plaintiff to find full compensation and damages, so far as it affects both parents, and you must say in your verdict that you so find. That is, you will find full compensation in damages, whether due the father, or due the mother, or due both the father and the mother.” The verdict returned was as follows: “Sept. 9, 1904.

It is from this judgment, in favor of both parents, we have this appeal; and it is not apparent to us how we can reverse the judgment because the parents were not joined in bringing the action and in recovering the judgment against the defendant. Mrs. Waltz, the mother of the deceased, is precluded from attacking the action of the court on the trial of the cause by which she was made a party plaintiff by the motion of her counsel to amend on April 4, 1905, which was allowed by the court. This was a ratification and approval by Mrs. Waltz of the action of the jury in considering and determining her rights as a party plaintiff in the action and of the entry of judgment on the verdict. She is therefore concluded as to any right of action accruing to her against the defendant by reason of the death of Henry Waltz. The defendant, company is likewise bound by the action of the court, taken on its initiative, in treating the suit as <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>brought by the father and mother of the deceased and in directing the jury “ to find full compensation and damages so far as affects both parents.” As thus amended, the proper parties were made plaintiffs, and the amendment made by the court on April 4, 1905, was unnecessary and'did-the defendant no harm, and hence may be regarded as harmless error.</p>
