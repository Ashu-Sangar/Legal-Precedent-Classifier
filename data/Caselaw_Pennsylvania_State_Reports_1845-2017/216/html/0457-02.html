As set forth in the articles of association the corporation was formed <em>“ </em>for the purpose of the supply of water to the public, and its location of territory of supply is within the Borough of Bridgeville in the County of Allegheny and State of Pennsylvania.” The corporation subsequently acquired franchises empowering it to supply water to the public in all the municipal districts within which water was formerly supplied to the public by its codefendant, the Chartiers Yalley Water Company. The corporation was formed for the purpose of taking over under lease the franchises and property of the Chartiers Yalley Water Company and operating the same. Its capital stock is $3,000,000.</p>

His term as a director of the company having expired previous to August 19, 1904, he did not take part in the directors ’ meeting of that date which authorized the execution of the lease.

There being no evidence tending to show the use of improper means to induce the execution of the lease in question, or that its terms are unconscionable, the sole question for determination is the power of the Chartiers company to lease its plant to another corporation. If it has that power it must be conferred by the Act of June 26, 1895, P. L. 369, entitled “ A supplement to an Act, entitled ‘ An Act to provide for the <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>incorporation and regulation of certain corporations,’ approved the twenty-ninth day of April, Anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, further amending the twelfth section thereof, so as to permit corporations organized thereunder, either for the purpose of carrying on any manufacturing business or for the supply of water, or for the manufacture or supplying of light, to purchase bonds or stock of other corporations of the same character, or to guarantee the payment- of interest and principal of such bonds, or either principal or interest, or to lease and operate corporate property.” The portion of the act applicable to this case and upon which the power to make the lease complained of depends, reads as follows : “ It shall and may be lawful for any company, organized under the provisions of this act, either for the purpose of carrying on any manufacturing business or for supply of water for manufacturing and supplying light, of this Commonweath or elsewhere to subscribe for, take, purchase, hold and dispose of the bonds or stock in any company of the same character incorporated under the provisions of this act or its supplements, or guarantee the payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, or either principal or interest, or to enter into contracts for the use or lease of the corporate property, real, personal or mixed of such company, upon such terms as may be agreed upon with the company or companies owning the same, and to run, use and operate such property in accordance with such contract or lease.”</p>

They are corporations <em>“ </em>of the same character.” Do corporations of their character come within the provisions of the act ? It will be noticed there is a difference between the words used in the title of the act of 1895 and those used in the body. In the title, which is a part of the act, and aids if needs be in its construction, Halderman’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/104/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="104 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="452125" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0251-01">104 Pa. 251</a>, the act is made to apply to three classes of corporations: (a) for the purpose of carrying on any manufacturing business, (b) for the supply of water and (c) for the manufacture or supplying of light, while the body of the act, plaintiff contends, applies to but two classes, those organized for the purpose of carrying <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>on any manufacturing business, and those organized to supply water for manufacturing and supplying light. It seems to us plaintiff’s contention is not well founded. To give the act the construction contended for by plaintiff would be to limit its provisions to one class of corporation, viz. : those organized for manufacturing purposes, as there is no authority in the act of 1874 for the creation of corporations to “ supply water for manufacturing and supplying light.” The legislature certainly intended all provisions of the act to have effect, and the language used should be construed with that end in view. A rule of construction is that where the words of a statute are susceptible of two constructions one of which will lead to an absurdly, the other not, the latter should be adopted, though it be a liberal instead of a literal construction. Applying this rule to the act of 1895, its entire provisions can be given effect and the body made to conform with the title by reading into the body the word “ or ” immediately before the words “ for manufacturing and supplying light.” If the laws of this commonwealth provided for the creation of a class of corporations “to supply water for manufacturing and supplying light,” we should hold the language used in the body of the act should prevail and have effect in preference to that employed in the title. There being, however, no provision in our laws for the organization of corporations for that purpose we are clearly of the opinion the intention of the legislature as indicated by the title of the act was to confer upon manufacturing companies, water companies and light companies the power to lease their plants to other corporations of the same class; that intention being manifest, for the purpose of giving the act full effect and preventing a portion of its provisions from being meaningless the word “ or ” should be supplied as we have above indicated. This, we think, can be done without doing violence to anjr rule of construction.</p>
