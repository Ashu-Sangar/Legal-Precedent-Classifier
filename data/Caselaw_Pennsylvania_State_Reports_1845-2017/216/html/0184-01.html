That it was recorded in com<a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>pliance with the explicit and positive direction of the plaintiff is clearly shown by the testimony of David N. Keast, who was very careful in caring for the interest of Jane Roberts. And in order that she might fully understand and comprehend the effect of recording the deed Mr. Keast explained the effect to her, and after the explanation she still insisted that it be taken to the court house, and we have no doubt she intended it to be recorded so that the matter would be fixed and she could not change it. The testimony shows further that Mr. Keast did not take the deed to the court house immediately, but held it more than a year after its execution; and that while he held it more than once she requested him to take it to the court house; and the further fact should not be overlooked that all this was done by Mrs. Roberts against the advice of her attorney, Mr. Keast, and the protests of one of the beneficiaries, Judson C. Norris, and without any influence being brought to bear upon her in favor of her conduct by any of the beneficiaries. Yet she, uninfluenced and unsolicited, directs the deed to be taken to the court house; which phrase, “ taken to the court house,” we believe, in view of the explanations made to her by her attorney, Mr. Keast, was understood by her to mean that it should be recorded. And if the deed was directed to be placed on record by her with a full understanding and comprehension of the legal effect of recording it, then when she directed it to be recorded she directed it to be delivered, for the legal effect of recording the deed would be that it is prima facie evidence of delivery: Bush v. Genther, 6 Del. County Rep. 323.</p>

Patterson never exercised any influence, and there is no allegation on the part of any witness for the plaintiff to show that Elmer P. Norris ever exercised any influence on Jane Roberts in procuring the making of the deed, nor is there any proof by any witness that Judson C. Norris ever exercised any influence in procuring the deed. If it be true that he was her confidential advisor, this would weigh against the plaintiff when it is remembered that when he learned of her intention to make the deed he protested against its being made to David N. Keast, her attorney, who after frequent solicitation- on her part prepared the deed, notwithstanding he had advised her against doing so. Where a deed is executed without fraud, accident or mistake, and delivered by a father to a son and without any duress or undue influence on the part of the son, the deed will not be set aside in a court of equity: Carney v.

Unless there is something suspicious in the circumstances, or the nature or amount of the gift is such that it ought not to have been accepted, even if freely tendered, the donee will not be called upon to show that the transaction was in all respects fair and honest, and in no respect tainted by fraud or undue influence: Worrall’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/110/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="110 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="543781" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0349-01">110 Pa. 349</a>.</p>

S.), 291, where in the trial it was argued that the plaintiff was of weak intellect from old age, yet she maintained the suit in her own behalf. In the absence of fraud or undue influence mere weakness of intellect from sickness or old age is no ground for avoiding a deed. It is not necessary that a person about to execute a deed should have sufficient mental capacity to take into connected view the whole of his property. If he understands in detail all his separate items of property, and chooses with understanding and reason between one disposition and another, it is sufficient. Mental capacity to execute a deed does not include the ability to understand the legal effect which lawyers may impart to the words employed. If the nature and effect of the instrument as a conveyance of property is understood, it is sufficient.</p>

And in connection with a discussion of that case it will be observed that Jane Roberts had the deed drawn by her own attorney; that she told him what she wanted done; that he advised her in connection with the matter; that he told her she could not convey the property by will without reserving the right which every person has of revoking it; that she insisted that she wanted to have the property so there would be nothing further done about it, but that the conveyance would be absolute; and after all this explanation and the advice of her attorney, her attorney drew the deed, explained it to her, she executed it and caused it to be recorded.

The grantor was old and. illiterate, and the grantees were her grandchildren, two of whom were consulted by her in many but not all of her business matters for some time previous to the date of the deed, but who may be treated as occupying a fiduciary relation to her. The bill was filed by the grantor more than two years after the date of the deed, and at a time when as found by the court below her memory had become very much impaired. The deed was prepared by the grantor’s attorney at her command, though against his advice, and was delivered by her to him voluntarily and with full comprehension of its effect, but in escrow, “ to be delivered to the grantees or any one of them upon my verbal or written instructions so to do, or in event of my death, without such instructions.” The attorney kept it for more than a year and then was directed by her to “ take it to the court house ” a direction repeated after he had explained that he would have it recorded and that would mean a delivery.</p>
