Hastings all the coal in and under fifty acres of land in Susquehanna township, Cambria county, with certain mining rights described in the agreement. Hastings made the first payment on the purchase money and in the following year conveyed his interest in the coal and mining rights to the Blubaker Coal Company, the defendant in this proceeding. Farber died on October 16, 1895, without having made any provision for the performance of the contract. On April 21, 1903, his administrator presented his petition to the orphans’ court of Cambria county setting forth that the deceased died seized in fee of the undivided five-sixths of the coal and mining rights sold by said agreement; that the petitioner understood that the Blubaker Coal Company was willing to accept a deed for the undivided interest in said coal owned by Farber and pay therefor a proportionate part of the purchase money fixed by the agreement; that the petitioner was “ willing and desirous that the said contract be complied with on the part of said decedent, as to all the title or interest of said decedent in the said coal and mining rights sold thereby,” and prayed that the court decree the specific performance of the contract as to the undivided five-sixths of the coal and mining rights, and that zzpozz payment of the balance of the purchase money due on said undivided interest, the petitiozzer cozivey the same to the Blubaker Coal Company.</p>

Petitioners (respondent) further represent that they are willing and desirous that the specific performance of said contract be decreed by the court whenever the administrator of said estate is prepared to execute and deliver a deed conveying to them, their successors and assigns, all said coal and the mining rights and privileges covered by said agreement with general warranty, and clear of all encumbrances.” The orphans’ court refused to decree the specific performance of the contract and dismissed the petition. The bill in the present suit avers that the answer of the respondent company in the orphans’ court proceeding was in effect an election by it to rescind and that it did thereby rescind the contract for the sale of the coal and mining rights.</p>

The bill prays that the court decree the rescission of the contract and the cancellation and discharge of the same of record and that the administrator sell the coal and mining rights and pay first out of the proceeds thereof to the said Blubaker Coal Company the sum paid by it on said contract with interest thereon.</p>

The answer admitted the application of the administrator to the orphans’ court for specific performance of the contract and averred “ that we made answer thereto declining to agree to accept a deed for an undivided interest in the coal, mining rights and privileges sold by said agreement, but we deny that we thereby elected to rescind, or that we would thereby rescind said contract or agreement.” The answer further sets forth that the respondent company is willing to pay to the administrator the balance of the purchase money, provided a decree can be obtained from, the court directing the administrator to convey to it the coal, mining rights and privileges described in the agreement; that the administrator has no standing to enforce the contract or to sell the coal with the mining rights and privileges therein described; that Farber died seized of an undivided six-sevenths interest in the coal; that said interest has become vested in the widow under her claim of exemption, and other matters which we do not regard as important or controlling in the disposition of the case.</p>

The learned judge concluded his opinion refusing relief as follows: “We, therefore, conclude that the facts do not warrant the court in declaring that the defendant company has forfeited its rights by rescission of contract, and no sufficient tender has been made on part of the plaintiff which would put the. defendant in the position of either rescinding the contract or of complying with the same by payment of the remainder of the purchase money, and we are, therefore, constrained to refuse the prayer- of the complainant.”</p>

Such is clearly the effect of the answer when construed in connection with the averments of the administrator’s petition. The petition, as we have seen, while reciting that the deceased was seized of an undivided five-sixths interest in the coal, averred a willingness and readiness to perform the contract as to all the interest which the deceased had in the coal. There is nothing in the case to show that the administrator knew or believed that his decedent had any greater interest in the coal than was named in the petition. There is no evidence of fraud or bad faith on the part of Farber in making the agreement or of his personal representative in attempting to carry it out. The administrator was performing his official duty when he asked the orphans’ court to decree the specific execution of the contract. The defendant company exercised its unquestioned right to decline to accept a part of the coal which Farber had agreed to convey to Blastings. As will be observed from its answer, the company denied that it was “ willing to accept a deed for an undivided interest in the said coal, mining rights and privileges,” and averred that it was willing that specific performance of the contract be decreed <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>when the administrator was prepared to execute and deliver a deed conveying “ all said coal and mining rights and privileges covered by said agreement with general warranty, and clear of all encumbrances.” This was a refusal to accept any undivided interest, and an insistence upon a conveyance of the coal in fee. This demand, as the record discloses, the administrator was not in a position to comply with, as his decedent did not own the fee simple title to the coal. The defendant company’s action in declining to accept such interest in the coal as the deceased owned, must, therefore, be regarded as an election by it to rescind the contract. To interpret the answer of the company otherwise would permit it to decline accepting the vendor’s interest in the coal, and at the same time prevent the administrator from selling the interest and applying the proceeds to the payment of decedent’s debts. In other words, the company would not accept the coal nor permit the vendor’s administrator to sell it in order to obtain funds to apply to the debts of the insolvent estate. This is an absurdity which the law will not tolerate. And not only did the company assume this position in 1903 when the administrator offered to convey to it all his decedent’s interest in the coal, but in the answer to the bill filed in this case, it still persists in demanding the conveyance of the fee simple title and declines to accept any lesser interest. A court of equity will not permit such inconsistent and unconscionable conduct on the part of a litigant, but on the contrary will compel him to act with due regard to the rights of the other interested parties.</p>
    <p id="b245-4" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[135,1773,1182,668]],["BL_246.1",246,[285,354,1179,252]]]'>The question of tender was eliminated from the cause by the action of the defendant. The administrator was not required to tender a conveyance of a six-sevenths interest in the coal. The vendee having declined to accept any undivided interest when the five-sixths interest was offered it, thereafter the administrator was not required to do a vain thing by offering again a larger undivided interest. The refusal by the defendant company to accept a conveyance was based on the fact that the administrator had offered to convey an undivided interest and not the entire interest in the coal, and hence the subsequent discovery that the vendor had a greater undivided interest did not impose on the administrator the duty of mating another tender. Had the defendant company accepted <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>the five-sixths,.interest in the coal when it was offered in the .proceedings in the orphans’ court, equity undoubtedly would have compelled the administrator to have conveyed the residue of the six-sevenths interest when it was ascertained that the vendor owned the larger interest.</p>
    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[283,615,1183,406]]]'>. The widow .and heirs of the deceased vendor were not required to purchase an. outstanding interest in the coal to enable the administrator to convey a fee simple title.
