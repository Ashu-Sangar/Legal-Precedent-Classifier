It was not testamentary, and it was no more a part of the will than the label on the back of it.”</p>

Whatever the form of the instrument is, if it vests no present interest in the donee but only appoints what is to be done after the death of the testator, it is a testamentary instrument: Turner v.

The interpretation of the paper is for the court. It disposes of all the testator’s personal property, and the testimony shows he had no real estate. It is clear that he did not intend to make a present gift of all his personal property, for, if he had, there is no reason why he should not have done so, instead of retaining possession for upwards of two years, and only making the entry in his private journal. He also points out in the paper the specific fund out of which his funeral expenses shall be paid, and expresses a desire as to the disposal of his body after death. Every fact surrounding the transaction shows that the property should not pass hi praesenti as a gift, but should only become effective at his death.</p>

Beaumont, at the time he made the paper in dispute, to wit: on October 25, 1901, was domiciled in the state of New York; at the time of his death he was domiciled at Butler, Pa. The Revised Statutes of New York, title “Wills,” vol. 3, sec. 8,inter alia,provide in regard to wills : “ There shall be at least two attesting witnesses, each of whom shall sign his name as a witness, at <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>the end of the will, at the request of the testator.” This provision of the law is not complied with. But it is not necessary to have attesting witnesses to a will in Pennsylvania. By the laws of which state shall this will be governed ? Does it speak from the date of its execution or from the date of the death of the testator? ^</p>

So far as we have been able to find, this case has. never been overruled or-modified, and is decisive of the question now before us. It is cited with approval by Judge Denio, in Moultrie v.
