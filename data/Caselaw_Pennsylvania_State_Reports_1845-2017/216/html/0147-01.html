There has been time for preparation, we think, since counsel were assigned for this defendant and there yet remains ten days for preparation; the continuance of the case is therefore refused.”</p>

A physician was called by the defendant, who testified to a mental condition that he says sometimes exists, and recited the symptom or effect of such a condition, but not with reference to this case, as he had no knowledge of it; and so his evidence, if you find no evidence of insanity in the defendant at the time of the crime, cannot affect the question of the guilt or innocence of this defendant.”</p>

The case was hot at all complicated, either in facts or in law, and counsel have not ventured to assert here that there was any defense they could have made which was prevented by want of time.</p>

Such reading is not a desirable practice. It leads to counter extracts by the other side and tends to confuse the minds of the jury. They are much more likely to get clear ideas of the law if they receive it altogether from the judge. But the practice, subject to the discretion and control of the judge, is not unlawful, and to stigmatize it as “ reading garbled <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>extracts,” without even an effort to show- any misreading or perversion, is reprehensible.</p>
    <p id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.4",179,[121,468,1179,457]]]'>There was no evidence of insanity to submit to the jury. Indulgent as the law of Pennsylvania is in favor of the accused, it has never tolerated, nor is likely to tolerate, a doctrine of “ transitory frenzy ” as a defense to murder. The medical profession in their humane efforts to diagnose and ameliorate every form of mental as well as bodily variation from normal condition, may be justified in giving it a specific name and description, but in the eye of the law it is nothing but vindictive and reckless temper.</p>
