    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.6",140,[272,406,1176,1025]]]'>This was an action of quo warranto brought by the Commonwealth ex rel. The Attorney General, against the Monongahela Bridge Company, and based on an alleged forfeiture of its franchises. The suggestion for the writ stated that the attorney general was informed as to the facts alleged therein by the Pittsburg and Birmingham Traction Company. Trial by jury was dispensed with, under a stipulation of the parties, and the case was heard by the court under the provisions of the Act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109. The facts were found by the trial judge substantially as follows: The Monongahela Bridge Company was incorporated under the Act of March 19, 1810, 5 Sm. L. 114, for the purpose of erecting a bridge over the Monongahela river, opposite Pittsburg, and various other acts supplementary to the act of 1810, were enacted by subsequent legislatures. A bridge was erected by the company as authorized by the charter, and maintained as a toll bridge. The Pittsburg and Birmingham Passenger Railway Company was subsequently chartered under the Act of April 13,1859, P. L. 749, and authorized to construct a railway across the bridge of the Monongahela Bridge Company.</p>
    <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.7",140,[260,1438,1186,239]]]'>In 1889 the railway company was authorized to operate its cars by cable instead of horse power, and a year later its name was changed to the Pittsburg and Birmingham Traction Com- , pany, and it was authorized to operate by electricity in addition to cable.</p>
    <p id="b140-6" data-blocks='[["BL_140.8",140,[273,1696,1174,510]]]'>In 1889 an agreement was entered into between the bridge company and the railway company whereby the former agreed to reconstruct and widen the bridge and provide a sufficient roadway to enable the cars of the latter to cross on double tracts, by cable, and in 1890 a supplemental agreement was made between the bridge company and the traction company authorizing the latter to' use electricity as a motive power instead of cable. The railway company agreed to and did advance a large sum of money towards the reconstruction of the bridge, which was to be liquidated by tolls.</p>

Viewers were appointed who awarded damages for the taking of the bridge, and an appeal was taken by the city from the award. Pending the determination of this appeal, the city entered into an agreement with the stockholders of the bridge company, by which it purchased the entire stock of the company, and all the stock was transferred to the city, or to persons designated by its representatives. Directors named by the city, being municipal employees, were substituted for the former directors. The transfer was made April 11,1896, and since that time no tolls have been charged for foot passengers or horse and wagon traffic over the bridge, and it has been maintained at the expense of the city, and the revenues received from it have been paid into the city treasury. When the stock was acquired by the city, the condemnation proceedings were discontinued. No meetings of stockholders of the bridge company have been held since the transfer of the stock, and no directors’ meetings since July 81, 1897.</p>
    <p id="b141-3" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[110,1278,1179,1131]]]'>In 1896 the traction company sued the bridge company for a portion of the money advanced for the reconstruction of the bridge as above stated. ' The suit resulted in judgment for the defendant: Traction Co. v.

Upon the trial of the latter suit the defendant attempted to raise the question of the right of the bridge company to exercise corporate franchises, but it was held that this question could not be raised in a collateral proceeding. In 1897 the bridge company appealed from the settlement made against it by the accounting officers of the commonwealth for tax on its capital stock, and among the specifications of objection stated that since April 13, 1896, the entire capital stock of the Monongahela Bridge ■ Company has been owned absolutely by the city of Pittsburg; that no tolls have been collected; that the property so acquired has been managed, operated and controlled as like property of the city; that no dividends have been declared; that the organization of the company has been maintained solely for the purpose of determining whether or not certain written contracts between the bridge company and the traction company</p>

The relations existing between the traction company and the bridge company have already, in part at least, been considered twice by this court. The case of Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Traction Co. v. Monongahela Bridge Co., <a href="/pa/184/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="184 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="987969" data-case-paths="/pa/184/0180-01">184 Pa. 180</a>, was an action to recover an amount of money advanced by the traction company for reconstructing the bridge. Under the contract this was to be paid by crediting the tolls <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>chargeable against the company; but the latter claimed that, owing to the fact that the city had purchased all the stock of the bridge company, and made the bridge free to the public, the company must be held to have surrendered its franchises, and to be no longer in existence, and therefore could collect no further tolls under the contract. The court below held that the contract remained in force, and that no recovery could be had by the traction company, of the moneys it had advanced, and on appeal the judgment for defendant was affirmed. The substance of the contention in that case was the same as in this. But in that proceeding, the existence of the corporation, the Monongahela Bridge Company, was not, nor could it be, questioned. Then in Monongahela Bridge Co. v. Traction Co., <a href="/pa/196/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="196 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="916762" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0025-01">196 Pa. 25</a>, the present defendant sued the same traction company to recover tolls alleged to be due. The defense was attempted to be set up, that the bridge company had forfeited its franchises by the sale of its stock to the city. Judgment was given for the plaintiff, and afterwards affirmed by this court. While the case was decided upon other grounds, it was pointed out by our Brother Mestbezat, that the purchase of the entire stock of the bridge company by the city did not dissolve the corporation, or vest in the city the title to the property of the bridge company.</p>
    <p id="b143-3" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[107,1534,1181,200]]]'>And now in the present case, the issue is simply whether or not the defendant company has done anything which has forfeited its right to exist, and exercise the functions of a corporation.</p>
    <p id="b143-4" data-blocks='[["BL_143.5",143,[106,1743,1179,563]]]'>There is no allegation in the pleadings of any failure to maintain the corporate organization. The only wrongful act alleged is that the ownership of the entire stock of the bridge company has passed to the city of Pittsburg. There is nothing in the evidence to show that the company as such sold any stock to the city. The stock was sold by the shareholders acting through a committee of their own number. The bridge company as a corporation had no stock to sell; it owned none; there was none in the treasury. As a matter of convenience the stockholders acted together in the matter, but the sale was that of the stockholders and was not by the company.</p>

The facts are found separately and. in numbered paragraphs, and are followed by a discussion of the law, and the conclusions reached by the court. The essential facts were not in dispute, and were for the most part agreed upon by counsel in writing and made part of the record. There is no difficulty in ascertaining from the record the real questions of law to be passed upon, and we think there was a substantial compliance with the act of 1874, and with the decisions of this court.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[259,807,1181,507]]]'>There is no requirement in the act that the court shall specifically answer upon the record, all the requests for findings of fact submitted by counsel. The act requires only that the court shall state “ separately and distinctly the facts found, the answers to any points submitted in writing by counsel, and the conclusions of .law.” No further answers to requests for findings of fact are required than the statement of the facts found by the court. The cases cited by appellant on this question relate to charging the jury upon points submitted, not to findings by the court alone, under the act of 1874.</p>
    <p id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[260,1323,1180,405]]]'>That the bridge company should be held to have lost its corporate functions by reason of the sale by the shareholders of their stock to the city, is indeed, as the court below says, a staggering proposition. Yet no other reason for forfeiture has been shown in this case. If the stock had been purchased by private individuals no one would have thought of suggesting that the transfer could in any way affect the right of the company to exist.</p>
