Until quite recently the courts insisted on such examination by their own board, and the recent amendment of Rule 36 by which the certificate of the state board of examiners is accepted as an equivalent, is a concession in relief of students from the burden of a double examination, by the state and by the local board, on the same subjects and for the same purpose. But from the provision for written questions and answers, and for the specific subjects and studies, as' well as from the general intent, it is manifest that the rule both in its original and its amended form requires an examination, in the ordinary meaning of that word, to test proficiency in the principles and practice of law and equity, not a mere inspection by the state or the county board, of certificates from other courts. Such inspection in exceptional cases of practitioners from other courts is provided for in the next rule, 37, as follows : “ Any person admitted to practice in other courts of this or other states who shall have been in actual practice for five years within the six years immediately preceding his application, and who shall <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>have satisfied the board of examiners of this fact and of his good moral character and professional standing, may without previous registration appear for final examination for admission to the bar; provided, however, that when, in the unanimous opinion of the board, the moral character, professional standing and qualifications of the applicant are such as to render an examination unnecessary, he may on filing in the prothonotary’s office a certificate to this effect, signed by all the members of ■the board present himself for admission on motion.”</p>

The appellant has not brought himself within any of them. There is no averment in his petition that he has passed an examination by either the state or the county board in the principles of law and equity, nor indeed is there any averment of such an examination by anybody at any time, and the statement of graduation at the Law Department of Yale University is lacking in precision of dates to show how much time he passed there. He has not therefore complied with the requirements of Rule 36 with regard to students applying for admission from the county of Allegheny.</p>

The rule and the certificate provided for in it have no reference to the admission of attorneys from other courts of this or other states. That subject is governed by Rule 37 already quoted.
