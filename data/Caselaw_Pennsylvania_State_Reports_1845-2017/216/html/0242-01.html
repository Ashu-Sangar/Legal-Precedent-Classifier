Moreover, the petition is defective in not setting forth the amount the property sold for and at least the probable amount that it would bring on a resale. So far as the condition of the records referred to is concerned, the petitioner had the same information and knowledge possessed by the execution creditors and purchaser of the property, and it is not apparent that she was not in as good position to protect her judgment at the time of the sale as she would be on a resale. Furthermore, it would not be fair to the purchaser to permit her to stand by and put upon it the burden of bidding up the property for the protection and benefit of both her and itself, and then allow her to <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>come in and have the sale set aside because the property was knocked down to it at less than what she alleges is its actual value.</p>
