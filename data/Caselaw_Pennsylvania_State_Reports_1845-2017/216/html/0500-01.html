    <p class="summary" id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[288,546,1175,86]]]'>Frazer, P. J., after stating the facts, found the following conclusions of law:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b532-6" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[282,649,1182,1262]]]'>1. The defendant’s contention is that plaintiff is not entitled to have the land free from the defendant’s railroad siding, because that siding was there at the time of the execution of the lease, and its existence was known to lessor. In other words, that this case is ruled by the line of cases which hold that a purchaser of land, in the absence of an express reservation to the contrary, takes the property subject to any apparent existing servitude.' This is undoubtedly the rule where the servitude is for the benefit of a third party, but where the servitude is for the benefit of the grantor, and no one else, it seems to us a conveyance of the property will extinguish the servitude, unless the same is expressly reserved. In this case, the defendant did not reserve the railway siding in the event of a sale of the premises ; on the contrary, he bound himself to convey by “ title, clear of all encumbrances,” which, as we understand it, means an absolute, entire and unincumbered estate. That such was intended by the parties is further indicated by the fact that the agreement specifically reserves to defendant the use of the siding during term of the lease, and follows that reservation by the clause providing a fee simple title, clear of all incumbrances, in the event of a purchase by the lessee. With the railway siding upon the premises, and the right remaining in defendant and his heirs and assigns to maintain and operate it, the deed tendered does not convey an absolute and unincumbered estate.</p>

The contention of defendant that the deed should be reformed because of the mistake of the scrivener in omitting to reserve the railway siding in the event of the sale of the property, has not, in our opinion, been established. To warrant the reformation of a written instrument, the testimony establishing a mistake must be clear, precise and indubitable, and must establish the fact beyond a reasonable doubt. Here we are unable to say from the testimony that beyond a reasonable doubt there was a mistake made in drawing the agreement. Two gentlemen, both reputable, testify positively on <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>that question. One says there was an omission; the other says there was not. Under those circumstances, the agreement must stand as written.</p>
