Higgins, carried, on the scrap iron business as equal partners in Allegheny City for some time prior to April, 1893, when they moved to and occupied premises in Pittsburg, purchased from J. P. Kohler for $8,000, the title being taken in the name of John P. Higgins. Kohler then owed the firm $5,000 which was credited on the purchase money, and the partnership- business was continued on these premises until the death of Michael Higgins, February 9, 1901. °On the 6th day of May following John P. Higgins made a settlement of the partnership business with Catherine Higgins, but the land purchased from Kohler was not included as part of the firm assets. John P. Higgins subsequently conveyed this land to Lawrence Higgins for a nominal consideration and also devised the same to him and appointed him executor, and having died on April 21,1903, the will was duly probated and letters issued to Lawrence Higgins.</p>

Higgins held the title in trust for it. The defendant denies these averments, and alleges that the first payment was made by John P. Higgins with money or assets withdrawn by him on account of the firm’s indebtedness to him. He then proceeds to state in detail the amount invested by each of the partners, the amounts drawn by each; that John P. Higgins claimed the land as his own, and that Michael Higgins never made objections thereto, nor disputed his right; that the plaintiff and his heirs had full knowledge of the facts for many years prior to Michael Higgins’ death.</p>

Higgins, and in it he avers that he has personal knowledge of all the facts set forth in said answer, and “ that all of said facts are true.” Notwithstanding these averments, however, if it appears that the facts asserted by the defendant are such that he could not have had <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>personal knowledge of them, the answer is not responsive: Ttiegel v.

The defendant must answer every material allegation in the bill whether specially interrogated thereto or not, and unless he states the act or contract fully, as it truly was, how can he conscientiously swear that the facts in his answer are true? Half a fact or half a contract is not the truth. Neither is it true if in truth the terms of a contract are different.”</p>

The only witnesses called by the plaintiff are Jacob P. Kohler and Mrs. "Weaver. The former testified that when John P. Higgins purchased the property in dispute he said, “ I want this deed made out in my name, and I don’t want you to say anything about it.” The latter, who is the niece of Mrs. Higgins, testified in regard to the property that “ John and his 'father always spoke it that they bought it together in partnership.” She also testified in regard to the deed that she heard John say to his father, “ Father, I will make that all right. I did not do it to rob the girls or you, but I don’t want Jim or Tom to get anything, because they are of.no account,” and that the father said “ John, you make that right, or I will put you in the penitentiary.” She does not fix the time that this conversation occurred accurately, but it seems to have been in 1897, four years prior to the death of Michael Higgins.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[292,1146,1176,1163]]]'>John P. Higgins may have requested Kohler not to say anything about the deed being made to him, to conceal the fact from the other members of the family, or from his father as well as them. If the latter were his purpose, and the conversation between him and his father related by Mrs. Weaver indicates it was, the inference is that his father did not know at the time of the purchase that John had withdrawn any of the assets of the firm on account of its indebtedness to him. But as he lived four years after he had obtained knowledge that the title was in John’s name, as shown by Mrs. Weaver’s testimony, without requiring John to make title to the firm, the presumption is that he was satisfied that his son should retain the land, and this circumstance corroborates the answer, as does also the fact that though the administratrix of Michael Higgins, and his next of kin, who are all sui juris, must have known that the title to the property was in John P. Higgins’ name, and that the firm had used it in conducting its business, yet, in 1901, she, acting under advice of her counsel, settled the partnership affairs with John P. Higgins, without any assertion on her or their part that the land was part of the firm’s assets, and they receipted in full for their distributive shares in their father’s estate. Our conclusion, therefore, is that the evidence does not overcome the answer.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[270,397,1177,661]]]'>The answer, wherein it denies that any part of the consideration paid for the real estate in dispute was paid out of the assets of the firm, and avers that the first payment was made by John P. Higgins with money or assets withdrawn by him on account of the firm’s indebtedness to him, is responsive to the bill, and is not overcome by the evidence. The withdrawal by John P. Higgins of firm assets on account of the firm’s indebtedness to him made them his individual property, and although the assets so'withdrawn were applied by him to the purchase of the land in dispute, yet, as they belonged to him, no part of the purchase money was paid by the firm, and it had no interest in the purchase. The bill must therefore be dismissed. Let a decree be drawn accordingly.</p>
