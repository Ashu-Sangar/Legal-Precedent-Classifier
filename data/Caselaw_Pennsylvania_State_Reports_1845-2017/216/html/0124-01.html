The circumstances under which the drafts were issued appear from the auditors’ report and from the testimony taken before them to be as follows: The claimants drew their drafts upon their debtor, one Letzelter, and sent them to the State Bank for collection. Letzelter was a depositor in the State Bank, which with his consent charged them against his account. The bank then issued the drafts in question to the claimants. The auditors have found “ that money to meet the drafts issued by the State Bank on the Hanover National Bank was forwarded to New York from time to time as drafts were drawn by the cashier of the State Bank,” and it also appears that at the time the drafts were issued there was sufficient money in the Hanover National Bank to the credit of the State Bank to meet them. After the failure of the State Bank the receiver stopped payment upon the drafts and withdrew the money from the Hanover National Bank.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[288,451,1177,149]]]'>It is clear that when Letzelter’s account was charged with the drafts which were drawn against it there was no fund created distinct from the general funds of the bank.</p>

This contention assumes, so far as the drafts charged against the depositors’ accounts are concerned, that the charge was made before the money was sent to the Hanover National Bank, while the contrary appears from the testimony. The teller of the bank testifies : “We made them good before we charged them up.” If the money was sent to the Hanover National Bank before the accounts were charged, it could not be said to be the money collected, for until the depositor’s accounts were charged the collection was not in fact made, and that part of the general funds of the State Bank sent to the Hanover National Bank was-not taken from the depositors. We cannot say,, therefore, that the moneys in the Hanover National Bank have been identified as the moneys collected for the holder of the drafts whose original drafts were charged to the depositor’s accounts. Nor are we prepared to say that the sending of moneys to the Hanover National Bank to pay any of the drafts is an identification of the moneys collected by the State Bank for the claimants. It is true that the moneys were intended by the State Bank to be used in the payments of the amounts collected for the claimants, and in place of the moneys collected, but the circumstances fall short of identifying them as the moneys which the bank held as their agent. Unless identified, it is manifest the moneys cannot be successfully claimed by them. It is needless to refer to the authorities which announce the doctrine with respect to tracing a trust fund. But it may be observed that in Freiberg v. Stoddard, <a href="/pa/161/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="161 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="854195" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0259-01">161 Pa. 259</a>, the depositor’s account was charged with the amount of the draft drawn upon him and the bank’s draft upon another bank issued to the drawer; nevertheless no preference <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>was allowed, although, in that case it was evident from the transaction itself that the moneys drawn upon were intended to be a substitute for the moneys collected.</p>
