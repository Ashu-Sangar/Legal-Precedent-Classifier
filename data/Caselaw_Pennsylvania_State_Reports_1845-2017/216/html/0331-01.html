Forquer, the proponent, and two brothers, several sisters and children of a deceased sister, who are the appellants. On November 10,1882, which was about one year after his marriage to his said wife, being about to go on a journey to Montana to visit a sick brother, he wrote and signed a last will and testament, without attestation by subscribing witnesses. By profession he was an attorney at law and for many years before his death was a prominent member of the bar of Butler county. The will, when made, was committed to the keeping of his said wife, while absent on the journey to Montana. On his return, according to the evidence, he made inquiry of his wife for the will, read it to her and then placed it in his office safe, where it remained, except when taken out by him on occasion for examination, until a short time before his death, during his last illness, when, at his request it was brought and read to him by his wife, in the presence of a young woman then residing in the house, and after expressing satisfaction with its contents, he committed it to the custody of his wife until such time as it would be necessary to probate it.</p>

The reference to the proposed journey seems but a statement of his reason for the making of his will at that time. It belongs to that class of phrases so often found in the introductory language of wills, such as “ Knowing the uncertainty of life,” etc. And we think it may be safely said that if the will had ended here no doubt could arise as to its absolute character. But the language which follows seems to gather up all that has gone before and to express it in another form. Did the testator intend that it should also,have a different meaning? The dispositions thus far made carry his whole estate to his wife, without any suggestion of their being contingent in character. Did he intend by the language which immediately follows to undo the absolute disposition already made of his whole estate, and attach a condition which would make their efficacy contingent on his death occurring during the time of his contemplated journey ?</p>

Can the will as a whole, by any reasonable interpretation, be made to speak as of the time of testator’s death, whenever it might occur, or does it, on the. other hand, clearly appear from the will itself that it was only intended to become of effect in the event of testator’s death during his contemplated journey ?

In the case before us the language expressive of the contingency is “ and should anything befall me while away or that I should die,” etc. The expression “ should anything befall me while away,” standing alone, is clearly contingent. It evidently refers to the possible death of the testator while away, as no other event could befall him which would give effect to the disposition of his estate which he was then making. The testator would have expressed the same thought had he said, “ And should death overtake me while away.” It clearly refers to his possible death while on his journey. We may well suppose that the testator, by the disjunctive expression which follows, “ or that I should die,” meant to add something to what he had already said. He had already provided for the contingency of death while on the journey. We may assume that he meant to add something by the use of the language which followed, and if so, that he meant to make provision against the event of his death whenever it might occur. By the use of the disjunctive “ or ” the provision which follows excludes the thought that immediately preceded, and has, we think, the same force and meaning as <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>if it stood alone. To give it the meaning contended for by the appellants we would have to interpolate the qualifying expression, “while away,” used in the preceding clause. But what warrant have we for doing this in order to give to the instrument a contingent character, which, if it exist, must clearly arise out of the writing as it stands ? In other words, we conclude (1) that it does not clearly appear from the will itself that its operation was intended to be contingent and (2) that it can, by a reasonable interpretation of its language, be construed to be absolute rather than contingent, and in either event, under the authorities, it is entitled to probate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b369-5" data-blocks='[["BL_369.4",369,[118,921,1180,354]]]'>This conclusion has been arrived at from a consideration of the language of the will itself unaided by extrinsic evidence. The character of a will, as being contingent or not contingent in its operation, depends on the intention of the testator as expressed in the will itself without the aid of extrinsic evidence in the form of subsequent declarations made by the testator in an incidental way, as to the disposition of his property.</p>

Without doubt, too, the careful preservation of a regularly executed will up to the time of death is of importance in the construction of a subsequent paper of doubtful testamentary import, an instance of which is found in Jacoby’s Estate, <a href="/pa/190/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="190 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="905147" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0382-01">190 Pa. 382</a>. But we have not been referred to any authority which holds that the- character of a will, as being contingent or otherwise, may be determined or any doubt thereof solved by the introduction of extrinsic circumstances such as those referred to. The court, in a proper case, may be aided by evidence of the circumstances surrounding testator at the time of making his will, so as to put itself as <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>nearly as possible in his place at the time the will was executed, but even this cannot be permitted to affect the construction when the language is clear and unambiguous. To be governed or even aided by the subsequent declarations of a testator in determining his intentions as already written in his will would be a precedent attended with much danger, tending to inject into the will an patent possibly not written therein and thus to depart from the strictness of the rule which requires wills to be in writing. The meaning of the language of the will might thus be made to depend, in some degree, not on the intention of the testator at the time the will was executed, but on what he afterward said about it under circumstances in which no testamentary import should be predicated of his words.</p>

The question at issue is not whether a will had, in fact, been.- made, but what is the meaning of a will admittedly made. Whatever doubt exists as to its meaning is not introduced by extrinsic circumstances, but is frqm within.

The evidence, however, of what took place at that time is uncontradicted and is sufficient to establish a republication of the will, and the will so republished is, we think, relieved of the <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>contingency expressed therein, the event having been passed. This would seem not only reasonable, but to be supported by authority.
