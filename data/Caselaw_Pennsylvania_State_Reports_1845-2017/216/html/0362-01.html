But the plaintiffs’ contention raises a question of law that is both novel and interesting, and if sustained by the highest court of our state would revolutionize the manner of developing oil and gas leaseholds. “ What the law ought to be ” and “ what the law is ” are different questions. The Supreme Court, ignoring the principié of stare decisis, on account of changed conditions or for any reason justifying it, may declare “ what ought to be the law ” to be henceforth “ the law,” but the lower courts have no such authority ; our duty is to follow the lead of the decisions, not to qualify, explain, modify, overrule or reverse them.</p>

Mr. Justice Wiliams, in Wettengel v. Gormley, <a href="/pa/160/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="160 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="852194" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0559-01">160 Pa. 559</a>, in discussing this question so far as it relates to oil, says: “ It is well understood among oil operators that the fluid is deposited in a porous sand rock, at a distance ranging from 500 to 3,000 feet below the surface. This rock is saturated throughout its extent with oil and when the hard stratum overlying it is pierced by the drill the oil and gas find vent and are forced by the pressure , to which they are subject into and through the well to the sur<a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>face.” “An oil or gas well may draw its product from an indefinite distance and in time exhaust a large space. Exact knowledge on this subject is not at present attainable, but the vagrant character of the mineral and the porous sand rock in which it is found and through which it moves, fully justify the general conclusion we have stated above and have led to its general adoption by practical operators.” \</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b395-3" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[113,729,1196,1345]]]'>“ The right of every landowner to drill a well on his own land at whatever spot he may see fit ” certainly must be conceded. If then the landowner drills on his own land at such a spot as best subserves his purposes what is the standing of the adjoining1 landowner whose oil or gas may be drained by this well ? He certainly ought not to be allowed to stop his neighbor from developing his own farm. There is no certain way of ascertaining how much of the oil and gas that comes out of the well was when in situ under this farm and how much under that. What then has been held to be the law ? — it is this, as we understand it, every landowner or his lessee may locate his wells wherever he pleases regardless of the interests of others. He may distribute them over the whole farm or locate them only on one part of it. He may crowd the adjoining farms so as to enable him to draw the oil and gas from them. What, then can the neighbor do? Nothing, only go and do likewise. He must protect his own oil and gas. He knows it is wild and will run away if it finds an opening and it is his business to keep it at home. This may not be the best rule, but neither the legislature nor our highest court has given us any better. No doubt many thousands of dollars have been expended “ in protecting lines ” in oil and gas territory that would not have been expended if some rule had existed by which it could have been avoided. Injunction certainly is not the remedy. If so, just how far niust the landowner be from the line of his neighbor to avoid the blow of “ this strong arm of the law ” ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[115,2083,1181,292]]]'>This brings us to the second question in the case, and that is this, “Will a lessee who has a lease on each of two adjoining farms be enjoined at the instance of one of the landowners from drilling a well on the farm of the other at such a point as will drain most of the gas that it produces from the land of the first? ”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.6",395,[163,2395,1134,42]],["BL_396.1",396,[299,364,1219,506]]]'>This question, has in it an element that is not in the other <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>and that grows out of the fact the landowners have a common ' lessee. We think it is well settled that the lessee has the same rights in regard to the locating of his wells as the landowner would have if doing the operating, but he cannot take advantage of the fact that he has leases on adjoining farms so as to fraudulently deprive either of his lessors of his royalty or annual gas rental. (^The law of this position is found in Kleppner ‘ v.

    <p class="summary" id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[296,882,1229,1133]]]'>The drilling of the well by the defendant company at. the point they did on the James B. Barnard farm was not as we have seen a fraud per se or simply because it would, drain gas from the plaintiffs’ farm; it might become a fraud because of something other than the drilling of this well, and that would be in refusing to develop or protect the plaintiffs’ farm. ' But I it appears that the defendant company soon after they drilled a well in£“the angle” of]the James B. Barnard farm alsp located and drilled to completion a well injpr near “an angle , of the plaintiffs’ farm where'he would have gotten some of the . gas of his neighbor on the other side of his farm had it been a producing well. The fact that this well proved a dry hole in no way militates against the defendant company’s effort to do . ’ the fair thing, as between it and the <em>plaintiffs.''¡A </em>Well on each farm, and James B. Barnard’s farm twice as large as that of' the plaintiffs’, does not show partiality toward James B. Bar- , nard. We are clearly of the opinion thatj there was no such fraud on the part of the defendant company in the premises as, would entitle the plaintiffs to either an injunction or an accounting for damages done by draining gas from their farm through the James B.
