    <p id="b414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[305,882,1184,754]]]'>What occurred immediately before the shooting, and the effect it was likely to have on the mind of the defendant, who was eighteen years old, is best shown by his own account of it. He testified: “ While he was sitting there and talking about the money, finally he came there and took hold of me by the coat and he said, ‘ Come on outside ; I want to talk to you.’ "When we got out on the front porch, he grabbed me by the breast and he said, ‘ Well, are. you going to give me the money or not ? ’ And he placed his hand in his pocket on the inside of his coat and I saw that stiletto, and he said, ‘ Didn’t I tell you that this stiletto is going to kill you to-day?’ When he had hold of his stiletto that way and said he was about to kill me then, I said, ‘ I am going to give you the money.’ He says, ‘ No, I don’t want the money now,’ and he pulled out his stiletto to strike me.”</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[304,1655,1181,669]]]'>If the jurors believed the defendant’s statement they might have found that the shooting was done without malice and under the influence of sudden anger, caused by the assault, or of terror caused by the threat to be carried into immediate execution. It was, therefore, error to refuse an instruction as to manslaughter and to instruct the jury that the defendant, having admitted the shooting, was guilty of murder unless he did it in self-defense. This testimony was not limited to the plea of self-defense ; it went directly to the mitigation of the crime. Where a homicide is committed without malice, and under the influence of sudden passion due to an adequate cause, the law mitigates the offense and reduces it from murder to manslaughter.</p>
