He gave the power to use the principal in words in themselves and in their context equally applicable to both the real and the personal estate, and then he clinched that meaning by the direction to the executor at her death to sell “ all my real and personal estate not used by my wife in her lifetime.” He thus twice classed the real and personal estate together, made no distinction between them in his provision for his wife’s power over them, and intended that no such distinction should be made.</p>

Put in none of these cases did the will contain the efficient language of the present, classing the real and personal property together as the subject of the pbwer to use. In all of them the power to use, i. e., convey the real estate, was sought to be inferred from the gift over of “ what remains,” pr “what shall be left” or “so much as may remain unexpended ” or similar phrases. None of such cases therefore is a close precedent as to the language of this will, even if we overlook, as we certainly never should, the caution of Sharswood, J., in Fox’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/99/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="99 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="446165" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0382-01">99 Pa. 382</a>. “ Every will is to be construed from its four corners to arrive at the true intention of the testator. Decisions upon other wills may assist, but cannot control the construction.”</p>
