When the policies were received they were not examined immediately by defendants, and in the interim a fire took place. The compames paid only half the amount of the loss. The defense was that in previous years plaintiffs’ plant had been insured under joint policies with other property of a firm closely connected with plaintiffs as to which property the warranty would have been good, and the list of policies furnished for the New York brokers did not clearly distinguish the properties on which it was now desired to have separate insurance. Secondly, defendants claimed that even if they had examined the policies and observed the error at once on receipt, it would have been <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>unavailing as the fire occurred before the mistake could have been corrected. <em>Held, </em>that the case was for the jury and that a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.</p>
