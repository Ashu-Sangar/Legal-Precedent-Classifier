As a tenant from year to year, his term was too brief to justify the court in charging him with the expense of the improvement, while the temporary character of the work, requiring repeated renewals during a lifetime, indicated the injustice of charging it upon the remainder-men or the reversioners. Such a structure is properly chargeable upon the tenant for life.”</p>

He was the “owner” of the lot in contemplation of the act of 1851, whose duty it was to lay the pavement. In the absence of the statutory provision for enforcing payment of the claim, the borough could have brought a personal action against the life tenant, and recovered a general judgment which would have been a lien on all his real estate, and for which it could have been sold on an appropriate execution. ’ The remainder-men, on the other hand, were not liable personally for the debt, nor could their estates in the premises have been subjected in any way to the claim for laying the pavement.</p>

Unless, therefore, a lien filed to enforce a claim against the life tenant for paving a sidewalk is to be extended so as to subject other estates than those bound by mechanics’ liens, the lien in this case would not subject the estates of the remainder-men to payment of the borough’s claim for paving the sidewalk in front of the premises sold on this lien. Here, the remainder-men were not in possession of the lot and had no right to the possession at the time the improvement was made.</p>
    <p id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[292,1777,1176,606]],["BL_527.1",527,[112,361,1182,1635]]]'>There is and can be no sufficient reason assigned for extending a lien for paving a sidewalk beyond that of a mechanic’s lien, and for holding that the estates of the remainder-men in the property liened can be subjected to the payment of the claim. As we have seen, the duty to pave was on the life tenant. He was in possession of the premises and was required to make the improvement. He was the “ owner ” in contemplation of the act of 1851, as held by this court, who was required to pave the walk on request of the borough authorities. The act gives no authority to the borough to require the paving to be done by the remainder-men, for the reason, first, that it is the duty of the life tenant to pave, and, <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>second, that the remainder-men were not in possession and had no right to the possession of the premises, and hence could not have done the paving if required by the borough. When the act of 1851 was passed, authorizing boroughs to require the owners of lots to pave sidewalks, it must be assumed that the legislature knew of the act of 1840 restricting a mechanic’s lien to the estate of the party in possession of the premises. It was therefore manifestly intended by the act of 1851 to give the borough the authority to require the owner in actual or constructive possession to lay the pavement on the footwalk, and on his refusal to do so, to enforce payment of the expenses by a lien and proceedings thereon against his estate, as provided in the mechanic’s lien law. The provision of the act of 1851 providing the procedure for enforcing a claim for paving a footwalk did not create a lien or, an indebtedness for the improvement against the remainder-men or any other owner of an interest in the premises, but simply, provided a remedy against the life tenant’s interest in the premises, in the language of the act itself, “ to collect the cost of the work and materials .... from said owners.” In fact, if we hold that remainder-men can be required to make such an improvement, and thereby perform the duty and assume the liability of the life tenant, we are confronted with the absurd proposition that they can be legally required to do something — enter upon the premises and pave — when they are not in possession of the premises, and would be trespassers if they entered to do the work. And, further, it would be recognizing as sound the principle, condemned in Waters v. Wolf, <a href="/pa/162/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="162 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="856738" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0153-01">162 Pa. 153</a>, that the legislature has the power to compel one man to pay the indebtedness of another without a contract, express or implied, on the part of the former. Such an interpretation of the act of 1851 clearly discloses its own refutation.</p>

A demand and refusal are essential to sustain a claim under the act of 1851; and the borough has no right to collect either the cost or the penalty without a previous demand and refusal: Mt. Pleasant Borough v. B. &amp;. O. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/138/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="138 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="11251996" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0365-01">138 Pa. 365</a>. We do not think the lien avers notice to the remainder-men. It alleges that <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>the claim was filed for $42.19, “ being a debt due the borough of Tarentum by said James Kennedy, Sr., Samuel Meanor, Ann Meanor’s heirs and others unknown, owners and reputed owners.” It then avers that the paving was done “ upon the failure of said James Kennedy et al., to do the same, and after due and regular notice to them so to do.” This is wholly insufficient as an averment of notice to the remainder-men. We are asked to infer that the words “et al.” refer to Ann Meanor’s heirs. But whether they mean “ and another ” or “ and others ” is indeterminable, and if either, whether they refer to other persons who have been named in the preceding part of the lien, or to persons other than those named therein. It is simply a guess as to the persons who were intended by these words in the averment. As the right to file a lien and the consequent right to take property and apply it to the payment of the debt depend upon notice to the parties sought to be charged, it follows that such notice should clearly and plainly be made to appear and not be left to inference. While it has been held that notice need not be averred in the statement or lien, yet we have distinctly ruled that notice to the owner is a prerequisite to the validity of a lien for paving a sidewalk. It is therefore essential that the borough show unequivocally and certainly that notice to pave was given the owner before it is in a position to compel him to pay for the improvement by the special remedy provided by the act of 1851. Here, the lien itself as well as the record of the trial of the scire facias issued on the lien failed to show any notice to the remainder-men to pave the footwalk, and hence the lien as to them is of no validity and is void.</p>

But it is difficult to see that any judgment was entered or could be entered against the remainder-men on the scire facias. The judgment, as noted above, was entered against James Kennedy, Sr., Samuel Meanor, and Ann Meanor’s heirs. The remainder-men are alleged to be the heirs of Ann Meanor, deceased, but their names do not appear in any of the proceedings from the filing of the lien to the deed to the sheriff’s grantee. And none of them was served with notice to lay the pavement or was made a party to or served with <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>the scire facias or alias scire facias issued on the lien. A judgment was very properly entered against Kennedy, who owned the life estate, as he had due notice of every step throughout the entire proceedings. Upon the judgment against the life tenant, his interest in the real estate could properly be sold. The proceeding on the claim was, as we have seen, to enforce a personal debt due the borough from him and not from the remainder-men. If they had been duly notified and had refused, and a judgment had been obtained against them upon a scire facias duly served, there would be some grounds for the defendants’ contention that they were concluded by the judgment and sheriff’s sale of the premises. Or if this was strictly a proceeding in rem for paving the roadway or the like and the claim was a lien on the lot itself, it might well be that the judgment, obtained upon a constructive service of the sci. fa., would be suificient to authorize a sale of the property. But here, there was no notice to the remainder-men to pave the walk and no service of the sci. fa. on the remainder-men. To permit a judgment to stand and be the basis of the sale of the defendants’ real estate under such circumstances, would be to deprive a party of his property without due process of law. By failure to serve the remainder-men, the court could acquire no jurisdiction over them, and hence a judgment entered against them would be void. Although this was a statutory proceeding to make the owner’s real estate liable for a debt, it was simply for the purpose of enforcing a claim due from him to the borough, and not a debt imposed upon the land which was sold on the lien. This distinction, as suggested above, is material in determining the validity of the sale upon which it is claimed the interests of the remainder-men in the property were sold.</p>

But there is nothing in the case whatever showing that either of these men, if different individuals, was a remainder-man, or that either of them was J. B. Meanor, a remainder-man and one of the plaintiffs in this action. Hence, there is nothing in this record to show that J. B. Meanor, one of the heirs of <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>Ann Meanor, deceased, and a plaintiff here, was notified to lay the pavement on the footwalk or was served with any writ of scire facias issued on the lien filed against the property. The record shows that no judgment was entered against J. B. Meanor on the scire facias issued on the lien. These facts make it apparent that his interest in the property was not subjected to the lien by the borough, nor bound by the judgment on which the property was sold.</p>
