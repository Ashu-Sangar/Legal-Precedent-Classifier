An issue was framed and certified from the orphans’ court into the court of common pleas to determine the validity of said lease; a jury was waived and the ease submitted to the court for trial under the Act of April 22, 1874, P..L. 109. The widow, Elizabeth A.

      <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>This sentence as it stands alone is plain and free from ambiguity, but as applied to the lease upon which it is indorsed and the evidence in connection therewith is not plain, but ambiguous and requires parol evidence to construe it. Reading it by its letter and considering it alone it is possible that it could be construed as merely to refer to and extend the provision in the lease so as to be ready to ship coal from the land of Boston Gardner on or before August 1,1900. The evidence shows that mining operations on the Boston Gardner farm were not commenced until May, 1900, and on June 2,1900, the time had already expired by the letter of the lease by which the lessees were to be ready to ship coal from the Boston Gardner land, but the mining of coal on the Murray lease did not expire until February 1, 1901. The evidence also shows that W. P. Murray knew that in order to mine coal from under his farm on this lease, it was necessary first to go through the coal on the Boston Gardner farm. What is meant by this written extension or the effect thereof, is not clear; neither does ¿the evidence of what was said and done by the parties at the time of the execution of this extension on June 2, 1900, make it absolutely clear how long the time was to be extended for mining coal on the W. P. Murray lease; as to whether it extended it from February 1, 1901, to June 2, 1902, as stated by H. F. Miller, or two years from August 1, 1900. However, it is clear, in our opinion, from the evidence, that the parties to this lease both did consider this extension to mean that the W. P. Murray lease was in full force and effect after the time limited in the original lease, to wit: February 1, 1901, and in view of the written extension, we think that the construction placed thereon by the parties should control.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b302-6" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[269,1909,1184,459]]]'>It was shown that the entry in the coal mine reached the W. P.

Murray lease, which was reached through one of the rooms from the Gardner farm on April 28,1902, within less than two years from the time of the extension on June 2,1900, and that the lessee mailed this check to W.

The lease would only be evidence of the contract between the parties and the mere surrender of the paper would not alter or change the rights of the different parties thereunder. The evidence shows that at the time W. A. Hindman, Esq., wrote the letter, on December 28, 1901, to C. J. Tighe, one of the lessees, he was not attorney for the widow, Elizabeth A. Murray, and had no authority to represent her and, therefore, his acts in reference to obtaining this new lease and the surrender of the old lease would not be binding upon her, and it is not now contended by the defendant to the contrary. The letter from <em>W. </em>A. Hindman, Esq., and the testimony of R. H. Murray, allege a forfeiture in the lifetime of W. P. Murray, deceased, not because the lessees had not reached the Murray coal .at the time of the alleged surrender of the old lease, but there is no competent evidence to sustain a forfeiture by W. P. Murray.</p>
