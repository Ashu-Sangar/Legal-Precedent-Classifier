While so attempting he was carried violently against a telegraph pole which was fifteen inches from the side of the car. The evidence established that except for the telegraph poles on one side, both sides of the car were alike under ordinary conditions, with respect to convenience and safety in alighting. It appeared, however, that the company had been relaying its tracks, and had deposited the old rails on the side of the track on which there were no poles. The plaintiff knew of this fact, and also saw at the time of the accident that the rails were covered with snow. He testified that it was the additional danger resulting from the rails being concealed by the snow that determined him to attempt to alight from the other side, since the danger there was open and exposed and was susceptible of some sort of measurement. <em>Held, </em>that the case was for the jury, and that a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff should be sustained.</p>

Since the several propositions advanced upon the argument in support of these assignments were framed without reference to this important and qualifying feature of the case, they may be regarded as abstract, requiring no discussion here. Whether a presumption of negligence arises from the mere fact, disassociated from all others in the case, that the telegraph pole with which the plaintiff came in contact was so erected and maintained that between it and the top of the car upon which the plaintiff was engaged, there was a space of only fifteen inches; or whether, <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>having shown so much, the burden still rested on the plaintiff to show actual negligence, were not the questions the court had to consider in ruling on the points submitted.

While so attempting he was carried violently against a telegraph pole at the side, with the result that he was seriously injured. A like ladder was on the other side of the car where no telegraph poles were to be encountered. Except for these telegraph poles, both sides, under ordinary and usual conditions, were alike with respect to convenience and safety in alighting. There was no rule or regulation requiring the one to be used rather than the other, the employee being free to choose either, determining for himself according to conditions existing at the time. On the day of the accident, when the plaintiff reached the point where he attempted to alight, he encountered unusual and extraordinary conditions, which, according to his testimony, put him to the choice between two methods of alighting, both of which were manifestly dangerous. The defendant company at this point had been relaying its tracks, and had deposited the old rails which had been replaced, in _ the open space at the side of the track on which there were no poles. Plaintiff knew this fact, for on a previous occasion, when these rails were under his observation, he attempted to alight on that side, had fallen on them, and been injured by them. When the accident here complained of' <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>happened, the rails were covered with snow, and the hazard of alighting on that side was thereby very considerably increased. Plaintiff distinctly testified that it was this danger, resulting from the rails being concealed then by the snow, that determined him to attempt the other side, since the danger there being open and exposed, was susceptible of some sort of measurement. In view of this testimony it became a question, not whether the telegraph line in its construction at that point, corresponded to the standard observed and adopted by railroads generally along curves such as was here, but whether, in view of the peculiarly hazardous duties required of the plaintiff at this point, and the use to which defendant had appropriated the other side of the track, making it also a dangerous place to alight upon from a moving train, it was negligence in the defendant to maintain a telegraph pole at this particular point, which at the height of the car was only fifteen inches removed therefrom. If by so doing the plaintiff was subjected to dangers which in good faith the defendant ought to have provided against, it was negligence; but this question could only be determined upon a consideration of all the facts of the case, and these were for the jury to find. Careful instructions as to the application of the law to the facts were required for a proper determination; and these were given. There was no error in refusing the binding instructions prayed for.</p>

Whether the evidence sought to be elicited from the witness, Dr. Gloninger, would or would not have been competent, need not be considered. The record shows that the witness was interrupted in his answer to the question by a timely objection which prevented him from repeating anything that had been told him by the plaintiff.</p>
