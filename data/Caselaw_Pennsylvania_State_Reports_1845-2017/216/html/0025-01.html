    <p id="b56-12" data-blocks='[["BL_56.22",56,[263,1644,1182,613]]]'>Plaintiff’s claim in this case was for removing certain prisoners, in pursuance of sentences and orders of the court, from the jail of Cambria county to the Western Penitentiary, the Dixmont Insane Asylum, the Polk Institute and the Hunting-don Reformatory, respectively. For these services he claimed fees under the Act of July 11,1901, P. L. 663, as follows: six cents per mile for each mile actually traveled by each prisoner ; ten cents per mile circular for each mile actually traveled or necessary to be traveled by plaintiff himself in case each sentence were separately executed, and for his assistants $4.00 each per day, three cents per mile circular for each mile traveled, and actual expenses necessary for such help.</p>
    <p id="b56-13" data-blocks='[["BL_56.23",56,[263,2266,1178,250]],["BL_57.1",57,[127,368,1180,98]]]'>Defendant contended (1) that the fees of the sheriff for the services upon which his claim was based, were to be determined,, not by the act of 1901, but by the Act of April 2, 1868, P. L. 3; and (2) if the act of 1901 is to govern, then the sheriff can claim mileage upon only one of several cotemporaneous com<a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>mitments, and cannot claim $4.00 per day each of his deputies, as charged by him.</p>
    <p id="b57-3" data-blocks='[["BL_57.4",57,[123,472,1185,1591]]]'>The Superior Court held that “ the act of 1901 is so in conflict with the act of 1868, that the latter must fall as to the questions raised in this suit,” and therefore the fees were to be determined by the act of 1901. Also that the sheriff was entitled to charge his own mileage for each mile circular traveled by him, at the rate of ten cents per mile, and to charge this rate upon each commitment, whether cotemporaneous or not, and also to charge for reasonable help and expens.es in transporting and delivering convicts and lunatics to the penitentiary, asylum, etc. It was held, however, that it was a question for the jury as to what were reasonable help and expenses, and because this question was taken from the jury by the trial judge, the judgment was reversed and a new venire awarded. The decision of the Superior Court is amply buttressed by the reasoning of the opinion and the authorities therein cited, and we can add but little thereto. We are clear that the earlier act is inconsistent with the later one, and as the act of 1868 was a general law, it was evidently intended that its provisions should be repealed by the act of 1901. The latter statute fixes the fees “ for executing any process, warrant, capias, attachment, decree, sentence or order of court, where the defendant’s body is to be taken into custody.” This language is broad enough to cover the execution of a sentence committing a convict to the penitentiary or reformatory, and of an order committing a lunatic or feeble-minded person to an asylum. But we do not find any provision in the act of 1901 authorizing the sheriff to make a charge of • $4.00 per day for deputies used in the transportation of prisoners. Clearly there can be no charge of this character unless the law expressly authorizes it. The act of 1868 did have such a provision, but it was not retained in the act of 1901.</p>

It does seem <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>to be an abuse, to permit tbe sheriff to collect from the same party, the county, duplicate charges for mileage, in cases where a number of writs or orders of court are placed in his hands, to be executed at the same time and by a single trip. But the language of the act bears no other construction, and the remedy must, therefore, be applied by the legislature and not by the courts.</p>
