J., specially presiding, after disposing of a question as to domicile of testator.\nThe next matter that requires attention is the question of law, whether the paper of October 25, 1901, is the valid last will and testament of Lucius S. Beaumont, deceased.\nThe testator kept a \u201c Journal Cash Book\u201d which is headed on the first page \u201c Cash Acct L. Beaumont et al.,\u201d in which the first entry was made February 1, 1890, and the last entry on November 15, 1903, on page 117. The alleged last will and testament offered and admitted to probate, was written on pages 79 and 80 of this book, on October 25, 1901. The date of the last entry immediately before this one, was December 4, 1894, and the date of the next entry after October 25, 1901, is November 4, 1901. The entire entries of the date of October 25, 1901, are offered, for probate as the will/\u2019 except the entry at the head of page 81 which reads as follows :\n\u201c L. S. Beaumont et al.\n\u201c1901.- Oct. 25 By Balance . . . 7825.37\u201d\nIs said paper invalid as the last will and testament of L. S. Beaumont because not signed at the end thereof as required by the Act of April 8, 1833, sec. 6, P. L. 249 ? When the above entry on page 81 was made,j we do not know except from its date, but we do know that it does not dispose of any of the property of the testator, and its only purpose is to carry forward the balance on page 80 for the convenience of the bookkeeper. We can say of this will as was said of the will of Elizabeth Phile Stott, by the Supreme Court in Wikoff\u2019s Appeal, 15 Pa. 281, where the testator wrote after her signature, \u201c This will was commenced in the year of our Lord 1843 and added to as occasion occurred.\u201d In speaking of these words written after the signature of the testator, the Supreme Court said: \u201c The matter in it bore neither on the contents of the will nor on its interpretation. It was not testamentary, and it was no more a part of the will than the label on the back of it.\u201d\nThe authorities are clear that if the testator had disposed of any part of his estate, however small, by words written after his signature, it would have invalidated the will. But such is not the fact in this will.\nIs the paper of October 25,1901, as admitted to probate, testamentary in character ? Whatever the form of the instrument is, if it vests no present interest in the donee but only appoints what is to be done after the death of the testator, it is a testamentary instrument: Turner v. Scott, 51 Pa. 126.\nComparing the paper before us with that passed upon by the Supreme Court in Tozer v. Jackson, 164 Pa. 373, we have no doubt that it is testamentary. The interpretation of the paper is for the court. It disposes of all the testator\u2019s personal property, and the testimony shows he had no real estate. It is clear that he did not intend to make a present gift of all his personal property, for, if he had, there is no reason why he should not have done so, instead of retaining possession for upwards of two years, and only making the entry in his private journal. He also points out in the paper the specific fund out of which his funeral expenses shall be paid, and expresses a desire as to the disposal of his body after death. Every fact surrounding the transaction shows that the property should not pass hi praesenti as a gift, but should only become effective at his death.\nAs we have heretofore found, Lucius S. Beaumont, at the time he made the paper in dispute, to wit: on October 25, 1901, was domiciled in the state of New York; at the time of his death he was domiciled at Butler, Pa. The Revised Statutes of New York, title \u201cWills,\u201d vol. 3, sec. 8,inter alia,provide in regard to wills : \u201c There shall be at least two attesting witnesses, each of whom shall sign his name as a witness, at the end of the will, at the request of the testator.\u201d This provision of the law is not complied with. But it is not necessary to have attesting witnesses to a will in Pennsylvania. By the laws of which state shall this will be governed ? Does it speak from the date of its execution or from the date of the death of the testator? ^\nAs early as the case of Desesbats v. Berquier, 1 Binn. 336, it was held in Pennsylvania that \u201c A will of personal property must be executed according to the law of the testator\u2019s domicile at the time of his death.\u201d The court cited many authorities to show that succession to the personal estate, whether by law or the act of the testator, is to be regulated by the law of the country in which he was a domiciled inhabitant at the time of his death, without any regard whatever to the place of birth or death, or the situation of the property at that time. So far as we have been able to find, this case has. never been overruled or-modified, and is decisive of the question now before us. It is cited with approval by Judge Denio, in Moultrie v. Hunt, 23 N. Y. 394 (court of appeals), where it is held that, The law is that the jurisdiction in which the instrument was signed and attested is of no consequence, but its validity must be determined according to the domicile of the testator at the time of his death.\u201d Hence we conclude:\n1. That the place of domicile of Lucius - S. Beaumont at the time of his death, to wit: November 29, 1903, was\u2019not the city and state of New York, but was the borough of Butler, Pa.\n3. The paper writing of October 25, 1901, is the valid last will and testament of Lucius S. Beaumont, deceased.\n4. That the place of domicile of Lucius S. Beaumont, deceased, on October 25, 1901, was New York city, N. Y.\nAnd now, October 20, 1905, the decree of the register admitting to probate the last will and testament of Lucius S. Beaumont, dated October 25, 1901, is sustained and affirmed, and the appeal from said decree is refused and dismissed at the cost of the petitioners.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nT. C. Campbell, with him- Charles W. Fuller, Wm. Findlay\nJanuary 7, 1907:\nBrown, Walter Lyon, Charles M. McKee, H. Walton Mitchell and Alex. A. Patterson, for appellants.\nLev. MoQuistion, with, him John II. Wilson and C. L. McQuisiion, for appellee."
