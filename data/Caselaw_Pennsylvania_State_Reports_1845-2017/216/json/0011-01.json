        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Potter,\nCounsel for appellants have here advanced the proposition that by the mere transfer of his interest in the good will of the business, the defendant was precluded from entering into a similar business in the same town, and prosecuting it in competition with the old firm, of which he had been a member. The position is wholly untenable. \u201c Good will \u201d has been defined by Judge Cooley as the favor which the management of a business has won from the public, and the probability that old customers will continue their patronage: Chittenden v* Witbeck, 50 Mich. 401; and Lord Eldon in Cruttwell v. Lye, 17 Yes. Jr. 385, spoke of it as \u201c simply the probability that old customers will resort to the old place.\u201d There is a very ample discussion of this question by the supreme court of Michigan, and a full citation of the authorities bearing on the point in Williams v. Farrand, reported in 14 L. R. A. 161. It is there said, \u201c the doctrine that a retiring partner who has conveyed his interest in an established business, whether the good will be included or not, cannot personally solicit the old customers of the firm, has no support in principle. A retiring partner conveys in addition to bis interest in the tangible effects, simply the advantage that an established business possesses over a new enterprise.\u201d\nIn the present case the contract for the sale of defendant\u2019s interest in the business was in writing, and we do not find in it anything which can be construed into an agreement by the defendant to refrain from engaging in a similar business, under his own name.\nAn agreement to retire from business, and not to resume it again, is in restraint of trade, and cannot rest upon mere inference : Hall\u2019s Appeal, 60 Pa. 458. So long as the defendant does not attempt to sell his goods as those of the old firm, or represent that his business is a continuation of the old firm, he is at liberty to engage under his own name, honestly and in good faith, in the same line of business and in the same locality.\nWe think the learned judge of the court below was entirely correct in his statement of the third conclusion of law, in which he says, \u201c The defendant is not deprived of the right to use his own name in connection with the conduct of his business simply from the fact that his surname is a portion of the trade-mark used by the copartnership of which he was formerly a member, and whose business has been continued by plaintiffs.\u201d And in the further comment made by him in overruling the exception to this finding, as follows: \u201c He has no right to use said name for the purpose of misleading the public or to induce persons to deal with him in the belief that they are dealing with or acquiring the product of the old firm, or its successors in business. He also has the same right to hold himself out as the person who invented or originated the kind of wares he offers for sale, subject to the same limitations.\u201d And in this connection it appears that the court below found as a fact, upon evidence which seems to us sufficient, that the defendant had not in this respect infringed upon or violated the rights of the plaintiffs.\nSo too in deciding the remaining question in this case, as to whether the defendant has so imitated the trade-mark or labels of the plaintiffs as to interfere unfairly with their business, or deceive the public, the court below has applied a well-established rule, and has found that \u201c the trade-mark or labels used by defendant are not so similar to those of plaintiffs in appearance, or in the sound and connection of the words, as are likely to cause a person of ordinary intelligence, using ordinary caution, in making purchases to be misled.\u201d\nThis finding is really the gist of the whole case, for if the action of the defendant has deceived or is likely to deceive purchasers, so that they have purchased or will probably accept the goods of the defendant under the mistaken notion that they are those of the plaintiffs, then the defendant should be enjoined from any such use of the labels. But measured by this well-established rule, it does not appear from the evidence, that the defendant has in any sense offended. A comparison of the labels of the respective parties shows such marked and striking differences that no one who has eyes to see with, and uses them, can fail to notice the differences. We cannot see that the similarity is sufficient to convey a false impression, or to mislead the ordinary purchaser. The labels of defendant distinctly refer to his own manufacture, and show that the goods are those of W. S. Trowbridge, and not those of the plaintiffs, the Trow-bridge Chocolate Chip Company. While both sets of labels are descriptive of the same article of manufacture, yet the label of plaintiffs bears upon its face a prominent and distinctive emblem, a large bowl filled to the brim with chocolate chips, while the corresponding label of defendant is entirely devoid of any emblem, but has instead the distinctive and arbitrary descriptive words \u201ctwentieth century.\u201d The distinction between the labels intended for smaller packages is equally apparent.\nIn fact, tbe real difficulty in this case is that the plaintiffs have reason to fear, not that the public will be deceived, but that if the fact becomes known that the defendant is engaged in the same business the public will purposely purchase the goods made by him for the reason that he was and is the originator of the confection known as chocolate chips. In other words, what the plaintiffs really desire is protection from the business competition of the defendant, carried on openly and frankly by him under his own name. As we have already seen, this was something which they did not provide for under the terms of the written agreement when they purchased from him his interest in the business, and they cannot now be permitted indirectly to attain this end which they failed to stipulate expressly for in negotiating the purchase, and which presumably was not included in fixing the amount of the consideration. The learned judge of the court below has with great industry and accuracy examined and assembled the eases bearing upon the exact questions here in dispute, has drawn from them the legal principles upon which they rest, and has with precision applied those principles to the facts of this case.\nWe see no reason whatever to differ from any of the conclusions reached by him.\nThe exceptions are overruled, and the decree is affirmed.",

T., 1905, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. Crawford Co., No. 2, Nov. T., 1902, dismissing bill in equity in case of H. P. White and Carl Bender, trading as Trowbridge Chocolate Chip Company, v. W. S. Trowbridge.\nBefore Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter and Elkin, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for an injunction.\nThomas, P. J., found the facts to be as follows :\n1. That for a period of two and one-half years and upwards, prior to January, 1900, the defendant, W. S. Trowbridge, was engaged in the city of Meadville in the manufacture of confectionery, consisting of thin oblong pieces of molasses candy coated with chocolate, and generally known as chocolate chips.\n2. That said defendant then claimed, and still claims, to have been tbe originator of this particular kind of confectionery, and adopted the name \u201c Trowbridge\u2019s Chocolate Chips,\u201d by which the same was known in the trade.\n8. That defendant, prior to said date, adopted as a trademark the words, \u201c Trowbridge\u2019s Chocolate Velvet Chips,\u201d and the representation of a bucket filled with chocolate chips, and caused the same to be registered.\n4. On January 22, 1900, the said defendant sold an undivided one-third in the business theretofore by him carried on, each to H. P. White and Carl Bender, and the said vendor and his vendees on the same day entered into a copartnership, under the firm name of \u201c Trowbridge Chocolate Chip Company,\u201d and from that time until January 11, 1902, the said copartnership engaged in the manufacture of the said Trowbridge chocolate chips in the said city of Meadville.\n5. Shortly after the organization of the said copartnership, and upon complaint of a rival manufacturer of confectionery, the said copartnership dropped from the name or trade-mark of said chocolate chips the word \u201c velvet \u201d and substituted for said name or trade-mark, \u201c Trowbridge\u2019s Chocolate Chips, the Original,\u201d under which name and trade-mark they continued to manufacture said chocolate chips until the dissolution of said partnership.\n. 6. On January 11, 1902, the said copartnership was dissolved, the plaintiffs in the bill having purchased from defendant his interest therein, by written agreement, of which the following is a copy :\n\u201cMemorandum of agreement made this 11th day of January, 1902, between Wm. S. Trowbridge of the first part and Harry P. White and Carl Bender of the second part:\n\u201c Whereas, the parties hereto entered into a partnership on the-day of January, 1900, for the manufacture and sale of confectionery, and especially for the manufacture of a quality of confectionery known by the trade-mark of \u2018 Trowbridge Original Chocolate Chips,\u2019 and have since said date been engaged in the manufacture and sale of such confectionery in Mead-ville, Pa., and,\n\u201c Whereas, the said Wm. S. Trowbridge has agreed to sell all his rights and interest in the said partnership and business,\n\u201c Now this agreement witnesseth, that the said Wm. S. Trowbridge hereby sells, assigns and transfers to Harry P. White and Carl Bender all the rights, title, interest, property and claim of him, the said Win. S. Trowbridge, to and in the said partnership business, together with the good will, rights, property, stock bills and accounts receivable, notes and credits, together with all other rights or property used in or connected with the said business and the prosecution thereof.\n\u201c In consideration whereof, the said Harry P. White and the said Carl Bender agree to pay to the said Wm. S. Trowbridge the sum of fifteen thousand dollars.\u201d\n7. Subsequently to the dissolution of said copartnership and the sale of his interest therein by defendant, the plantiffs continued to carry on the same business under the same name and in the same place as was done prior to said sale and dissolution of the copartnership, and in the prosecution of said business have advertised extensively, and the said chocolate chips had, prior to said dissolution and has had subsequently thereto, a large and extensive sale, the said company now employing about 150 hands, and is manufacturing about 6,000 pounds thereof per day.\n8. That on June 11, 1902, plaintiffs caused to be registered by the commissioner of patents a print, the title of which is \u201c Trowbridge\u2019s Chocolate Chips,\u201d which said print has been by them continuously used as a trade-mark or advertisement on the pails or larger packages in which said confectionery has been packed and shipped.\n9. The plaintiff company packs or puts up for sale their chocolate chips in common stock candy pails or buckets of two sizes, one of which holds about twenty-five pounds and the other about ten pounds, and in paper or pasteboard boxes of convenient size to hold five, one, one-half and one-fourth pounds respectively. The pound boxes are dark brown in color, tied by two small white ribbons, and the dimensions are 10|-x2-|xl{-' inches ; the half-pound boxes are dark brown in color and the dimensions are 5fx2fxlJ inches ; and the quarter-pound boxes are inclosed in white wrappers, and the dimensions are 6|-x2f-xf-inches.\n10. Upon each \u201c chip \u201d manufactured by the plaintiff company is stamped upon one side the word \u201c Trowbridge.\u201d\n11. Upon all of the larger packages put up by plaintiffs is placed a white label corresponding in appearance to the registered print, consisting of the word \u201c Trowbridge \u201d at the top thereof, in letters three-fonrths of an inch high, and of the words \u201c Chocolate Chips \u201d at the bottom thereof, one and one-fourth inches to one and three-fourths inches high, \u2014 varying with the size of the label, \u2014 all of a dark red color. In the center of said label is the picture of a punch bowl filled with chocolate chips; the coloring of the punch bowl is blue, and of the chips, a light chocolate.

Upon the one-pound and the half-pound boxes is printed in gold, in heavy script type, slightly diagonal across the top of the box, the word \u201c Trowbridge\u2019s,\u201d and beneath said word and as a continuation thereof extends a heavy scroll or flourish in the same color, in which scroll is printed in small brown letters the words \u201c Name on every chip.\u201d Below and someAvhat to.the right of the word \u201c Trowbridge\u2019s \u201d is printed in gold and in heavy ornate letters, one-fourth inch high, the word \u201c chocolate \u201d on a slightly oval line, and immediately below said word and in similar type and the same color, is the word \u201c chips,\u201d printed on a straight line.

About the middle of September, 1902, the defendant, W. S. Trowbridge, began in the city of Meadville the manufacture of confectionery known as chocolate chips, and similar in form and appearance to the same kind of confectionery manufactured by plaintiff and numerous other persons or firms throughout the country.\n16. The chocolate chip manufactured by defendant is plain and has no printing or stamp impressed thereon.\n17. The said defendant is advertising and offering for sale his said confectionery and has solicited and is soliciting trade therefor generally, and has adopted and is using a stamp or mark on his labels, packages, bill and letter heads, hereinafter more fully described.\n18. The said defendant puts up his said confectionery in common or stock candy pails of a capacity of about ten and twenty-five pounds, respectively, and in common paper or pasteboard boxes or packages in quantities of five, one, one-half and one-fourth pounds. The pound boxes are white in color, and of the dimensions of 7x2f-x2-f inches; the half-pound boxes are white in color and of the dimensions of 5-|x2-|xl-|- inches; the quarter-pound boxes are inclosed in a wrapper of chocolate color, and the dimensions are 6|-x2-?,-x|inches.\n19. From two-thirds to three-fourths of the said chocolate chips sold by either plaintiffs or defendant is put up in candjr pails.\n20. The defendant uses upon his pails a white label, at the top of which is printed horizontally in heavy black Gothic letters about one-half inch high the words \u201c The Originator.\u201d Somewhat below is a circle, five and one-half inches in diameter, above which and parallel thereto is printed in heavy black Gothic letters, five-eighths inch high, the name \u201c W. S. Trow-bridge,\u201d which name is followed by a period; and below the said circle, in similar type and color, the words \u201cMeadville, Pa.\u201d Within and at the top of the said circle and parallel thereto, in heavy black Gothic letters, seven-eighths inch high, is the word \u201c Chocolate,\u201d and at the bottom of said circle and parallel thereto, in the same type the word \u201c Chips.\u201d Across the center of said circle is printed horizontally in heavy red script letters the word \u201c Twentieth,\u201d and immediately below, parallel thereto and extending somewhat to the right thereof, in the same type and color the word \u201c Century.\u201d\n21. The design used by defendant in his bill and letter heads, and probably on some smaller labels, advertisements, etc., is the same in language, form and colors as the label above described, being merely reduced in size.\n22. The pound and half-pound boxes used by defendant have printed somewhat diagonally across the tops in not very heavy script type the words \u201c Twentieth Century,\u201d with a flourish extending from the capital \u201c C \u201d back beneath and parallel with the word \u201c Twentieth.\u201d Preceding said words, on a line with the top of the small letters thereof, in small Gothic type is the word \u201c The.\u201d Beneath the word \u201c century,\u201d on a horizontal line is printed in inclined Gothic type about one-eighth inch high, the words \u201c Chocolate Chips,\u201d and immediately beneath and parallel thereto is printed in somewhat smaller type the name \u201c W. S. Trowbridge.\u201d To the left of said writing is the design of a griffin, holding a partly opened scroll, upon which is printed, in small inclined Gothic type the word \u201c Purity,\u201d beneath which in the same type is the word \u201c Excellence.\u201d All of said printing and stamping is the color of silver.\n23. The quarter-pound boxes used by defendant are wrapped in chocolate-colored paper, upon which is printed in rather large script type and diagonally across the top of the box, the words \u201c Twentieth Century,\u201d beneath which, parallel thereto, and beginning somewhat to the right thereof and in the same type are the words \u201c Chocolate Chips.\u201d Somewhat below is printed horizontally in Gothic type one-fourth inch high, the name \u201cW. S. Trowbridge.\u201d Above and to the left of the word \u201c Twentieth \u201d and within the flourish to the letter \u201c T \u201d is printed in 'ornate type, the word \u201c The,\u201d and over the word \u201c Twentieth,\u201d and parallel thereto, is found in figures, three-eighths inch high, the number \u201c 10,\u201d followed by the letter \u201c c,\u201d one-fourth inch high, through which extends a perpendicular line. To the left of said printing is the design of a griffin, holding a partly opened scroll, upon which in small inclined Gothic type is printed the word \u201cPurity,\u201d and beneath this and in the same type the word \u201c Excellence.\u201d All of said printing and stamping is in the color of silver.\n24. As a means of advertisement, defendant has had prepared and used a window screen or poster about 30x10 inches, through the center of which horizontally appear the words \u201c Chocolate Chips,\u201d each word beginning with a large bright red capitalC,\u201d five and three-fourths inches high, shaded with dark green. The balance of the said words are printed in large black lower-case ornate type, two inches high, above and below which black letters are dark green lines and ornaments. Directly above said words are printed horizontally in heavy script type, about one inch high, in bright red, the words \u201cTwentieth Century.\u201d To the left of said words and on the same elevation as the tip of the capital \u201c C\u2019s \u201d in black ornate letters, one inch high, is the word \u201c The,\u201d beneath which in a wave line, in black ornate letters, one and one-fourth inches high, is the word \u201c Meadville,\u201d and below the said last-mentioned word in the same type and color as the word \u201c The \u201d is printed horizontally, the word \u201c Chip.\u201d At the right of said screen or poster and on the same elevation as the top of said capital \u201c C\u2019s\u201d are the black ornate letters, one and one-fourth inches high, \u201c W. S.,\u201d with periods after each. Beneath said letters on a wave line and in letters of the same type and color the word \u201cTrowbridge,\u201d beneath which word in black ornate letters, one inch high, is printed horizontally the word \u201c Originator.\u201d\n25. By correspondence with dealers and otherwise the defendant has held himself out as \u201c being the originator of the Chocolate Chips.\u201d\n26. The trade-mark or labels used by defendant are not so similar to those of plaintiffs in appearance, or in the sound and connection of the words, as are likely to cause a person of ordinary intelligence, using ordinary caution, in making purchases to be misled.\nThe court entered a decree dismissing the bill.\nError assigned was decree of the court dismissing the bill.\nThomas Roddy and Manley O. Brown, for appellant.\nThe ownership of a trade-mark has in general been considered a right of property, and equity will protect that right from infringement. Proof of fraud is not required. The mere violation of the rights is sufficient to induce the exercise of the equity powers of the courts : Menendez v. Holt, 128 U. S. 514 (9 Sup. Ct. Repr. 143).\nThe good will of a partnership is part of the property of the firm. Of this good will is the firm name. In a proper case the court of equity will perpetually enjoin such unlawful use of the name by the retiring partner.\nA surname may become impersonal when attached to articles of manufacture and becomes the name by which such article is known in the trade. In case of sale of the rights to manufacture the same pass also, but it does not pass as good will, but as trade-mark: Vonderbank v. Schmidt, 44 La. Ann. 264 (10 So. Repr. 616) ; Beach on Modern Eq. Juris, sec. 762; Russia Cement Co. v. LePage, 147 Mass. 206 (17 N. E. Repr. 304); Ayer v. Hall, 3 Brews. 509.\nJune 27, 1906:\nIf a trade-mark be imitated so closely as to deceive the public, its use will be enjoined : Colton v. Thomas, 2 Brews. 308; Witthaus v. Wallace, 2 W. N. C. 610; Shepp v. Jones, 35 W. N. C. 29 ; Parmer v. Harris, 60 Pa. 156 ; Colladay v. Baird, 4 Phila. 139; Pratt\u2019s App., 117 Pa. 401; Putnam Nail Co. v. Dulaney, 140 Pa. 205.\nGeorge W. Haskins, with him A. G. Richmond and John O. McClintock, for appellee.\nThe sale of the good will does not involve any obligation on the vendor not to exercise the same trade. If the vendee of such good will desires to protect.himself from such a contingency, he should do it by an agreement: Palmer v. Graham, 1 Parsons\u2019Select Equity Cases, 476; Rupp v. Over, 3 Brewster, 133 ; Fish Brothers Wagon Co. v. Titus G. Fish, 16 L. R. A. 453 ; Cottrell v. Babcock Printing Press Mfg. Co., 54 Conn. 122 (6 Atl. Repr. 791); Chittenden v. Witbeck, 50 Mich. 401 (15 N. W. Repr. 526); Williams v. Farrand, 14 L. R. A. 161; Bassett v. Percival, 87 Mass. 345; Hall\u2019s App., 60 Pa. 458.\nIt is not enough that there may be a possibility of deception. The offending label must be such that it is likely to deceive persons of ordinary intelligence: Brown v. Seidel, 153 Pa. 60; Heinz v. Lutz, 146 Pa. 592; Hoyt v. Hoyt, 143 Pa. 623; Howe Scale Co. v. Wychoff et al., 198 U. S. 118 (25 Sup. Ct. Repr. 609) ; Holzafel\u2019s Co. v. Rahtjens\u2019 Co., 183 U. S. 1 (22 Sup. Ct. Repr. 6) ; Brown Chemical Co. v. Meyer, 139 U. S. 540 (11 Sup. Ct. Repr. 625) ; Carmichel v. Latimer, 11 R. I. 395; Fish Bros. Wagon Co. v. Fish, 16 L. R. A. 453; Duryea v. Natl. Starch Mfg. Co., 79 Fed. Repr. 651."
