The general rule is a good rule, the exceptions are not many and they will not be lightly increased. But to say that no exception shall be permitted under any circumstances would be to ignore the infinite variations of human action underpressure of emergencies or doubt, and to reduce the elastic principles of the common law to the rigidity of a penal statute. But how clearly the exceptions must be shown to be such is made manifest by the cases of Hunterson v. Traction Co., 205 Pa. 568 ; Bainbridge v. Traction Co., 206 Pa. 71, and Boulfrois v. Traction Co., 210 Pa. 263.\nThis was a very close case but when it was here before, 204 Pa. 474, it was held to be one for the jury. It was tried by the court below on the lines of the opinion by our late Brother Dean and we have seen nothing to change our views.\nJudgment affirmed.",

United Traction Company, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Street railways \u2014 Getting on car \u2014 Moving car.\nIn an action against a street railway company to recover damages for personal injuries, the case is for the jury, where the evidence for the plaintiff, although contradicted, tended to show that plaintiff boarded a summer car; that when he saw the car coming about 100 feet distant he waved his hand to the motorman to stop, who at once put on the brakes so that when it reached the plaintiff it had almost stopped, and he stepped up on the running board and was about to go into the body of the car after the car had actually stopped, when the conductor rang the bell for the car to start; that it was instantly started with a jerk and threw him off and injured him.\nArgued Oct. 30, 1906.\nAppeal, No. 35, Oct. T., 1906, by defendant, from judgment of O. P. No. 3, Allegheny Go., Peb. Term, 1901, No. 43, on verdict for plaintiff in case of James Powelson v. United Traction Company.\nBefore Mitchell, O.

See 204 Pa. 474.\nThe facts do not substantially vary from those brought forth in the previous trial, except that plaintiff testified that after he had stepped on the running board, the car had actually stopped.\nThe court refused binding instructions for defendant.\nYerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $7,500. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in refusing binding instructions for defendant.\nWilliam A. Challener, with him Clarence Burleigh and James C. Gray, for appellant.\nRody P.
