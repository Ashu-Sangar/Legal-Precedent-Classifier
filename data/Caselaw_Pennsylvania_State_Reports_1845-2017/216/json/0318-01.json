Nothing is left in doubt either as to the contingency itself on which the devise over is to take effect, or the time of its happening. It is to be at the death of appellant, whether that shall be before or after that of her mother. So long as the contingency is still possible in the future the estate of 'the appellant is liable to be defeated by its occurrence.\nDecree affirmed.",
