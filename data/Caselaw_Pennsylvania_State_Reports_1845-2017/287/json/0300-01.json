Mesta Machine Co., 286 Pa. 199, 206, we recently said that, in this class of cases, an expert witness called by plaintiff \u201cwould have to testify, not that the condition of claimant'might have, or even probably did, come from the accident, but that, in his professional opinion, the result in question came from the cause alleged.\u201d It is sufficient to say, an examination of the record in the present case shows that the testimony, given by one, if not more, of plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses, measures up to the required standard.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
