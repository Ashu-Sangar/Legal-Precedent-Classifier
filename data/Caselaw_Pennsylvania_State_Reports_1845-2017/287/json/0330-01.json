On this state of the record, even though plaintiff may have had previous knowledge of the pavement, and other facts may have existed which, under different circumstances, might have told strongly against his right of recovery, or under the evidence as presented might have been accepted by a jury as indicating a lack of due care on plaintiff\u2019s part, yet his alleged contributory negligence was, as said in the opinion of the court below, \u201ca pure question of fact and could not have been determined......as a matter of law.\u201d\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
