    <p id="b141-8" data-blocks='[["BL_141.11",141,[128,990,1156,866]]]'>Eva M. Knauer and ,C. Hull Knauer, her husband, were married in 1888 and for more than thirty years resided in her home at Milton, Northumberland County. In June, 1924, during the temporary absence of the husband, the wife moved all the furniture from the home, put it in storage and locked the house. On his return the husband obtained entrance to the house and still resides therein. The wife, after a brief visit to her son in Schuylkill County, went to Delaware County where she rented rooms and has since remained. At the end of a year she filed a petition in the latter county, praying to be decreed a feme sole trader under the provisions of the Act of May 28, 1915, P. L. 639. The husband filed a responsive answer, after which testimony was taken. The decree prayed for was granted and the husband has appealed.</p>

It must be a wilful nonperformance of his duty. See King v. Thompson and Wife, <a href="/pa/87/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="87 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1057895" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0365-01">87 Pa. 365</a>; Ellison v.

That the wife had a separate estate of her <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>own sufficient for her support will not prevent granting the decree: Bremer’s Petition, <a href="/pa/279/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="279 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1083391" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0405-01">279 Pa. 405</a>. While the separation and failure to support appear in the instant case it is not shown that such failure constituted a breach of duty on his part. She dismantled the common domicile and departed without his knowledge or consent; she failed to inform him of her new place of abode; she refused to answer his letters and in some cases refused to receive them; when he followed her to Delaware County she declined to see him, and has never called upon him for support and refuses his advances, for reconciliation. As we said in Graver’s Petition, supra, she cannot take advantage of the status she has thus created to bring herself within the terms of the act. Furthermore, under the statute, the husband’s failure to support must extend over the entire year; yet the proof in the instant case fails to show the husband had knowledge of the wife’s whereabouts for the first part thereof and until he did he was not in default under any aspect of the case. The petition was filed June 29,1925, and while Mrs. Knauer left her home in Northumberland County, June 17, 1924, there is no evidence he knew where she went or where she was until some indefinite time during that summer. It is a drastic statute, depriving a husband of his rights in a summary manner, without trial by jury, and cannot be unduly extended.</p>

The evidence tended to prove he refused to sign a note with her at the bank, to enable her to liquidate a floating indebtedness she had incurred in the improvement of her property; also that he told somebody she was temporarily upset and not herself, owing to her condition, change of life, and further that he had said she was morally insane. There was no com<a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>petent proof of this, except the testimony of one of her attorneys that Mr. Knauer made such a remark to him after the separation. Some other minor matters appear, but, taking the evidence as a whole, it fails to justify her contention.-</p>
