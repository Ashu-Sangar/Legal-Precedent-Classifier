It has been held in this State that a separation having all the elements of wilful and malicious desertion, under our divorce laws, may be deprived of its efficacy as such by some acts indicating an assent or agreement of the wronged party to its continuance (Olson v. Olson, <a href="/pa-super/27/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="27 Pa. Super. 128" data-case-ids="856558" data-case-paths="/pa-super/27/0128-01">27 Pa. Superior Ct. 128</a>; King v.

Superior Ct. 33</a>), the statutory desertion not then having been persisted in. The converse of this principle is true, that a separation without the elements of wilful and malicious desertion present, may be turned into such by <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>some positive and unequivocal act indicating an intention to desert. If there is some act, such as adultery by one of the parties, that would excuse the injured party from taking back the other, that would show, despite the amicable or reasonable character of the separation, that the adulterer intended to renounce the marriage relation; the separation would become a malicious desertion by him or her from the day of the act, within the meaning of the Act of 1917. As to a separation on reasonable cause becoming a wilful and malicious desertion on the expiration of the cause, see Zeiler v. Zeiler, <a href="/pa-super/58/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="58 Pa. Super. 220" data-case-ids="446188" data-case-paths="/pa-super/58/0220-01">58 Pa.

Superior Ct. 193</a>, 194. “Desertion begins with the intent to desert and to make such desertion permanent”: Hedderson v. Hedderson, supra. The foregoing quotation was taken by the court from Browne on Divorce, p. 144. In accord with this view see also 19 C. J. 63, and Keezer on Marriage and Divorce, 2d edition, section 327, “The intention to abandon need not begin at the time of the separation. Even if at the time of separation there was no intention to abandon the spouse, but later such intention arises, legal abandonment occurs and the statutory time begins to run.” For an illustration of the application of this principle see Carroll v. Carroll, <a href="/nj-eq/68/0724-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="68 N.J. Eq. 724" data-case-ids="204143" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/68/0724-01">68 N. J.

The English law, in accord, is well settled,— [Though the separation be no desertion in its inception, it may become such afterwards: as where a husband leaves his wife in the first instance for some good purpose, with her consent, and afterwards breaks off all connection with her and lives in adultery”: Browne &amp; Watts on Divorce, 1921 edition, page 70. See also the able opinion of Judge Endlich in Bechtel v. Bechtel, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20D.%201076" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="18 Pa. D. 1076">18 Pa. Dist. R. 1076</a>, stating, “the doctrine therefore has nothing to do with the question whether a separation, not in its inception a wilful and malicious desertion, can by subsequent events be converted into such ab initio, That question seems to be disposed of by the prin<a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>ciple ‘desertion begins with the intent to desert and to make such desertion permanent,’......but if a separation which does not so begin can become a desertion by an after-developed purpose, clearly, the instant when it becomes a desertion must be marked by something tangible indicative of supervening intention not originally entertained, and the necessary period of desertion can begin to run only from that time. Where no change of circumstances, nor announcement, expressed or implied, of the new purpose has occurred, there can, in the nature of things, be no proof of it or of the time of its birth.” .</p>
    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[151,925,1155,1191]]]'>What more tangible act indicative of an intent to renounce the marriage relation could there be than the fact of adultery coupled with the actual physical separation persisted in for more than a year under the Act of 1917. Two married people for various reasons agree to live separate and apart from each other. They have no relations in common. One of them commits an act or acts of adultery in total disregard of the marriage vows with a reckless disregard of social as well as legal duty, evidencing every intent not to regard it either as being in existence or as having any force. Can it be doubted that such act, coupled with absence and separation, is equivalent to an open expression of an intent to wilfully and maliciously maintain that separation? To permit the injuring person, on the injured person’s death, to claim an interest in the disposition of the latter’s, property would be to the manifest prejudice of the children, if any, whom she has forsaken, as well as other heirs she has disgraced, and against a sound public policy. The question seems to answer itself. The misconduct must be such as would be sufficient to procure a divorce in itself, as the facts here show.</p>

The act of wilful and malicious desertion does not appear and the separation under the law would be by consent or by mutual agreement. The widow met Bower on the train to Atlantic City, at which last-named place she remained for a month, and then came back to Shamokin, accompanied by Bower; after about a week she and the fireman went to Detroit, Michigan, where they remained the greater part of the time until after the husband’s death.
