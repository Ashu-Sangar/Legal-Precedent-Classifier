Where the insurance commissioner, as statutory liquidator of an insurance company, has filed his account, plaintiffs in a pending suit in equity against the officers of the company for misapplication of funds, cannot petition that the account be referred back to the liquidator with instructions to proceed in the equity suit, where it appears that the petitioners had made no application to the liquidator to so proceed, and had filed no exceptions to his account.</p>

This litigation was pending in the Common Pleas of Philadelphia and had beén started by a stockholder and certain creditors of the corporation. The bill in equity which they filed charged a misapplication of assets of the company by the defendants named therein. Appellants did not make their application to proceed with <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>the litigation to the liquidator but waited until Ms account was filed and tben presented their petition to the court. As has been pointed out in the preceding opinion, this was not the proper way to proceed; the application should have been made to the insurance commissioner, the statutory liquidator. No application was made nor was any exception filed with him. Under these circumstances, the court below very properly dismissed the petition and confirmed the account.</p>
    <p id="b38-4" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[263,844,1150,314]]]'>In oral argument it was stated that the insurance commissioner has a further accounting to make. If this be so there is no reason why appellants shall not renew their application to him. If he can be satisfied that further assets will be realized by proceeding with the litigation it would be his duty to do so.</p>
    <p id="b38-5" data-blocks='[["BL_38.6",38,[263,1175,1146,87]]]'>The order of the court below is affirmed at appellants’ cost.</p>
