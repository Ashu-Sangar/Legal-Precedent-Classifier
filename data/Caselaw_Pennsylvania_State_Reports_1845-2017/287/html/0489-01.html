The court was of opinion that the first reason should be sustained, and, therefore, that it was not necessary to discuss the second. We are of one mind in concluding that the court erred in entering judgment for defendant for the first reason; the second has given us much concern. We have concluded that the question raised by it is not so clear and indisputable as to warrant our entering judgment for defendant without further light.</p>
    <p id="b518-3" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[273,321,1155,1391]]]'>
      <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>The trial court decided that the coal was not shown to be black, to be merchantable in 1878, or to be stone coal. Our judgment is not only that the court erred in its determination, but that under the evidence the coal which was mined by defendants was black coal, was merchantable, and, that it was stone coal within the meaning of the words used in the deed. All that was shown to indicate that the coal was not black coal was that it was stained red at the outcrop and in other places in the mine, very likely by sulphur water or other chemical action. That this takes place is a matter of common knowledge, but it does not make the coal any the less black .coal. Indeed, witnesses testified that when the coal, which was red on the surface, was broken the inside of it was black. The court below in its opinion on the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto says, “The undisputed evidence is that the coal was wholly in the Pittsburgh vein, and that the Pittsburgh vein was the same as had been opened and worked by John Penny. So there is no question that the coal mined was of the seam designated in the deed from the assignees of John Penny.” It is stated in appellant’s brief that it is a matter of common knowledge that the Pittsburgh vein of coal, with the exception only of small portions at the extreme edge of the stratum at the point of an outcrop, is black.</p>

It was unquestionably merchantable in 1922 when defendants mined and sold it and its merchantability at that time was sufficient under the language of the grant. The court was of opinion that the coal was not stone coal because it was soft. So far as we have been able to discover there is.no definition on the record to show just what was meant by stone coal or its related hardness. Even some stones are not hard and the test to be applied in determining the hardness of coal so as to <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>meet the designation “stone coal” is nowhere shown in the record. It does affirmatively appear in the testimony that the term “stone coal” was originally used in early conveyances to differentiate it from charcoal. In McKelvy v. Wilkinsburg Domestic Coal Co., <a href="/pa/283/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="283 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="1090579" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0227-01">283 Pa. 227</a>, the coal which was the subject of the litigation was designated by a deed for it made in 1873 as “all the good black merchantable stone coal.” A witness Blackburn called by plaintiff, who was a mining engineer and coal operator, testified that the words “stone coal” are used in dealings to designate the Pittsburgh seam of coal, one of the large veins in the district. In the Standard Dictionary, the words “stone coal” are defined as “mineral coal as distinguished from charcoal.” We think the coal in question met the designátion “stone coal” and that the court erred in determining otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b519-5" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[126,1192,1153,686]]]'>The question of title to the coal mined has given us much trouble. The plan referred to in the deeds and made by B. F.

Whigham &amp; Madison Bailey, Assignees of John Penny. April &amp; May, 1878. R. P. Hunter.” This plan shows a number of tracts all designated by letters. The sum of the total acreage in the designated tracts agrees with the acreage called for in the deeds, 114 acres 152.83 perches.

McClure, and that there is nothing in the deed which would sustain a finding or conclusion that the language “embracing in all 114 acres and 152.83 perches of unmined coal” in the fourth description was intended by the grantors, or was understood by the grantees, to limit in any way whatever the coal referred to in the second description, being the coal in controversy It is asserted that the actual operations conducted in the mining of the coal by Sneathen and his associates show that Andrew McClure, who then owned the surface overlying the coal, understood and construed the language of the deed to mean and to cover all of the coal in and under the land included in the second description, notwithstanding the fact that on the Hunter <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>plan all of its territory was marked by the words “coal out.”</p>
    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[123,436,1155,914]]]'>On the other hand, appellees, so far as this branch of the case is concerned, take their stand upon the proposition that by his title deeds appellant took title to 114 acres and 152.83 perches of unmined coal, and to no other or additional coal. They point to the language of the fourth description, urging that the wording of the deeds conveys the title strictly in accordance with the Hunter survey and covers 114 acres and 152.83 perches, as shown by it, and no more; that the plan conforms to the language of the deed, showing where and how the acreage is made up, and operates to limit the entire grant and conveyance of the coal, described in the deed, to 114 acres and 152.83 perches of solid unmined coal, and that the coal which was mined and removed by defendants, being stumps, ribs and smaller areas, was not a part of this body of solid unmined coal and was not a part of the coal which belonged to plaintiff.</p>

They also call attention to the fact that in the record in the recorder’s office the entire description as to, the coal conveyed is run together in one paragraph and is not set forth in separate paragraphs beginning. <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>with the word “also,” as would seem to be indicated by the record before us.</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[295,439,1151,533]]]'>In our thought, while the weight of the argument would seem to incline to the view that appellant did not own the coal which appellee mined, the situation nevertheless is not so clear, — particularly in view of evidence which, as we understand it, shows that John Penny may have mined outside of the tracts designated on the Hunter survey and that his right to so mine was not contested by Andrew McClure, — as to make us feel that the case should now be disposed of on this ground as a matter of law by us.</p>

If it shall be of opinion upon consideration that judgment should be entered for defendant on this ground, then that question can be brought before us for review, with the light shed upon it by the court’s opinion. If the court shall conclude, however, that plaintiff has shown title to the coal, then it must dismiss the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto and reinstate the motion for a new trial and upon that motion make such order as to justice and right may seem proper. In this connection, we think it advisable to say that in our opinion there cannot be a recovery under the facts as they appear from the record both for treble damages under the act of assembly and for the profits received by defendants from the mining of the coal. It would seem to us that plaintiff’s right of action is for the profits received by defendants, that defendants mined the coal under a claim of right so to do by virtue of the lease from McClure and that they were not wilful trespassers under the terms of the Act of May 8, 1876, P.
