    <p id="b436-6" data-blocks='[["BL_436.10",436,[281,877,1151,367]]]'>The plaintiff sued to recover damages for the death of her husband (in the other two actions for the death of her two minor children) killed in the collapse of a theatre building belonging to defendants, in which the decedents were witnessing a moving picture show. Recovery was denied on the ground that the negligence shown was that of an independent contractor.</p>
    <p id="b436-7" data-blocks='[["BL_436.11",436,[279,1256,1150,425]]]'>In addition to owning the theatre building, defendants owned a piece of land alongside of it, on which they concluded to erect a building and for that purpose they entered into a contract in writing with J. D. Ritter for its construction. The specifications, which were made part of the contract, provided “The owner will take care of all sewerage, painting, wiring, plumbing and heating necessary for the completion of this building.”</p>
    <p id="b436-8" data-blocks='[["BL_436.12",436,[277,1692,1150,699]],["BL_437.1",437,[127,327,1154,867]]]'>Ritter, the contractor, in proceeding with the work, dug a trench for the concrete foundation wall of the new building eighteen inches wide, parallel with and alongside the wall of the theatre building, extending for its entire length. The trench was excavated to a depth of about eighteen inches below the foundation wall of the theatre building. On or shortly before the date the theatre building collapsed, it had rained and the earth around the foundation wall was wet and soft. Concrete had been run into the ditch with the water still standing therein, and one of the defendants, on the day the building collapsed, had drained the water from the ditch. On that day the defendant Charlson <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>went upon the premises with six workmen to aid in the work that was going on; according to the testimony, he was in charge of the work on that day. Among other things, he caused a further excavation to be made for a sewer pipe (under the contract the owners had to provide the sewerage) leading from the theatre building and under its wall and into the lot where the new building was being erected and to the rear of that lot where connection was to be made with the sewer. In making this excavation, a hole was cut through the foundation wall of the theatre building apparently about eighteen inches in diameter and sufficient earth was removed from under the foundation wall to permit a workman to pass through back and forth. Shortly after the defendant Charlson and his workmen ceased their work and left the building, it collapsed.</p>

The trial judge refused to receive this testimony, because “the plaintiff had already shown one proximate cause for which another than the defendants were responsible and to offer additional testimony with a view of showing a proximate cause for which the defendants were responsible would require the jury to guess as to the responsibility for the collapse of the building.” To sustain its position, the court relied upon the cases of Bruggeman v. City of York, <a href="/pa/254/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="254 Pa. 430" data-case-ids="1025455" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0430-01">254 Pa. 430</a>; Fullick v.

Neither of these decisions nor any other that we have knowledge of sustains the rulings <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>of the court below. The plaintiff was entitled to show by such competent evidence as she could produce what caused the building to fall and whose negligent act brought about the catastrophe. The fact that witnesses called by her may have assigned as the reason the digging of the ditch by the contractor did not preclude her from showing a further contributing cause, the putting in of the sewer by the owner and the weakening of the foundation wall of the theatre by the cutting away of part of it to put the sewer line through. “As a general rule it may be said that negligence to render a person liable need not be the sole cause of an injury. It is sufficient that his negligence concurring with one or more efficient causes, other than plaintiff’s fault, is the proximate cause of the injury.
