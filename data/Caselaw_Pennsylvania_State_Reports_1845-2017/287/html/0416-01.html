    <p id="b441-12" data-blocks='[["BL_441.21",441,[127,1738,1153,634]]]'>David Wheeler, having become financially involved, executed, on December 24, 1912, a deed to James W. Hunter as trustee, conveying all his property except his homestead lands and the personal property pertaining thereto in trust for his creditors. This deed was made in pursuance of an agreement previously executed by Wheeler and certain of his creditors, which, however, neither appellant nor his decedent signed. The agreement stipulated that Wheeler should execute a deed for his property to Hunter as trustee and that the terms of the agreement should be incorporated in the conveyance, which was done.</p>
    <p id="b442-3" data-blocks='[["BL_442.4",442,[276,313,1149,363]]]'>

There is no question that appellant is a creditor of Wheeler. It is so admitted of record.</p>
    <p id="b442-4" data-blocks='[["BL_442.5",442,[274,695,1152,1232]]]'>The trust created by the deed from Wheeler to Hunter was administered by the latter for more than twelve years, when appellant, becoming dissatisfied with the way in which the trust estate was being carried on, presented his petition to the court below to compel the trustee to file an account. The .court refused the prayer of the petition on the grounds (1) that while it is true neither appellant nor his decedent had not signed the agreement preceding the deed, he had by signing the extension agreement adopted the former one, (2) that appellant’s petition for an accounting is defective because it fails to set out whether appellant or his decedent paid out any money as surety for Wheeler or any facts which would enable the court to determine the equities between Wheeler and the decedent’s estate, (3) that the agreement which preceded the deed, having been “adopted” by petitioner, is the law “unto the parties thereto” and the petition fails to state any particular in which the trust has not been carried out, and (4) that the remedy of petitioner is under the agreement and the court would not take cognizance of the matter unless petitioner had exhausted every remedy under the trust agreement and had failed to obtain relief.</p>
