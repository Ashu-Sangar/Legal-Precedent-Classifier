    <p id="b611-9" data-blocks='[["BL_611.11",611,[128,1162,1156,318]]]'>Plaintiffs, husband and wife, sued to recover damages for injuries received by the wife, — who, hereafter in this opinion^ will be referred to as the plaintiff. The court below directed a verdict for defendant, on the ground of plaintiff’s contributory negligence; judgment was entered accordingly; hence this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b611-10" data-blocks='[["BL_611.12",611,[129,1490,1155,806]]]'>The accident occurred at night, as plaintiff was walking across'Allegheny Avenue, near its intersection with Sixth Street, Philadelphia, and it happened thus: One of defendant’s cars had turned from Sixth Street, into Allegheny Avenue, coming from the rear of plaintiff as she crossed the latter highway some thirty-five or forty feet west of the west house-line of Sixth Street. The car had cleared the curve; it was on the straight track on Allegheny Avenue, and had run its own length, about fifty feet, on the straight track before plaintiff was hit. Moreover, it appears from a plan in evidence that the sidewalk is cut back at this corner, so that from the point where plaintiff traversed Allegheny Avenue there would be a view of the whole curve of the track over which the car was slowly approaching.</p>
    <p id="b611-11" data-blocks='[["BL_611.13",611,[132,2307,1152,99]],["BL_612.1",612,[268,329,1150,534]]]'>Plaintiff testified that she looked when three or four feet from the track, but did not see the car; that she <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>did not look again, and was struck just after stepping on the first rail. The case is clearly within .the principle stated in Crooks v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., <a href="/pa/216/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="216 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="950335" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0590-01">216 Pa. 590</a>, 592, and repeated in Cunningham v.

    <p id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[316,874,518,44]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
