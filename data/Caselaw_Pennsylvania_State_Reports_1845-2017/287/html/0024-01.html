To the last-mentioned note the following was added, “This judgment is against 1803, 5 and 7 State Street property and is not to be collected until after the death of C. Duncan Cameron. This note is given for service in holding State Street property in trust and for service to be rendered to C. Duncan Cameron.”</p>

The several petitions set forth that petitioner is the widoAV of C. Duncan Cameron, who wilfully and maliciously and without reasonable cause deserted her a number of years before the time of his death, and during his lifetime failed to contribute to her support, and that the notes in question were fraudulently given without consideration, and for the purpose of defeating her dower rights and preventing her from participating in the distribution of her husband’s estate.</p>

Cameron, and to remise, release, and quitclaim the said Charles D. Cameron from any further payments, and discharge him and make him free from all payments or orders of said court: and also from all dower interests after his death.”</p>

In a case similar to the present, where the validity of a writing reduced to judgment is attacked on the ground of fraud, a heavy burden rests upon those who undertake to avoid the writing and set it aside, and the evidence to sustain the allegation of fraud must be clear, precise and indubitable : People’s Bank v.

We consider unnecessary a discussion of the question whether the legal effect of the writing was to in fact release the dower rights of petitioner. It was at least an admission by her contrary to her present contention, and competent evidence bearing on the question whether there was a fraudulent attempt to deprive her of her rights.</p>
