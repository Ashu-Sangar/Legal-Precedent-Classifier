The First National Bank of Carnegie was organized under the acts of Congress relating to national banks, one of which provides that for its “contracts, debts and engagements” each stockholder shall be individually responsible “to the amount of his stock therein, at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in such stock.” Both institutions became insolvent, and, on the same day, finally closed their doors. The trust company in accordance with the laws of the State, passed into the control of the secretary of banking, and its affairs are being wound up by that official.

He allowed the claim of the receiver as a debt due by the trust company, but refused to award him a share in the amount then for distribution, because that fund was insufficient to pay the depositors of the trust company in full. The receiver did not object to the partial account, but filed exceptions to the schedule of distribution on two grounds: (1) that the statute which directed a preference to be given to depositors, violates article III, section 7, of the state Constitution; and (2), in so far as it attempted to give such a preference, the statute is void, because in antagonism to section 23 of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.

L. 354, 355, but little need be said. The- constitutional provision alleged to be infringed, provides that “The General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law......providing or changing methods for the collection of debts.” If the statute declared that a depositor should have a special compulsory remedy against the trust company, through the appointment of a receiver or otherwise, as a means of <em>collecting </em>his debt, it might well be held to be within the constitutional inhibition. But the Act of 1913 gives no such right. It simply says “That, in case of any dis<a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>tribution of the money......of any trust company, in the course of its liquidation by legal process or otherwise, distribution shall be made and preferred in the following order, namely: First, To the payment of all depositors in the trust company......” Many statutes provide for such preferences on distribution, and no one has contended until now, so far as we are aware, that they are constitutionally forbidden. Rent claims, wage claims, debts due to the United States and the State, are familiar instances in which preferences on distribution were allowed long beftxre the adoption of the Constitution of 1874, and then, as now, met with a practically unanimous approval. It is not to be supposed that the people intended to prevent the passage of any other such acts, when a real reason for the preference is made to appear. It is rather to be believed that the intention was that no debtor, or class of debtors, should have imposed on him or them, by legislation, a method for the collection of his or their alleged debts, which is not common to all other debtors of the same general character. This being so, the Act of 1913 does not infringe the constitutional provision.</p>

He repeatedly states that he does not claim a right paramount to the depositors, but on what line of reasoning this limitation rests is not stated, and is not <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>known to us* If that provision of the Federal Reserve Act is valid for the purpose claimed, it must be because Congress has the power, and has thereby exercised it, to give to debts due a national bank, a status over and above all other obligations of the stockholder.

This proposition is stated too broadly. Of course, to the extent that the National Government has spoken, the door is closed to any action by a state. The true rule is that “Any attempt by a state to define their [a national bank’s] duties, or control the conduct of their affairs, is void whenever it conflicts with the laws of the United States,......or impairs the efficiency of the bank to discharge the duties for which it was created”: First National Bank of San Jose v. California, <a href="/us/262/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="262 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="6141484" data-case-paths="/us/262/0366-01">262 U. S. 366</a>, 369; Davis v.

Eo converso, a state statute which does not define the duties or control the conduct of a national bank’s affairs, and does not conflict with the laws of the United States, or impair the efficiency of the bank to discharge its duties, is valid. On this rock appellant’s contention is wrecked. The state statute under consideration, which gives a preference to the depositors of a trust company, cannot possibly offend against the foregoing rule, merely because, — and this is the only effect of section 23 of the Federal Reserve Act,— a national bank may become a creditor of a trust company, if it owns stock of the bank. It requires a very wide stretch of the imagination to even guess that.Congress intended to prevent a state from declaring. the order in which the assets of one of its creatures shall be <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>distributed, in case a national bank should become a creditor. Far less is it possible to conceive that, by the Federal Reserve Act, Congress intended not to give the receiver of the bank a preference over all other creditors of the state corporation, but only to place him on the same plane with the most favored of such creditors.</p>

Thus, section 3466 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, provides that “Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent, or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.” Notwithstanding the broad language of this section, it has been held that the states have power to pass laws, allowing exemptions to debtors, which shall take preference over a debt due to the United States: Fink v. O’Neil', <a href="/us/106/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="106 U.S. 272" data-case-ids="3498587" data-case-paths="/us/106/0272-01">106 U.

Superior Ct. 170</a>.- This conclusion was reached because of section 916 of the Revised Statutes, which reads as follows: “The party recovering a judgment in any common law cause, in any circuit or district court, shall be entitled to similar remedies upon the same, by execution or otherwise, to reach the property of the judgment debtor, as are now provided in like causes by the laws of the state in which such court is held, or by any such laws hereafter enacted which may be adopted by general rules of such circuit or district court; and such courts may, from time to time, by general rules, adopt such state laws as may hereafter be in force in such state in relation to remedies on judgments, as aforesaid, by execution or otherwise.” It is true the proceedings in the present instance have not been by way of suit and judgment, as normally they <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>would have been, since the whole amount of the statutory liability is sought to be recovered (Kennedy v.

S. 258</a>), but it would hardly be claimed, because the State does not require a judgment to be recovered before the claim is presented, that this operates to enlarge the right of the receiver. Unless it is expressly declared otherwise, and it is not here, the statutory rights of a debtor are not affected by the method employed by a creditor to collect his claim. It should be added that the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania, where both institutions were located, did adopt a general rule, as provided by section 916 of the Revised Statutes, above quoted, giving to judgment creditors “similar remedies......by execution or otherwise to reach the property of the judgment debtor, as are now provided in like cases by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania.”</p>

Of course, if that which the State attempted, was, in effect, a fraud on the federal statute, the action by the State would fall; but this is not pretended here. The preference given to depositors has back of it a substantial reason. For a long series of years, in all common law countries, certain classes of creditors have been given a preference on distribution. If the receiver’s claim is valid, it would be so, also, if the preferred creditor was the landlord of the bank building, an employee of the bank, or a mechanic’s lien claimant. The underlying basis for such preferences is that the use of the landlord’s property, of the employee’s labor and of the builder’s labor and materials, made possible the assets to be distributed. Depositors, in the nature of things, are also in a preferential class- Without them a banking insti<a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>tution would perish from dry rot. “The success of almost all commercial banks depends on their ability to obtain loans from depositors”: First National Bank of San Jose v.

It was sought, by a savings bank, to enforce this preference against the assets of a national bank in the hands bf a receiver. The right thereto was denied because it was directly antagonistic to the act of Congress, which, — beyond giving a preference to the United. States, to cover possible losses when <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>national bank notes had been issued, — directed that the balance of the assets should be divided ratably among all the creditors of the bank. As the federal law was paramount, the savings bank’s claim was necessarily overruled. The Supreme Court was careful to say, however, that its conclusion was reached solely on the ground of the conflict between the state and federal statutes, adding (page 283), “If there be no conflict, the two laws, can coexist and be harmoniously enforced”; and (page 289), “True it is that where, by state law, a lien is made to result from a particular contract, that lien, when its existence is not incompatible with the act of Congress, will be enforced.” In the instant case, presumptively, the depositors became creditors of the trust company in reliance upon the statutory provision that they should have a first lien on the assets in case of insolvency.</p>

The selection must not be an arbitrary one but one based on reasonable distinction. The Act of .May 13, 1912, P. L. 354, provides that, in the liquidation of trust companies, distribution shall be made (in priority to all other claims) to depositors of such trust companies, certificate and check holders. The act treats all depositors alike whether they live in or out of Pennsylvania. Is there any sound, reasonable basis for this classification? The selected class are a part of the trust company’s general creditors. Those who hold the bank’s notes or who deposit bonds or other securities for sale, where the money has been received and intermingled in the general fund, are not included. Other illustrations might be given, but the most striking is that the creditor, receiver of a national bank, here excluded stands in the same position as the class of creditors the state act prefeis. There is no reason inherent in the transaction on which the claims of these general creditors so preferred rests, — that, through fiduciary or other confidential relation, it distinguishes such creditors from others, or that would seem to give them a right or place superior to other creditors of equal grade. If we were to say that persons who lend money to banks stand in a class by themselves, while persons who lend money to other corporations or individuals, some of which perform services similar to banks, are excluded, we set up no reasonable standard to determine the classification. If a state may prefer depositors from the list of general creditors, why may it not prefer, as creditors, persons who lend money to any debtor?

People lend money to banks as they do to individuals or others, that it may yield them a revenue. The demand in each case is the same, property to back the loan and individual honesty. When the money is deposited under other circumstances, it is usually to enable one to more expeditiously carry on his business, or it assumes a trust relation.

Stat. 1916, s. 1540) providing that the district courts of the United States may, by general rule, adopt state laws in relation to remedies by execution or otherwise. Such a rule was adopted by the district court and was in effect January 1,1913. But does this dispose of the receiver’s claim to share equally with the depositors? The act of Congress and the rule of court both relate to state laws <em>as to remedies. </em>It is true that the Pennsylvania Banking Act of 1923, P. L. 809, under which the receiver filed his claim, directs that distribution shall be made in accordance with the priorities fixed by law, but the question of priorities is not one of remedy, but of substantive law. Certainly Congress never intended to constitute each district court a subordinate legislature, and to delegate to those bodies power to adopt the substantive law of the states in which they were situated. Where a state law is inconsistent with an act of Congress, it cannot be adopted by rule of court: Bronson v. Kinzie, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Howard%20311" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="1 Howard 311">1 Howard 311</a>, 314; M’Cracken v. Hayward, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Howard%20607" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="2 Howard 607">2 Howard 607</a>, 615; United States v. Halstead, <a href="/us/23/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="10 Wheat. 51" data-case-ids="1434761" data-case-paths="/us/23/0051-01">10 Wheat. 51</a>. The state law here conflicts, as we have seen, with a later federal act, and the latter supersedes it. Upon these considerations, the decision of the Superior Court in Jones’ Est., <a href="/pa-super/84/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="84 Pa. Super. 170" data-case-ids="662659" data-case-paths="/pa-super/84/0170-01">84 Pa. Superior Ct. 170</a>, cited by' appellees, would seem to be questionable, although other considerations may have turned the issue. Fink v. O’Neill, <a href="/us/106/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="106 U.S. 272" data-case-ids="3498587" data-case-paths="/us/106/0272-01">106 U. S. 272</a>, is clearly distinguishable. The state law there involved had a direct relation to executions.</p>
