The Commonwealth thereupon began the present proceedings, claiming to recover an additional bonus on the capital stock, measuring the amount upon which it was to be charged, by the difference between an alleged statutory capital (ascertained by multiplying the number of new no-par shares by $100) and the sum upon which a bonus had theretofore been paid. The court below decided that, since the corporations did not receive any additional capital when the exchange of shares was made, the State had no legal claim. She thereupon prosecuted the present appeals.</p>

The Commonwealth’s claim must necessarily fail, therefore, unless it can be sustained because of the reference in its title to the Act of 1919.</p>

The cases are quite numerous, but the true rule, where it is attempted to impose a liability by reference to some earlier statute, is that set forth in Titusville Iron Works v. Keystone Oil Co., <a href="/pa/122/0627-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="122 Pa. 627" data-case-ids="1948401" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0627-01">122 Pa. 627</a>, 634, and never thereafter antagonized.

This effectually closes the old and well-worn short-cut route, and we cannot, no matter how much inclined we might be to do so,......[hold otherwise than that all attempts of the character stated] are void because of the infraction of section 6, of article III.” The proviso, now under consideration, attempted to travel that same “old and well-worn short-cut route,” but, as there decided, it was closed by the constitutional provision.</p>

Without it, the only possibly relevant provision of the statute would be section 1 which enacts that the classes of corporations specified might at any time change to or from stock having a par value to stock having no par value, and that “where shares without nominal or par value shall be provided for, a stated capital shall be fixed, — the amount of which shall be set forth in such proceedings, — which stated capital shall be governed by, and be subject to, the provisions of the acts of assembly relating thereto mnv in force or which may hereafter be enacted.” As the statute does not provide otherwise, the “stated capital” <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>would of course be tbe real capital of the corporation, and not a fictitious one ascertained by multiplying the total number of shares by $100. Those words are so defined in section 3 of the Act of 1919. Whatever their meaning in the Act of 1923, however, the utmost we could assume in favor of the Commonwealth, and this we do . without deciding the point, would be that the clause quoted justified the Commonwealth in charging an additional bonus under the circumstances specified in prior statutes, that is, if additional capital had been received by the corporation. This is not enough, however, to sustain the present claim. It would have to appear also that some statute, relating to the bonus to be paid on increase of capital stock, ■ provided for the arbitrary valuation of $100 per share. Here the contention wholly fails. • So far as we have been advised, or by our own investigation have ascertained, no statute authorizes such arbitrary valuation, except the Act of 1919, and it is, in terms, limited “to the bonus required to be paid...... under the provisions of this act,” that is, the Act of 1919, and hence only applies to the formation, reorganization, merger or consolidation of the corporations specified in it. It says nothing regarding a bonus to be paid on the increase of capitalization by existing corporations which are not being reorganized, merged or consolidated. Possibly the legislature intended by the Act of 1923, — though this is very doubtful, — that, under the circumstances appearing in the instant case, a valuation should be made in the way claimed, and an additional bonus paid; but, if so, it has not expressed its will, even remotely, save possibly in the unconstitutional proviso to that statute.</p>
