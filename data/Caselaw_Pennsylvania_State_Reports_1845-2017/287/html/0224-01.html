This act does not specify nonnegotiable instruments but authorizes the prothonotary to enter a judgment in favor of the original holder or his assignee, where the note confesses a judgment or contains a warrant of attorney for such confession. The holder of a note is “the payee or indorsee......who is in possession of it, or the bearer thereof”: Act of 1901, P. L. 220. ■ The term “holder” under the negotiable instruments act is much broader than the term assignee, but where the holder is the endorsee or bearer it is clear that he must also be an assignee and where as here delivery is made to him by the original payee it is as the latter’s assignee that he takes. Since the term holder may include an assignee, <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>the fact that Faulk was referred to as “holder” in the power of attorney is immaterial.</p>
    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[280,463,1151,588]]]'>Complaint is further made that the endorsement does not show an assignment from the original holder. The proceeding here is a motion to strike off. We have no evidence before us and we must take the record as presented. The court below held, and in this we concur, that there was an assignment by S. D. Oberlin to L. E. Faulk. The so-called special endorsements- should not be considered separately but jointly as they were intended to be. In the absence of evidence to the contrary an endorsement such as appears on this note by the record will be presumed to be a joint assignment.</p>
    <p id="b254-5" data-blocks='[["BL_254.6",254,[281,1063,1150,588]]]'>The note was assigned, as appears by the endorsement on the back, and, though another person in addition to the payee may have executed the assignment, that does not destroy the validity of the assignment by the payee, the original holder, which is all that is necessary to satisfy the act. Such signature, carrying with it a liability by contract (Kline v. Keiser, <a href="/pa/87/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="87 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="1057816" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0485-01">87 Pa. 485</a>; Southern Lime &amp; Stone Co. v.

The judgment was properly entered as evidenced by Curry v. Bacharach Quality Shops, Inc., <a href="/pa/271/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="271 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="295672" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0364-01">271 Pa. 364</a>.</p>

Appellant seems to have lost sight of the fact that the note provides for the entry of judgment by “any court of record (having jurisdiction of the amount) at any term of such court.” As the court below properly observed, there was no territorial limitation on the jurisdiction within which this might be done. Our Act of 1806 applied to the note, and authorized the entry of judgment by the prothonotary. While, under the “full faith and credit clause” of the Constitution, as held in <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>Grover &amp; Baker Sewing Machine Co. v.

S. 287</a>, a judgment so entered in one state might not be binding or of any force in another state which did not recognize such procedure because the defendant was not served with a process and did not voluntarily appear, or because the judgment was not confessed by the warrant of attorney, still the same opinion recognizes the validity of the judgment in the state whose procedure authorized it, though it might be contrary to the laws and policy of another state where it is sought to be enforced.</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[142,962,1155,965]]]'>Moreover, the presumption, without evidence to the contrary, is that the law of the state where the note was made, is the same as that in Pennsylvania (Musser v. Stauffer, <a href="/pa/178/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="178 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="885511" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0099-01">178 Pa. 99</a>; Cape May Real Estate Co. v.

Nor is the presumption avoided because the law of Pennsylvania happens to be a statute: Baughman’s Est., <a href="/pa/281/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="281 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1086979" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0023-01">281 Pa. 23</a>, 37-38.

Radcliffe, <a href="/us/137/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="137 U.S. 287" data-case-ids="3546677" data-case-paths="/us/137/0287-01">supra,</a> the opinion held that the maker of every note does not undertake to write into his engagement all the local laws of every state, even though a confession of judgment is authorized, we need not decide whether the Act of 1806 shall be read into the note. When the instrument was' presented to the prothonotary, it must be assumed, in the absence of evidence, that it came from a state which authorized entry of judgment there in the same manner that the prothonotary was called on to enter it here under our laws.</p>
    <p id="b255-6" data-blocks='[["BL_255.6",255,[142,1954,1153,150]]]'>We hold that the judgment was properly entered, and the order of the court below discharging the rule is affirmed at cost of appellant.</p>
