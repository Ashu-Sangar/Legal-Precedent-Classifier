The Act of July 10,1919, P. L. 887, divides the counties of the State into eight classes, those having a population of between one hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty thousand, of which Schuylkill is one, constitute the fourth class. Section 5 of article XIV of the state Constitution provides, in effect, that the-officers in each county having a population exceeding one hundred and fifty thousand shall be paid by salary and all fees received shall go to the county. It follows that the sheriff of Schuylkill County is a salaried officer. The act giving rise to this litigation is that of May 10, 1923, P. L. 183, the title to which is: “An Act authorizing sheriffs in counties of the fourth class to appoint a solicitor; prescribing the duties of said solicitor and fixing his salary”: while the act is, inter alia, as follows: “Section 1. That in all counties of the fourth class the sheriff may appoint one person learned in the law as his solicitor. Section 2. Said solicitor shall advise upon all legal matters that may be submitted to him, and shall conduct any litigation when requested so to do by the sheriff. The solicitor shall hold office for the term for which the sheriff was elected, and <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>shall receive a salary of five hundred dollars per annum to be paid out of the county treasury.” Pursuant thereto, the sheriff appointed the plaintiff, E. J. Graeff, Esq., as his solicitor, and this suit was brought to compel payment of his salary. The lower court granted the relief prayed for; this the Superior Court reversed and dismissed the petition, holding the Act of 1923 unconstitutional; plaintiff has appealed.</p>

In the language of Judge, now Mr. Justice Kephart, speaking for the Superior Court, in Carr v. Ætna etc. Co., <a href="/pa-super/64/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="64 Pa. Super. 343" data-case-ids="457925" data-case-paths="/pa-super/64/0343-01">64 Pa. Superior Ct. 343</a>, 349, “Unless a substantive matter, entirely disconnected with the named legislation, is included within the folds of the bill, the act should not be declared a violation of the Constitution by reason of its title offending section 3, of article III.” In the instant case there is nothing in the act not expressly covered by the title, except the provision that the county shall pay the solicitor’s salary. This is clearly implied from the fact that the sheriff is a county officer whose sole remuneration is a fixed salary payable by the county. The county is the only municipality men<a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>tioned in the title, hence, whom but the county should or could the act direct to pay the solicitor? There is nothing in the title to support an enactment that the State or any subdivision of the county pay the salary which the title says the act provides; hence, it must be chargeable to the county. It is not logical to say the act might be expected to provide for payment of the solicitor’s salary by the sheriff. Such a statute would be a vain thing, for the sheriff, like any other citizen, without statute, might employ one or more lawyers at his own expense. The manifest purpose of the act was to relieve the sheriff, — who, in this class of counties, receives but a modest salary, — from the expense of a solicitor, and yet enable him to secure competent legal help. Where the sheriff is compensated by fees, his income may be ample to include necessary counsel fees. The act in question is not unlike that of July 18,1917, P. L. 1042, amended by the Act of April 4, 1919, P. L. 37, providing a solicitor for the county controller, or that of July 17, 1919, P. L. 995, providing for the appointment of assistant district attorneys, in certain counties, the title in neither of which says the county shall be liable for their salaries; yet such liability is implied from the nature of the offices and the duties performed, and the body of each statute so provides. See Maginnis v. Schlottman, <a href="/pa-super/76/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="76 Pa. Super. 124" data-case-ids="8860363" data-case-paths="/pa-super/76/0124-01">76 Pa.

It was recognized that cities varying greatly in population will probably vary so greatly in the amount, importance and complexity of their municipal business, as to require different officers and different systems of administration. Classification therefore is based on difference of municipal affairs, and, so long as it relates to and deals with such affairs, the questions of where the lines shall be drawn, and what differences of system shall be prescribed for differences of situation, are wholly legislative. What is a distinction without a difference is largely matter of opinion. No argument, for example, could be more plausible than that there is no real difference in municipal needs, between a city of 99,000 and one of 100,000 population. It is a sufficient answer that the line must be drawn somewhere, and the legislature must determine where. So long as it is drawn with reference to municipal and not irrelevant or wholly local matters, the courts have no authority to interfere.” The test is not wisdom but good faith in the classification: Seabolt v.

To this we cannot agree. Here the sheriff, in the matter of collecting fees, is, in effect, the county’s agent and as practically every official act of his is compensated by fees belonging to the county, it is of vital interest to the latter that he have suitable legal assistance. Again, his acts are so interwoven with the administration of justice that any error on his part is likely to cost the county money, which is another reason why the county is interested in his having competent legal advice. Furthermore, an error on <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>his part might vitiate the election of county officers or the selection of jurors. As a rule sheriffs are not lawyers and there is no county official more in need of legal help than they, and the office of sheriff’s solicitor is almost as much a matter of municipal concern as the office of sheriff itself, as it has a direct bearing upon the proper performance of the duties of the incumbent of that office.</p>
