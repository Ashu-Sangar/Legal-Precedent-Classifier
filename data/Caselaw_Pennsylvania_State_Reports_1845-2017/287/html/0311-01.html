Moreover, we cannot agree that the commission attempted to afford defendant any such relief; or, to quote appellant’s words, that the record shows the “commission, with full knowledge and after due consideration [of] the contract...... exercised its discretion, [and therefore] said contract is ipso facto abrogated.” The report of the commission fails to warrant this construction; it simply states the conclusion of law, that the contract does not prevent the Public Service Commission from assessing on the parties concerned “such just and proper portions of the cost of maintenance......as the commission may determine.” This means only that, so far as the public interests are involved in the maintenance of the bridge in good order and repair, the contract cannot prevent the commission, in the first instance, from assessing the cost of such maintenance in the manner and proportions which to it may seem best; the report <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>contains no ruling or attempt to rule that, after the parties concerned have responded to the order of the commission, they are debarred from enforcing the contract between themselves.</p>

While the railroad company was legally obliged to keep the original grade crossing in repair, yet, in 1902, it was under no obligation to erect a bridge over such grade crossing.

This was done under the contract before us, and, further, in order to permit the borough to accommodate the street railway company (from whom the borough received $5,000 in cash and an undertaking to pay for the maintenance of the bridge, which obligation was adhered to for some years), plaintiff company constructed a much more substantial bridge than would have been necessary to care for ordinary traffic. Then, also, plaintiff was obliged to purchase land for the approaches to the bridge. On this state of facts, it cannot be held that the contract lacked consideration.</p>

L. 320, chapter II, section 2, confers on these municipal bodies the broad right to pass such ordinances “as they shall deem necessary......for the government of the borough,” and subsequent sections confer powers over roads and streets, — powers which, in connection with the general police power provided for by section 2, have been liberally construed to go beyond the mere regulation of public order: see Boro, of Millerstown v. Bell, <a href="/pa/123/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="123 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="967112" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0151-01">123 Pa. 151</a>, 154, and Boro. of Ridley Park v.

Superior Ct. 615</a>, 619. The original grade crossing was in the bed of a street or highway passing through defendant’s corporate limits; after this crossing was replaced by the bridge, entirely within the municipal limits, the latter “became a part of” the borough’s system of streets (Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Greensburg, etc., Ry.

L. 299, section 1, boroughs have wide jurisdiction to manage and control their roads and streets. Finally, the Act of June 9, 1874, P. L. 282, has a proviso which contains what may properly <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>be taken as a legislative construction of powers previously conferred on boroughs, to the effect that, in 1874, they possessed the legal right (since then expressly conferred on them by the Acts of May 25, 1907, P. L. 240, 241, and of May 14, 1915, P. L. 312, 367) to enter into obligations such as the one here sought to be enforced. The Act of 1874 states, “that nothing in this proviso contained shall affect any contract made, or hereafter to be made, with any railroad company [for] apportioning the expenses of altering and adjusting the grades of existing railroads and intersecting streets in any.....borough, so as to dispense with grade crossings.” The contract at bar is of the character thus described; it provides a method adopted by defendant borough and plaintiff railroad for dividing or apportioning the expense of abolishing a grade crossing. At this day and under the circumstances of this case, we shall not depart from the legislative view, indicated in 1874, that boroughs possessed the legal right to make such contracts. On many occasions between 1874 and the date of the first statute which specifically provided for borough contracts to abolish grade crossings, these municipal bodies, throughout the state, acted, like defendant, on the theory that they, under their general powers, already possessed the right to enter into such contracts; this is the view of law expressed by the legislature itself, — the source of all municipal powers, — and we have been shown no reason or authority which moves us to depart from it in the present instance. The only case in this court touching on the point of law now under discussion, which our own research has disclosed, is South Waverly Borough’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=20%20W.N.C.%20209" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="20 W.N.C. 209">20 W.
