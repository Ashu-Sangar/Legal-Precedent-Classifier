Shelley took out two policies of life insurance for $5,000 each on his own life, and in 1890 assigned them to his minor daughter. On his death, ten years later, the proceeds were paid to her guardian. Upon arrival at majority in 1902, an amount, including this sum, was delivered, by order of the orphans’ court, to <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>the ward, and retained by her until November 3, 1922, when she died. Her entire estate, now for distribution, is much in excess of the sum received when she became of age. The Woman’s College of Baltimore (now Goucher College) presented a claim for $10,000 to the auditor appointed to distribute the balance in the hands of her executors, and the right to demand payment of it gave rise to the present litigation.</p>
    <p id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[151,757,1156,640]]]'>The father made a will in 1898, which was probated after his death in 1900, and named Doctor Goucher executor. The latter was then president of the institution above referred to, and continued to act in that capacity until 1908. An inventory of the estate was filed in which no reference is made to the insurance paid to the guardian of the daughter. A first but not a final account of the administration appears, and the executor was never discharged. During his lifetime, he made no demand for the return of the money received from the insurance company, so far as the record discloses, or for the payment of any sum from the daughter.</p>

Section five directed that the proceeds of the two policies of insurance, which had been previously transferred to her, and subsequently paid, as noted above, should be held in trust for the daughter, and, upon her death without children, the principal used for the Woman’s College, to be appropriated as therein provided. The executor was directed to invest this insurance fund in government or municipal bonds, and pay the income in the manner set forth, but he never collected the same. It was delivered to the guardian, a fact of which Doctor Goucher had full knowledge, he having at the same time received the proceeds of a third policy, standing in the name of the estate, and later distributed this money under the terms of the will.</p>

The net amount received until 1922, when Miss Shelley died, does not appear. It is insisted that the receipt of the income derived from the land constituted an election to take under the will, and, since benefit from one provision was accepted, the daughter was bound to see that all parts of it were given force and effect, thereby relinquishing her absolute right to the proceeds of the insurance, which it was her duty to surrender to the estate for distribution, as provided in paragraph five.</p>

It is true, the rights of the remainderman are ordinarily to be determined as of the time of the termination of the life estate, and, where the right of entry does not come into existence until it ends, the statutory period is measured from that time, since the estates of the remainderman and life tenant are distinct: Lloyd’s Est., <a href="/pa/281/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="281 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1087047" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0379-01">281 Pa. 379</a>; Stahl v.

In that case a trust fund was transferred by one executor to a second intact, to be used for the benefit of the latter’s wife for life.

On distribution of this specific fund, the remaindermen were held entitled to it, as against the heirs of the life tenant, their claim being presented within the statutory period after her death. The facts showed a definite sum set aside and held on an express trust, not subject to the running of the statute, until repudiated by the trustee, as we have heretofore noticed, and not an implied or constructive one. The executor in the case at bar at no time raised a trust fund, though it is now claimed he might have done so, in view of Miss Shelley’s election to take the rents of the farm.
