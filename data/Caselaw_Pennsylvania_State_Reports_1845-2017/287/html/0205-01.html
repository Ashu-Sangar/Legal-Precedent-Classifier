After an investigation by some of the larger creditors, in January, 1918, an agreement was entered into between the company, three persons styled “officers,” “such” creditors as would join, and three persons designated as “committee.” Seventy per cent of the stock was to be transferred to the committee, to be elected directors in place of the “officers” who had resigned. They were to continue the business of the company, or dispose of it in a manner specified.</p>
    <p id="b232-9" data-blocks='[["BL_232.12",232,[299,1786,1149,590]],["BL_233.1",233,[154,334,1152,97]]]'>The terms of the agreement were carried out, the committee running the business until 1919. The operation not being profitable, the “committee,” having received an offer for the entire business, including all property, decided to sell. The creditors signing the agreement accepted the offer, as did a majority of the stockholders, 1,300 shares held by the committee out of a total 1,600 shares approving the sale. It was consummated and the price received, $108,000, was turned over to the creditors’ committee. This sum, with other items, brought the . total assets to $113,000 in the committee’s hands, <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>which was distributed among the creditors named in the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b233-3" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[150,444,1156,812]]]'>In 1916, the Sample Company had contracted with Buehler for his services for a period of ten years. He agreed to purchase and pay for 100 shares of preferred stock; in case his services were not satisfactory, the company agreed to repurchase this stock. Buehler continued in its employ until 1919, when the above sale of all the company’s assets took place. His service being thus discontinued, Buehler brought suit against the Sample Company on his contract, and recovered judgment. The creditors’ committee did not consider his claim in distributing the $113,000. Buehler then secured the appointment of a receiver who filed this bill to compel the “committee” to account for all moneys received during their committeeship or as directors or officers of the company. An order was so made; it is here appealed.</p>

This conclusion is vigorously assailed because the transactions, it is claimed, lacked the essentials of such an assignment in that the committee were merely agents of the creditors and the proceeds of the sale were turned over to them as agents for their principal. It was denied Buehler had any standing as a creditor or otherwise to demand an accounting, or that there were any creditors who could demand it; and even if he was a creditor, he could not participate in the fund, as the funds in the committee’s hands were there through a lawful contract that debarred other creditors.</p>

Here we have a company, in failing circumstances, unable to liquidate its accounts. A committee of its creditors, after conference with the principal stockholders, conceived the idea of taking the property out of the management and control of the stockholders and their directors and placing it and the ownership of more than two-thirds of its stock in the hands of third persons. They were to run the business for the best interest of the creditors until all the debts were paid or if necessary take such action in voluntary or involuntary liquidation or sale as would produce like results. The business was unsuccessful, the property was sold and the assets distributed among the creditors signing the agreement. Appellants contend the committee acted merely as agent or attorney, without obligation to account for the purchase money to any one but their principals, the creditors. The money was received for them, and no other persons, and there never was any transfer of company property, qua property, to or through the creditors’ committee. At all times title remained in the corporation, and, when turned into cash, the latter was handed to the committee of the company for distribution among the creditors, under the agreement. Distribution was nothing more than payment of their claims. Though this may have been a preference and other creditors went unpaid, there is nothing in law to prevent a preference, where the end sought to be ob<a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>tained was, the payment of a claim, not in bad faith, or with an intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors.</p>

While title to it was not in them, their control, dominion and authority over it under the agreement was complete. It was provided (clause 1) that the creditors’ committee, as majority stockholders, might vote and otherwise deal with the shares of stock in the interest of the creditors, and that they might “cause the company to take such action, either in continuance of the business of the company or in voluntary <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>or involuntary liquidation as the committee might think best,” and until liquidation or sale the stock was to be held “until all the purposes of this agreement have been fulfilled and all the debts now existing or incurred shall have been paid.” The company, by the agreement, undertook to and did have transferred the evidences of ownership of property, namely, the shares of stock, and agreed, to and with those same persons, that the committee should sell the concern for creditors. The committee used the power in the agreement to elect themselves directors, and as such they conducted the company business. The offer to buy was made to the committee for, all “right, title and interest” of the “committee.” It was afterwards approved by them as directors and stockholders. They as a committee were empowered by the creditors to proceed. The committee, acting as directors, authorized the execution of the bill of sale. As directors, they transferred to themselves, as a committee, the proceeds of sale and remaining assets in cash of the company for distribution among the creditors. The committee were not all the creditors of the corporation nor any considerable part of them. Considering the ultimate results in view, it seems clear that a trust was intended and carried out by the creation and execution of these powers.</p>

The assignment does not purport to have been made in adjustment and satisfaction of the debt. Here we have an inability to pay debts; the persons, who were to receive the property, were named, and certain creditors were preferred. We need not consider separately the sale and payment for the property. We rest our conclusion upon all the facts before us; but, where creditors intervene, these circumstances, in connection with the sale and payment, would weigh materially in creating a trust which the statute turns to the benefit of all creditors.</p>
