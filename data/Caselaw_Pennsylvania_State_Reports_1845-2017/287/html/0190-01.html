This latter section was amended by the Act of July 15, 1919, P. L. 955, providing as follows: “Section 17. That all scrip, bonds, certificates and evidences of indebtedness issued......or assumed, or on which interest shall be paid, by any and every private corporation,......are hereby made taxable......for state purposes.” At the end of the section, the 1919 amendment added the following paragraph: “It is the intent of this act that all scrip, bonds, certificates, and evidences of <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>indebtedness made taxable under this section are not taxable under section one (1) of the act to which this is an amendment, and that only such scrip, bonds, certificates, and evidences of indebtedness which cannot be made taxable under this section are to be taxed under section one (1) of said act.”</p>

While the intent clause of this section does not broaden the subjects of taxation mentioned in it, it does specifically declare that only when scrip, bonds, etc., cannot be made taxable under this section, they are to be placed under section 1. Car trust certificates were given a definite status in section 1, being specifically named in that section in the Act of 1913. It was because of this specialization we held they were not taxable under section 17. They remain thus classified since the amendment of 1919, and if it were not for the strong language used in the intent <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>paragraph, which shows the evident purpose and desire of the legislature to bring all taxable subjects within that section which theretofore have been considered as being in either section, we might feel constrained to hold they still remained in section 1. But a particular reference, being considered as controlling over a general reference in a statute, must give way to a later statute emphasizing a legislative intent to regard the general reference as controlling. Rules for the construction of statutes yield to a legislative mandate as to how a special statute should be construed. In Com. v. Lehigh &amp; New England R. R. Co., supra, we held, where the subject was taxable under section 17 as well as section 1, it was taxed under the latter section. This was because of irreconcilability and double taxation, applying the principal above referred to, stated in Endlich’s Interpretation of Statutes, section 216. In Com. v. Megargee Bros., <a href="/citations/?q=275%20Pa.%2016" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="275 Pa. 16">275 Pa. 16</a>, in discussing the question whether certain mortgages were evidence of indebtedness, we said the principle relied on in Com. v. Lehigh &amp; New England R. R. Co., supra, did not apply. The amendment of 1919 brought this subject of taxation under section 17. This reasoning as to car trust securities was used in sustaining the Commonwealth’s position that the mortgages then under investigation, though not named in section 17, must be considered as included in “evidence of indebtedness.” Appellant states that this is inapplicable to the present case; we do not so regard it. The facts here and there involved have a close and necessary relation, even if the facts do not make it so that the principle discussed is the same. It is, as the court below found, conclusive of the first question, presented, that the specific reference must control.</p>

To bring equipment or corporate trust securities within any of them it must appear that they possess one of the elements called for.

The structure of the lease is, in its general legal aspects, similar to an ordinary bailment lease or contract. It is effective to do the work required and is recognized by our statutes in that, by the Act of July 5,1883, P. L. 176, it must be recorded. It is altogether legal that this ownership, vesting in one person, may legally be split <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>into many parts, and these parts' may be sold or distributed to and among those who are thereafter the owners. This may be accomplished through the lessor owner, himself or itself, as the case may be, or through a trustee, the usual method; the latter may issue a document signifying such ownership. It is here, as is the usual custom, called a “car trust security.” This method of splitting ownership does not detract from its efficacy as a bailment contract, and preserves intact its verility as such. Indeed, such instruments of leases may contain provisions for interest and promissory notes, covering the total value. These are recognized as being legitimate parts of a bailment contract: Wilson v. Weaver, <a href="/pa-super/66/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="66 Pa. Super. 599" data-case-ids="628144" data-case-paths="/pa-super/66/0599-01">66 Pa. Superior Ct. 599</a>, 604. They may be in favor of the original owner lessor, or be the property of the substituted owners. Whether the transaction is directly with the lessor, or, as here, through a trustee for substituted owners, by separate or joint assignment, to which the lessee is a party, the lease may have the dual effect of being an instrument evidencing completely part ownership, and an obligation calling for the payment of a sum of money. It is not necessary that they be expressed in separate papers, and either or both methods of enforcing the demand may be pursued, subject to our rules heretofore announced in like cases. This quality of combining a retention of title and ownership and a note calling for the payment of money is not referable solely to the law of bailments, but arises through that law, plus the contract on which the entire relationship is founded. We have, then, embodied in the same document, not only an obligation to pay, but as well a participating owner’s certificate.</p>

      <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>The ordinary bailment lease, without more, could scarcely be considered as coming within the provisions of this act, though the entire value is to be paid in rentals, and title may pass when a dollar is paid. But a different question arises, where, as here, the lessor, by virtue of the property owned, issues and sells independent instruments, call them participating certificates if you will, with all the characteristics of interest bearing securities, by which a sum of money is raised and which sum, with a stipulated annual charge for its use, is to be repaid the owner. Such documents possess in a stronger degree the dual properties indicated above.</p>
    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[279,1005,1151,1077]]]'>Here we have an ownership in a lessor, who leases to a railroad company, and an agreement of assignment containing the form of a car trust certificate, followed by the issuance of such certificate. This is a typical method, unobjectionable as a bailment. The lease, the primary paper, is for a term of years, a specified return in rent being named. It covers the purchase price of the property and is payable in certain installments, three-fourths of which are periodical. Penalties are attached for failures to comply with the conditions, and rights are granted to the lessee to become the ultimate owner by paying one dollar; no redelivery is specified, but that is unnecessary: Stiles v. Seaton, <a href="/pa/200/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="200 Pa. 114" data-case-ids="924337" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0114-01">200 Pa. 114</a>, 118; Federal Sales Co. v.

Certain rights appertain to the participating owners or the trustee in case of a. default. The assignment from the lessor to the trustee takes with it all the rights of the lessor, and creates broader conditions, not stipulated in the original contract. The car trust securities themselves do not exceed the terms of the lease, or the assignment.</p>

It stands precisely in the same attitude as <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>though it had given to its lessor notes or bonds covering the rental. If they had been sold it can scarcely be said they were not evidences of indebtedness. This lease was made with the further agreement that it was to be assigned to a trustee whose name was incorporated in the lease not only for the purpose of limiting the lessor’s right therein, but also to mark the. cars for identification. Reading these two documents together, we cannot escape the conclusion that they must be considered, so far as the question before us is concerned, as being one instrument.</p>
    <p id="b223-5" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[144,969,1155,810]]]'>In matters of this kind, particularly that of taxation, we look through the form to the substance. The railway company thus became a party to the assignment from the lessor to the trustee, who was to represent the participating owners to whom these certificates were sold. The equipment was only part of the security. The railway company laid itself open to general liability on these securities. The instrument reads as follows: “The par value of this security will be payable on the first day of -, A. D. 19 — ......In the meantime dividends hereon will be payable as evidenced......Both are payable ......out of the rentals......of certain cars..'____ by Gest to Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company......

In the same instrument this appellant accepted and became bound by the terms of that agreement. Therein, in case default was made in any covenant of the lease, the trustee or the owner, in addition to retaking the cars with the incidents attached thereto, had power to recover from the lessee for rent due or to become due until a sum was realized sufficient to pay in full the par value and the dividend warrants.</p>

As thus read, this in substance is more than an agreement to pay rentals ; the papers in terms provided for a debtor who must ultimately be liable for the payment in full of the face of this certificate, and a money charge for its use.</p>

This sum is not paid for the use of property, as was done in Commonwealth v. Phila. &amp; Erie R. R., <a href="/pa/164/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="164 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="860262" data-case-paths="/pa/164/0252-01">164 Pa. 252</a>, though it might be such payment in case there was a default, but its present status is a compensation for the use of the money originally turned in to the trustee. It is paid yearly on the par value of the certificate; it is this sum of money which the lessee contracts to repay either from rentals or out of its general fund. Rent is compensation for the use of land or property, while interest is a sum paid for the use of money. Dividends, common or preferred, are what the shareholder owner earns from the property without liability in case the dividends are not paid. Here, considering the rights and obligations springing from the certificate, the liability assumed by the railway company, it is idle to say, with the fact that this rent is ultimately payable as interest would be, with all the incidents and remedies attaching to it as would attach to the liability for payment of interest, that “interest” could be successfully disguised under the word “rental.” That it is to be paid to a trustee instead of directly to the participating owners, is immaterial. This is the customary method where a bond and mortgage is in existence.</p>

They would be called so more accurately than some other documents which we believe also would be known generally by that name. Their purpose, as stated in the agreement of the trustee with the railroad, is to secure payment to the holder with <em>interest; </em>they do nothing else. We do not regard the precise limits of the trust company’s undertaking as important. If it were only to collect and pay money received by the company under the secured contract of the railroad, it would be a security for money payment. But the counsel for the company seemed not prepared to argue that the company could not put the money received from the railroad into its general account without a breach of trust, and give the certificate holder cash or a check for his interest or principal. But be the undertaking greater or less, the security better or worse, we cannot regard these certificates as anything but corporate securities by general understanding and in fact.”</p>
