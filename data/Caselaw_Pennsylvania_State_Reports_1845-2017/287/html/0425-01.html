    <p id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.11",451,[128,1269,1152,863]]]'>In August, 1921, defendants, béing desirous of converting their residence in Sharon into a two-family apartment, made a verbal agreement with plaintiffs, who were contractors and builders, to furnish all material and do the work necessary for the purpose. It was to be done at cost plus fifteen per cent, and was started about the first of September and completed in December, 1921. The first bill for $666.07 was presented on September 17th and promptly paid. Other bills presented later, from time to time as the work progressed, were not paid and, after completion, plaintiffs filed a mechanic’s lien for the unpaid balance amounting to $3,862.02. A scire facias was issued to which an affidavit of defense was filed and thereon the case was tried, resulting in a verdict and judgment for plaintiffs for approximately the entire amount; defendants have appealed.</p>
    <p id="b451-7" data-blocks='[["BL_451.12",451,[128,2143,1152,265]],["BL_452.1",452,[267,330,1151,917]]]'>Numerous errors are assigned but we find nothing calling for a reversal. No motion was made to strike off the lien and the affidavit of defense went to the merits of the claim and averred, inter alia, that, as part of the verbal contract, plaintiffs guaranteed the entire cost of <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>the improvement would not exceed $2,500; one of the defendants so testified and said no changes were thereafter made. Defendants’ architect prepared a pencil sketch on which the verbal contract was based; but, although present at the making thereof and in court at the trial, was not called as a witness, or his pencil sketch produced. The plaintiff who made the contract, testified there was no guarantee as to total cost but that he estimated such cost, according to the pencil sketch, at from $2,500 to $2,700. He also testified that as the work progressed, numerous changes were made at the direction of defendants and their architect, including a change of rear porches into kitchens, replacing the old front porch with new enclosed porches, making an open stairway, the insertion of French doors, change of partition, etc., which, he said, made a much more expensive job. This branch of the case was for the jury.</p>

In other words, the first bill included the hours of work theretofore done on the job, and the second bill the hours done between the date •of the first and second bills and each bill gave the time as of the date it was presented, not setting out the actual hours of work done each separate day. This, defendants contend, amounted to such lumping charges as invalidated the lien and prevented a recovery thereon. The contention cannot be sustained. It is a direct proceeding between owner and contractor, where the same detailed statement is not required as between owner and subcontractor.

These cards <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>were approved by the foreman and filed with the bookkeeper at the end of the week. One of the plaintiffs spent several hours each day on the job in question. On proof of the accuracy of the slips by him, by the foreman and by the bookkeeper, they were received in evidence without calling the individual workmen. The time cards were kept in due course of business and, when duly proved, were competent evidence. Plaintiffs paid the workmen according to these cards and should be reimbursed. Charges are good if made according to the nature of the business and the usages of the trade in such business: Singerly v.

This is especially equitable as one plaintiff spent much time on the job for which the defendants paid nothing. In a cost plus contract, operating expenses are properly included as part of the cost of the material: Lytle, Campbell &amp; Co. v. Somers, F. &amp; T.
