Police power controls the use of property by the owner, for the public good, its use otherwise being harmful, while eminent domain and taxation take property for public use. Under eminent domain, compensation is given for property taken, injured or destroyed, while under the police power no payment is made for a diminution in use, even though it amounts to an actual taking or destruction of property. Under the 14th Amendment, property cannot be taken except by due process of law. Regulation under a proper exercise of the police power is due process, even though a property in whole or in part is taken or destroyed. The conditions on which its legitimate exercise is predicated should actually exist or their happening be so likely that restraint is necessary, similar to a court issuing a restraining order for injuries done or threatened to persons or property. Likewise, there should be a reasonable and substantial relation between the thing acted on and the end to be attained, one that promotes health, safety or general welfare, necessary to the common good, and a reasonable demand for regulation, not one that is merely an unnecessary “experimentation [or interference] with the fundamental rights of the individual”: Truax v.

The power of judicial investigation does not concern itself with the wisdom of the policy emanating from the legislative branch, or whether the best of all possible means of achieving the desired result has been selected. It is concerned only with the questions of whether the statute has a recognized police purpose, and whether it has a reasonable relation to the object to be attained.</p>

On what theory can this set-back line be justified as an effort to promote the general welfare? The ordinary use permits the owner to place his house where he wills; but this general welfare is not based on artistic taste, or repugnancy to the desires of a few. All grants of power are to be interpreted in the light of the maxims of Magna Charta and the common law as transmuted into the bill of rights; and those things which these maxims forbid cannot be regarded as within any grant of authority made by the people to their agents: Cooley, Const. Lim. 209. “To secure their property was one of the great ends for which men entered society. The right to acquire and own property, and to deal with it and use it as the owner chooses so long as the use harms nobody, is a natural right. It does not owe its origin to constitutions. It existed before them. It is a part of the citizen’s natural liberty, — an expression of his freedom, — guaranteed as inviolate by every American bill of rights”: Spann v.

W. 513</a>. What reasonable relation has the set-back line, or space in front of houses in ordinary residence districts, to the health, safety or morals of the community? It certainly would not disturb the comfort of the ordinary person; it is not offensive to the eye, nor a source of sickness; it does not materially increase or decrease fire hazards. To bring this, and other like regulations, under the police power, would be to sweep away constitutional guarantees on the ownership of property. It is regulation run mad.</p>

      <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>The application and consequence of this ordinance is a gross discrimination in that it does not hear alike on all persons living within the same territory. Regulations which do not operate on all alike cannot be justified under the police power. Here it affects property differently on adjoining blocks, ór within the same block or on opposite sides of the street. As Judge Linn of the Superior Court states, “The. ordinance purports to zone the entire city — built-up as well as unbuilt. Section 32 (b) establishes a building line on streets wholly or partially built up. Consideration of the section will disclose that the line may be further back from the street line on one side of the street than on the other, and even on the same side of the street its distance from the street line may vary in different squares, its location depending wholly on how far back (if at all) a house or houses had already been built, and if but one house had been built, its line would seem to control all the other lot owners. If no house had been built, 32 (a) would seem to require all builders to recede at least fifteen feet.” We may add, if there is only one building erected in a block, placed back, say, 100 feet, from the street line, then all other buildings afterwards erected in the block, whether eighty per cent or more of the total number, would have to conform to this one. If the lots in a square were of different depths, the owners of the short lots might not be able to build at all on their lots, if they had to maintain the same distance back from the street as the eighty per cent of the buildings already erected on longer lots. No provision is made either for the difference in the character of the houses or their width or depth. They may all be of different sizes. It would be confiscatory to enforce such an ordinance. It applies only to one side of the street in blocks where eighty per cent of the houses are already set back a uniform distance.</p>
