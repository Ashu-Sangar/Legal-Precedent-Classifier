The former thereupon graded and constructed the roadbed, passing it under the tracks of the Reading Company, near Swatara Station. As directed by the commission, the entire cost of the subway, within its right-of-way, was paid by the railroad, no portion of the work beyond being undertaken by it, except the building of two retaining walls to the east, a consideration not important in the determination of this proceeding. In approaching the underground passage, the road officials reduced the grade of the highway, not, however, altering the existing center or side lines. As a result of the improvement there was a cut where the road passed through the land of Hoffer, trustee', the present plaintiff, from the old grade, at a <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>point near the southwest corner of his land, to the bed beneath the railroad tracks,. gradually descending to a depth of eight feet. The result was to make entrance into the abutting property difficult, except at the upper end.</p>
    <p id="b147-3" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[137,618,1170,1669]]]'>The Public Service Commission directed that, in addition to the cost of the new subway, the railroad should pay all consequential damages which might be occasioned by the reconstruction of the adjoining highway, made necessary so that traffic might pass through it. Against the latter’s protest, the petition of plaintiff, asking compensation for the loss sustained by the change of grade, was allowed, and an award made in his favor. The defendant company intervened and appealed, and the question of its liability for the damages assessed was submitted to the court of common pleas for decision. No facts were in dispute, and it was agreed by all parties that the proceeding before the commission had been initiated by the highway department, which undertook the actual grading and building of the road, — the center and side lines of the old highway, located in a township of the second class, not being altered, — and that the subway was built at the expense of the railroad entirely withjn its right-of-way, except as above noted. The learned court below was of opinion that the property damage occasioned by the alteration of grade was compensable, and under the terms of the Public Service Act, was chargeable by the commission to defendant. Judgment was entered against it for $2,659.59, a sum which included interest from the date of the original award, as stipulated by the parties. This amount is determinative of the question of the appellate jurisdiction, and made necessary a review here, if any was demanded. The suggestion of defendant that the appeal shouid have. been taken to the Superior Court, because of the amount involved, is without merit.</p>

The Constitution of 1874 (art.

Just as before, the injury must be proximate, immediate and substantial in order to permit a recovery.

Superior Ct. 381</a>, 386. Prior to the statute referred to, there could be no award for damages resulting from a change of grade by the State Highway Department, or by a railroad company for the elevation or depression of tracks within the line of its own right-of-way, and this legislation did not extend the liability to cover such loss.</p>

      <em>isted; </em>and for damages, such, as claimed here against defendant, there was none. The only injury to be considered by it was a legal one, recognized as collectible by the Constitution or legislative enactments. The cost of construction ordered, and allowances to which the landowner is entitled by statute, may be assumed, in part at least, by the Commonwealth, or divided between the municipal and public service corporations affected, but only such items can enter into the total as are compensable by law, and injuries arising from change of grade are not included. It is suggested, however, that the framers of the act indicated a purpose to provide payment for such consequential injuries, though not previously allowable, since, in the parenthetical clause relating to damages for property “taken, injured or destroyed,” these words are used “ (for which compensation the said owners are hereby invested with warrant of authority, upon appeal from the determination of the commission, to sue the Commonwealth),” disclosing thereby, it is said, an intention to permit recovery for any loss no matter how occasioned. An examination of the statute leads to the belief that the provision referred to was inserted so that payment by the State could be enforced, when the commission assumed responsibility for part of the legal damage inflicted, or undertook the construction by its own contractors, as permitted by the act, when the municipal and public service corporations did not agree to do the work by their own agents, as directed. In such case, the only redress would be by suit against the State, and, to cover such contingencies, the right to institute appropriate proceedings, by the one entitled to compensation, was given.</p>

If there was any injury, it resulted from the cutting of the. road by the highway department. Had it undertaken the improvement, as it could have done after securing a certificate of public convenience, clearly no damages could have been recovered on account of the <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>alteration, nor is the situation changed because it saw fit to seek the aid of the commission in abolishing the crossing, thereby compelling the railroad to bear part of the cost. The Public Service Law contemplates the existing right to compensation under some statute, and merely determines how this sum shall be apportioned. It does not attempt to impose new liability for alterations of grade, as has been expressly directed in the case of changes in roads and streets by some classes of municipalities: State Highway Route No. 72, supra. There is no legislative enactment making such claim a legal charge, and no recovery can, therefore, be had against defendant.</p>
