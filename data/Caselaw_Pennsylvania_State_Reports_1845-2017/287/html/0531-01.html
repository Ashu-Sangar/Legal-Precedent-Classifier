We do not so regard it. The inhibition prevents one known to have the qualifications of an optometrist, and licensed as such, from doing a thing in the same way as one who is not so known. In the one case, the vendor does not assume, directly or indirectly, to adapt glasses to the eyes. They are sold as so much merchandise. In the other case, the very fact of the license clothes his act with an apparent assumption that the glasses are adapted and fitted to the eyes. This imposes on the credulity of the public, already overtaxed by similar acts. It may be said this assumption would be true if a physician sold glasses in the manner indicated. This does not follow, as one learned in that profession is better qualified to treat the eye and determine to a degree from an inspection of it what would or would not be necessary in glasses or medicine than one having an optometric education. An optometrist is not required to study the branches of medical education and science which treat of the structure of the eye, or the related physical organisms on which it depends for life, and the effects which may follow any disruption of normal functioning. The difference between the two professions, if optometry may be called such, is so apparent that further discussion is unnecessary. Moreover, the legislature has power to classify and regulate itinerant ped<a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>dlers (Com. v. Gardner, <a href="/pa/133/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="133 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="812881" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0284-01">133 Pa. 284</a>); and this should be so in cases like the one before us, for a broader reason, namely, such classification and regulation affects directly the health of the community: Baccus v. State of Louisiana, <a href="/us/232/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="232 U.S. 334" data-case-ids="3672237" data-case-paths="/us/232/0334-01">232 U. S. 334</a>. The law operates equally on all persons within the defined classification. The prohibition as to peddling of glasses by optometrists is a reasonable exercise of the police power by the legislature, having a direct and reasonable relation to the health of the people.</p>
    <p id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[272,886,1151,634]]]'>Appellant urges the act prohibits him from practicing outside or away from his office though he uses lawful methods. We do not understand the law so to read. There is nothing to prohibit the practitioner from intermittent practicing away from his office if he obeys the law. He cannot practice it by peddling on the streets or from person to person as the itinerant merchant, but if he is called to a home or hospital he must provide himself with the instruments necessary to properly fit or adapt glasses to the eye. We do not interpret the provision in the Act of 1925, supra, as prohibiting such visits.</p>
    <p id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.6",562,[270,1542,1151,532]]]'>An optometrist may not open more than one office unless he has a licensed optometrist in charge of the second office. If it is desired to engage in business on a large scale, and cover different places with his license, he must either make the examination personally with the necessary instruments or have it done in the same way by a registered optometrist. What the act intends to prevent is the indiscriminate opening of offices nominally under the protection of a license, but in reality in charge of one who is not registered.</p>

As stated in Butcher v. Baybury, 8 Fed. (2d) 153, “no person can acquire a vested right to continue, when once licensed, in a business, trade or occupation Avhich is subject to <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>legislative control and regulation under the police power. The rights and liberty of the citizen are all held in subordination to that governmental prerogative, and to such reasonable regulations and restrictions as the legislature may from time to time prescribe. Regulations so prescribed and conformed to by. the citizens may be subsequently changed or modified by the legislature wherever public interest requires it, without subjecting its action to the charge of interfering with contract or vested rights. This is elementary.” As further stated, in a note on page 1273 of vol. 8, L. R. A. (N. S.), “The granting of a license in such cases is merely the means taken by the State, in the exercise of the police power, to regulate and restrict the engaging in certain professions and occupations for the public good, and confers no right whatever, in the way of a contract with the State, upon the licensee. He takes the same subject to the right of the State, at any time that the public demands, to make further restrictions and regulations thereto; and, if such restrictions and regulations are reasonable, they will be upheld, even though they actually prohibit some people from further engaging in such occupations or professions under a license previously granted.”</p>
