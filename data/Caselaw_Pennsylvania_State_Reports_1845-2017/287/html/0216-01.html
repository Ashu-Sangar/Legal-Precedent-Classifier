In the latter part of 1921 it had apparently large inventories, heavy liabilities, and a small amount of current assets. Its officers, in Febru<a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>ary, 1922, organized a Delaware corporation of the same name. The purpose was to sell first preferred stock and use the money received therefrom in the Pennsylvania company’s business.</p>

It is stated a 20% commission was paid by the Pennsylvania company to their directors, as individuals, for selling the stock. This commission was, with some additional expense for stationery, charged as a debt against the Delaware company. Dividends on this first preferred stock sold were paid in June, September and December of 1922 from the sum retained from the proceeds of the sale of that stock, avowedly out of interest on the notes given by the Pennsylvania company which had accrued but which had not been paid. We shall consider later whether these payments were out of income.</p>

The only evidence we have on the subject is contained in the advertisement or the prospectus. The purpose stated therein was not', to pay debts or to take up factor’s loans, or factor’s commissions, etc., as suggested by counsel in an objection to certain evidence. As appears in the prospectus, “The <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>Delaware Company intends to take over a property in Grassland......consisting of a stone factory building and 10% acres of land with freight station and railroad siding, within thirty minutes of the center of Philadelphia......and there install its spinning mill, thereby eliminating the rental space.....Other purposes of this issue are to provide funds to enable the company to fill the quantity of advance orders on hand and to do the very large business available during the next eleven months, which larger business the company can handle at an increased profit with its present facilities.” Then follows the alluring statement as to earnings. “Sales for the past three years have averaged nearly $1,500,000 annually. Net earnings applicable to dividends, on the first preferred stock for the past three years after depreciation, have averaged over two and one-half times the dividend requirements of this issue.” Observe the record, as given below.</p>

They proposed to sell $500,000 of eight per cent first preferred stock with actual net earnings, applicable to dividends, as follows: 1918, $10,901; 1919, $20,625; 1920, $13,624; 1921, $14,956. It is idle to talk about two and one-half times dividend requirements being earned in the last three years. The statement of counsel, standing alone, that the Pennsylvania company could refinance the company factor’s interest or factor’s commission or charges in order to make the prospectus true, cannot be considered in the face of this prospectus. But what was actually done with the $168,000 paid over to the Pennsylvania company? True, $34,000 was pai,d out as commission. What of the balance? As to this the record is silent. <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>Apparently it was lost somewhere in the operation of the Pennsylvania company.</p>
    <p id="b245-3" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[151,446,1154,755]]]'>Undoubtedly the, Pennsylvania concern was in ex-tremis, and ready for the legal undertaker. Instead of submitting peacefully, however, the shrewd minds of the defendants devised a scheme whereby a large sum of money was secured which, had it been used honestly in an effort to bring the old concern back to life might have extenuating circumstances; but there is no evidence here of such use, good faith, or anything to sustain a finding that this was an honest transaction. Conceding that it was the purpose of the new concern to lend money to the old, under the conditions' existing at the time, it becomes a question whether the action of the directors in this case was an exercise of the good business judgment the law requires of them.</p>

    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[278,599,1155,959]]]'>The Delaware company held notes in the sum of $168,-000. The two companies, through officers who were identical, sold all the machinery and equipment of the plant to the Delaware company for approximately $151,000. The agreement was therefore signed by the same persons as officers for both companies. It is difficult to find any benefit to the Delaware company as a result of this transaction. The Delaware company, through the same men, surrendered its notes to themselves as officers of the Pennsylvania company, receiving in exchange this agreement or bill of sale and a new note for $17,000 which was the balance of the former sum of $172,000. This note was more than balanced, however^, by other claims against the Delaware company. Perfectly competent evidence to show the real value of the machinery at the time of transfer was! refused. Notwithstanding this, we are able, from the only evidence in the record, to find this value.</p>
    <p id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.6",246,[276,1580,1152,805]]]'>This machinery was carried oh the books of the company at $100,000, less a depreciation of $40,000, leaving its net worth $60,000. The testimony of a man associated with the machinery for years, competent to fix value, made it $68,000 ready for operation, or $60,000 removed. This did not include the heating plant, plumbing, electric lighting and office fixtures, all of the latter priced at $7,521. The only evidence in this case fixes the value at approximately $75,000. The company’s bookkeeper corroborates this in stating that an adjustment of $48,000 was necessary to balance the books after this increased sale price to the Delaware company. There was not a scrap of evidence to justify the sum fixed, $151,000, but, on this basis, notes due to the Delaware company were wiped out.</p>

It is attempted to be justified on tbe theory that tbe Delaware company earned interest on the money loaned to the Pennsylvania company. It is said there was an account receivable that would justify the dividends. No money as such earnings bad ever been paid. A sum out of capital had been retained for tbe purpose of paying these dividends. But in any event tbe debt owed by Delaware company for tbe commissions paid by Pennsylvania company exceeded the obligation of Pennsylvania to Delaware, after tbe machinery sale in November, and before the last dividend. There were due amounts ranging from $9,000 to $27,000. Tbe purpose of paying dividends is manifest. It was to induce the unwary to buy more preferred stock. Such act was a powerful lever in tbe sale. The payment of dividends was a manifest abuse of business discretion, which directors are supposed to possess. It was a payment out of capital and can be designated in no other way. Tbe Delaware company is still a going concern, but, even if not, it can compel an accounting for a sum paid out from capital as dividends to the prejudice of an indebtedness of the company, even though there were accounts <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>receivable.

We there held directors responsible for dividends paid out of capital, even though based on a treasurer’s report showing earnings, whereas, in fact, no earnings had been made with which to pay dividends. They are required to make reasonable investigations, and here, even on appellee’s theory, a balancing of accounts must show payment out of capital when the first two dividends were paid, and there cannot be the slightest question as to the last one. See, as to net profits, 14 C. J. 799, 802, 805. “The value of the loans upon which the earnings were computed was not checked up and as a matter of fact the loans turned out to be valueless and the interest on the same which made up the supposed earnings of the society was never paid”: Phila.
