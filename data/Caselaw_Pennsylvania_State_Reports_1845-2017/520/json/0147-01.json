        "text": "NIX, Chief Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent.\nBy today\u2019s order, the majority has taken another unnecessary and unwise step away from a longstanding and beneficial rule governing the modification of court-ordered child custody arrangements. Because today\u2019s decision is based on Karis v. Karis, 518 Pa. 601, 544 A.2d 1328 (1988), it is implicitly a statement that the original custody order involved in the instant case was modifiable without proof of a \u201csubstantial change in circumstances.\u201d\nPrior to this Court\u2019s decision in Karis v. Karis, a well settled rule in this Commonwealth was that modification of a child-custody order had to be based on a \u201csubstantial change in circumstances\u201d and the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child. In re Estate of R.L.L., 487 Pa. 223, 409 A.2d 321 (1979); Commonwealth ex rel. v. Daven, 298 Pa. 416, 148 A. 524 (1930); Parker v. MacDonald, 344 Pa.Super. 552, 496 A.2d 1244 (1985); Commonwealth v. Bishop, 185 Pa. Super. 362, 137 A.2d 822 (1958); Commonwealth ex rel. Teitelbaum v. Teitelbaum, 160 Pa.Super. 286, 50 A.2d 713 (1947).\nIn connection with the principle last mentioned, the Superior Court established a rule requiring that, on a petition to change an existing child-custody order, the petitioner had to show, as a threshold matter, that there had been a \u201csubstantial change in circumstances.\u201d Constant A. v. Paul C.A., 344 Pa.Super. 49, 496 A.2d 1 (1985); Agati v. Agati, 342 Pa.Super. 132, 492 A.2d 427 (1985); Fatemi v. Fatemi, 339 Pa.Super. 590, 489 A.2d 798 (1985); Hartman v. Hartman, 328 Pa.Super. 154, 476 A.2d 938 (1984); Daniel K.D. v. Jan M.H., 301 Pa.Super. 36, 446 A.2d 1323 (1982). Unless the petitioner met that initial burden, a court would not reexamine the previous judicial determination as to custody. E.g., Constant A. v. Paul C.A., supra; Agati v. Agati, supra. The previous adjudication carried with it a presumption that it was in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child.\nThe rule requiring a threshold showing of changed circumstances was based on a cogent and, in my view, compelling consideration: unless the petitioner seeking modification is required to make an initial showing of substantially changed circumstances, the custodial status of the child could be subjected to destabilization by repeated spurious or frivolous petitions, and by the frequent relitigation of issues previously resolved. Agati v. Agati, supra.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, this Court in Karis v. Karis, supra, held that an existing order for partial physical custody could be changed to one for shared custody without preliminary proof of a \u201csubstantial change in circumstances.\u201d The Karis majority based that holding on its construction of sections 5304 and 5310 of the \u201cCustody and Grandparents Visitation Act,\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5310. Section 5304 empowers a court to enter an award for shared custody. Section 5310 provides that \u201c[a]ny order for custody ... may ... be modified at any time to an order of shared custody____\u201d (Emphasis added.) Both of these sections are 1985 reenactments of provisions contained in a 1981 statute. See Act of November 5, 1981, P.L. 322, 23 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1005, 1011.\nThe wording of section 5310 providing for the entry of an order for shared custody \u201cat any time\u201d can arguably be interpreted as eliminating the \u201csubstantial change in circumstances\u201d threshold where the court is being called upon to consider the entering of an order of shared custody. I, however, do not believe that such a construction accurately reflects the legislative intent sought to be expressed. I am of the view that this language was employed to stress the viability of shared custody as an effective remedy in many of these cases. The concept of shared custody, either physical or legal, offers the trial court the flexibility to maximize the available positive input a natural parent can offer to the rearing of his or her offspring. Where both parents are fit, exhibit a desire to share in a continuing involvement with the child, and are capable of setting aside their personal differences to communicate and cooperate in promoting the best interest of the child, that opportunity should be fully exploited. It is my view that the \u201cat any time\u201d language employed in section 5310 was merely to direct the court\u2019s attention to considering the possibility of shared custody whenever it was appropriately called upon to reevaluate a previous custody order. I still maintain that it is only appropriate to reevaluate an existing order where the change of circumstances would dictate such action. Repetitive and frivolous assaults upon an existing custody arrangement undercut the security necessary to establish a supportive environment for the rearing of the child and therefore undermine the best interests of the child.\nI joined in the result reached in Karis because the record established that the trial court did find a \u201csubstantial Change in circumstances\u201d before proceeding to reexamine the prior order. I noted in my concurring opinion my disagreement with the view that section 5310 requires that we discard the former threshold requirement. Karis, 518 Pa. at 609-10, 544 A.2d at 1333. I reassert that point of departure today.\nHere the majority compounds its error in Karis by using it as decisional authority in a procedural posture where section 5310 has no applicability. In this matter, the court had given Martin S. Jaindl \u201cprimary physical custody\u201d of his six-year-old son Brian. The initial order had also provided that the child\u2019s mother was to have \u201cpartial physical custody\u201d during specified hours of each weekday and on alternate weekends. Upon a petition for modification filed by the mother, the court transferred custody to the mother and gave the father only visitation rights. The court noted that each of the parents would provide a \u201cloving and caring environment\u201d and that the \u201cequities\u201d of the matter were \u201cextremely close.\u201d The Superior Court, on review, concluded that the record did not demonstrate a \u201csubstantial change in circumstances\u201d that would warrant the entertaining of the petition for modification and on that basis reversed the order, thereby reinstating the initial order.\nAlthough this situation does not fall within section 5310, which speaks only of modification \u201cto\u201d an order of \u201cshared custody\u201d, the majority nonetheless relies upon Karis as its basis for concluding that the threshold inquiry is no longer necessary to consider the merits of petitions for modification. Thus the unstated result of this Court\u2019s reversal is to signal the bar of this Commonwealth that petitions for modification of custody orders may be entertained at any time without regard to whether there have been any material changes which would warrant a reevaluation. I am confident the unsettling impact of today\u2019s decision will soon become evident.\n. If the majority\u2019s response is due to their disagreement with the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that the record did not establish a \u201csubstantial change of circumstances\u201d to warrant entertaining the petition, I concede that there could be merit in the majority\u2019s position on that issue. In such case, the appropriate response would have been to reverse that finding and remand the matter to the Superior Court to review the lower court\u2019s order as to the best interests of the child.",
