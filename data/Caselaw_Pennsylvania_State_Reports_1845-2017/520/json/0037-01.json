The order of the Superior Court is vacated to the extent that the court found the aforementioned issues to have been waived because they were not raised in the Court of Common Pleas, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for consideration of those issues only. In all other respects, the petition is denied.\nJURISDICTION RELINQUISHED.",
