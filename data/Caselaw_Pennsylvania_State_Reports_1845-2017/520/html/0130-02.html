Thompson.</p>
    <p id="b298-7" data-blocks='[["BL_298.8",298,[242,964,1155,850]]]'>The facts leading up to the present controversy are as follows. In October, 1981, S.R.I. issued a comprehensive insurance policy to the New Galilee Volunteer Fire Department, an unincorporated volunteer fire association serving the residents of New Galilee, Beaver County, Pennsylvania. This policy, designated as a “Business Auto Policy” and issued in the name of the New Galilee Volunteer Fire Department, covered six (6) vehicles owned and operated by the department. The policy provided for uninsured motorist coverage, as mandated by the then extant Uninsured Motorist Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The applicable declarations limited S.R.I.’s uninsured motorist liability to $30,000.00 per accident for each vehicle. The association paid annual premiums totaling $30.00 for this coverage. This policy, as stated above, was issued in the name of the association and there were no individuals specified as named insureds.</p>
    <p id="b298-8" data-blocks='[["BL_298.9",298,[241,1834,1152,204]],["BL_299.1",299,[229,322,1152,418]]]'>On April 15, 1982, appellee, an elected trustee and volunteer firefighter with the department, while responding to an alarm, was involved in a collision with an automobile driven by an uninsured motorist. Upon impact appellee <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>was thrown from the vehicle and sustained head and spinal cord injuries. As a result of these injuries appellee has been unable to resume his regular profession as an independent trucker. By the time the arbitration proceeding commenced appellee had received workmen’s compensation benefits totalling $49,660.35 from P.M.A. Insurance Company. These benefits were paid pursuant to a policy issued to the Borough of New Galilee.</p>
    <p id="b299-4" data-blocks='[["BL_299.5",299,[228,760,1153,1224]]]'>Appellee thereafter filed a claim with S.R.I. seeking uninsured motorist benefits under the policy. The parties disagreed as to the amount of coverage available. Consequently, the matter proceeded to arbitration in accordance with the Uniform Arbitration Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The arbitrators unanimously agreed that appellee’s compensatory damages were $200,-000.00. However, on the issue of whether appellee should be permitted to cumulate or “stack” the $30,000.00 uninsured motorist limit for each of the six insured vehicles under the policy, the arbitrators, in a 2-1 decision, allowed appellee to aggregate the coverages to reach the $180,-000.00 maximum limit. The arbitrators based their conclusion on the fact that although appellee was not a “named insured” under the policy, it was proper to infer, given the nature of an unincorporated association, that the parties intended each member of the fire department be deemed a “designated insured” for purposes of stacking uninsured motorist benefits. Therefore, under the stacking guidelines enunciated in <em>Utica Mutual Insurance Company v. Contrisciane, </em><a href="/pa/504/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="504 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1787755" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0328-01">504 Pa. 328</a>, <a href="/pa/504/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="504 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1787755" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0328-01">473 A.2d 1005</a> (1984), the arbitrators reasoned that appellee was a member of the “class one” category of “uninsured” and entitled to stack the coverages.</p>

This is precisely why the legislature has extended to these individuals the various immunities and limitations to which the majority alludes. See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8332.3, 8501. Purchasing insurance coverage by using the association name is merely a convenient method by which the individual members seek to protect themselves.
