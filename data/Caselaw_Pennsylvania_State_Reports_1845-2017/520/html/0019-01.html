On June 25, 1980, appellant filed a complaint in divorce in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County. His wife, Sandra, filed a counterclaim on October 31, 1980, in which she advanced, <em>inter alia, </em>a claim for interim counsel fees and costs. Her motion was granted, and on December 29,1981, the trial court ordered appellant to remit $1,655 in costs and $7,500 in interim counsel fees. Mr. Rosen filed an appeal in the Superior Court challenging the propriety of the trial court’s award.

Because of Mrs. Rosen’s disregard of the final order of divorce, the trial court held Mrs. Rosen in contempt for failing to adhere to the equitable distribution provisions of that decree. The Superior Court ruled that, since the decree in divorce was a nullity, the orders directing Mrs. Rosen to comply with that decree could have no legal efficacy and, therefore, dismissed the contempt finding. Under the terms of the equitable distribution award made by the trial court, Mrs. Rosen received approximately $500,000.</p>

Since <em>Fried </em>is a statement by this Court of our view of the intent of the General Assembly in drafting the Divorce Code of 1980 as to the finality of interim counsel fee orders, it should have been applied to all cases then pending on appeal. <em>McCloskey v.

In <em>Rosen I, </em>the Superior Court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the appeal of the interim counsel fee award because the award was a final order.

Mrs. Rosen contends that the unappealed decision in <em>Rosen I </em>is the law of the case which cannot now be relitigated regardless of our intervening decision in <em>Fried v.

Yet the Court now chastises the Superior Court for “virtually ignoring” Rule 1701(c) in finding that the trial court had been divested of jurisdiction in the present case.
