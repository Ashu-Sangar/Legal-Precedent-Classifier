In August of 1984, the appellants, while employed as guards at the institution, perpetrated several acts of physical abuse against an inmate named Robert Riggleman. Inmate Riggleman was scheduled to be released from the prison on August 14, 1984. During the last three days of Riggleman’s incarceration, guards Brachbill and Musser subjected him to a series of abuses which included unlawful shackling and handcuffing, and the forcible administration of an enema, all for their sport and amusement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> On the eve of Riggleman’s release from the prison, he disclosed to prison officials what Brachbill and Musser had done to him; he also agreed to cooperate with the authorities in their decision to take action against the two guards.

The guards explained to Riggleman that their conduct during his last few days of incarceration was being scrutinized and they told him not to talk to the police. They asked him to call them every day or so and they offered to pay for the calls. Riggleman encountered guard Musser at a yard sale one day where Musser told Riggleman that the continuing investigation of the incidents <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>was a concern to the guards. He once again told Riggleman not to discuss the incidents with the police. At that time, Musser gave Riggleman $7.00, and offered to buy Riggleman some pants and to take Riggleman’s family out to dinner. Riggleman informed the state police about this encounter and about other calls he was receiving from the guards.</p>

    <p id="b703-6" data-blocks='[["BL_703.6",703,[183,1057,1165,901]]]'>In this appeal Brachbill and Musser challenge the Superi- or Court’s affirmance of their convictions on two grounds. It is first contended that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the intimidation charge under section 4952 because of the absence of any evidence of intimidation. Secondly, it is argued that the trial court should have granted the motion to suppress the testimony of a state police officer relating to an unlawfully intercepted telephone conversation. Although we are of the view that relief must be given based upon the second allegation, we are nevertheless constrained to discuss the first contention. Since the first argument is in effect a claim that the motion in arrest of judgment made at trial should have been sustained, it would require, if valid, the preclusion of a retrial as to the charge of intimidation. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

They contend that, since the prior provision has been replaced by section 4952, which contains different language, the General Assembly could not have intended that the two acts have the same meaning. They argue that the legislature would have used the term “induce” if it intended the new provision to have the same meaning. According to appellant, the Legislature exhibited its intention to limit the application of the present provision to instances where a witness is actually threatened, and that any inducement which did not involve a form of “intimidation” was not intended to fall within the purview of the newer formulation of the offense. Appellants claim that the words “induce” and “intimidate” do not have the same meaning in their common and ordinary usage, and absent a contrary definition in the Act, they must be given their ordinary meaning. They rely upon the well recognized rule of statutory construction that penal statutes must be strict<a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>ly construed. <em>Commonwealth v.

They therefore would have us conclude that, because the Commonwealth’s evidence only established inducements and did not prove any threats or attempts of coersion, we must reach the conclusion that the record fails to support an offense under section 4952.</p>
    <p id="b706-5" data-blocks='[["BL_706.5",706,[234,623,1161,1497]]]'>While this argument at first blush may appear to possess some validity, it totally ignores paragraph (b) of section 4952. The offense as defined in paragraph (a) is expressly deemed to be a felony of the third degree under (b) if: “(2) The actor offers any pecuniary or other benefit to the witness or victim____” Thus, although section 4952(a) uses the word “intimidates” and not the former broader term “induce,” it is nevertheless clear that the legislature intended to proscribe, under the provisions of this section, any offers of benefit with the intent to “obstruct, impede, impair, prevent or interfere with the administration of criminal justice, ...,” and that such conduct would constitute a felony of the third degree. A rule of construction may never be permitted to give a restrictive meaning to a word or term used in a statutory provision where the clear language of the text of that statute indicates otherwise. An acceptance of the appellants argument in this regard would require that we ignore the clear mandate of (b)(2). Such a result would be clearly in violation of the most basic principles of statutory interpretation. 46 P.S. §§ 551 and 552(2). <em>See also, Cali v.

Riggleman, who had already discussed the prison events of August 10 through 14th with the police, advised the police that he had been contacted by one of the guards. Corporal Hoffmaster asked Riggleman if he could listen in on the conversation when the call was returned. Riggleman consented to having the call monitored by Hoffmaster. They decided to place the return call from the Philipsburg State Police Barracks. Once there, Riggleman called a number left for him by Brachbill, while Hoffmaster listened to the conversation on an extension phone. Corporal Hoffmaster made notes of what he heard.</p>

Essentially he testified that Brachbill explained to Riggleman that both he and Musser were worried that Riggleman was pressing charges against them for their conduct during his last few days in prison, and that they were worried that their jobs were in jeopardy. Hoffmaster also testified that he heard Brachbill attempt several times to get Riggleman to agree to meet with him and that Brachbill also asked Riggleman to keep in constant contact with him and Musser until the controversy over the incidents subsided. According to Hoffmaster, Brachbill asked Riggleman to “go to bat for us” with respect to the investigation.

This distinction is further illustrated in the definitional section under section 5702 where it distinguishes between the concept of an “intercept” and the statutory definition of an “intercepting device.” The argument presented by the Commonwealth would require us to amend the definition of “intercept” as it appears in section 5702 as follows:</p>

The means employed to achieve this surreptitious intrusion is not relevant to the interest being protected by section 5703. It is the interception and not the intercepting device that breaches the expectations of privacy that section 5703 is designed to reinforce. Section 5704(2)(ii) merely provides for an <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>exception to the prohibition under 5703 for law enforcement officers where certain procedures are followed prior to the interception.

Thus the difference in treatment of these devices by the legislature for the purpose of regulating public access to them does not justify a conclusion that surreptitious interceptions by means of extension phones is not proscribed under the Act. By using an extension telephone, which qualifies as an “electronic, mechanical or other device,” Corporal Hoffmaster intercepted the communication between Brachbill and Musser.

First, Hoffmaster’s testimony was offered to bolster Riggleman’s credibility. Riggleman, a former prisoner, testified to the illegal conduct of two prison guards who worked at the facility in which he was incarcerated. It is quite reasonable that the jury would not have believed the testimony of Riggleman, a polluted source, without substantiation. Quite possibly, Hoffmaster’s testimony was the only evidence of the call that was credited by the jury. Secondly, it is clear from the record that Officer Hoffmaster testified to statements made by Brachbill during the call that were not recounted by Riggleman. (N.T. 3/11/85 pp 6-11)</p>
