We hold that the reclassification of an employee’s position which results in reassignment to a position in a class with a lower maximum pay rate without a reduction in pay is not a demotion under the Civil Service Act.</p>

McHale was employed by the Appellant, the Department of Transportation (DOT), in a position classified as a Traffic Control Specialist Supervisor, which was designated as Pay Range 41. In October, 1983, DOT conducted a classification and organizational survey. By letter dated August 1, 1984, DOT advised McHale that the classification review of his position had determined that the current classification was inappropriate for his responsibili<a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>ties. DOT indicated that reassignment was not possible because no position as a Traffic Control Specialist Supervisor was available and that McHale’s position would be “reallocated downward” to the Traffic Control Specialist, designated Pay Range 38, effective August 8, 1984. McHale was advised that he would retain his current salary.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[254,621,1155,420]]]'>After receiving the notice of his reclassification, McHale filed an appeal request with the State Civil Service Commission. On the appeal request form, he indicated that he was appealing a demotion pursuant to section 951(a) of the Civil Service Act, 71 P.S. § 741.951(a), and on the basis of a discriminatory personnel action pursuant to section 951(b), 71 P.S. § 741.951(b). The Commission refused McHale’s request for a hearing on December 13, 1984.</p>

The Commonwealth Court had held that civil service employees had property rights in having their jobs accurately classified and that adverse determinations in reclassification pro<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>ceedings were agency adjudications appealable under the Administrative Agency Law. We reversed the Commonwealth Court’s holding, reasoning that because there is no per se right to government employment, no right exists to have a job designated by a particular classification in the absence of a specific legislative or contractual provision creating such a right. We determined that no such provision existed.</p>

Appellee asserts that the reclassification of a position from one class to a different class with a lower maximum salary is a demotion. The Commonwealth Court accepted the Appellee’s argument based solely upon the definition of demotion in § 3(r) of the Civil Service Act, 71 P.S. § 741.3(r).</p>

A demotion may also be made by an appointing authority with the approval of the director upon the written petition of the employe stating the reasons therefor and supported by such evidence as the director may require to show that the employe is able to perform the duties of the class of position to which he petitions that he be demoted.</blockquote>

Accordingly, the Appellee’s reassignment to a <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>position in a different class without a pay deduction was not a demotion which would trigger the right to appeal under § 951(a) of the Civil Service Act.</p>

McHale (McHale) held the supervisory position of “Traffic Control Specialist Supervisor” Pay Range 41 carrying a maximum annual salary of $29,233.00. When he returned to work at the start of business on August 9, 1984, he held the non-supervisory position of “Traffic Control Specialist” Pay Range 38 carrying a maximum annual salary of $25,624.00. This change in position was referred to by the Department of Transportation (DOT) as a “downward reallocation.” Because of it, McHale’s bargaining unit designation was changed from B-5, Engineering and Scientific, Supervisory to B-4 Engineering and Scientific, Non-Supervisory. McHale’s downward position <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>change was ostensibly prompted by a department survey report indicating that, due to a prior reorganization in the district where he was employed, McHale no longer exercised supervisory responsibilities. Thus, it appears that first, without cause relating to job performance, DOT relieved McHale of his supervisory duties and responsibilities. Next, DOT conducted a survey which led to a report that confirmed that McHale no longer had supervisory responsibilities. Then, based on that report, McHale was demoted to a lower position which DOT euphemistically calls a downward reallocation.</p>
