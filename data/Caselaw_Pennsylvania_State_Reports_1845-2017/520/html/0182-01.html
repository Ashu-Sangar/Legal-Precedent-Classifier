Since he believed his convictions were for crimes which also violated the terms of the conditions of his parole, Appellee asked that the Board apply <em>Rivenbark </em>and recompute the backtime he should serve as a parole violator. On January 28, 1986, the Board denied Appellee's request arguing, as it does before us, that the act for which he was recommitted as a technical parole violator (possessing a weapon) did not constitute a criminal <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>offense for which he was convicted.

Recommitment as a convicted violator exposes the parolee to serve the remainder of his unexpired time without credit for any time spent on parole and requires serving out the unexpired term <em>before </em>serving time on the new sentences, subject, of course, to reparole by the Board. On the other hand, where the parole condition is violated and does not result in a conviction, our legislature has chosen to treat such a technical parole violation under 61 P.S. § 331.21a(b) which gives the parolee credit for time spent on parole while free of violations and reposes in the Board authority, in its discretion, to recommit for a period less than the unserved portion of the original sentence.</p>

These two technical violations stemmed from convictions for crimes of assault which were co-extensive with the Board imposed condition to refrain from assaultive behavior.</p>

    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[250,422,1155,582]]]'>Applying that simple question to this case leads us to the following.

Appellee was not convicted of an illegal weapons possession crime, he was convicted of four robberies. Thus, he was not convicted of a criminal offense that was co-extensive with the conditions of his parole.

Thus, if a parolee is convicted of a crime, the acts which constitute the elements of that crime cannot form the basis of a technical parole violation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> However, separate acts which constitute separate crimes (or violations of parole convictions) for which the parolee was not adjudged can form the basis of technical parole violations.</p>

      <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>For example, in this case Mr. Threats was convicted of four robberies. He was not, however, convicted of a weapons offense. Regardless of the fact that a knife may have been the means by which Mr. Threats accomplished the force necessary to accomplish the robberies, the possession of the knife was a distinct offense, and a conclusion that this was a technical violation was not precluded by the convictions on the robberies.</p>
    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[205,757,1153,369]]]'>I note with interest that the Commonwealth Court has recently adopted the approach which I am here embracing, <em>Morrow v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, </em>114 Pa.Cmwlth. 48, <a href="/pa-commw/114/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="114 Pa.

Therefore, I believe that the Commonwealth Court and the Parole Board should continue to adhere to that approach.</p>
