Because he wished to join together three of his lots into one, thereby dividing his undeveloped land into two lots, the Appellee was required to submit an application for subdivision plan approval to Butler Township, which in accordance with the Municipalities Planning Code and the Township ordinances, referred the matter to the Butler Township Planning Commission.</p>

The matter was then referred to the Township Commissioners for final approval. At the Commissioner’s meeting, the Appellee, through his attorney, was advised that the submitted plan could not be approved until the Appellee agreed to build certain roadways to Township specifications. Because more information was requested, the matter was tabled to permit the Appellee additional time to comply with the Commissioners’ request. After all of the requested information had been furnished, the plan was brought to a final vote and rejected. The written notice of the Commissioner’s decision was as follows:</p>

Appellant objected to the late submission of the “deemed approval” issue. Notwithstanding, the trial court permitted testimony on that issue.</p>

    <p id="b682-10" data-blocks='[["BL_682.10",682,[222,2087,1154,303]]]'>The legislature has embodied the proper procedure for obtaining subdivision approval in the Municipalities Planning Code.

    <p id="b683-6" data-blocks='[["BL_683.6",683,[219,806,1152,96]]]'>(emphasis added). It is the interpretation of these two sections which has caused problems for the lower courts.</p>
    <p id="b683-7" data-blocks='[["BL_683.7",683,[216,922,1157,583]]]'>In <em>Appeal of Johnston, </em>supra, the Commonwealth Court carved out an exception to what appears to be an unambiguous provision. The Borough Council had failed in its letter rejecting the proposed subdivision plan to specify by ordinance section the areas in which the plan failed to comply with the ordinance. Commonwealth Court agreed that the Borough’s non-compliance with § 10508(2) did not operate as an estoppel because the <em>intended </em>purpose of that section had not been defeated since the applicant was the Borough Mayor who presumably was aware of the reasons for the plan’s rejection.</p>
    <p id="b683-8" data-blocks='[["BL_683.8",683,[216,1530,1153,311]]]'>Because § 10508(2) is specific and unambiguous, we cannot agree with Commonwealth Court’s interpretation as set forth in <em>Appeal of Johnston, </em>supra.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Statutory Construction Act, the Act of December 6, 1972, No. 290, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1501 et seq., sets forth the appropriate consideration in interpreting a statute:</p>

Only if a statute is unclear may a court embark upon the task of ascertaining the intent of the legislature by reviewing the necessity-of the act, the object <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>to be attained, circumstances under which it was enacted and the mischief to be remedied. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c).</p>
    <p id="b684-4" data-blocks='[["BL_684.5",684,[240,445,1154,370]]]'>Section 10508(2) is quite clear, “... the decision <em>shall </em>specify the defects ... and <em>shall </em>... cite the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon.” (emphasis added). Generally, words are construed to mean their common usage. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903. By definition, “shall” is mandatory. Accordingly, there is no latitude for overlooking the plain meaning of § 10508(2) to reach a more desired result.</p>
    <p id="b684-5" data-blocks='[["BL_684.6",684,[236,882,1157,699]]]'>While we are cognizant of the harshness of the result in instances such as now before us, we cannot overlook the plain meaning of the statute to avoid a harsh result. To read an exception into § 10508(2), as the court did in <em>Appeal of Johnston, </em>supra, would eventually emasculate the rule itself. Ordinarily, an applicant is aware of the ordinance sections involved prior to submission of his plan. Therefore, in most cases, the applicant would have actual knowledge of the specific ordinances in question thereby negating the necessity for the rule. However, being aware of this fact, the legislature still adopted §§ 10508(2) and 10508(3). Therefore, we will not amend the Municipalities Planning Code by grafting in such an exception.</p>

The Appellant also argues that the "deemed approval" issue was waived because it was not raised in the Appellee’s notice of appeal filed in the Court of Common Pleas. Since the record reflects that the trial court was advised of the waiver argument and decided to hear evidence on this issue, the trial court apparently believed notice prior to trial was sufficient notice to preserve the issue. We find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court thereby finding no merit in this argument.</p>

While this may be true, proper procedures may have been followed to prevent this occurrence. <em>See, </em>53 P.S. § 11007.
