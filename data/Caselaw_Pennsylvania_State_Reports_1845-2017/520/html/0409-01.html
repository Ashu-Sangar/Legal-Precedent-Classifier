It was in one of those years that he met Traitz. They became friends in 1981 when Braig, who is interested in boxing, became a member of the Board of Directors of the Montgomery County Boys’ Club, a Club which was organized and run by the Roofers’ Union and by Traitz and his wife. Braig was an active, and not a letter-head, Board member. He involved his wife and children in the Club’s activities.</p>

    <p id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[214,618,1154,249]]]'>8. In 1984, some of the graduates of the Montgomery County Boys’ Club went to the Bahamas for a three-day boxing match sponsored by the Roofers’ Union. Braig was invited to go free. He declined the offer, paid his own way, and exhibited his cancelled check to the Board.</p>
    <p id="b581-6" data-blocks='[["BL_581.7",581,[214,899,1152,150]]]'>9. The year 1985 marked a retention election for Braig. He asked Traitz to be the labor coordinator, on behalf of the Roofers’ Union and other labor unions, for his campaign.</p>

On March 17, 1985, St. Patrick’s Day, Braig his wife and his two daughters had dinner with the Traitz family at its Trooper, Pennsylvania farm. After dinner, Kris, Braig’s fifteen-year-old daughter, wanted to ride one of the terrain vehicles, a three-wheeled bike apparatus, owned by the Traitz family. Donna, a daughter of Steve and Barbara Traitz, put Kris on the terrain vehicle. It went out of control and fell twenty feet over an embankment fracturing her arm. Traitz took full responsibility for the accident and felt devastated by it.</p>
    <p id="b581-8" data-blocks='[["BL_581.9",581,[211,1623,1155,636]]]'>11. Since 1981 Braig maintained a policy of recusing himself from cases involving roofers. His law clerks routinely screened out cases identifiable as roofers’ cases without consulting Braig. On October 7, 1985, after offering to recuse himself from a roofer’s case, <em>Currie v. Miller, </em>which had inadvertently, reached him for a jury trial, Braig presided over a settlement which, by agreement of all parties, was fair. The plaintiff, a member of the Roofers’ Union, sought the policy limit of $100,000. The defendant’s insurer offered $32,000. The case settled for $40,000. Defense counsel testified that he rejected the recusal offer without any pressure whatsoever from Braig.</p>

He also refused campaign donations <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>from individual lawyers, and never used his official letterhead stationery for private correspondence.</p>

After Traitz appeared upset by two telephone calls he received, one relating to a friend who was ill with cancer and the other relating to one of his daughters who was seriously ill in the hospital, Braig told him good news about a roofer who had appeared before him the day before and who had obtained a $40,000 settlement.</p>

From time to time, Mr. Traitz gave Dr. Braig, Braig’s wife, who is a teacher, hats and clothing for underprivileged children in her classes. He donated woolen caps for winter as well as summer caps.

    <p id="b582-9" data-blocks='[["BL_582.9",582,[229,1596,1154,313]]]'>17. From time to time, Braig’s daughter, Jennifer, would ride in horse shows with the Traitz’ daughters-in-law. She liked the Traitz’ farm and barn where they kept the horses and often she would have dinner with them after riding in shows. Pictures were taken of Jennifer’s riding. Some of them Traitz had enlarged and hung in his office.</p>

    <p id="b596-7" data-blocks='[["BL_596.8",596,[224,1256,1156,649]]]'>I would remand this matter to the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board to investigate further and determine the source of the funds used by Mr. Traitz to shower gifts upon Judge Braig over the years. Were these funds Union funds or personal funds of Mr. Traitz? Did Judge Braig, over the years of family friendship with Traitz, know the source of these funds or, under all the circumstances surrounding the corrupting influence of Mr. Traitz upon many colleagues of Judge Braig, should Judge Braig have known that he was being drawn into a situation by his “friend” which could only raise the spectre of gross impropriety? As the saying goes, with friends like that, who needs enemies?</p>
    <p id="b596-8" data-blocks='[["BL_596.9",596,[221,1939,1155,428]]]'>The public and Judge Braig are equally entitled to a full and complete airing of all the facts surrounding the giving and receipt of cash and gifts from an importuning source. The dismissal of charges against Judge Braig on the grounds of insufficient evidence leaves much to be desired. Perhaps we must stay content with the realization that Judge Braig will remain off the bench under order of this Court while the federal charges are pending.</p>
