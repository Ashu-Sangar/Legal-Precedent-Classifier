Appellee operated a business in Greenville in which he dealt in buying and selling gold and silver, among other things. On occasion Mr. Louis G. Milliron of Greenville, Mercer County, an employee of National Gas Company, made service calls to the business. During the service calls he saw a sign in appellee’s window stating that appellee was buying silver and gold. He engaged in conversations with appellee approximately four times prior to December 18, 1980, during which he told appellee of his coin collection. Mr. Milliron also told appellee that he had some silver he might sell. During the night of December 18,1980, Mr. Milliron’s home was burglarized. His coin collection and other items were stolen. The following day Mr. Milliron went to appellee’s place of business to tell him that he was offering a reward <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>for information on his missing collection. There he observed Frank Shannon and Clyde Devore talking with appellee in the process of selling him a coin or coins. At the time Mr. Milliron was not close enough to the exchange to observe the coins in the transaction. However, he did observe on Shannon’s wrist his watch which had been stolen in the burglary the night before. Mr. Milliron went across the street to the Greenville Police Department to inform them of his observations and then returned to the store. He announced that Shannon was wearing his watch. Shannon and Devore hastily took a check from appellee and left the store to be followed by Milliron who was soon joined by two policemen. The policemen took the two into custody after a brief pursuit. Shannon and Devore subsequently pled guilty to the Milliron burglary among others. Most of the items stolen from Milliron were recovered from Shannon and Devore. However, an 1881 Liberty ten-dollar gold piece was not recovered.</p>
    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[245,1329,1153,581]]]'>Shannon testified that on December 12, 1980, while in appellee’s store with Devore, appellee gave him Milliron’s name and told him the general area where he lived. He proposed that Shannon and Devore burglarized Milliron’s home for the specific purpose of stealing the coin collection, and that he would share in its value with them. Shannon stated that he and Devore had consummated several prior deals with appellee. As an example he testified that appellee had directed them to his store in Warren, Ohio, for the purpose of fencing stolen guns, and that following appellee’s directions they went there and sold them for $500.</p>
    <p id="b496-6" data-blocks='[["BL_496.5",496,[242,1930,1152,472]],["BL_497.1",497,[245,347,1149,206]]]'>On the night in question it was the burglars’ intent to steal the coin collection which appellee had told them was in Milliron’s home. Shannon testified that appellee in his post-burglary dealings with them did not want to be informed of the relationship between the items they sold him and specific burglaries. He did, however, want Shannon to let him know which articles were “hot” in order that he could melt them down quickly. Although appellee had instructed them to wait until things “cooled down” after the <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>Milliron burglary, Shannon testified that when they were observed by Milliron the next day they were in the process of selling a ten-dollar gold piece to appellee which was stolen at Milliron’s the night before.</p>
    <p id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[244,571,1153,362]]]'>The Commonwealth’s exhibits consisted of a check in the amount of $100 made out to “cash” signed by appellee and dated December 19, 1980, as well as a business card of appellee containing directions to, and the address of, appellee’s store in Warren, Ohio, with the figure $500 written thereon. These items were recovered from the burglars at the time of their arrest.</p>
    <p id="b497-6" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[244,958,1153,1448]],["BL_498.1",498,[244,336,1149,91]]]'>Appellee testified in his own defense that he had directed Shannon and Devore to his Ohio store, that they might dispose of guns, without knowing that they had been stolen in burglaries. He explained that he merely referred them to a third party who bought guns and watches and who frequented the Warren store. He testified that the coin he purchased from the burglars the day after the Milliron robbery was a <em>21/2 </em>dollar gold piece, not the 10 dollar gold piece that Shannon testified he sold him. He testified that he was not aware that Shannon and Devore were burglars or that the items they sold him on the occasions of their visits were “hot”. He denied that he told the burglars of Milliron’s coin collection, and specifically denied the existence of an agreement with them to dispose of the items or share in the proceeds. He went on to testify that after Shannon and Devore were arrested Milliron returned to his store and he showed him a <em>2lh </em>dollar gold piece. He asserted that he had no 10 dollar gold pieces in the store at that time. This last was on cross-examination. He was not given the opportunity to state either then or on redirect examination that Milliron at that time was accompanied by an officer or officers of the Greenville Police who were then present to hear Milliron state that the piece which appellee showed him was not from his collection. Consequently, no such averment was part of the trial record or considered by the jury. In addition, Lori Morford, who appellee identified as his bookkeeper/secretary, neither appeared nor testified <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>at trial, although appellee placed her in the store at the time of the events of December 19.</p>
    <p id="b498-5" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[241,468,1152,154]]]'>In a memorandum in support of appellee’s request for a new trial, submitted after the evidentiary hearing on remand, appellee specifically asserted:</p>
    <blockquote id="b498-6" data-blocks='[["BL_498.6",498,[276,641,1116,1022]]]'>Lori Morford’s testimony was critical to the defense of Jerre Hentosh’s case. Morford would have testified that she was present when Shannon and Devore entered the store on or about December 12, 1980, and they brought in some merchandise to sell and the store was very small and narrow and she could hear all of the conversation that took place and there was never any discussion either on that day or any other working day, in that store, between Hentosh and either burglar as it related to the burglary of the Milliron residence. Further, Ms. Morford would have testified that she, rather than Hentosh, was the one who wrote out the checks that were paid to Shannon and Devore. She also was in the store on December 19,1980 when Milliron came into the store with the police and stated that the gold coin in question did not come from his house. Her testimony would have seriously impeached the testimony of the two admitted burglars, who were testifying as Commonwealth witnesses against Jerre Hentosh.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b498-7" data-blocks='[["BL_498.7",498,[272,1691,1112,699]]]'>In addition, prior to trial, Hentosh requested his attorney to subpoena Officers Sherbondy and Pinkie from the Greenville Police Department. Sherbondy would have testified that he and Pinkie accompanied Milliron into Hentosh’s store, the victim saw the gold coin in question, which the two burglars claimed that they took from his residence, and said that the coin did not belong to him. That testimony would have destroyed the credibility of Frank Shannon, who testified that on December 19, 1980, the same day that Milliron and the police came into Hentosh’s store, he had just sold Hentosh a $10 dollar gold piece from the Milliron burglary, the only evidence linking the defendant to the crimes charged.</blockquote>

Therefore, we are unable to determine whether his testimony would have been favorable and, consequently, we cannot determine whether counsel’s restraint lacked a reasonable basis. In short appellee has failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating that counsel’s failure to call Officer Sherbondy constituted ineffectiveness. <em>McNeil, supra. See also Commonwealth v.

The record indicates, however, that except for the erroneous reference in the exchange set forth above, she was not asked any question relating to her knowledge of the events of any date other than the day following the burglary, i.e. December 19, 1980. Thus, there is absolutely no indication on the record as to what her testimony would have been as it related to the plan to burglarize Milliron or the latter’s putative denial that the coin sold was his. Again, without proof of what that evidence would have been we are unable to draw any conclusion as to whether it would have been helpful to his defense, or that the course of action not pursued by counsel offered a chance of success greater than that actually followed. <em>Stoyko, supra.</em>

As the majority notes, and I concur, if the missing witnesses had testified at the evidentiary hearing as alleged, sufficient evidence would have been presented to establish a lack of any reasonable excuse why their testimony was not presented at the original trial. The lack of this favorable testimony would undoubtedly have prejudiced the appellee’s case. Thus, if the missing witnesses had testified at the evidentiary hearing the appellee would have met his burden of proof with regard to a claim of ineffectiveness of trial counsel. However, Officer Sherbondy failed to appear at the evidentiary hearing and Lori Morford did not substantiate the favorable testimony alluded to by the appellee in his memorandum in support of a new trial.
