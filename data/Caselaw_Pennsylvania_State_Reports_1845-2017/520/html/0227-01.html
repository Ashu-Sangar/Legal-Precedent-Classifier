Ski Roundtop paid its capital stock taxes for these years, but thereafter filed timely petitions for partial refunds, claiming that the assets used for making snow were engaged in a manufacturing activity and were, therefore, exempt from the capital stock tax. The Board of Finance and Revenue refused the taxpayer’s petition for refund on the ground that making snow is not manufacturing. Ski Roundtop then filed timely petitions for review with Commonwealth Court. On June 15,1987, a three-judge panel of Commonwealth Court denied the taxpayer’s request for a refund, again on the ground that snow-making activity is not manufacturing, 106 Pa.Cmwlth. 608, <a href="/pa-commw/106/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="527 A.2d 600" data-case-ids="1360378" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/106/0608-01">527 A.2d 600</a>.

As the air decompresses, it cools, freezing the water with which it is mixed into water crystals. These crystals attract moisture from the air as they are sprayed from the guns, building larger crystals which form man-made snow. The water for this operation is pumped from collecting pools at the base of the slopes through underground lines to snow gun nozzles placed at seventy-five foot intervals along each ski trail. Pressurized air is also pumped to each snow gun nozzle through underground lines from large compressors located at the base of the mountain. Using these snow guns, <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>trained workers walk the trails and make adjustments to the snow guns so as to direct the correct amount and placement of snow on the trails. Different types of snow, e.g., heavy, dense snow or light fluffy snow, may be produced in the snow guns, depending on what is required by the steepness and condition of the various slopes. Ski Roundtop management decides the amount, placement, and timing of artificial snow to be produced by the machines. Approximately one million gallons of water are used in a full day’s operation, in addition to large amounts of electricity to run the compressors and pumps.</p>

With respect to manufacturing criteria, Commonwealth Court found that Ski Roundtop applied the requisite skill and labor to the snow-making activity, but that the snow produced by this activity was not a new product substantially different from the original material, which Commonwealth Court identified as water: “the essential fact is that Roundtop’s man-made snow is still only frozen water.”</p>

It is our view, therefore, that pressurized air, as <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>well as water, is a material which is physically, though not chemically, combined with water to produce snow.

    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.6",399,[240,986,1154,466]]]'>As to the first question, we believe that taxpayer’s snow is substantially different from the materials from which it is made, air and water.

The present case is distinguishable from <em>American Ice </em>with respect to the labor and skill required, since we have determined that the taxpayer’s snow-making activity involves the requisite skill and labor, but it is not distinguishable with respect to the permanency of the product.

To fill the void, this Court in 1961 attempted to supply a workable definition for this purpose. <em>Philadelphia School District v. Parent Metal Products, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/402/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="402 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="1296690" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0361-01">402 Pa. 361</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20257" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="167 A.2d 257">167 A.2d 257</a> (1961). Since the legislature has not seen fit to further clarify its intended meaning of the term since our definition offered in <em>Parent Metal Products, Inc., </em>it may properly be assumed that the definition given therein comports with legislative intention. <em>See e.g., In re Obradovich’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/386/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="386 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1268295" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0342-01">386 Pa. 342</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20435" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="126 A.2d 435">126 A.2d 435</a>, 437 (1956) (“[I]t is the function of a court to construe legislation as it exists and for the legislature to enact whatever changes therein it may deem desirable____”). The essence of that definition is “the application of labor or skill to material whereby the original article is changed into a <em>new, different and useful </em>article.” <em>Parent Metal Products, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/402/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="402 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="1296690" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0361-01">402 Pa. at 364</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20257" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="167 A.2d 257">167 A.2d at 258</a> (Emphasis added). It was further stated that “[wjhether or not an article is a manufactured product depends upon whether or not it has gone through a substantial transformation in form, qualities and adaptability in use from the original material,____” <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20257" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="167 A.2d 257">Id.,</a> <a href="/pa/402/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="402 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="1296690" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0361-01">402 Pa. at 364</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20257" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="167 A.2d 257">167 A.2d at 258-259</a>.</p>

The more difficult question is whether it is a “new” substance within the criteria established. Clearly the housewife who fills the ice trays and places them in the refrigerator to have ice available in the morning is not engaged in manufacturing ice. While the resulting ice is the water in a “different” form, it has not undergone a substantial transformation as would justify concluding that a “new” product had been created. It is true, as Mr. Justice McDermott argues, that snow is but an altered form of water. The distinction is as Mr. Justice Flaherty suggests, that the sophistication involved in the process of altering the form provides the key. I also agree that the element of permanency supplied by our Court in <em>Commonwealth v. American Ice Co., </em><a href="/pa/406/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="406 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1304865" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0322-01">406 Pa. 322</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.2d%20768" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="178 A.2d 768">178 A.2d 768</a> (1962), was an unfortunate gratuity not warranted by the statutory language.</p>
    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[237,1239,1159,1148]]]'>Finally, I am constrained to note that the opinion of Mr. Justice Flaherty speaking for the Court does not reflect an adoption of the “flexible approach” urged by Mr. Justice Larsen since his dissenting opinion in <em>Golden Triangle Broadcasting, Inc., v. City of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/483/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="483 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="1751245" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0525-01">483 Pa. 525</a>, 535, <a href="/pa/483/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="483 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="1751245" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0525-01">397 A.2d 1147</a>, 1152 (1979) (Larsen dissenting, joined by Mr. Justice Manderino). This view in essence urges that we adopt as a rule of thumb the principle that “any doubts concerning the status of appellants’ activity must be resolved in favor of appellants.” As previously discussed herein, it is our responsibility to strictly carry out statutory mandate. Having determined the meaning of the term “manufacturing” which has been accepted by the legislature, as evidenced by their inaction since 1961 to offer any attempt to change or modify it, we are bound to apply it in each case without modification. The suggestion that the well established meaning of manufacturing should be adjusted on a case-to-case basis to satisfy a perceived legislative intent to foster manufacturing is, in my opinion, jurisprudentially unsound. If the established definition does not conform to legislative intent, it is the responsibility of the legislature to make that adjustment.</p>
