To fully understand the posture of this issue, it is necessary to briefly review the procedural history of this matter.</p>

Thomas then filed a petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, which was denied without a hearing. On appeal to Superior Court from the dismissal of his petition without a hearing, <a href="/pa-super/345/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="345 Pa.

Super. 211" data-case-ids="639129" data-case-paths="/pa-super/345/0211-01">497 A.2d 1379</a>, Thomas argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial because, inter alia, counsel failed to <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>request the court to charge the jury on all grades of robbery, counsel failed to object when evidence of other criminal activity was injected into the trial by a Commonwealth witness, and because Thomas was denied his right of allocution. Superior Court held that Thomas was not entitled to have the jury charged on the various grades of robbery, and, thus, he was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this question. That court further held that Thomas’s claim of ineffectiveness for failing to object to the reference to prior criminal convictions had at least arguable merit, and, thus, remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the question of the basis for counsel’s inaction. Both of these rulings were proper.</p>
    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[256,1027,1153,788]]]'>At Thomas’s request, Superior Court also remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the denial of the opportunity for allocution at sentencing. The Commonwealth, appellant herein, contends this was error because Thomas’s PCHA petition does not state what Thomas would have said and how deprivation of allocution has prejudiced him. While we agree that no evidentiary hearing is required on this question, we reject the Commonwealth’s argument that one who stands convicted of a crime and who is denied an opportunity to address the sentencing court must somehow demonstrate prejudice thereby. What effect the exercise of the right of allocution might have on the subjective process of sentencing can never be known with such certainty that a reviewing court can conclude there was no prejudice in its absence.</p>

Often referred to as the “ancient inquiry,”- the practice originated in the English common law where, as early as 1689, any failure to permit a defendant to plead for mercy required reversal.
