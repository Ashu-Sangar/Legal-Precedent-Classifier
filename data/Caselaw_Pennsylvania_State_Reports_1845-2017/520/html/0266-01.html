Shortly thereafter, McCardle’s union told the LCB that he was suffering from mental illness. In response to that assertion, the employer asked that it be supplied with substantiating information by August 17, 1984. When no such information was provided, the LCB, by a decision dated August 23, 1984, terminated McCardle’s <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>employment.

    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[248,537,1153,675]]]'>As a General Manager IB, McCardle was represented by the Independent State Stores Union (“Union”). On August 28, 1984, the Union advised the LCB of its intention to grieve his dismissal. The Union alleged that McCardle’s misconduct was caused by “severe psychological problems which resulted in bizarre and unexplainable behavior.” Together with that contention, the Union asked that McCardle be placed on sick leave until he was able to resume his duties. After the grievance was denied at the prescribed preliminary stages of consideration, the Union took the matter to arbitration, pursuant to a labor agreement in force between the Union and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.6",436,[241,1230,1157,836]]]'>The labor agreement, styled “Memorandum of Understanding,” is relatively laconic in its treatment of the employer’s disciplinary powers. The central provision on that subject states: “The Commonwealth shall not demote for disciplinary reasons, suspend, discharge or take any other disciplinary action against any manager <em>without just cause.” </em>(Emphasis added.) Although the Memorandum itself does not give a definition of “just cause,” such is provided in the Work Rules and Regulations published by the LCB. In those Rules the agency set forth a list of offenses which could result in “disciplinary action” against an employee. The Rules also specify a class of offenses which may provide “just cause” for immediate dismissal. Included in the latter group of designated infractions are: “Theft of Commonwealth funds or property” and “Serious violation of counter procedures.”</p>

    <p id="b437-4" data-blocks='[["BL_437.5",437,[233,592,1153,367]]]'>At the hearing before the arbitrator, the grievant did not contest the charges that were the basis for his dismissal. Indeed, Mr. McCardle admitted his guilt. The Union, however, renewing its contention that McCardle’s breach of trust was the product of mental illness, argued that he was not responsible for his actions and thus should have received a penalty less severe than discharge.</p>
    <p id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.6",437,[233,977,1153,580]]]'>As to McCardle’s mental condition, the Union established that he had undergone psychiatric treatment at the Veterans Hospital for approximately seven months following his termination by the LCB. His period of treatment included both in-patient and out-patient care. The Union also put into evidence the opinions of a psychologist and a psychiatrist from the hospital, both of whom stated that the grievant was suffering from a stress-related mental disorder. The employer offered no evidence to contradict those opinions, but did seek to challenge their weight regarding the question of what caused the grievant’s dishonest acts.</p>
    <p id="b437-6" data-blocks='[["BL_437.7",437,[232,1576,1153,799]],["BL_438.1",438,[261,315,1150,153]]]'>In keeping with the evidence supporting the charges, the arbitrator found that the grievant had committed the various acts of manipulation and misappropriation alleged. However, based on the Union’s medical evidence, the arbitrator determined that the grievant’s misdeeds were the result of mental illness and thus not his fault. The arbitrator also interpreted the medical evidence as indicating that the grievant was recovering from his disorder and could return to responsible employment with the LCB. Predicated on those conclusions about Mr. McCardle’s mental condition, the arbitrator decided that the LCB did not have just cause for the discharge. The arbitrator further determined that the LCB should give the grievant an opportunity to demonstrate whether or not he had recovered from his mental problems so as to be “capable of responsible behav<a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>ior.” Such opportunity, the arbitrator added, was to be provided in a way that would “limit any further damage to the employer or the employee.”</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[258,491,1153,575]]]'>Having made those determinations, the arbitrator entered an award sustaining McCardle’s grievance, subject to the following terms: (1) the LCB would immediately reinstate the grievant to the status of employee, and the period following his termination would be treated as a suspension; (2) the grievant would resume employment as a Clerk II, and remain in that classification for at least six months to demonstrate whether or not he could cope with stress; and (3) if the grievant successfully completed the trial period, the time he had spent undergoing treatment at the hospital would be converted to sick leave.</p>

With regard to the arbitrator’s finding that the dismissal of the grievant did not rest upon just cause, the court agreed, stating: “[w]e do not see how the discharge of a mentally ill individual can be said to be for ‘just cause.’ ” 100 Pa.Cmwlth. at 276, <a href="/citations/?q=514%20A.2d%20961" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="514 A.2d 961">514 A.2d 961</a>.

I do not believe that the mere happening of misconduct, in itself, closes the inquiry and mandates “discharge for good cause.” I believe an employee has the right to explain away the dereliction. Surely, an employee who suffers amnesia and wanders away from family, friends and acquaintances for several months and thereby fails to report to work for an extended period of time should be able to prove this circumstance and thus avoid “discharge for good cause.” In this case, McCardle was given the opportunity to explain away the dereliction and failed to do so. Under these circumstances, I can agree that the Liquor Control Board had “just cause” for the firing of McCardle and the inquiry should have ended there.</p>

The arbitrator considered the evidence of Mr. McCardle’s mental illness and found that his discharge was not based upon <em>“just </em>cause” because his conduct was mitigated by said mental illness. The majority holds that such an interpretation of “just cause” by the arbitrator was outside of the “essence” of the bargaining agreement because “the concepts of culpability and mitigation applicable in criminal law are not applicable to this area.” At 276. I agree with Mr. Justice Papadakos (in his concurring opinion in this case) and the Commonwealth Court that, contrary to the majority’s assertion, such concepts of mitigation and culpability are most certainly applicable to a grievance proceeding intended to determine whether there was “just cause” for discharge within the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and that an arbitrator acts within his or her authority in applying such concepts.</p>
