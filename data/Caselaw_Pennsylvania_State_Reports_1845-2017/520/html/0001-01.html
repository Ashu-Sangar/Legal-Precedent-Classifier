At approximately 8:30 p.m. on May 13, 1983, Appellant and Paulino Santiago, the victim, were arguing with one another at the corner of 17th and Wallace Streets in Philadelphia. The argument was over money and a woman named “Betsy.” Betsy was Appellant’s former lover who had recently moved out of Appellant's house and had taken up residence in the victim’s house (her new lover). The victim’s brother, Francisco Santiago, was present at this argument and overheard the exchange between the men.</p>
    <p id="b171-6" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[217,1573,1153,583]]]'>At the conclusion of this argument, Appellant entered a nearby house and a few minutes later came looking for the victim. Appellant was now carrying a .22 caliber rifle and he found the victim and brother Francisco in an abandoned house on Wallace Street, where the two had entered to use the bathroom. As Appellant entered the abandoned house, he found both brothers and, pointing the loaded rifle at his victim, said, “Give me the money” and immediately fired one shot into Paulino Santiago’s chest from a distance of about six feet. Appellant then quickly exited through the house’s back door and ran down an alley.</p>

The autopsy performed the next day <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>identified the gun shot wound as the cause of death. A warrant for the arrest of Appellant was issued on May 14, 1983, the day following the shooting, but he was not apprehended until November, 1983, when he was finally located in New York City. Upon being apprehended, Appellant waived extradition and was returned to Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[228,691,1153,636]]]'>Taking all of these circumstances together, a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Paulino Santiago’s death was a homicide. From the nature of the injury, a jury could infer that the homicide was intentional and malicious. Since the armed Appellant came looking for his victim, the jury could conclude that the killing was premeditated. Finally, the jury could accept the eyewitness testimony of the victim’s brother and conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant committed the crime. Accordingly, we are satisfied that sufficient evidence exists in this record to support the jury’s verdict of murder of the first degree, and dismiss Appellant’s sufficiency challenge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Accordingly, our discussion of what kind of evidence may be used to establish the aggravating circumstance was totally unnecessary to our consideration and disposition of the issue as presented to us and is viewed only as non-binding <em>dictum.</em>

    <p id="b183-7" data-blocks='[["BL_183.9",183,[218,1090,1153,208]]]'>I am unable to assent to the determination that burglaries are inherently crimes falling within aggravating circumstance (d)(9), as “involving the use or threat of violence to the person.”</p>
    <p id="b183-8" data-blocks='[["BL_183.10",183,[218,1324,1153,853]]]'>First, the majority confuses the concepts of “risk” and “threat”. The former involves simply a chance or possibility of injury whereas the latter describes more precisely an expression or indication of intention to inflict injury. Even if it is assumed that at common law burglary was considered a serious crime because of the <em>risk </em>of violénce to persons, it does not follow that burglary necessarily involves a <em>threat </em>of violence. Breaking and entering the close of the residence could be accomplished without excessive force, and the felony to be committed therein need not, in contemplation or realization, involve an encounter with the residents (theft for example). Thus the common law burglary could well have been committed without any expression of intention to do injury, although there might be the possibility of such should the resident come upon the burglar.</p>
    <p id="b183-9" data-blocks='[["BL_183.11",183,[218,2203,1152,205]],["BL_184.1",184,[240,345,1154,426]]]'>Second, the expanded definition of burglary contained in the Crimes Code counsels against considering burglary as being, <em>by nature, </em>a crime of violence. It is true that the types of structures subject to being burgled has been <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>broadened to include any that <em>might </em>be occupied, but it is not necessary that the structure in fact be occupied. The crime is complete even if the structure is unoccupied and is known to be unoccupied; only complete abandonment is a defense. Put simply, since entering an unoccupied, secured area to commit any crime is now a burglary, the legislature has de-emphasized the importance of the risk of harm to persons.</p>
    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.4",184,[236,804,1156,482]]]'>Nor is the majority’s notation that the Uniform Firearms Act includes burglary as a “crime of violence” persuasive. More telling, I think, is the fact that the legislature included burglary not in Article B of Title 18, under the heading “Offenses Involving Danger to the Person,” but in Article C, “Offenses Against Property.” Though a <em>particular </em>burglary might ultimately involve danger to the person, I believe the legislature has recognized that burglary by nature is essentially a property crime.</p>
    <p id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[231,1318,1157,1073]]]'>Finally, I am troubled by what I perceive to be a tendency exhibited here and in other cases to expansively construe the language of the aggravating circumstances. It should not be forgotten that the whole purpose of specifically enumerating aggravating circumstances was to <em>narrow </em>the type of first degree murder cases in which death would be an appropriate penalty. Especially as to circumstance (d)(9), where the issue is not the nature of the crime being punished but the defendant’s criminal history, it is contrary to this limiting purpose to broaden the range of what may be included. Under (d)(9), I believe it was the legislative intention to make the death penalty a possibility only where the first degree murderer had previously engaged in crimes where he had used, or had exhibited an intention to use, violence against a person. To now hold that it is also appropriate where the defendant’s prior crimes posed only a risk of violence opens the door too wide, and invites a challenge to the statute as giving too little structure to rationally distinguish capital from non-capital first degree murders.</p>
