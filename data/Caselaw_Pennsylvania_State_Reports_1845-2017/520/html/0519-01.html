As the sole intestate heirs of the decedent, appellants assert entitlement to the estate’s assets. Relief was denied by the Court of Common Pleas. The Superior Court affirmed. <em>Bloom v.

    <p id="b688-5" data-blocks='[["BL_688.5",688,[226,816,1155,566]]]'>The will in question follows a common testamentary scheme by designating the husband to receive all of the wife’s property, and appointing an alternate beneficiary in recognition of the possibility that the husband might predecease the wife. The issue raised in this appeal is whether the courts below erred in determining that, for purposes of the alternate beneficiary provision, divorce from testatrix’s spouse could be equated with the death of testatrix’s spouse. Integral to the resolution of this issue is the question of whether it is of significance that the alternate beneficiary is a relative of testatrix’s ex-spouse.</p>
    <p id="b688-6" data-blocks='[["BL_688.6",688,[219,1403,1158,989]],["BL_689.1",689,[209,336,1149,97]]]'>Prior to the adoption, in 1947, of the statutory predecessor to 20 Pa.C.S. § 2507(2), supra, it was the law in this Commonwealth that the right of a former spouse to take under a will was not affected by divorce. <em>Jones’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/211/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="211 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="940125" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0364-01">211 Pa. 364</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20A.%20915" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="60 A. 915">60 A. 915</a> (1905). The 1947 legislation rendered ineffective, upon divorce, testamentary provisions favoring one’s spouse. As stated in the Official Comment accompanying 20 Pa.C.S. § 2507(2), this legislation was based upon section 53 of the Model Probate Code and reflected recognition of the fact that most persons who fail to change or revoke their wills after a divorce would want to have their wills changed by operation of law. The legislature did not, however, take action to curtail the effectiveness of bequests made to the relatives of an ex-spouse. Certainly, there is a possibility that, after a divorce, one’s feelings towards an ex-spouse’s relatives might be changed and that the frequency of contacts with such relatives might be reduced. This is a highly individualized matter, however, and it cannot be said that the likelihood of estranged feelings is <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>sufficiently high as to warrant nullification of such gifts by operation of law.</p>
    <p id="b689-5" data-blocks='[["BL_689.5",689,[207,449,1154,1144]]]'>In the present case, the testatrix did not mention her intestate heirs at all in her will but rather designated her husband’s uncle as both an alternate beneficiary and an alternate executor. Many would view this as an unusual testamentary scheme, for one’s brother and sisters would normally be expected to take precedence over a husband’s uncle in receiving a share of one’s bounty. Such a scheme may evidence an unusually close bond between testatrix and the husband’s uncle, or, perhaps, the lack of such a bond between testatrix and her own family. Experience teaches, certainly, that individuals form bonds of friendship in patterns that often cannot be predicted or understood. (“A sympathetic friend can be quite as dear as a brother.” Homer, <em>Odyssey </em>(9th c. B.C.)). Other explanations for the chosen scheme might also be imagined, such as variations in the needs of the potential beneficiaries. Whatever the reason may have been for the designated scheme, there can be no doubt that the reason may well have outlasted testatrix’s marriage. Given these considerations, we do not believe that distribution of the estate to an ex-husband’s uncle is a result to be specifically avoided in construing the alternate beneficiary clause in paragraph IV of the will.</p>

    <p id="b690-5" data-blocks='[["BL_690.6",690,[225,714,1157,760]]]'>The clear intent to be discerned from the present will is that the husband’s uncle, Selfon, was given precedence over testatrix’s brother and sisters, who, in fact, were not intended to receive anything under testatrix’s will. Nevertheless, appellants argue that the bequest to Selfon was made absolutely conditional upon the death of testatrix’s husband, in that testatrix stated in paragraph IV of the will that the estate should pass to Selfon “[i]f my said husband predeceases me.” We believe this language does not evidence an intent that Selfon should be denied receipt of the bounty where the former husband is still living, where, due to divorce, the latter is disqualified from taking under the will. The effect of the language in question was analyzed correctly in the decision below, wherein the Superior Court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b690-6" data-blocks='[["BL_690.7",690,[262,1496,1113,720]]]'>These words, however, may also be viewed as part of a broader scheme, i.e., a method by which the testatrix describes her order of preference regarding who should enjoy her estate. It is overwhelmingly likely that the only reason for the predecease clause was to provide a fallback beneficiary in case the husband was no longer available to take under the will. Once the husband is barred by divorce from taking the gift, the time of his death no longer has any apparent significance. Therefore, as the trial judge noted in his opinion, “[c]ommon sense, in part, impels us to the conclusion that [the predecease clause] ... is less a precondition and more a provision to address the situation where the primary beneficiary could or would not [take under the will] ...”</blockquote>

It would have been highly illogical for testatrix to have made disposition of her estate dependent upon the death of a former spouse who is no longer a qualified beneficiary. We find no indication in the will that use of the phrase, “[i]f my said husband predeceases me,” was intended to mean anything other than, “if my husband is no longer able to take as a beneficiary.” To conclude otherwise would be to place undue technical emphasis upon testatrix’s use of the word, “predeceases,” with the result that the testamentary scheme would be defeated.
