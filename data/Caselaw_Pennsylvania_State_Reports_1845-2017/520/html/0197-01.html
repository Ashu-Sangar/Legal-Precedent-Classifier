Ashcom was a tenured professional employee of the Greater Johnstown Area Vocational-Technical School (hereinafter School), working as a teacher in the Mathematics Department. Just <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>prior to commencement of the 1983-84 school year, Ashcom was notified that, due to declining school enrollment, she was being furloughed from her job.

    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[221,592,1153,902]]]'>At issue in the arbitration proceeding was the method to be utilized in assigning furloughs. The School’s position was that the pertinent collective bargaining agreement required that furloughs be made on the basis of <em>departmental </em>seniority. Since Ashcom was the least senior member of the Mathematics Department, and also of the French Department where she was similarly certified to teach, she was selected for furlough. The Association claimed, however, that furloughs were to be assigned on the basis of <em>district-wide </em>seniority, rather than departmental seniority. Under this approach, employment positions would have been reshuffled so that Ashcom would have retained her job as a mathematics teacher while another individual with Jess district-wide seniority would have been furloughed. The arbitrator ruled in favor of the Association, adopting the view that the furlough process must take into account district-wide seniority.</p>

[Section] 1125.1(c) requires the [School] to engage in a comprehensive overview of its professional staff and, to the extent practicable, realign its staff in such a manner that the senior-most employees are retained.</blockquote>

There is absolutely no language in that provision indicating that departmental seniority was viewed by the parties as an incomplete method of assigning furloughs, such that reference to the Code would be necessary.

If the arbitrator relied upon the statutory savings clause to incorporate the entire Public School Code into the agreement and then elected to consider Section 1125.1(c), but not Section 1125.1(e), such an election would most certainly be deemed arbitrary. Regardless of whether the latter provision was taken into account, the result reached was not consistent with the plain meaning of Section 1125.1(e). See <em>Arnold v.

Rather, the legitimate scope of inquiry is limited to the question of whether the furlough policy announced by the arbitrator can be discerned from the language and context of the agreement. We believe that it cannot. To emphasize, this is not a case where we simply disagree with the arbitrator’s decision, but rather one where we perceive no rational basis to support that decision.

In light of this mutual cross-reference between the collective bargaining agreement arid the Code, I believe that the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement lay solely with the arbitrator and that his interpretation had a rational basis given the provisions in the Code concerning <em>district-wide </em>seniority of professional employees. 24 P.S. §§ 11-1124, ll-1125.1(c).</p>
