The Commonwealth Court’s erroneous interpretation of section 315 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 602 (Purdon’s Supp.1988), and the majority’s “affirmance” of that interpretation by declaring this appeal to have been improvidently granted, are in conflict with the legislative intent and compensation scheme clearly established by the General Assembly’s major substantive amendments to the Act in 1972 and this Court’s recent interpretations of those amendments. The erroneous interpretation denies workmen’s compensation benefits to an eligible claimant, and partially resurrects, for purposes of the three year time bar period of section 315, the discarded “accident” prerequisite for eligibility for workmen’s compensation which was replaced in 1972 with the more general requirement of <em>“injury </em>to an employe, regardless of his previous physical condition, arising in the course of his employment and related thereto____” Section 301(c)(1), 77 P.S. § 411 (Purdon’s Supp.1988).</p>

Those findings are as follows. Appellant, Robert J. McDevitt, suffered from a medical condition of “diabetic neuropathy of his lower extremities” which predated his employment with Ron Davidson Chevrolet (Davidson), appellee. This condition caused numbness in appellant’s lower extremities and difficulty in walking and maintaining balance. During his employment with Davidson (December 2, 1973 — July 23, 1978), appellant suffered <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>three separate falling injuries in the course of employment injuring, respectively, his knee (torn cartilage), hip (fracture), and on February 23, 1978, his shoulder (dislocation/fracture) which occurred when he slipped on ice in the employer’s driveway while working. Appellant returned to work following each of these injuries.</p>

No. 9. Appellant ceased employment as of that day (July 23, 1978), and filed a claim petition on July 10, 1981. Hearings were held, and the referee examined the medical testimony and other evidence offered by both parties and found that: appellant’s pre-existing condition made him “more likely to fall and hurt himself,” F.F. No. 18; appellant had “an extremely diminished range of motion in his right shoulder, which [his] Doctor directly attributed to [his] work related fracture of 1978,” F.F. No. 21; the “injury to his right shoulder would prevent his return to work as a car salesman,” F.F. No. 22; and</p>

    <p id="b287-7" data-blocks='[["BL_287.7",287,[215,1812,1154,419]]]'>Based on these findings, the referee awarded compensation beginning on the date of disability, July 23, 1978.

Davidson appealed the referee’s adverse decision to the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Board), appellee, raising, for the first time, the three year time-bar period of section 315 which provides, in relevant part:</p>

    <p id="b288-6" data-blocks='[["BL_288.6",288,[247,924,1154,633]]]'>Without taking additional evidence, the Board vacated the referee’s award and dismissed the claim petition, accepting Davidson’s argument that appellant’s “injury” for section 315 purposes occurred on February 23, 1978, the date of his last <em>accident </em>at work. Accordingly, the Board held that his claim of July 10, 1981 was untimely as it was filed more than three years beyond his “injury” of February 23, 1978, even though the claim was filed within three years from the date on which his disability from work commenced (July 23, 1978). Further, the Board held that Davidson had not waived the time-bar of section 315 even though it had failed to raise the issue before the referee.</p>
    <p id="b288-7" data-blocks='[["BL_288.7",288,[245,1598,1155,738]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed, agreeing with the Board that appellant’s shoulder injury occurred on February 23, 1978 and holding that <em>that date, </em>not his date of disability, triggered the three year time-clock of section 315. <em>McDevitt v.

It is apparent that the Commonwealth Court in this case equated “accident” with “injury” for purposes of starting the time-clock under section 315. This is absurd, and it flies in the face of the letter, spirit and entire tenor of the 1972 amendments to the Act.</p>

Thus, we specifically stated in <em>Bernard S.

    <p id="b290-5" data-blocks='[["BL_290.5",290,[235,639,1160,1712]]]'>There is simply no support for the Board’s and Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of section 315 which was amended by the legislature in 1972 as part of its major overhaul of the Act. To be consistent with our interpretation of “injury” in all other contexts that we have examined under the Act as amended in 1972, we must interpret “within three years after the injury” to mean within three years after the claimant’s disability has commenced. No other interpretation makes sense — suppose a worker was struck by a crane in a steel mill and seriously injured his back; suppose further that this worker was, as our worker in the instant case, a conscientious employee who worked through his pain for quite some time until he could no longer stand it and he became immobilized; and suppose said immobilization was reached exactly three years and one day from the time of the “accident;” finally suppose that unequivocal medical testimony established that his current disability was caused by this accident and consequent injury to his back. Under the Board’s, and the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning, which has now received the stamp of approval by this Court, this claimant could not file a claim for compensation on the very day his disability commenced since the date of trauma is the date which commences the running of the statute of limitations of section 315. If the worker continued to work for three years or more before becoming finally disabled by a work related accident, <em>he could never collect compensation benefits </em>under this interpretation. This decidedly <em>unhumanitarian </em>construction of the Act places an unwarranted and unjustifiable judicial restriction on eligibility for benefits which <em>penalizes </em>the conscientious worker who manages to keep working despite a work-related injury which <em>eventually </em>disables him or her.</p>

Because he had suffered no economic loss before that time as he gamely continued to work, his injuries were not compensable “injuries” within the meaning of the Act until July 23, 1978. It is manifestly unfair and improper to deny appellant benefits because he did not file a claim within three years of the date of the traumatic “accident” which did not actually disable him or prevent him from work until six months later.</p>

Properly notified, appellant would have attempted to show, inter alia, a continually deteriorating condition and continuing “injuries” from use of his arm at work from February 23 to July 23, 1978. This Court recently addressed the issue of the effect of the failure of a party to raise an issue before a workmen’s compensation referee, but failed to reach a majority consensus on whether waiver would always bar the raising of such an issue before the Board on an appeal from a referee’s decision. <em>DeMarco v.

I am convinced that the idea that this statute of limitations is absolute and jurisdictional, and of an exalted stature, comes from an earlier era that was anti-workingman; and from an era that was also unwilling to give full deference to the integrity of the administrative process.
