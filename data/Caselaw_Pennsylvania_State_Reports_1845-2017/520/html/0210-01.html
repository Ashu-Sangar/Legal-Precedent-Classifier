On July 24, 1985, the bodies of Paul Conard and Sandra Wiker were discovered at 868 North Queen Street in Lancaster. The murders were very brutal, with both bodies having been stabbed, strangled, bound and gagged.</p>
    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[200,654,1154,803]]]'>On the morning of Friday, July 26, 1985, several detectives of the Lancaster Police Department, along with the District Attorney, interviewed Marcellus Barnett and Timi Buterbaugh concerning information they possessed about the Conard-Wiker murders. The two individuals had arrived at the police station earlier in the evening and were questioned until about 1:00 or 1:30 a.m. Barnett told the police about his involvement in giving Appellant the layout of Conard’s apartment and other information possibly linking Appellant to the murders. Barnett also related to the police that the Appellant came to see him after the murders and told him that he, the Appellant, and his confederates had forced their way into Conard’s house by gunpoint, had tied up both Conard and Wiker, stabbed them, took guns and money, and left.</p>
    <p id="b379-6" data-blocks='[["BL_379.6",379,[200,1475,1154,906]]]'>Barnett further stated that he believed that Appellant was staying at the Parkside Motel under an assumed name and that he was probably armed. (N.T., Pre-Trial Hearing, pp. 199-200, 219-224.) The police decided to place a stakeout at the motel in the event Appellant attempted to leave. Two police officers were sent to the motel at 3:00 a.m., were advised of the situation and were instructed not to do anything unless it appeared that Appellant was attempting to leave. The officers were informed that Appellant might be armed and dangerous. Appellant had registered at the Parkside Hotel on July 25, 1985, under the assumed name of James Long. At 6:26 a.m., July 26, 1985, Appellant left his motel room, and pursuant to their instructions, the police officers placed him under arrest. Appellant had in his possession a knife and a revolver at that time and two rings later identified as belonging to Paul Conard. (N.T., Pre-Trial Hearing, pp. 177-205).</p>

He offered an explanation of his whereabouts on the crucial dates in question, but could not provide the names of witnesses to corroborate his story. He could offer no cogent explanation as to why he checked into the motel under an alias. Appellant claimed that he got the gun and the rings in exchange for drugs (a quarter gram of crank — methamphetamine) but would not, or could not, name the other party to the transaction. When asked whether he knew Sandy Wiker (one of the victims in this case), Appellant denied knowing her. He was then confronted with the fact that her name was listed in an address book taken from him previously. Appellant could not explain the discrepancy, became angry, and asserted that all the police had him for was receiving stolen property. (N.T., pp. 1078-1087). Under the circumstances, and especially in light of the fact that no eyewitnesses to these crimes were called to testify by the Commonwealth, this testimony as to Appellant’s answers during the interrogation was highly damaging to Appellant’s cause. If this testimony of Lieutenant Landis was improperly admitted at trial, in whole or in part, and we conclude that it was, Appellant is clearly entitled to a new trial.</p>

Further interrogation at that point was not instigated by Appellant but by Lieutenant Landis. We do not view Lt. Landis’ <em>continued </em>questioning as intended to clarify Appellant’s desires respecting counsel. What, in Appellant’s request, needs clarification? What was equivocal or ambiguous? Appellant reportedly said, “Can I use the phone to call my mother to see if she can get me an attorney?” to paraphrase Lt. Landis’ testimony.
