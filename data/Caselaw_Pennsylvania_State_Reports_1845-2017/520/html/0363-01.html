The Board believes that continuous employment ■with the Commonwealth is the condition by which statutorily conferred retirement benefits are fixed. The Board argues that employment is such a pre-requisite pointing to the Commonwealth Court’s original order which specifically directed that <em>employees </em>who were members of the System were to continue paying the 5% retirement contribution rate. The Board reasons that all other individuals by implication are subject to the new contribution rate. The fallacy with this argument is that the original case only involved actively employed individuals. Therefore, it was not at all unusual for the Commonwealth Court order to enjoin only the collection of the new contribution rate from current employee members of the System.</p>

All retirement rights, including the basic compensation rate, are fixed by the Retirement Code and here lies the heart of this case.

Continuous employment is nowhere referred to as a pre-requisite for membership in the class or system and, in reality, is but one possibility. A member can also be one who belongs to a service class, (Class A) for example, and who maintains his membership by being an annuitant, vestee or by keeping his contributions in the System. In all of these cases, membership is maintained even though the member is not working for the State. If that member returns to active service in the same service class (Class A), his contribution rate has been fixed at 5% and stays at that rate because he never changed his status as a member or his class of service.</p>

On the other hand, the employees who upon severance chose to withdraw their contributions have clearly terminated their membership status and cannot expect to maintain any rights upon return to the System, except to buy back former State time at the old rate. 71 Pa.C.S. § 5504. Their new service will be subject to the rules in effect when they re-enter State service.

Employees on paid or unpaid leave are active members as long as they continue making contributions or keep their accumulations in the fund (Category No. 3). Category 5 employees are also protected because they kept their accumulations in the fund. Only Category 4 employees were correctly denied relief because they withdrew their accumulations, thereby voluntarily choosing to terminate their continuous membership status with the system and losing any rights they formerly had.</p>

Indeed, the Commonwealth Court in its order of March 7, 1984 held that the increase in the pension contribution rate from 5% to 6XA% as applied to vested and non-vested members of the system was an unconstitutional impairment of the right to contract. Every state employee who was a member of the system prior to the passage of Act 31 has contractual rights in the system established at the time of membership. As long as membership in the retirement system continues<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> or the employment relationship is maintained, the contractual rights may not be impaired. The Commonwealth Court in granting partial summary judgment to the Board sanctioned an impairment of those rights in this case by authorizing the Board to impose the higher 6XA% contribution rate as to employees who were members of the retirement system prior to the effective date of Act 31, and who temporarily left active state employment and withdrew previous pension contributions before returning to state service. The order permits the higher rate even though the employee who has returned to active employment maintained an employment relationship while separated.</p>

The same is true for an employee who is laid off and withdraws his pension contributions to survive while waiting for return to active service under either civil service law in a collective bargaining agreement. In each case the separated employee has maintained an employment relationship and upon return to active employment is entitled to be restored to his prior position with the same contractual rights initially acquired upon membership in the retirement system.</p>
