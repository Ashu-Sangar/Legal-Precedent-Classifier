The essence of the Appellant’s petition attacking the judgment is that it has an absolute right to subrogation under § 319 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 671. Although we do not agree with the procedure utilized by the Appellant to protect its right, we do agree that its subrogation rights under the Act are absolute.</p>

PECO in turn joined the Appellant, Allis-Chalmers Corp., as an additional defendant seeking contribution for any damages that it may have to satisfy. At the time of the accident, Appellee, Ova Winfree, was the employee of the Appellant. Because of the injuries sustained the Appellee was unable to work, resulting in the payment of workmen’s compensation benefits to him in accordance with the Act.</p>

After the denial of post-trial motions, judgment was entered on the verdict and PECO filed an appeal to the Superior Court. In January, 1984, PECO and the Appellees agreed to settle the judgment for $800,000. The Appellees had the judgment marked satisfied and PECO withdrew its appeal.</p>

To grant such relief, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he was induced to record the satisfaction of judgment by fraud or mistake. However, in <em>Epstein </em>we affirmed the denial of the petition concluding that the appropriate remedy was an assumpsit action for breach of contract. No evidence had been offered demonstrating that the plaintiff was fraudulently induced to satisfy the judgment of record. Rather, the defendant failed to honor the agreement to pay the judgment after the judgment was satisfied on the record.</p>

So long as the plaintiff was not duped into actually satisfying the judgment, that judgment would not be stricken.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.6",561,[235,1653,1154,744]]]'>In the case sub judice, the Appellant does not claim that the Appellees were fraudulently induced into satisfying the judgment. Instead, the Appellant contends it was defrauded by the actions of the Appellees and PECO. Thus, on the face of its petition, the Appellant would not be entitled to the relief sought since the Appellees received a jury verdict and PECO agreed to pay a settlement which obviously the Appellees have agreed to accept. The Appellees are not now alleging that PECO committed any fraud. On the face of the judgment and record facts there is no reason to strike the satisfaction. No facts have been pled showing that PECO fraudulently induced the Appellees to satisfy the judgment. Thus, the procedure utilized by Appellant was inappropriate.</p>

In <em>Olin, </em>Commonwealth Court upheld the claimant’s right to pursue workmen’s compensation benefits even though he did not protect his employer’s future subrogation claim. The court held that since no benefits had been paid prior to the dismissal of the third party complaint, the claimant had not affected the employer’s subrogation rights. More importantly, the court held that statutory benefits arise without regard to the possible liability of third persons. Thus, workmen’s compensation benefits are not contingent but absolute.</p>
    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.6",563,[233,1687,1154,693]],["BL_564.1",564,[247,321,1153,421]]]'>In <em>Travelers Insurance Co., supra, </em>the injured employee entered into a consent judgment against joint tortfeasors and satisfied the judgment upon payment. Prior to the settlement, the Appellant-plaintiff, the employee’s workmen’s compensation carrier, had advised the Appellee-defendant, the insurance carrier for one of the tortfeasors, of its subrogation claim. However, the plaintiff never advised the employee or his attorney of its claim, nor did it intervene in the personal injury action. While the court did recognize subrogation as an equitable remedy, it did so in the context of the application of the concept of promissory estoppel. Thus, if the workmen’s compensation carrier had justifiably relied upon the liability carrier’s protection of its <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>rights in the third party negligence action, then promissory estoppel would be applicable and the workmen’s compensation carrier would be entitled to proceed to recoup the benefits it paid. However, since the workmen’s compensation carrier did not prove any evidence of negligence as to the cause of the employee’s injuries, it was foreclosed from being reimbursed as a subrogee under <em>Broderick v.

    <p id="b564-4" data-blocks='[["BL_564.5",564,[242,761,1157,850]]]'>In addition, both lower courts relied upon <em>Meehan v.

In <em>Meehan, </em>the plaintiff and the City of Philadelphia filed a joint action against the third party tortfeasor for damages arising out of the injuries the plaintiff received as the result of a motor vehicle accident. Both then settled the cause of action against the tortfeasor. Prior to the settlement, the City had paid the plaintiff benefits under the Act of June 28, 1935, P.L. 477, 53 P.S. § 637 and the Workmen’s Compensation Act. The City then tried to recover a credit for any workmen’s compensation benefits paid or to be paid. In rejecting the City’s claim, the court relied upon equitable principles and held that the plaintiff had been led to believe that his settlement with the City resolved all subrogation claims by the City. Therefore, the City was precluded from pursuing any further claims against Meehan.</p>

In both <em>Traveler’s Insurance Company </em>and <em>Meehan, </em>the court looked to the interplay between the claimant and his employer to determine whether estoppel was appropriate in supporting a denial of subrogation rights. In each case, estoppel did not apply to the obtaining of benefits, only to the enforcing of the subrogation rights. In the case, sub judice, the lower courts agreed with the Appellees’ argument that the Appellant should be denied its subrogation rights because it did not fully cooperate in obtaining a negligence judgment. In fact, the Appellees argue that Appellant acted in direct controvention of their interests. There appears to be some support for Appellees’ <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>argument in the record. However, Appellant’s actions must be viewed in the context in which they arose. Appellees seem to lose track of the fact that Appellant was joined by the original defendant in a cause of action in negligence based upon contribution or indemnification. Thus, the Appellant did in fact become an adversary. It therefore was not unreasonable for the Appellant to pursue the actions it did.</p>

Adopting Appellees’ argument would be placing the employer in the dubious position of cooperating with its employee and running the risk of being found solely liable or vigorously pursuing its own exoneration and losing its subrogation rights.

At trial petitioner stated that it intended to demonstrate that ‘the accident occurred because of plaintiff’s own misconduct.’ (trial transcript, trial: June 1 — June 9, 1982, hereinafter transcript, p. 23); petitioner cross-examined Mr. Winfree about the instant of the accident, returning consistently to questions involving mis-step, slipping and falling on a surface purportedly known to the plaintiff to be grease covered. (Transcript p. 150-182); petitioner cross-examined several witnesses of whom defendant PECO intended to ask no questions, (transcript, <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>p. 444-447; 501-509; 630-641).

(Transcript p. 990-991). The testimony of the only eyewitness was a fellow employee and fellow union member of Mr. Winfree. (Transcript p. 992-993).

As to the first contention, the company developed separate files for handling Winfree’s case and its own defense. (R.R. 192a, 241a). However, the record clearly reveals that while Allis-Chalmers requested and Winfree’s counsel agreed that Allis-Chalmers would be subrogated to any recovery by Winfree against PECO, it later forbade Winfree’s counsel from having contact with Allis-Chalmers’ insurance carrier. (R.R. 253a-254a, 244a). Winfree then informed Allis-Chalmers that he could no longer maintain any subrogation interest on Allis-Chalmer’s behalf. Allis-Chalmers blames lack of communications between its own departments for the difficulties appellee faced. (Appellant’s brief at 6, 7).</p>

    <p id="AL5" data-blocks='[["BL_571.7",571,[197,1305,1155,744]]]'>(Appellant’s brief at 23). However, the trial court’s ruling does not limit an employer’s defenses to indemnity issues alone; it merely points out that the consequences of presenting an affirmative defense of contributory negligence may include loss of subrogation when an employer concurrently fails to cooperate fully with its employee’s case. We do not preclude employers from presenting any viable defense as long as there remains a clear, unambiguous commitment to cooperate with an employee’s legitimate requests for assistance in developing the employee’s case. If that commitment wavers or fails, as it has in this case, then the equitable remedy of subrogation may be denied.

Therefore, had Allis-Chalmers properly demonstrated that either the satisfaction was improperly entered, or that Allis-Chalmers was an <em>innocent </em>third party, it would have been entitled to the relief requested. We find Allis-Chalmers failed to demonstrate any appropriate ground for relief. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the lower court.</p>
