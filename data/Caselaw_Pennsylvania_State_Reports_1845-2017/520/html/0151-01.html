    <p id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[247,413,1154,869]]]'>In <em>Hubble, </em>the Appellee and his wife voluntarily went to the State Police Barracks where <em>Miranda </em>rights were given by the police. At that time, the wife suggested to her husband that he get a lawyer, following which the Appellee stated to the police, “I want a lawyer,” and “I want a public defender.” The police thereupon encouraged and aided Hubble unsuccessfully to telephone an attorney. At his request, they also succeeded in contacting his probation officer who, likewise, advised Appellee to find a lawyer. The facts showed that the police advised him that a public defender might not come to the police barracks, while they still continued to urge him to call the public defender. Appellee and his wife then put on their coats, proceeded towards an exit, but after conferring at length and being told that the police now had information placing him at the scene of the crime, Hubble returned to give an inculpatory statement.</p>

We then included Appellee’s utterances within the totality of circumstances test of <em>Oregon v. Bradshaw, </em><a href="/us/462/1039-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="462 U.S. 1039" data-case-ids="6196866" data-case-paths="/us/462/1039-01">462 U.S. 1039</a>, <a href="/us/462/1039-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="462 U.S. 1039" data-case-ids="6196866" data-case-paths="/us/462/1039-01">103 S.Ct. 2830</a>, <a href="/us/462/1039-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="462 U.S. 1039" data-case-ids="6196866" data-case-paths="/us/462/1039-01">77 L.Ed.2d 405</a> (1983), which holds that where a suspect rather than the police initiates further conversation, the evidence is not suppressed automatically under <em>Edwards. </em>We buttressed this last conclusion by noting as well that even if the initial admission had been infirm, Hubble voluntarily gave statements later which in any case cured any original defect. We stressed <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>the fact the police “scrupulously honored” Hubble’s equivocal statement regarding the need for a lawyer by helping him look up an attorney’s telephone number and providing him with a telephone. Finally, in <em>Hubble </em>we made a crucial finding that the suspect was not misled by the erroneous police statement that the public defender would not travel to the barracks, and we reiterated that conclusion in our opinion. <em>Hubble </em><a href="/pa/509/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="509 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1795316" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0497-01">509 Pa. at 511</a>, <a href="/pa/509/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="509 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1795316" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0497-01">504 A.2d at </a>173 and 175. We emphasize the absence of any misleading act because it is readily apparent that an opposite finding in <em>Hubble </em>would have resulted in a different outcome.</p>
    <p id="b321-5" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[212,876,1154,1148]]]'>In the present case under review, we hold that the statement by the authorities to Griggs was an impermissible inducement and thereby tainted his admissions. By conveying the distinct impression that the district attorney would be told of his cooperation in giving a confession on the spot, there occurred an inescapable inducement which cannot be condoned under our law. For while we recognize that the police have a legitimate responsibility to conduct investigations, including interrogations, criminal suspects have a constitutional right to make up their own minds as to whether they want the <em>Miranda </em>protections. Promises of benefits or special considerations, however benign in intent, comprise the sort of persuasion and trickery which easily can mislead suspects into giving confessions. The process of rendering <em>Miranda </em>warnings should proceed freely without any intruding frustration by the police. Only in that fashion can we trust the validity of subsequent admissions, for if the initial employment of <em>Miranda </em>is exploited illegally, succeeding inculpatory declarations are compromised. Misleading statements and promises by the police choke off the legal process at the very moment which <em>Miranda </em>was designed to protect.</p>
    <p id="b321-6" data-blocks='[["BL_321.6",321,[211,2042,1153,306]],["BL_322.1",322,[248,299,1155,614]]]'>Our analysis rests squarely on <em>Hubble. </em>There we affirmed the admissibility of a confession only after we were able to determine that the authorities had “scrupulously honored” the suspect’s rights and that he had not been misled by investigative inquiries. Moreover, <em>Hubble’s </em>approval of a confession following Appellee’s initiation of a <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>conversation with the police itself was predicated on an absence of efforts by interrogators to mislead and induce the suspect and took place after the suspect was read his rights. By contrast, here the improper suggestion of a benefit in return for cooperation poisoned the interrogation system. We are not prepared to say that the Appellant’s initiation of conversation in this case is constitutionally permissible unless there is a prior finding that the initiation was not induced in the first instance but occurred after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given. Since the circumstances of this case preclude such a finding, we now decide that the inculpatory testimony given at the barracks was infirm.</p>
    <p id="b322-5" data-blocks='[["BL_322.5",322,[246,930,1155,874]]]'>Because we hold that the police engaged in an inducement, there is no need to address the issue of whether the utterance regarding an attorney was sufficiently precise to pass muster under <em>Hubble. </em>On the one hand, if it is assumed that a valid request was made, <em>Edwards </em>would have halted all further interrogation. Subsequent conversation by the suspect then likewise would be tainted because it would be the product of continuing improper persuasion. On the other hand, if the utterance did not qualify as an unequivocal call for an attorney, at that point the police also were not justified in promoting an admission by suggesting a benefit if the suspect would not ask for representation. In our decision today, we decide only that the authorities are not permitted to employ inducements which impair in any way a suspect’s right to his own unfettered evaluation of the need for legal counsel. <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny, especially <em>Hubble, </em>otherwise would make no sense.</p>

I do not interpret appellant’s question “what good would it do me to tell you” as a request for a legal opinion from the officer on the legal advantages to be gained by securing legal counsel, nor do I interpret “Maybe I should talk to a lawyer” as an unequivocal request to cease interrogation and retain a lawyer; neither did the suppression court make such interpretations.
