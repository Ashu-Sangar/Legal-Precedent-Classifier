Appellant’s employment was terminated as a result of the fact that Appellant accepted an employer-designed “voluntary” termination plan rather <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>than risk an involuntary layoff. He was subsequently denied unemployment benefits.</p>
    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[241,396,1154,519]]]'>Appellant worked as a maintenance foreman for Nabisco Brands, Inc. He had been with the company for over seventeen years at the time of his separation from employment on October 31, 1985. The termination of Appellant’s employment came about through a plan euphemistically titled “operation leveraging and streamlining” (“OLS”) which was offered unilaterally to all management employees by Nabisco. Nabisco established this plan in order to avoid mandatory layoffs of salaried personnel such as the claimant.</p>
    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.6",250,[240,941,1153,581]]]'>The particulars of the reduction plan at issue are that in April, 1985, all management personnel were notified that in order for the company to remain competitive, the company would have to reduce its number of salaried employees by thirty (30%) percent nationwide. In order to avoid becoming uncompetitive, the company offered individualized severance packages to those who would relinquish their employment “voluntarily.” Had this program not produced the required staff reduction, it was asserted that layoffs would have followed. Rather than risk layoff, Appellant accepted Nabisco’s offer to resign under the OLS plan.</p>
    <p id="b250-6" data-blocks='[["BL_250.7",250,[240,1539,1152,419]]]'>As it turned out, more people accepted the OLS plan than was necessary to ease Nabisco’s financial dilemma. Neither Appellant nor any of the other individuals who accepted the plan was advised of this. The agreement, once effectuated, was not revocable. Thus, even if such knowledge would have led Appellant or his co-workers to reconsider their decision, it came too late for them to retract their separation agreements.</p>

I believe that, as a matter of law, Appellant’s termination here was not voluntary under our Unemployment Compensation statute. Moreover, the Commonwealth Court’s decision to the con<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>trary may have a wide-scale detrimental effect on persons currently in the workforce who are subject to this sort of enticement and whom the statute is designed to protect.</p>
    <p id="b251-4" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[214,494,1154,638]]]'>If this Appellant had not “voluntarily” signed up for the termination plan at issue, he would have remained in the general pool of employees, 30% of whom would have had to have been laid off or terminated. Or so he was led to believe. Rather than risk the layoff, Appellant signed up for the plan. As it turned out, more than 30% of its employees accepted the employer’s plan. Hence, no one was, in fact, laid off and Appellant alleges that <em>he was the only person denied </em>unemployment compensation. All others who accepted this termination plan and applied for unemployment compensation were paid appropriate benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> (N.T. at 13).</p>

This provision renders invalid any agreement by an employee to waive or release any of his rights under the act. It is our view that if the labor-management agreement were able to be relied upon to disqualify Gianfelice as a “voluntary quit” when his separation from work was not in fact voluntary, the agreement would be invalid to such extent.</blockquote>

The temptation to do this will be especially great in periods when an employer faces a financial downturn, or when the bulk of its employees become older and achieve higher wage benefits. To deny unemployment compensation benefits to employees caught in such circumstances seems to me to be contrary to the most fundamental goals of the statute. Nor should we be concerned that this employee will receive double benefits — unemployment compensation and severance pay. One offsets the other and <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>only the balance, if any, is paid to the terminated employee.
