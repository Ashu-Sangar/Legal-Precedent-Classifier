From 1932 to 1953 the President of the B &amp; 0 was a member of the Board of Directors of the AAR and its Medical and Surgical Director represented the B &amp; 0 at meetings of the Medical and Surgical Section.

Thus, Dale asserts that nine years before he was even hired, B &amp; 0 was or should have been <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>aware of the hazards of dust in the workplace. Finally, although asbestosis is not mentioned as a common problem in railroad work, the Committee’s report in 1937 observes that “Silica, asbestos and lead are the principal substances generating toxic dusts to which railway employees may be exposed----”, and “We may accept as axiomatic that dust from whatever source, if in an excessive amount, is injurious.”</p>

Some of these studies concerned primary users (employees who worked with raw asbestos) and some concerned secondary users (employees who worked with products fabricated from asbestos), although no study dealt directly with pipe-fitters working on railroads.

The same expert also testified that the extent of ignorance of asbestosis during the time period in question is illustrated by a report in the 1937 AAR minutes which indicates that the Illinois Workers’ Occupational Diseases Act provides for a three year statute of limitations after exposure with respect to asbestosis, but that we know now that actual latency of this disease may be 10 or 20 years.

If there is a statutory requirement that FELA awards shall be diminished by the amount of an employee’s contributory negligence, it is implicit in the statutory scheme that liability attaches to a negligent act only to the degree that the negligent act caused the employee’s injury, and thus that an employer is financially responsible only for those damages which it has caused. Thus, we hold that an FELA employer whose employee has been injured partially by the employer’s negligence and partially by other causes, whether those other causes relate to a pre-existing condition or to a concurrent, contemporary cause arising from the circumstances of the injury, must pay damages only for those injuries attributable to its negligence. We agree with B &amp; 0, therefore, that the trial court was in error in instructing the jury that if it found the railroad negligent, the railroad was liable for the whole amount of damages, whether or not its negligence caused those damages in whole or in part.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Section 53 says absolutely nothing, however, to suggest that where other factors contributed to an employee’s injuries, that an employer’s damages can or should be reduced on that account. <em>See, Farmer v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em><a href="/f-supp/311/1074-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="311 F. Supp. 1074" data-case-ids="3088906" data-case-paths="/f-supp/311/1074-01">311 F.Supp. 1074</a> (D.C., W.D.Pa., 1970). To so hold seems to me directly contrary to the language and spirit of <em>Rogers, </em>quoted <em>supra. </em>On the contrary, where an employer railroad’s negligence causes, <em>in whole or in part, </em>an injury to their employee, they are liable for the entire amount of damages, and there is no provision in the FELA for reduction of damages for innocent causes which concur with a defendant’s negligence in causing an injury. See, <em>Sentilles v. Inter-Caribbean Corp., </em><a href="/us/361/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="361 U.S. 107" data-case-ids="6165317" data-case-paths="/us/361/0107-01">361 U.S. 107</a>, <a href="/us/361/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="361 U.S. 107" data-case-ids="6165317" data-case-paths="/us/361/0107-01">80 S.Ct. 173</a>, <a href="/us/361/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="361 U.S. 107" data-case-ids="6165317" data-case-paths="/us/361/0107-01">4 L.Ed.2d 142</a> (1959), <em>Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., supra; Farmer v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., supra; Fleming v. Husted, </em><a href="/f2d/164/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="164 F.2d 65" data-case-ids="1208864" data-case-paths="/f2d/164/0065-01">164 F.2d 65</a> (8th Cir., 1947); Restatement, Second, Torts § 433A, comment a. To hold that an employer’s damages may be reduced under the instant circumstances seems to me to be directly contrary to the language and spirit of <em>Rogers, </em>quoted <em>supra. </em>The pro-labor policies of the Act will be insensibly undermined by the unprecedented anti-worker holding of the majority. Simply put, the rule is and ought to be thuswise: the employer as <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>tortfeasor under this Act must take its victim as it finds him.
