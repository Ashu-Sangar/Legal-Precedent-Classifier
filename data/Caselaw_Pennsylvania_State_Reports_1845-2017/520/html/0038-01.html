Sprague, who filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in the Commonwealth Court challenging the placing on the ballot in the November 1988 general election one seat on the Supreme Court and one seat on the Superior Court. Named as respondents in the action were Robert P. Casey, in his official capacity as Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; James J. Haggerty, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; William Boehm, in his official capacity as Commissioner of the Bureau of Legislation, Commissions and Elections; Allen Ertel, in his capacity as Democratic Party nominee for the office of Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania; Anita B. Brody, in her capacity as Republican Party nominee for the office of Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania; Walter M. Cohen, in his capacity as Republican Party nominee for the office of Judge of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania; and, Catherine Ford-Elliot, in her capacity as Democratic Party nominee for the office of Judge of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. The various respondents filed preliminary objections to the complaint filed by petitioner. Prior to argument in the Commonwealth Court which was scheduled for September 14, 1988, this Court, in response to petitioner’s request for the Exercise of Plenary Jurisdiction, entered an order on September 12, 1988, granting the petition for the Exercise of Plenary Jurisdiction, and listed the case for argument during the September argument session in Pittsburgh.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After the receipt of briefs and oral argument, this Court entered a <em>per curiam </em>order on September 27, 1988, <a href="/pa/519/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="519 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="1813549" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0313-01">519 Pa. 313</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="519 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="1813549" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0313-01">548 </a><a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a><a href="/pa/519/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="519 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="1813549" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0313-01">A.2d 249</a>, denying respondents’ preliminary objections, granting petitioner’s application for summary relief and directing the Sécretary of the Commonwealth to remove from the ballot in the general election of 1988 the offices of Justice of the Supreme Court and Judge of the Superior Court.

Petitioner argues that although he may have had constructive notice of the elections at that time, he asserts that he was not aware of the constitutional issues surrounding the election until July 1, 1988. The correct inquiry in determining whether his conduct resulted in a want of due diligence is to focus not upon “what the plaintiff knows, ‘but what he might have known, by the use of the means of information within his reach, with the vigilance the law requires of him,’ ” <em>Taylor v.

It is asserted petitioner, as an attorney, is deemed to be familiar with the mandate of the Constitution of this Commonwealth, and thus should have been immediately aware of his claim. The candidates-respondents, however, are also lawyers and are candidates for offices on the two highest courts in this jurisdiction, and should be charged with the knowledge of the Constitution as well.

It must be kept in mind that the right ostensibly conferred upon each of the appointees, by her or his commission, was a term of office lasting until the first Monday of January, 1989. Each of the appointees accepted a commission with that apparent limitation, and took no steps to challenge the official decision to put those seats on the ballot for the November 1988 general election. The action brought by petitioner Sprague sought no redress against either Justice Stout or Judge Melinson, and in no way sought to diminish the rights they had been given and had accepted. Moreover, the relief sought by the petitioner would expand the terms of their appointments, and thus could not be adverse to their interests.

Therefore the terms of ten years commencing in an even year would thereafter expire in an even year. Thus the concern of <em>Cavanaugh </em>is not legitimately present. What injected this question into this scenario was the attempt to exercise the gubernatorial appointment in a manner contrary to the mandate of section 13(b).

The irony of the situation is best illustrated in that the respondents who support the errant governmental action in this case rely on those cases articulating the constitutional preference of an elected jurist over an appointed judge. The context in which that premise was developed occurred in situations where the appointing authority attempted to extend the power of appointment to the detriment of the right of the public to elect judges. <em>See, e.g., Berardocco v.

The problem arose because the office of Justice of the Supreme Court was formerly assigned a term of twenty-one years. Where a term of office is assigned an odd number, if it commences in an even-numbered year, it will expire in an odd-numbered year. Conversely, if that odd-numbered term began in an odd-numbered year, it would expire in an even-numbered year and would continue to alternate in this manner into infinity. In contrast, where the term commencing in an even-numbered year is for an even number of years, it will always expire in an even-numbered year and the election to fill the new term can properly be held in the preceding municipal election. After the adoption of the present Article I in 1968, all judicial terms of office were assigned an even number and the former twenty-one-year term was abolished. At the time that the <em>Cavanaugh </em>issue was presented to this Court, there were only two twenty-one-year terms yet to expire. One was the seat of the then Chief Justice O'Brien which was to expire in January of 1983 and the seat of the late Chief Justice Roberts which was to expire in 1984. The <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>Roberts seat did not present the problem because it expired in an even-numbered year and would be succeeded by a ten-year (even numbered) term. Thus, the <em>Cavanaugh </em>court was not presented with a precedent setting issue but merely the adjustment of one term of office so that it would fall within the scheme clearly mandated under Article V.</p>

Const, art. VII, § 3. In general elections the citizens of this Commonwealth are called upon to elect either a President or a Governor. Because of the importance of selecting good judges, it was concluded that the election of judges in an election where either a President or Governor was being elected would detract from the public attention required for the filling of the judicial office. Even the detractors of the popular selection of judges must concede the wisdom of this policy as long as we retain elected judges. Although they may challenge the efficacy of electing judges, they cannot legitimately dispute that a. presidential or gubernatorial racé distracts the voters in their selection of judicial officers. Thus the exception provided in Article VII, section 3 lost its viability with the adoption of Article V in 1968. Rather than attempting to perpetuate the issue, the <em>Cavanaugh </em>Court could have employed the vehicle provided for in Article VII, section 3 by holding that the term of Chief Justice O'Brien could have been extended to the “next succeeding even-numbered year.” Pa. Const, art. VII, § 3. Notwithstanding the language of the majority opinion in <em>Cavanaugh, </em>its <em>sui generis </em>quality must be recognized and therefore that decision provides no authority beyond the holding in that specific case.
