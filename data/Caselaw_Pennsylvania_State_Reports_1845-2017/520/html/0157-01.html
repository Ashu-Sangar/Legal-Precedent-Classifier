We hold that respondent, Seymour H. Braun, presented psychiatric testimony which established that his neurotic depression was a causal factor in his misconduct, and therefore adopt the recommendation of the Disciplinary Board that he be suspended from the practice of law for two years.</p>

On fifteen occasions, respondent forged his client’s signature on checks totalling $1,962.94. From November, 1980 to September 1985, respondent took no action of record in the administration of the estate, failing, inter alia, to pay inheritance tax or to file inventories or accounts. In March, 1985, when the executrix requested reimbursement for funeral expenses she had advanced, respondent deposited $750.00 in the estate account to cover the check he sent.</p>

Both psychiatrists agreed that respondent suffered from neurotic depression, and respondent’s psychiatrist, who treated him in 1976 and 1986, testified that the condition persisted during the intervening years while respondent’s misconduct took place and that the psychiatric disability was a causative factor in the misconduct.</p>

The Disciplinary Board, on the other hand, found that respondent’s mental disability was a factor in causing the misconduct, and also recommended that he be disciplined with a two-year suspension. On July 15, 1988, this Court ordered respondent’s immediate suspension from the practice of law and issued a rule to show cause why he should not be disbarred.</p>

His conduct transgressed DR 1-102(A)(4), dealing with conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; DR 1-102(A)(6), dealing with conduct adversely reflecting on the fitness of an attorney to practice law; DR 6-101(A)(3), dealing with conduct involving neglect of a legal matter entrusted to an attorney; DR 9-102(B)(3), dealing with the maintenance of complete records of funds of a client and the rendering of appropriate accounts of the funds; and DR 9-102(B)(4), dealing with the prompt payment or delivery to a client, as requested by the client, funds in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive. Such misbehavior, of course, would warrant the most severe sanction, disbarment, rather than suspension, unless significant mitigating factors impinge on the decision. <em>See, e.g., Office of Disciplinary Counsel v.

I disagree with the Court’s disposition of this matter for several reasons. My review of the record convinces me that the Respondent has not carried his burden of establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, a connection between his psychiatric illness and his acts of misconduct. Therefore, there are no mitigating circumstances in this case. Respondent has engaged in conduct which is illegal, dishonest and deceitful, and I recommend that he be disbarred.</p>

Slagle, M.D., and his own testimony with regard to his history of neurotic depression and treatment thereof. The testimony shows that Respondent sought help for his depression on two occasions, first in 1976 and second in late October 1986. Neither of these occurred during the relevant time period <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>when the misconduct took place. Respondent represented the executrix in administering her decedent’s estate from November of 1980 to September 1985, during which period he took no action of record with regard to the estate. He did, however, manage to forge the name of his executrix to fifteen checks between the period of March 1982 and July 1985. Respondent claims to have been severely depressed during the entire period (1980 through 1985). Yet he sought no treatment whatsoever during that period. The only basis for Dr. Slagle’s diagnosis as to Respondent’s condition during that time period was Respondent’s own assertion that he was depressed. With regard to the causal connection between the depressed condition and the misconduct, the most Dr. Slagle could say was that he thought that Respondent set himself up to be punished because of guilt feelings. When asked whether neurotic depression would cause a person to engage in forgery or misappropriation of client funds, Dr. Slagle said “I would say sometimes” (N.T. 21). However, upon further questioning for clarification purposes, Dr. Slagle talked in terms of neglect or morally dishonest conduct rather than legally dishonest conduct.</p>
    <p id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[227,1569,1153,699]]]'>Dr. Patrick McDonough, Petitioner’s expert, testified regarding the symptoms of neurotic depression. His testimony for the most part agreed with Dr. Slagle as to the general symptoms of depression; however, he unequivocally stated that the symptoms did not include dishonest or illegal conduct. He testified that in his professional opinion the neurotic depression <em>did not </em>cause Respondent to misappropriate the funds or engage in forgery (N.T. 81-84). Further, he testified that the self-punitive conduct which is characteristic of neurotic depression ordinarily takes the form of actual physical harm to the person, i.e., cutting the wrists or taking pills in a suicide attempt, and does not involve engaging in conduct to harm third parties (N.T. 82).</p>

I find the fact that Respondent attempted to conceal his misconduct by replacing funds which he had misappropriated when he feared discovery of his very careful forgeries to be in conflict with the theory advanced by Dr. Slagle that Respondent was setting himself up to be punished. I also find it interesting that Respondent only sought treatment for his depression after he received the letter of allegations from the office of Disciplinary Counsel. I would also like to note that forgery and conversion are crimes in this Commonwealth and, if criminal charges are brought, neurotic depression would not constitute a defense to such charges. The Hearing Committee report noted that the Respondent received an informal admonition for violation of DR 6-101(A)(3) in 1983, but he sought no help for his alleged depressive condition at that time. In fact, at no time during the three year period during which Respondent engaged in the forgeries and misappropriation did he seek treatment for his depression. Further, Dr. Slagle testified that Respondent clearly has not progressed to the point where he is cured or able to function without monitoring. He also cannot provide any assurances that Respondent’s depression will not recur or that Respondent will not be a danger to the public.</p>
