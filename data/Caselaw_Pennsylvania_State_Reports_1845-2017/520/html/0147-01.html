Section 5304 empowers a court to enter an award for shared custody. Section 5310 provides that “[a]ny order for custody ... may ... be modified at any time <em>to </em>an order of <em>shared </em>custody____” (Emphasis added.) Both of these sections are 1985 reenactments of provisions contained in a 1981 statute. <em>See </em>Act of November 5, 1981, P.L. 322, 23 P.S. §§ 1005, 1011.</p>

I, however, do not believe that such a construction accurately reflects the legislative intent sought to be expressed. I am of the view that this language was employed to stress the viability of shared custody as an effective remedy in many of these cases. The concept of shared custody, either physical or legal, offers the trial court the flexibility to maximize the available positive input a natural parent can offer to the rearing of his or her offspring. Where both parents are fit, exhibit a desire to share in a continuing involvement with the child, and are capable of setting aside their personal differences to communicate and cooperate in promoting the best interest of the child, that opportunity should be fully exploited. It is my view that the <em>“at any time” </em>language employed in section 5310 was merely to direct the court’s attention to considering the possibility of <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>shared custody whenever it was appropriately called upon to reevaluate a previous custody order. I still maintain that it is only appropriate to reevaluate an existing order where the change of circumstances would dictate such action. Repetitive and frivolous assaults upon an existing custody arrangement undercut the security necessary to establish a supportive environment for the rearing of the child and therefore undermine the best interests of the child.</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.5",316,[238,753,1153,418]]]'>I joined in the result reached in <em>Karis </em>because the record established that the trial court did find a “substantial Change in circumstances” before proceeding to reexamine the prior order. I noted in my concurring opinion my disagreement with the view that section 5310 requires that we discard the former threshold requirement. <em>Karis, </em><a href="/pa/518/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="518 Pa. 601" data-case-ids="1811621" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0601-01">518 Pa. at 609-10</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="518 Pa. 601" data-case-ids="1811621" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0601-01">544 A.2d at 1333</a>.

    <p id="b316-6" data-blocks='[["BL_316.6",316,[232,1190,1156,903]]]'>Here the majority compounds its error in <em>Karis </em>by using it as decisional authority in a procedural posture where section 5310 has no applicability. In this matter, the court had given Martin S. Jaindl “primary physical custody” of his six-year-old son Brian. The initial order had also provided that the child’s mother was to have “partial physical custody” during specified hours of each weekday and on alternate weekends. Upon a petition for modification filed by the mother, the court transferred custody to the mother and gave the father only visitation rights. The court noted that each of the parents would provide a “loving and caring environment” and that the “equities” of the matter were “extremely close.” The Superior Court, on review, concluded that the record did not demonstrate a “substantial change in circumstances” that would warrant the entertaining of the petition for modification and on that basis reversed the order, thereby reinstating the initial order.</p>
    <p id="b316-7" data-blocks='[["BL_316.7",316,[232,2112,1151,257]],["BL_317.1",317,[219,316,1152,360]]]'>Although this situation does not fall within section 5310, which speaks only of modification <em>“to” </em>an order of <em>“shared custody”, </em>the majority nonetheless relies upon <em>Karis </em>as its basis for concluding that the threshold inquiry is no longer necessary to consider the merits of petitions for modifica<a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>tion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Thus the unstated result of this Court’s reversal is to signal the bar of this Commonwealth that petitions for modification of custody orders may be entertained at any time without regard to whether there have been any material changes which would warrant a reevaluation.

If the majority’s response is due to their disagreement with the Superior Court’s conclusion that the record did not establish a “substantial change of circumstances” to warrant entertaining the petition, I concede that there could be merit in the majority’s position on that issue. In such case, the appropriate response would have been to reverse that finding and remand the matter to the Superior Court to review the lower court’s order as to the best interests of the child.</p>
