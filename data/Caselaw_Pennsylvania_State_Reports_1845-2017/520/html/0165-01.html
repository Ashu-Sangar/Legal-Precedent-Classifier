A criminal complaint charging Leroy Johnson, Appellee, with rape (18 Pa.C.S. § 3121), statutory rape (18 Pa.C.S. § 3122), and related offenses was filed on September 13, 1983. The complaint alleged that over a period of time beginning in the Fall of 1977 up to and including August of 1980, Appellee sexually assaulted and raped the minor daughter of a woman with whom he lived during that same period. Effective less than two years after the last alleged rape, by Act of May 13, 1982, P.L. 417, No. 122, Section 1(b), effective in 60 days (“Act 122”), the legislature amended 42 Pa.C.S. § 5552 to extend the statute of limitations for rape, and other major offenses, from two to five years. “A prosecution for any of the following offenses must be commenced within five years after it is committed: ____”</p>

We look first to the terms of the statute, itself, for guidance. By way of Act 122 of 1982, the Pennsylvania legislature amended 42 Pa.C.S. § 5552(b), such that a prosecution for theft must be commenced within five years after it is committed. Act of May 13, 1982, P.L. 417, No. 122. This amendment became effective July 12, 1982. <em><a href="/pa-super/349/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="349 Pa.

The legislature did not specify whether, once effective, the Act was to be applied to thefts occurring before July 12, 1982 or only to thefts occurring on or after its effective date. The Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1501 <em>et seq, </em>provides that no statute shall be construed to be retroactive “unless clear<a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>ly and manifestly so intended by the General Assembly.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1926.</blockquote>

In <em>Duffy, </em>the Act of March 23, 1877, extending the statute of limitations on misdemeanor forgeries from two to five years (the statute on felony forgeries was already five years) read as follows: “That hereafter the offence of forgery, whether the same be a misdemeanor or a felony, shall not be held barred by the Statute of Limitations, when the indictment therefor shall be brought or exhibited within five years next after the offence has been committed.” <a href="/pa/96/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="96 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="494638" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0506-01">96 Pa. at 506</a>. The crime of the defen<a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>dant in that case occurred on or about September 25, 1875. Hence, the statute in question extending the limitations period from two to five years became effective after the crime was committed but before the initial two year period had run. This Court reversed what amounted at the time to a discharge of the defendant. At page 514 of his opinion in that case, Mr. Justice Green stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.5",335,[275,708,1112,1466]]]'>At the time the Act of 1877 was passed, the defendant was not free from conviction by force of the two years’ limitation of the Act of 1860. He therefore had acquired no <em>right </em>to an acquittal on that ground. Now an act of limitation is an act of grace purely on the part of the legislature. Especially is this the case in the matter of criminal prosecutions. The state makes no <em>contract </em>with criminals, at the time of the passage of an act of limitation, that they shall have immunity from punishment if not prosecuted within the statutory period. Such enactments are measures of public policy only. They are entirely subject to the mere will of the legislative power, and may be changed or repealed altogether, as that power may see fit to declare. Such being the character of this kind of legislation, we hold that in any case where a right to acquittal has not been absolutely acquired by the completion of the period of limitation, that period is subject to enlargement or repeal without being obnoxious to the constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. A law enlarging or repealing a statutory bar against criminal prosecutions may, therefore, apply as well to past as to future cases if its terms include both classes. Such legislation relates to the remedy only and not to any property right or contract right. The Act of 1877 in the present case was legally operative to enlarge the period of limitation as to the defendant, he having acquired no right of acquittal by virtue of the previous limitation at the time of the passage of the act____</blockquote>
