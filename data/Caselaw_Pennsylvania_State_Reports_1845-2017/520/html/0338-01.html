Prior to the Act of 1913, death sentences were carried out by means of hanging rather than electrocution. As stated in <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, we are not persuaded by appellant’s argument that the introductory language contained in the Act of 1913, to wit, the first clause of 61 Pa.S. § 2121, supra, insofar as it recites that every person convicted of murder of the first degree shall be sentenced to death, constitutes a mandatory sentencing provision.

See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1936 (statute latest in enactment must prevail). In light of these statutory modifications, the Act of 1913 must be read as if amended to state: “Every person convicted of the crime of murder of the first degree, and sentenced to death thereon, shall be executed in the manner herein provided, and not otherwise.” This comports, too, with a presumption the legislature would not have enacted valid death penalty <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>sentencing procedures, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711, without having in place a method for carrying out sentences of death. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (presumption legislature does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable). In short, the legislature has removed the challenged provision from operation prior to there being any occasion for this Court to address its validity.

It follows, therefore, that the jury was not unconstitutionally restricted in its consideration of mitigating factors. Evidence, to the extent any was introduced, relating to factors recited above such as emotional crisis, marital disharmony, and lack of prior criminal convictions would plainly have been subject to full consideration as elements of the other mitigating circumstances set forth in the jury instructions. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2), (3), (5) (addressing extreme mental and emotional factors); 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8) (“Any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.”); 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1) (lack of significant history of prior criminal convictions).</p>

For example, it is claimed that evidence should have been introduced that appellant was a member of the 4H Club and the Lions Club. In view of the seriousness of this crime and the extent of other evidence of character and record presented for the jury’s consideration, it is inconceivable that appellant’s club memberships could have affected his sentence. Similarly, it is asserted that counsel failed to present evidence that one <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>of appellant’s children had been killed in an automobile accident nearly two years before the present murder, yet examination of the record reveals that this evidence was indeed introduced during the guilt determination phase of trial. (N.T. 1046, 1102). During the penalty phase of trial, counsel moved for admission of all of the defense evidence from the guilt phase. Evidence regarding the death of appellant’s child, as well as additional evidence pertaining to appellant’s character, reputation, and marital relationship thereby came before the jury for consideration. With regard to his marital relationship, appellant claims evidence in mitigation could have been offered that his wife, the victim in this murder, had been having extramarital affairs. Such evidence would have been of little worth, since there was already evidence in the record that appellant and his wife suffered serious marital problems, and, further, the evidence would have appeared preposterous to the jury and would have undermined appellant’s credibility since appellant himself had testified during the guilt determination phase that he was certain that his wife never engaged in extramarital affairs.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[236,1510,1152,528]]]'>It is also claimed that the jury should have been informed that one of appellant’s co-conspirators, who fired the fatal shot in this murder, received only a sentence of life imprisonment.

The prosecutor did not say that the co-conspirators <em>would </em>have invoked the Fifth Amendment, but rather stated that there were a <em>number </em>of reasons for his reluctance to call the co-conspirators to the stand, and that just one of those reasons was the possibility that they <em>might </em>assert their Fifth Amendment rights. Further, the prosecutor’s comment was merely a response to defense counsel’s closing argument in which it was inferred that the prosecution had an obligation to produce the co-conspirators’ testimony.

The Act of 1860, section 75, fixed the punishment for murder at death and provided for hanging as the means of executing the sentence. Both the 1860 Act and the Act of 1913 fixed the punishment for murder in the first degree at death. However, the Act of 1913 changed the means of execution from hanging to electrocution. It was not until the Act of 1925 that the punishment was fixed at either death or life imprisonment as the jury may determine.</p>
