Brief for Amicus Curiae at 11 n. 9. This is a distinction without substance, as both the defendant and the Commonwealth have the right to appeal the legality of a sentence, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9781(a), and the illegal sentence <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>imposed in this case would certainly have been corrected on appeal. Moreover, it has long been the opinion of a dissenting segment of this Court that an illegal sentence is a legal nullity, and sentencing courts must have the authority to correct such a sentence even if that means increasing the sentence. <em>See Brown, supra </em>(Nix, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant also claims that 1) his guilty plea was not voluntary in that he was confused and fearful, did not understand of what a negotiated plea consisted and acted at the direction of counsel without knowledge or understanding of what he was doing; 2) the negotiated plea bargain was not fulfilled by the sentencing court in that appellant was allegedly never told that he could be sentenced to a consecutive term of probation; and 3) he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in that counsel did not object to the voluntariness of the plea, the "unfulfilled" negotiated plea bargain, and the "illegal" sentence imposed. Appellant did not file a motion to withdraw his plea, thus the first two issues have been waived. <em>Commonwealth v. Lee, </em><a href="/pa/460/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="460 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="482725" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0324-01">460 Pa. 324</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="460 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="482725" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0324-01">333 A.2d 749</a> (1975). As these two issues were also raised, however, within the context of a claim of the ineffectiveness of counsel, we will address their merits.</p>
      <p id="b556-6" data-blocks='[["BL_556.6",556,[267,1600,1120,784]]]'>A review of the guilty plea colloquy reveals that appellant was extensively questioned by his attorney, the prosecutor and the sentencing court regarding his knowledge and understanding of the terms of his plea bargain, the voluntariness of his plea, the consequences of his plea, and his satisfaction with counsel’s representation of him. Similarly, the record does not support appellant’s claim that he was not told that he would be sentenced to a consecutive term of probation under the terms of the negotiated plea bargain. Appellant was told twice during the colloquy that, under the plea bargain, he could be sentenced to a consecutive term of probation. Guilty Plea and Sentencing Transcript at 12 and 25-26 (May 28, 1985). When the court sentenced appellant to a consecutive three year term of probation, therefore, the court did <em>not </em>depart from the negotiated plea agreement as alleged by appellant. In order to prevail upon a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel, there must be merit to the underlying claim. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a> (1987). Because there is no merit to any of appellant’s claims, we find that appellant’s counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the voluntariness of appellant’s plea, the “unfulfilled” negotiated plea bargain, or the "illegal" sentence imposed.</p>

The original sentences imposed by the trial judge violated the provision of the Sentencing Code which requires a minimum sentence of confinement which does not exceed one-half of the maximum sentence imposed, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9756(b). Recognizing that the original sentences of forty-eight to sixty-four months violated this statutory provision, the trial judge acted correctly in sua sponte conforming the sentences imposed to that which he had intended. Because the original sentences as stated were illegal, the Appellant and the Commonwealth had the statutory right to appeal the legality of the sentence. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9781(a).</p>

We noted that the United States Supreme Court had held in <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em><a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">449 U.S. 117</a>, <a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">101 S.Ct. 426</a>, <a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">66 L.Ed.2d 328</a> (1980) that the principles of double jeopardy are not violated where punishment pursuant to a statute is clear and explicit and the statute would permit an increased sentence on appeal. Because the sentencing provisions of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731 are mandatory and the Commonwealth has the right of appeal to the Superior Court under § 3731(e)(4) from the imposition of any sentence which does not meet those provisions, we held that a defendant could not have an expectation of finality in a sentence which was improper under § 3731. No violation of a defendant’s double jeopardy rights could be found because the Commonwealth had the statutory right to appeal from an improper sentence.</p>

      <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Sojourner </em>in that the trial judge was not required to impose a particular penalty for the crimes charged to which the Appellant plead guilty. For this reason, I find the majority’s reliance upon our holding in <em>Sojourner </em>as authority for its broad statement that, “Thus, there can be no constitutional bar in this jurisdiction to an increase in sentence after service of the sentence has begun.”, (Majority opinion at 389), is a misinterpretation of that holding.</p>
