Weiskerger <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>was sentenced to a term of three years’ probation. Clapps was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of six to twenty-three and one-half months, and a consecutive probation of one year.

    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[242,582,1159,1444]]]'>The facts presented at trial are as follows. Walter Placek (Placek) was a member of the majority faction of the Wyoming Area School Board during the years preceding the general election of November, 1979. His wife, Barbara, a nurse, was employed at the county nursing home, Valley Crest, as a Coordinator of Program Development, an administrative position. Appointments to positions at the nursing home were under the control of the County Institution District, which is composed of the county commissioners. Appellee Weiskerger was treasurer of the local Republican party organization and he was politically allied with appellee Clapps who was vice-chairman of the local Democratic party organization and a member of the Exeter Borough Council. Four new school directors from the ticket endorsed by Clapps were elected in November, 1979. A change of county commissioners also occurred as a result of the election. Placek, a holdover board member, testified at trial that in January, 1980, he was approached by Weiskerger who wanted to know if Placek would be willing to join the four new directors in forming a new majority coalition which would give that group control of the nine-member Board of School Directors. Placek further testified that Weiskerger told him that Clapps might be able to guarantee Placek’s wife’s retention of her position at the Valley Crest nursing home by exercising influence with the new county commissioners because at that time positions at that facility were being abolished.</p>

That equipment, and a bodywire used by Placek to record a meeting with Clapps, produced the tapes <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>and transcripts which were used by the Commonwealth at trial. It was during the meeting with Clapps that Placek elicited Clapps’ offer to intercede with the new county commissioners to preserve Barbara Placek’s job in exchange for Placek’s agreement to switch his allegiance to the Clapps faction on the school board. Placek did not vote with that faction as required by the terms of the offer. Later, his wife’s position at the nursing home was abolished, and she was offered a position as a full-time nurse, a position for which she was qualified and which paid more than the position she had been filling. She declined, and, in April, 1981, she initiated a suit against appellees, Hudock and others in federal court for alleged civil rights violations.</p>
    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[187,1027,1157,940]]]'>When the within prosecution commenced, appellees pled not guilty. At trial they did not testify, nor did they offer any other evidence. Counsel for appellees developed facts through cross-examination which showed that Placek may have benefited at a time prior to the incidents at issue herein by a change of allegiance from a minority to a majority coalition on the board. It was shortly after that conversion that Placek’s wife received her initial appointment at the nursing home. In addition, Placek himself had received a consultant’s position and two part-time teaching assignments following this earlier switch. It was also made clear to the jury that Placek had served the FBI in an “enthusiastic manner”, performing his role as an FBI “recruit” like a “zealot.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> Counsel for appellees used these facts in an attempt to portray Placek’s behavior as that of a corrupted individual whose interests would be served both politically and monetarily (through his wife’s civil suit) by the convictions of appellees.</p>

That court vacated the judgments <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>of sentence and granted a new trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

Such indeed is their obligation. It does mean that in holding out inducements they should act in such a manner as is likely to induce to the commission of crime only these persons and not others who would normally avoid crime____ <em>This test shifts attention from the record and predisposition of the particular defendants to the conduct of the police and the likelihood, objectively considered, that it would entrap only those ready and willing to commit crime.” </em><a href="/us/356/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="356 U.S. 369" data-case-ids="6163723" data-case-paths="/us/356/0369-01">356 U.S. at 383-384</a>, <a href="/us/356/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="356 U.S. 369" data-case-ids="6163723" data-case-paths="/us/356/0369-01">78 S.Ct. at 826</a>. Thus, the test for entrapment has shifted in emphasis from a consideration of a particular defendant’s readiness to commit crime, a subjective test, to an evaluation of the police conduct, an objective test, to determine whether there is a substantial risk that the offense will be committed by those innocently disposed. To determine whether an entrapment has been perpetrated in any particular case, therefore, the inquiry will focus on the conduct of the police and will not be concerned with the defendant’s prior criminal activity or other indicia of a predisposition to commit crime.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">7</a>

The language of subsection (b) which places the burden of proof on a defendant to prove that his or her conduct “occurred in response to an entrapment” does not indicate a legislative enunciation of a subjective test requiring that a defendant prove that he or she was not predisposed to commit crime. The burden of proof language was merely intended to explicitly place the burden of proof on the defendant to establish the defense of entrapment <em>as defined in subsection (a) </em>with its language focusing objectively on the conduct of the police officers. In addition, the objective test represents the more enlightened approach and fosters the constitutional ideal of equal justice for all.

The defense was not known at common law, but in one form or another has been universally accepted by the states through judicial decision and legislation. It is an affirmative or positive defense, in the nature of confession and avoidance, which must be raised by the defendant. <em>See generally </em>21 Am.Jur.2d <em>Criminal Law </em>§ 202 (1981). As a rule it is not an available defense to an offense which involves violent conduct; one cannot be heard that he was weak enough to agree to another’s injury. However, it exists for most other offenses. Its shortest definition of policy is that one ought not be induced or encouraged to do what he did not himself conceive or originate: there is enough crime without suggesting more to otherwise innocent persons merely to test their resistance to temptation.</p>

Immoral and or illegal police conduct is that at which the defense is directed. Although artifice and deceit in some measure are recognized as the only practical means of apprehending criminals in certain circumstances, the distinction between conduct that constitutes entrapment and that which does not lies in whether the conduct in question merely provided an opportunity to the defendant, as opposed to providing inducement to commit the act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
