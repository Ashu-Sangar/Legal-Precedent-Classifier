At issue here is whether the Wrongful Use of Civil Proceedings Act (“Act”) as set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8351-8354 is applicable to a complaint which was filed prior to the effective date of the Act, although not adjudicated until after the effective date of the Act. The critical facts are not in dispute. The Appellee, Mario Ludmer, is a medical doctor who was the treating physician for one of the Appellant’s clients in a personal injury lawsuit. In preparation for the litigation, the Appellant, Maurice A. Nernberg, Jr., had requested that Dr. Ludmer prepare a written report of his examination and a diagnosis of the client’s medical condition. Dr. Ludmer submitted a report and offered to testify at trial if necessary to clarify his position. During the personal injury trial, the defendant’s wife became ill, <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>resulting in the plaintiff instructing Nernberg to negotiate a settlement rather, than seeking a continuance.</p>
    <p id="b386-4" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[252,418,1152,631]]]'>After settling the personal injury action, the Appellant then commenced a lawsuit against the Appellee claiming that the Appellee did not properly cooperate with him in the preparation of the personal injury action and that he had interfered with the contractual relationship between the Appellant and his client. As a result of the Appellee’s actions, the Appellant alleged that he was forced to settle the personal injury action for less money. Following the completion of the discovery, the Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment which was granted. On appeal the Superior Court affirmed and we denied allocatur. <em>Nernberg v.

The trial court granted the preliminary objections and dismissed the Appellee’s complaint.

To support his position, the Appellant argues that under the Act the key element for establishing a cause of action is the wrongful initiation of a lawsuit. Since the underlying lawsuit filed by the Appellant against the Appellee was filed in March of 1979, the Act was not in existence and therefore the Appellant argues that the cause of action did not exist. To permit the current cause of action to continue would thus result in applying the Act to a cause of action which occurred two years prior to its existence. Thus, applying the Act to the case <em>sub judice </em>will result in a retroactive application of the Act.</p>

The Appellee’s cause of action did not accrue until such time as he successfully defeated the Appellant in his attempts to have the Appellee held legally liable. In this instance, that did not occur until we denied allocatur on September 14,1983. Having obtained a successful determination in the Appellant’s cause of action, Appellee had met, at least arguably, all the elements of a cause of action under the Act. Thus, the Act was not being applied retroactively to events occurring in March of 1979, but rather prospectively to events occurring in September of 1983. Therefore, there is no merit to the Appellant’s <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>contention that the Act is being impermissibly applied retroactively.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, </em><a href="/pa/471/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="471 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1725146" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0210-01">471 Pa. 210</a>, <a href="/pa/471/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="471 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1725146" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0210-01">369 A.2d 1271</a>, 1273 (1977). This principle, however, does not apply to the facts of the present case. This is simply not a situation where the statute is being applied prospectively even though some of the facts or conditions came into existence before its effective date. Here, prior to the enactment of 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8351, an essential fact or condition to a cause of action for malicious use of process, namely, an arrest of the person or a seizure of property did not exist as, a part of <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>Nernberg’s underlying lawsuit. Thus, no cause of action for malicious use of process could be maintained against Nernberg as a result of his filing the underlying action even though it may eventually terminate in favor of Ludmer.</p>
    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[241,524,1153,515]]]'>The statute, (42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8351) in effect, created a new and somewhat different cause of action by eliminating the arrest or seizure requirement as an element of the offense. Thus, a suit initiated in March of 1979 that could not become actionable regardless of an outcome in favor of the defendant, became potentially actionable in February of 1981 and the majority now applies the new standard to past, irreversible conduct which occurred almost two years before the statute became law. That amounts to improper retroactive application of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.6",392,[233,1057,1159,1304]],["BL_393.1",393,[218,337,1154,201]]]'>The majority is impressed with the fact that the underlying lawsuit was finally terminated on September 14, 1983, more than two years after the effective date of 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8351. This emphasis on the time of termination is misplaced. Under both the common law and the relevant statute, it is not the event of termination in favor of the person against whom the suit was brought that gives rise to a cause of action. If that were so, then anytime a defendant prevailed in a lawsuit, he would, as a result of the favorable termination, have an action for wrongful use of civil proceedings against the person who sued him. The termination of the lawsuit must be related back to the facts and circumstances existing at the time it was initiated. Thus, if A, as claimant, files suit against B, as defendant, and four years later the case is finally terminated in favor of B, this favorable termination in and of itself does not give rise to a cause of action for malicious or wrongful use of civil process in favor of B. It is necessary, in such a situation, to refer back to the circumstances of the initiation of the suit to determine if a cause of action exists. If at the time the suit was commenced the common law was the prevailing law, as it was in March of 1979, then it is to the requirements of the common law that we must look. Under the common law, if the initiation of a lawsuit involved the lack of probable cause and malice, and an arrest of the <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>person or a seizure of property, it was those circumstances coupled with termination in favor of the person against whom the suit was brought that gave rise to a cause of action for malicious use of civil process.</p>
    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[219,556,1151,255]]]'>When Nernberg filed the underlying lawsuit against Ludmer, the actions he took at that time could not make him subject to a suit for malicious use of civil process even though his suit may terminate in favor of Ludmer. This was true even if he brought the suit with malice.</p>
    <blockquote id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[261,825,1111,309]]]'>“[A] mere suit, however malicious or unfounded, cannot be made the ground of an action for damages.
