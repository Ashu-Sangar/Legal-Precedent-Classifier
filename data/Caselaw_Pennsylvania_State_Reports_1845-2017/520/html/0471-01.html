In her appeal the appellant frames two issues: (1) whether our decision in <em>Hack v. Hack, </em><a href="/pa/495/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="495 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1770722" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0300-01">495 Pa. 300</a>, <a href="/pa/495/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="495 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1770722" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0300-01">433 A.2d 859</a> (1981), abolishing the defense of interspousal immunity is to be given retroactive application; and (2) whether the duty of fair dealing and good faith requires an automobile insurer to properly advise its insured of the insured’s entitlement to present a claim or claims under the applicable policy where the insurer advises its insured that legal representation is unnecessary and induces the insured to rely upon the insurer to pay appropriate benefits?</p>
    <p id="b639-6" data-blocks='[["BL_639.7",639,[207,1403,1154,576]]]'>The issues presented by the appellant arise out of the following factual background: On the morning of July 21, 1980, the appellant was riding as a passenger in an automobile being operated by her husband, David R. Dercoli. The automobile was travelling on U.S. Route 422 in Lawrence County when, apparently, Mr. Dercoli became drowsy and fell asleep. With Mr. Dercoli asleep at the wheel, the automobile crossed over the centerline of the highway and crashed into the rear wheels of an on-coming tractor-trailer. Mr. Dercoli was killed instantly. The appellant was severely injured.</p>

Subsequently, after receiving the advice of the appellees’ agents, the appellant began to receive certain benefits paid by the appellees under the policies in force.

After argument on appellees’ demurrer, the lower court concluded that the appellee-insurers had no duty to inform appellant of the <em>Hack </em>decision and the effect, if any, that decision had on appellee’s ability to obtain benefits under the liability provisions of the applicable policies. In reaching this conclusion the lower court cited the case of <em>Taglianetti v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board, </em><a href="/pa/503/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="503 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1785923" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0270-01">503 Pa. 270</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="503 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1785923" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0270-01">469 A.2d 548</a> (1983) involving a workmen’s compensation claimant. The lower court analogized the situation in the instant case to that involved in <em>Taglianetti. </em>It was decided that the reasoning applied in <em>Taglianetti </em>which held that the insured-employer had no duty to advise a compensation claimant of the maximum possible benefits was applicable to this case. Accordingly, the demurrer was sustained and appellant’s complaint was dismissed. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed. <a href="/pa-super/369/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="369 Pa.

    <p id="b643-4" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[184,760,1159,1179]]]'>In spite of the fact that appellant was assured by appellees’ agents that they would see to it that appellant received all benefits to which she was entitled, appellees’ agents failed to advise her of her right to seek liability damages. The appellant argues that this failure was a breach of appellees’ duty of fair dealing and good faith. In addition, appellant argues that when <em>Hack </em>abolished the bar of interspousal immunity, a conflict of interest arose with the appellees’ agents who were advising the appellant. On the one hand these agents were aware of appellant’s injuries and expenses and of her reliance on them for advice and guidance in her claims. On the other hand they knew that if they would advise appellant of the <em>Hack </em>decision and of her right to proceed against her husband’s estate for damages, such proceedings would substantially increase the financial exposure of the appellee-insurers. Nonetheless, the appellees’ agents continued to deal with the appellant on the same basis and continued to permit her to rely on them for all that she was entitled to under the policies. Considering all of the well-pleaded material facts in appellant’s complaint and the reasonably deducible inferences therefrom, we believe that the appellant’s arguments have merit.</p>
    <p id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.6",643,[182,1962,1170,421]],["BL_644.1",644,[225,320,1161,1623]]]'>We have long recognized that: “the utmost fair dealing should characterize the transactions between an insurance company and the insured.” <em>Fedas v. Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/300/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="300 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1125909" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0555-01">300 Pa. 555</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.%20285" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="151 A. 285">151 A. 285</a> (1930). The appellees’ agents in this case voluntarily. undertook to provide assistance and advice to appellant and in the process advised her against retaining independent legal counsel.

The duty of an insurance company to deal with the insured fairly and in good faith includes the duty of full and complete disclosure as to all of the benefits and every coverage that is provided by the applicable policy or policies along with all requirements, including any time limitations for making a claim. <em>See: Gatlin v. Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Co., </em><a href="/sw2d/741/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="741 S.W.2d 324" data-case-ids="9971812" data-case-paths="/sw2d/741/0324-01">741 S.W.2d 324</a> (Tenn. 1987). <em>See also: Sarchett v.

This is especially true where the insurer undertakes to advise and counsel the insured in the insured’s claim for benefits. Under such circumstances, the insurer has a duty to inform the insured of all benefits and coverage that may be available and of any potential adverse interest pertaining to the insurer’s liability under the applicable policy. When <em>Hack </em>was decided and the defense of interspousal immunity was abolished, an adverse interest pertaining to appellees’ financial exposure arose. Consistent with the obligation of fair dealing and good faith the appellees had a duty to inform the appellant of their conflict of interest, and of her apparent right to damages against her deceased husband’s estate which ultimately would be payable under the liability provisions of the policies that insured the decedent. The appellees’ failure to so inform the appellant was a breach of the duty of fair dealing and good faith. Assuring the appellant at the outset that she need not hire an independent attorney and that she would receive all that she was entitled to receive, and then failing to inform her of her apparent right to damages following the <em>Hack </em>decision is hardly dealing with appellant fairly and in good faith.</p>

Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board, </em><a href="/pa/503/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="503 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1785923" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0270-01">503 Pa. 270</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="503 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1785923" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0270-01">469 A.2d 548</a> (1983), argue that they had no affirmative duty to advise the appellant of the <em>Hack </em>decision and her ostensible right to file a claim for damages on which appellees would ultimately be liable. <em>Taglianetti </em>involved a claim for survivor’s benefits under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended. The claimant’s <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>husband had died of a fatal heart attack while in the course of his employment. The claimant requested information of her husband’s employer as to any widow’s benefits due her. She was not advised as to all possible benefits that she may claim. When she eventually learned of an additional claim available to her, the time limitation for that claim had expired. This Court held that the employer had no affirmative duty to apprise the claimant of all available benefits. (Larsen J. filed a dissenting opinion which was joined by Roberts, J.). We believe that <em>Taglianetti </em>was wrongly decided in that the decision in that case tends to relieve insurers and similar entities of the obligation to deal fairly, honestly, openly and in good faith with lay-claimants and non-experts who may be entitled to benefits and who are the very people the insurers have obligated themselves to protect.</p>
    <p id="b645-4" data-blocks='[["BL_645.5",645,[192,1199,1159,1165]]]'>The remaining issue raised in this case is whether <em>Hack v.

That is to say, did the abolition of the defense of interspousal immunity as promulgated in <em>Hack </em>apply to appellant whose claim arose out of an accident that occurred approximately one year prior to the <em>Hack </em>decision? Neither the trial court nor the Superior Court addressed this question in that each court found no duty to inform on the part of the appellees. Since, however, we have concluded that the appellees breached their duty of fair dealing and good faith in failing to inform the appellant of her apparent right to seek damages after the <em>Hack </em>decision, we are constrained to consider this issue. If <em>Hack </em>does not apply to appellant’s claim, that decision would be of no benefit to her. It would follow then that the appellees’ failure to inform appellant of <em>Hack </em>would not constitute a breach of their obligations toward her. If, however, <em>Hack </em>applies to appellant’s claim, then the failure on the part of the appellees to inform appellant of that decision would amount to a breach of fair dealing and good faith in that she was denied a claim to which she was entitled.</p>

The <em>Hack </em>decision eliminated the defense of interspousal immunity which acted as a bar to suit when one was injured at the hands of a negligent spouse. At the time of the <em>Hack </em>decision appellant’s claim was well within the applicable statute of limitations. Thus, with the bar removed and the claim being viable and within the time limitations, it would be unfair to continue the bar as to the appellant. Further, there is no equity favoring the appellees’ position that would dictate the opposite conclusion.</p>

First, I wish to disassociate myself from the pronouncement made in that opinion to the effect that <em>Taglianetti v.

This case involves a duty voluntarily assumed by an insurer; <em>Taglianetti </em>presented a stituation where we held that by law no duty to inform exists or may be imposed on an employer. Both legally and factually, the two cases are distinct. If <em>Taglianetti, </em>so recently decided, is unsound, this is neither the time nor the place to say so.

Mr. Justice Flaherty’s dissent, if it became law, would snatch from a poor widow the benefits she was entitled to receive but for the knowing and intentional misguidance of the insurers that induced her to place her entire trust and confidence in the insurers to see to it that she received all of the benefits to which she was entitled. Once the insurers knowingly and purposefully talked the widow out of seeking independent legal counsel, the insurers voluntarily placed themselves in the position of protecting the widow and obtaining for her all benefits that were reasonably due under the facts and state of law known to the insurers.</p>

On the contrary, in this case, the insurers themselves voluntarily transformed themselves into legal advisors to the widow. This accommodation offered by the insurer would certainly inure to the monetary benefit of <em>both </em>parties. Unless the dissenting opinion is suggesting that legal representation <em>per se </em>harms the interests of widows, orphans and others similarly situated, I believe that the approach cutlined in the majority opinion will benefit everyone. After all, the law does not favor a volunteer. It is simple black letter law that where one gratuitously undertakes to render legal or other services and then does so in a careless or negligent way, causing harm, liability attaches. <em>Pascarella v.

Until today an insurance company on the facts pleaded in this case has had no <em>fiduciary </em>duty to an insured, even when it advised its insured that he does not need a lawyer. But if, under the guise of “fair dealing and good faith,” we are now to decide that insurance companies have a fiduciary duty to advise of every possible claim, surely insurance companies will cease even to talk to claimants for fear of breaching this new judicially declared duty. However, with such a duty, if they do continue to talk to claimants, what will their obligations be? Are they obligated to advise of innovative claims against themselves? Are they obligated to inform claimants of an improbable but perhaps conceivable claim that they themselves would not agree to pay? Are they, as in this case, obligated to be on the lookout for changes in the law which might be favorable to a claimant? Until today, insurance companies have had none of these obligations.</p>

It has always been the case that insurance companies, insureds and claimants are potential adversaries. An insured knows or should know this upon entering into an insurance contract, and a <em>contract </em>is what it is. When a loss occurs, it has always been the prerogative of an insurance company to make offers of settlement, and it has always been the prerogative of the insured to accept or reject them. Whether to accept or reject the offer, however, is a decision that only the claimant can make. If for some reason, the offer does not satisfy him, he is perfectly <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>free to seek independent legal counsel, notwithstanding advice to the contrary by the insurance company. To change this traditional underlying arrangement, to transform insurance companies into legal advisors for claimants, is unprecedented. In sum, I cannot believe that the approach outlined in the majority opinion will benefit anyone, and in the long run it will certainly harm the interests of those it seeks to protect.</p>
