I disagree, however, that Section 503(a)(4) requires that the Commonwealth refund to the appellee, First National Bank of Fredericksburg (First National Bank), bank shares taxes paid by it for five years prior to 1983. To establish its entitlement to a refund, First National Bank must show that the Commonwealth is not entitled to the shares taxes paid by the bank. Under the circumstances of this case, it is necessary to establish that the Commonwealth is not entitled to the bank shares tax because that tax was invalid as declared by this Court in <em>Dale National Bank v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/502/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="502 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1784530" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0170-01">502 Pa. 170</a>, <a href="/pa/502/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="502 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1784530" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0170-01">465 A.2d 965</a> (1983). Where, however, a court holds that a tax that was paid to the Commonwealth is invalid, but also holds that its ruling of invalidity is to have prospective effect only, then the invalidity and entitlement to refunds would only apply to future levies and collections. A court decision that is applied prospectively only does not invalidate that which happened in the past. <em>See Linkletter v. Walker, </em><a href="/us/381/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="381 U.S. 618" data-case-ids="6172443" data-case-paths="/us/381/0632-01">381 U.S. 618</a>, <a href="/us/381/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="381 U.S. 618" data-case-ids="6172443" data-case-paths="/us/381/0632-01">85 S.Ct. 1731</a>, <a href="/us/381/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="381 U.S. 618" data-case-ids="6172443" data-case-paths="/us/381/0632-01">14 L.Ed.2d 601</a> (1965).

For years Pennsylvania relied upon the established interpretation of the bank shares tax in imposing taxes on banks to meet a significant portion of the Commonwealth’s annual budget. Conversely, no inequity or hardship results to the bank by a purely prospective application of the new rule. In the face of “firmly embedded” law, no bank could claim that it relied upon a reduction in the share tax liability because of its ownership of federal obligations prior to July, 1983. Retroactive application of <em>Dale </em>mandating refunds of the bank shares taxes paid would cause a hardship on the Commonwealth and provide the bank with an undeserved windfall. In short, the Commonwealth reasonably relied upon a pre<a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>sumptively valid tax as a significant source of income to balance annual budgets. To apply <em>Dale </em>retroactively and require the refunds sought would result in severe financial hardship to the Commonwealth. Thus, all three factors lead directly to the conclusion that <em>Dale </em>should be applied prospectively. Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

The majority concludes that: “A taxpayer thus has a right to a refund under section 503(a)(4) [of the Fiscal Code] if two conditions are met: (1) The petition must be filed within five years of the settlement or payment of the tax, and (2) the taxpayer must prove that a court of competent jurisdiction has held, since the payment of the tax, that the statute under which payment was made had been erroneously interpreted.” (P. 942.) The second condition stated by the majority must be qualified to the extent that the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction declaring the tax invalid must have retroactive application.</p>
