The facts are as follows: After inconclusive proceedings before a district justice and an arbitration panel, Appellant-landlord brought an action of ejectment against the Appellee-tenant. Appellants (sometimes collectively referred to hereafter as the “Landlord”) sought to evict Appellee on the basis of her forfeiture of a residential lease due to non-payment of rent and failure to comply with provisions in the lease regarding prompt payment of rent. The Landlord’s housing project, Bethlehem Township I, which contains the premises that are the subject of the instant appeal, is a housing project heavily subsidized by the federal government pursuant to provisions of the National Housing Act, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201715-7" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 U.S.C. § 1715-7">12 U.S.C. § 1715-7</a>(d)(3). Appellee-tenant’s leasehold was specifically subsidized through a Special Allocation under § 8 of the National Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1437f, as a result of which the Landlord is compelled to calculate the tenant’s portion of the rent pursuant to the terms of the Act and the imple<a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>menting HUD Regulations (<a href="/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20881" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="24 C.F.R. § 881">24 C.F.R. § 881</a>) and Handbooks, and to abide by other restrictions and limitations pursuant thereto.</p>

In the other two cases, voluntary stipulations were entered into granting the Landlord conditional judgments for possession and back rent in certain amounts, with payments on the back rent to be liquidated by modest additional monthly payments. However, in the instant matter, the parties were unable to agree on a figure of back rent due. The Landlord argued that $1,476.00 was due, but Appellee contended that only $163.00 was due and owing. Appellee argued that she was entitled to a large reduction in back rent because of a period of unemployment. The matter was therefore tried before Judge Grifo, <em>inter alia, </em>to interpret the relevant federal regulations on these issues.</p>

The verdict was in terms which were almost identical to the language agreed to by the parties in the stipulations in the other two cases. The court found that the back rent due was $1,261.00 and Appellee was ordered to liquidate this sum by making payments of $25.00 extra monthly on her rent. Judge Grifo also granted judgment to the Landlord for possession, but this was conditioned upon Appellee’s non-payment of the extra $25.00 per month due, together with current rent on or before the fifteenth day of every month. “In the event that payment is not received by the 15th day of each month, [Landlord] shall have the right to file an affidavit of default, and file a praecipe for writ of execution for possession and of money judgment.” (See, Appendix 1, p. 7 of Appellants’ brief.) Judge Grifo found authority to grant this conditional verdict under Pa.R.C.P. 1056(b), one of the rules governing “Actions of Ejectment,” which rule provides: “A conditional verdict may be entered in an appropriate case,”</p>

Appellee further asserts that a Motion to Stay the Writs of Possession was filed and, after hearing, by order of Judge Grifo dated January 23, 1987, the motion was denied, and that on February 5, 1987, Appellee filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition which was dismissed on December 17, 1987.

Pa.R.C.P. 3162(b)(2) and 3170(d)(3) permit a court to stay or set aside a writ of possession entered consequent to an action of ejectment “upon any other legal or equitable ground.” Pa.R.C.P. 1056(b), quoted above and directly at issue here, does expressly permit the entry of a conditional verdict in an ejectment action in an “appropriate case.” The proper question to be addressed on this appeal, therefore, is not whether the trial court has equitable power (it does!), or whether this is an action at law or in equity, but rather whether this is an “appropriate case” in which to exercise such equitable power specifically authorized by Rule, or whether, on the contrary, the exercise of such power here constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>

Appellee never acquired any “equity” interest in the leasehold property in the way that a purchaser under a mortgage or an installment land sales contract does. By making periodic payments on a mortgage or installment contract, the purchaser may be said to gradually acquire the fee as he or she pays off the “mortgage” loan. Historically, foreclosure was an equitable proceeding that developed out of the need to protect such purchasers from forfeiting their equity or investment, acquired over a period of years, because of a single minor or technical deficiency in their performance.

It would not be proper today for a court to order the equivalent of strict foreclosure forfeiting in its entirety of a borrower’s substantial investment or equity interest which he or she built up in a piece of real estate, simply because of a minor breach or a delinquent payment. The borrower would have to be given some chance to “make good” or the property would be sold at a public sale where any excess realized over the balance due on the mortgage would go to the borrower. In other words, the court would enter the equivalent conditional verdict. But this is only required where there is, to begin with, some “equity” or equitable interest in the property entitled to protection.

Appellee preserves the argument that federal law entitled her to the “equitable” relief afforded here, but neither party has presented to this Court either briefs or research setting forth what substantive rights, if any, federal law bestows on Appellee here such that she would be entitled to the entry of a conditional verdict under our Rules. We will not speculate upon what those rights may be. To do so would appear to require a detailed review of federal law, the regulations thereunder, the HUD Handbooks, and possibly the legislative history as well. If the parties wish to continue this litigation, these issues should first be presented and argued before the trial court which should then weigh the arguments and render a decision analyzing federal law. If substantive federal law is found to be applicable here such that Appellee is entitled to a <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>grace period in order to make up back payments of rent, we think that principles of comity in our federal system would then permit Pa.R.C.P. 1056(b) to be employed to effectuate the entry of a conditional verdict.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In light of her assertion, noted above, that the landlord has acquired, during the course of this appeal, a valid and enforceable Writ of Possession against her, Appellee argues that this appeal is moot. Documents substantiating that contention concerning the Writ of Possession have not been filed with this Court, nor have they been made part of the record submitted to this Court. If, on remand, it appears that such a writ can and will be enforced without further objection or contest, the trial court will be fully competent to give the parties any further relief to which they may be entitled, consistent with this opinion.</p>
