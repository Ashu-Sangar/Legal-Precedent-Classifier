From November 19, 1991, to February 2, 1993 — the time period at issue in this case — Appellant was in custody serving his probation-violation sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> A review of the record from the underlying case <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>reveals that the basis for the probation revocation and corresponding sentence of incarceration pertaining to Appellant’s former offenses was the murder conviction. This raises the question whether Appellant was in custody during that period “as a result of the conduct on which [the murder] charge was based,” for purposes of Section 9760(1). If answered affirmatively, then to the extent Section 9760(1) applies to the present situation it requires that Appellant be given credit toward his murder sentence for the disputed time period of November 19, 1991, to February 2, 1993. This is so because Appellant was in custody on the probation-violation sentence as a result of the conduct underlying the murder charge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

Indeed, if sentencing on such offenses could occur simultaneously, ordinarily the sentencing court in its discretion would be able to effectuate concurrent sentencing. Barring any legislative prohibition of the same, it appears anomalous for the judiciary to craft a procedural rule precluding the sentencing court from effectuating such a result by the application of credit for time served in instances in which sentencing on one offense is delayed for reasons unrelated to the defendant’s conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>

The majority states that Appellant was in custody due to “unrelated parole violations.” In fact, the record from the underlying case strong<a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>ly suggests that Appellant had been on probation, not parole, and that the violation in question was not unrelated, but consisted of his murder conviction. The majority also stales that the difference between parole and probation is "of no moment” for purposes of the present case. When a prisoner is released on parole and then later incarcerated as a convicted parole violator, the remainder of his <em>original </em>sentence is reimposed. Perhaps for this reason, the Legislature has determined that a convicted parole violator must serve the balance of his original term before the new term of imprisonment commences. <em>See </em>61 P.S. § 331,21a(a). On the other hand, when a probationer commits an offense for which probation is revoked, a new sentence is imposed in place of the original sentence of probation. Under such circumstances, the sentencing court would appear to retain discretion to direct that the sentence for the new charge run concurrently with the probation-violation sentence. Accordingly, the majority's statement notwithstanding, that Appellant was sentenced following a violation of conditions of probation rather than parole is arguably relevant to the proper disposition of the instant proceedings.</p>

Other jurisdictions with similar statutes — i.e., statutes that allow for credit for pre-sentence incarceration resulting from the same charge for which the sentence was imposed, or a different charge based upon the same underlying conduct — have endorsed different standards of causation in situations similar to the present one. In <em>Schubert v. People, </em><a href="/p2d/698/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="698 P.2d 788" data-case-ids="10413905" data-case-paths="/p2d/698/0788-01">698 P.2d 788</a> (Colo. 1985), for example, the Colorado Supreme Court determined that a defendant is in custody "as a result of” the relevant conduct if there is a "substantial nexus" between such conduct and the pre-sentence restraint. <em>See <a href="/p2d/698/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="698 P.2d 788" data-case-ids="10413905" data-case-paths="/p2d/698/0788-01">id. </a></em><a href="/p2d/698/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="698 P.2d 788" data-case-ids="10413905" data-case-paths="/p2d/698/0788-01">at 795</a>. Under this test, where multiple concurrent sentences are ultimately imposed the defendant is entitled to credit against all such sentences so long as he would have been held in pre-sentence custody for the conduct underlying each one. The Supreme Court of California, by contrast, has settled on a more stringent "strict causation” test. <em>See People </em>v. <em>Bruner, <a href="/cal-4th/9/1178-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="9 Cal. 4th 1178" data-case-ids="1989387" data-case-paths="/cal-4th/9/1178-01">9 </a></em><a href="/cal-4th/9/1178-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="9 Cal. 4th 1178" data-case-ids="1989387" data-case-paths="/cal-4th/9/1178-01">Cal.4th 1178</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20534" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="40 Cal.

Under that standard, a defendant is entitled to credit for a pre-sentence period of imprisonment only if the conduct underlying the formal term of incarceration was a "but <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>for” cause of the earlier restraint. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=892%20P.2d%201277" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="892 P.2d 1277">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=892%20P.2d%201277" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="892 P.2d 1277">at 1286-87</a>. Presently, it need not be decided whether to adopt Colorado's lenient substantial-nexus test, California’s strict-causation rule, or some intermediate standard, as it is clear that, even under the strict “but for” test adopted by California, Appellant's confinement during the disputed time interval occurred "as a result of” the conduct upon which his subsequently imposed third-degree murder sentence was based.</p>
