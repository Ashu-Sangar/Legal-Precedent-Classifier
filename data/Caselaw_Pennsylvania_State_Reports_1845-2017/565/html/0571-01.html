Murphy, Jr., (“Murphy”), sued the Appellee, Duquesne University of the Holy Ghost (the “University”), for breach of the parties’ tenure contract. Murphy appeals from the order of the Superior Court affirming the trial court’s entry of summary judgment in the University’s favor. We granted allocatur to determine the applicable standard of review. We conclude that the standard of review that governs on appeal from the grant of a motion for summary judgment in any breach of contract action between private parties applies to Murphy’s claim. We also conclude that the University is entitled to summary judgment, albeit for reasons that differ from those relied upon by the court below. Accordingly, we affirm the Superior Court’s order.</p>

      <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>The material, undisputed facts of record are as follows. The University is a private, ecumenically-oriented, Catholic institution established in 1878 by the Fathers of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost and of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. According to Section 2 of the University’s Faculty Handbook as prepared in 1986 (the “Faculty Handbook”), the University’s stated mission is to prepare its students “intellectually, professionally, aesthetically, spiritually, and ethically for the ordinary responsibilities of life and for leadership in a free, complex, and changing society.....” Its goals as stated therein are to: offer undergraduate students a well-rounded and broad education; enable students to develop an expertise in certain disciplines; prepare advanced students for careers; preserve the record of human thought; engage students in the discussion and study of religious and ethical values, “especially those of the Judaeo-Christian tradition in its Catholic dimension”; maintain an institution which is responsive to the needs of the community; and create an atmosphere appropriate to a moderately-sized community of scholars which encourages close faculty-student relationships.</p>
    <p id="b736-6" data-blocks='[["BL_736.4",736,[257,1405,1156,148]]]'>In 1966, the University hired Murphy to teach in its School of Law. In September of 1967, the University awarded 'tenure to Murphy.</p>

The Faculty Handbook expressly stated that certain of its Sections (Sections 1 though 18) constituted part of a faculty member’s contractual relationship with the University. One of those Sections set forth Statute IV from the University’s 1985 Statutes (the “Statutes”) in its entirety. Statute IV, dedicated to the University’s faculty, governed the award and loss of tenure. Under Statute IV. J., Murphy was entitled, as a tenured faculty member, to renewal of employment until retirement or age 70.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Under Statute IV. K.I., <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>Murphy could forfeit tenure by serious misconduct or for professional incompetence, and was provided a process that had to occur before employment could be terminated.</p>
    <p id="b737-4" data-blocks='[["BL_737.5",737,[235,503,1154,629]]]'>On August 1, 1989, the University reaffirmed and distributed its written policy prohibiting sexual harassment. In the fall of 1991, a first-year law student, Bonita Lynch (“Lynch”), who was taking one of Murphy’s courses, filed a sexual harassment complaint against him. Lynch accused Murphy of assault and unwelcome physical advances, and claimed that he had inappropriately assisted her in law school assignments. Lynch subsequently filed a lawsuit against Murphy and the University in federal district court asserting violations of Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="20 U.S.C. § 1681">20 U.S.C. § 1681</a> <em>et seq. </em>(“Title IX”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and several pendant state-law claims.</p>
    <p id="b737-5" data-blocks='[["BL_737.6",737,[236,1166,1150,472]]]'>Dr. Judith Griggs, Duquesne’s Affirmative Action Officer, investigated Lynch’s allegations, and in December 1991, issued a report to Dr. John E. Murray, Jr. (“Murray”), the University’s President. Dr. Griggs found that Murphy had involved himself both emotionally and physically with Lynch, thereby creating a hostile and intimidating environment with which she was forced to contend. Dr. Griggs also concluded that Murphy’s conduct was inconsistent with the moral standards of the University and the ethical standards of its professorate.</p>
    <p id="b737-6" data-blocks='[["BL_737.7",737,[235,1666,1151,419]],["BL_738.1",738,[242,327,1158,201]]]'>After receiving the report, Murray notified Murphy in a letter dated December 5, 1991 that he accepted Dr. Griggs’ findings and conclusions, and viewed Murphy’s behavior as a clear violation of both the University’s basic philosophy and its sexual harassment policy. Murray informed Murphy that he would be permitted to complete his teaching assignments that semester, but would then be suspended until June 1, 1992. Murray directed Murphy to seek professional counseling to <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>insure that he would not engage in any such conduct during the suspension, and warned that the University would take immediate and appropriate action if information of additional or similar past misbehavior came to light.</p>
    <p id="b738-4" data-blocks='[["BL_738.4",738,[241,554,1159,254]]]'>Accepting the terms of suspension, Murphy sought counseling and provided the University with reports of his progress. Ultimately, Murphy’s counselor advised the University that he had benefited from the counseling and would conform his conduct in the future to University standards.</p>
    <p id="b738-5" data-blocks='[["BL_738.5",738,[239,834,1163,147]]]'>By letter dated June 4, 1992, Murray informed Murphy that his suspension was lifted and that his status as a tenured professor was reinstated.</p>
    <p id="b738-6" data-blocks='[["BL_738.6",738,[237,1007,1165,630]]]'>Consequently, Murphy returned to teaching for the 1992-93 academic year. Pursuant to a letter from then Dean of the Law School, John J. Scullio dated June 2,1993, the University offered to renew Murphy’s employment for the 1993-94 school year. Murphy accepted the University’s offer on or about June 8, 1993. In addition to incorporating the Statutes and the Faculty Handbook, the letter stated that the Standards of the American Bar Association for Legal Education (“ABA”) and the Articles of the Association of American Law Schools (“AALS”) that were applicable to law schools and law faculties were to be incorporated by reference into the parties’ agreement (the “Contract”).</p>
    <p id="b738-7" data-blocks='[["BL_738.7",738,[235,1665,1161,366]]]'>In the summer of 1993, however, attorneys representing Ms. Lynch notified the University that Murphy had engaged in a pattern of misconduct, harassing Ms. Lynch, as well as several other female law students. Based on these assertions, the University felt compelled under Title IX to reopen its investigation of Murphy’s activities. In August 1993, the University did so, and placed Murphy on paid leave.</p>
    <p id="b738-8" data-blocks='[["BL_738.8",738,[234,2055,1163,311]],["BL_739.1",739,[217,329,1155,247]]]'>Subsequently, the University’s Law School Dean sent Murray a memo dated October 11, 1993, requesting that a process be initiated to terminate Murphy’s tenure and listing several allegations of Murphy’s serious misconduct. By letter dated October 25, 1993, Murray notified Murphy that the University proposed to terminate his employment as a tenured professor <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>pursuant to Statute IV K.l. of the Contract. Murphy was also advised of his entitlement under Statute IV to a hearing before the University Grievance Committee for Faculty (the “Committee”), and of the several grounds for the proposed termination.</p>
    <p id="b739-4" data-blocks='[["BL_739.4",739,[218,606,1155,470]]]'>As was his right, Murphy requested a formal pre-termination hearing, which was held for two full days in May 1994. Murphy was represented by counsel, who cross-examined the University’s witnesses and called witnesses and offered exhibits on Murphy’s behalf. Four women, all law students who had taken one of Murphy’s courses, testified about their respective encounters with Murphy in 1989, 1990 or 1991. Because of her pending federal action, Ms. Lynch chose not to testify.</p>
    <p id="b739-5" data-blocks='[["BL_739.5",739,[219,1100,1155,1000]]]'>After the hearing concluded, the Committee submitted a report dated December 21, 1994 with its findings, conclusions and recommendation (the “Report”) to Murray. Based on the evidence presented, the Committee made several findings, unfavorable to Murphy, determining that he attempted to form relationships with female law students who rebuffed him, created an atmosphere in which female law students were made to feel uncomfortable, effectively foreclosed female law students from taking certain courses he taught, abused his power as a professor in dealing with female law students, provided substantial and improper academic advisement as a quid pro quo in the context of sexual harassment, pursued conduct of repetitive approaches to women which was offensive, and was apparently reluctant to comprehend the ethical and legal principles involved. Nevertheless, reasoning that much of the evidence against Murphy had been available to the University when Lynch first filed her complaint in 1991, the Committee recommended against Murphy’s termination on the grounds of laches.</p>
    <p id="b739-6" data-blocks='[["BL_739.6",739,[220,2124,1154,254]],["BL_740.1",740,[242,333,1157,473]]]'>Under the Contract, the final decision in this matter was given to Murray, as the University’s President. Accordingly, Murray made a thorough review of the Report, and advised the Committee in writing on January 4, 1995 of his final decision. Murray informed the Committee that he was in <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>substantial agreement with its substantive findings, but that he disagreed with its process concerns. Murray explained that the record did not support the application of the doctrine of laches. Murray then concluded that “[t]he University has, by abundantly clear and convincing evidence, established more than sufficient grounds to support the finding of serious misconduct by Professor Murphy and consequent termination of Cornelius F. Murphy, Jr. as a tenured professor at Duquesne University.”</p>
    <p id="b740-4" data-blocks='[["BL_740.4",740,[239,839,1160,636]]]'>On the same day, Murray wrote to Murphy, notifying him that he had made the final decision to terminate him as a tenured member of the University’s faculty. As permitted under the Contract, Murphy appealed Murray’s decision to Duquesne’s Board of Directors. Upon its review of Murray’s point-by-point response to Murphy’s appeal, at its regular meeting on February 17, 1995, the Board approved a motion, recognizing, <em>inter alia, </em>that “the President had the authority to terminate the employment of Professor Murphy pursuant to the powers granted to him in the University Bylaws and Statutes”, and accepting “the conclusions and final decision of President Murray” to terminate Murphy’s employment.</p>
    <p id="b740-5" data-blocks='[["BL_740.5",740,[236,1507,1162,635]]]'>Murphy filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the University, asserting in Count I, a claim of age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 623">29 U.S.C. § 623</a>(a); in Count II, a claim of age discrimination under the Pennsylvania Human Relation Act, (“PHRA”), 43 P.S. § 951 <em>et seq.; </em>and in Count III, a claim for breach of contract. With respect to the latter, Murphy alleged that the University’s termination of his employment violated the Contract because he did not engage in serious misconduct and because he did not receive the process of tenure termination that the Contract promised.</p>
    <p id="b740-6" data-blocks='[["BL_740.6",740,[234,2174,1160,203]],["BL_741.1",741,[223,329,1149,98]]]'>The University moved for summary judgment. In July 1998, the district court granted the motion as to Murphy’s ADEA claim, and declined to retain jurisdiction over Murphy’s state law causes of action. Thereafter, Murphy had his case <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>transferred to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, and voluntarily discontinued his PHRA claim.</p>

The trial court granted the University’s motion. The trial court’s decision was premised on its determination that the claim was not subject to <em>“de novo” </em>review because a court should not intrude into a university’s operations. Essentially, the trial court decided that even if material facts were genuinely in dispute, Murphy was not entitled to have a “new factfinder (this time Allegheny County residents rather than Dr. Murphy’s colleagues) ... .re-visit the evidence and determine what happened between Professor Murphy and the students.” (Trial Court Opinion at 12.)

The faculty handbook, which was incorporated into the contract, set forth a procedure that the College was bound to follow in deciding whether it would reappoint the appellant when his initial term expired. That procedure provided for annual written evaluations of the appellant’s performance by the Art Department’s chairman, as well as several levels of internal appeal from an unfavorable decision. After reviewing the evaluations made of the appellant, the College declined to reappoint him. Once the process of internal appeals was completed, upholding the decision against reappointment, the appellant sued the College for defamation and for breach of contract. As to the latter, the appellant alleged that the College violated his employment <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>agreement by not acting in good faith in considering his reappointment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The College filed a motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, which the trial court granted.</p>

Against that standard, we reviewed the record and the terms of the <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>parties’ agreement, and determined that the evidence established that the College gave to the appellant all that he was promised in his employment contract-a certain procedure for making and appealing reappointment decisions, which did not contemplate a court’s review on the merits. We concluded that the contract itself prohibited judicial review of the findings the College made when it decided not to reappoint him, and thus we lacked “jurisdiction,” in a nontechnical sense, to review the merits of the College’s decision. <em>Baker, </em><a href="/pa/516/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="516 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="1808550" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0291-01">532 A.2d at 403</a>.

Although one of the parties to this dispute is an institution of higher learning, we see no need or reason to devise special rules for restricting review. This is so because private parties, including religious or educational institutions, may draft employment contracts which restrict review of professional employees’ qualifications to an internal process that, if conducted in good faith, is final within the institution and precludes or prohibits review in a court of law. This is what was done by Lafayette College in <em>Baker </em>and, allegedly, by the University in this case.

Murphy contends that the Contract “merely state[d] that tenure could be forfeited for ‘serious misconduct.’ ” It did not state expressly that “his tenure could be forfeited <em>if </em>it is determined via the process set forth in the [Statutes] that he has committed ‘serious misconduct’ or if the University President determines there are grounds for termination.....” (Appellant’s Brief at 15-16) (emphasis in original). According to Murphy, therefore, a jury in a civil action has the right to determine whether his behavior rose to the level of serious misconduct. The University counters that the Contract, “set[ ] forth precisely how this standard [was] to be evaluated and <em>by whom. </em>.... <em>[The University] did not agree to turn over to a judge or jury the right to decide whether that standard [was] met. That right under the applicable contract remained with the chief executive officer of the University.” </em>(Appellee’s Brief at 28-24) (emphasis in original).</p>

Having thoroughly reviewed the parties’ agreement, we cannot accept Murphy’s interpretation, which is based exclusively on the way one sentence in the Contract was written. Simply put, the parties’ contractual intent cannot be gleaned by ignoring all but one sentence in the Contract, and then reading that sentence out of context. Moreover, contrary to Murphy’s claim, specific, express written language is not necessary for a particular contractual intent to exist in an agreement. Rather, it is common for the intent of contracting parties to be inherent in the totality of their contract.</p>
    <p id="b756-4" data-blocks='[["BL_756.4",756,[246,892,1158,518]]]'>We accept, however, the University’s position. We agree that the Contract was clear and unambiguous in setting out a process in Statute IV exclusively reserved to the University and its faculty for arriving at a conclusive determination as to whether Murphy’s tenure had been forfeited for serious misconduct. Thus, while Murphy is free to assert in a court of law that the process of forfeiture that was afforded him did not comply with the Contract’s terms, he is not free to demand that a jury re-consider and re-decide the merits of his termination.</p>
    <p id="b756-5" data-blocks='[["BL_756.5",756,[245,1447,1159,464]]]'>That this interpretation is correct is evident from a careful reading of the parties’ entire Contract and the plain meaning of Statute IV K.l. when taken in context. Significantly, the source of the process of forfeiture of tenure under the Contract, like all decisions involving faculty employment, was the Statutes themselves. Thus, the Contract reflected that tenure forfeiture was considered a matter of the University’s self-governance, and one that the parties had kept for themselves to determine.</p>
    <p id="b756-6" data-blocks='[["BL_756.6",756,[243,1947,1160,418]],["BL_757.1",757,[223,323,1153,614]]]'>The Statute in the Contract dedicated to the faculty, Statute IV, was comprehensive, covering the faculty’s activities, benefits, rights, and responsibilities. Paragraph K.l. of Statute TV, which controlled tenure’s forfeiture, was but one piece of a larger procedure that ultimately determined who would be part of the University’s permanent faculty. Commencing with a teacher’s appointment to the faculty, the Contract provided a means for the University to determine whether re-appoint<a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>ment, advancement, promotion to tenure, or if need be, termination should occur. At each step, the University evaluated a teacher against an applicable standard: had he performed in a manner that allowed for advancement; had he demonstrated the “excellence in teaching”, the “scholarly and professional activities”, the “service to the University” and the “promise of continued professional growth” that merited tenure; had he engaged in the “serious misconduct or professional incompetence” that warranted termination? The decisions made along the way, including the one for tenure forfeiture, were repeatedly described in the Contract as “final.” Statute IV K.l. spoke in terms of a “closed” case.</p>
    <p id="b757-4" data-blocks='[["BL_757.4",757,[225,959,1153,971]]]'>All of these decisions involved subjective judgments of a teacher’s professional and personal qualities, and his potential for either advancing or impeding the University’s mission. They required an intimate understanding of the teacher, and of the University’s philosophy, policies, and day to day life. The Contract, therefore, gave to the University’s process, final authority to make them. The University is an ecumenically-based institution dedicated to promoting through the members of its tenured faculty the ethical and religious values of the “Judaeo-Christian tradition in its Catholic dimension.” It comes as no surprise that the University and its faculty agreed not to cede to any lay outsider or secular institution the right to define and determine what behavior on the part of a faculty member was so antithetical to its mission that he could not remain a member of the University’s community, and instead, concurred that the process set out in the Contract would finally decide whether a faculty member’s actions rose to the level of serious misconduct and whether forfeiture was in order.</p>
    <p id="b757-5" data-blocks='[["BL_757.5",757,[224,1961,1154,407]],["BL_758.1",758,[253,323,1163,302]]]'>Moreover, there was nothing in the Contract to indicate that any of the judgments relating to a faculty member’s continued place in the University, or lack thereof, would be open to a judge or jury to override. Indeed, it would be unreasonable to believe that the parties intended that the process for deciding the matter of tenure forfeiture, which was so carefully elaborated in their Contract to the point of final determination, could be completely circumvented by the filing of a civil <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>action. Rather, the detailed provisions of the Contract for deciding the matter have inherent in them the intent of the parties that the agreed-upon process was to be final. That intent, with respect to the finality of the process, is just as express and enforceable a promise as if it were actually written in the phrase that Murphy demanded.</p>
    <p id="b758-4" data-blocks='[["BL_758.4",758,[251,648,1159,301]]]'>We hold, therefore, that Murphy is not entitled to litigate the merits of his termination in this breach of contract action.

    <p id="b758-5" data-blocks='[["BL_758.5",758,[246,981,1166,868]]]'>We emphasize that the decision made about Murphy in this regard was not unrestrained. The Contract provided a judicial-like process and a standard for determining whether tenure forfeiture was warranted, and imposed upon the University an exacting burden of proof. Additionally, Murphy was entitled to, and in fact pursued, an appeal to the University’s Board of Directors from the President’s final decision. Moreover, Murphy was not subject to the President’s whim. All of the participants in the process, including Murray, were required to follow the Contract’s process to the letter, and fulfill their contractual obligations with good faith. We agree with the Superior Court’s statement in <em>Baker </em>that “when an employer expressly provides in an employment contract for a comprehensive evaluation and review process, a court may look to the employer’s good faith to determine whether the employer has in fact performed those contractual duties.” <em>Baker, </em><a href="/pa-super/350/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="350 Pa.

Murphy contends that a jury must resolve whether he engaged in the behavior that led to his termination and whether that behavior was serious misconduct. In light of our holding, we conclude that these questions are not material and not open to dispute and litigation in the present breach of contract claim.</p>
    <p id="b759-4" data-blocks='[["BL_759.6",759,[213,737,1154,800]]]'>Murphy also contends that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the University breached a procedural term of the Contract by not having its Board of Directors consider additional evidence and argument when it reviewed the President’s decision to reject the Committee’s recommendation in favor of retaining him. This alleged contractual term was not contained in paragraph K.1 of Statute IV. According to Murphy, it was found in the 1958 <em>Statement on Procedural Standards in Faculty Dismissal Proceedings </em>(“Statement”) of the American Association of University Professors (“AAUP”), as set forth <em>in </em>a letter the AAUP’s Associate Secretary sent to him. Moreover, Murphy argues that contrary to the Superior Court’s ruling, he is not collaterally estopped by the district court’s decision from litigating this allegation.</p>

More specifically, it is not apparent that Murphy had a full and fair opportunity to litigate whether the 1958 AAUP Statement was part of the process that the University had to follow. Further, it is not apparent that in addressing Murphy’s assertion that the University’s proferred reason for his termination was a pretext for age discrimination, that the district court was required to determine whether Murphy’s termination satisfied all of the Contract’s procedural terms that allegedly came from tangential materials. Therefore, we conclude that Murphy’s allegation of procedural breach arising out of the 1958 AAUP Statement is not subject to collateral estoppel.</p>

Although the record shows that Murphy raised this issue in the lower courts, it would appear that because he did not argue it clearly, neither the trial court not the Superior Court distinguished it from Murphy’s allegation of procedural breach based on the AALS Standards and Bylaws.
