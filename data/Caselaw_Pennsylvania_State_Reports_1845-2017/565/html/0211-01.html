Jones responded that the Act’s real estate exception, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(4), which serves to waive immunity, applies to her claim. We granted allocatur to clarify the parameters of § 8522(b)(4). We conclude that Jones’ claim does not fall within the exception. Accordingly, we affirm the Commonwealth Court’s order, affirming the trial court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of SEPTA.</p>
    <p id="b375-5" data-blocks='[["BL_375.4",375,[222,866,1155,519]]]'>On December 23, 1996, Jones was injured when she slipped and fell on a train platform at SEPTA’s Fern Rock station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On May 27, 1997, Jones commenced an action in negligence against SEPTA. Jones alleged that the sole cause of her slip and fall was the rock salt that lay on the train platform, and that SEPTA was negligent in not warning the public of the salt and in failing to clear it. In its Answer and New Matter, SEPTA denied Jones’ allegations of negligence, and as a Commonwealth party, raised sovereign immunity as an affirmative defense.</p>
    <p id="b375-6" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[223,1410,1156,626]]]'>Ultimately, SEPTA filed a motion for summary judgment. SEPTA contended that as a matter of general rule, the Sovereign Immunity Act shields it from suit, and that Jones had no evidence to support her assertion that her claim was allowed by the Act’s real estate exception found at 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(4). SEPTA argued that § 8522(b)(4) requires proof that Jones’ injuries resulted from a dangerous condition “of’ the train platform itself, as opposed to the presence of a substance or an object “on” it, and that since Jones neither averred nor could show such a condition, the real estate exception did not apply. The trial court agreed, and granted SEPTA summary judgment.</p>

As aptly noted in those cases, the language the legislature chose for subjecting the Commonwealth to liability under 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(4) — “a dangerous condition of Commonwealth agency real estate” — varies markedly from the language it chose for subjecting a local agency to liability under 42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(b)(3) — the “care, custody or control of real property....” <em>See Kilgore, </em><a href="/a2d/717/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="717 A.2d 514" data-case-ids="12119309,356279" data-case-paths="/a2d/717/0514-01,/pa/553/0022-01">717 A.2d at </a>518 n. 6; <em>Grieff, </em><a href="/a2d/693/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="693 A.2d 195" data-case-ids="11984785,11984843,11984932,960447,960456,960465" data-case-paths="/a2d/693/0195-01,/a2d/693/0195-02,/a2d/693/0195-03,/pa/548/0013-01,/pa/548/0012-01,/pa/548/0011-02">693 A.2d at </a>197 n. 3. Because the words the General Assembly used in the Sovereign Immunity Act are one way and the words it used in the Tort Claims Act are another, we are of the view that the legislature did not intend that § 8422(b)(4) and § 8542(b)(3) be interpreted in lockstep.</p>

In her complaint, Jones avers that “salt on the ground” of SEPTA’s train platform constituted a “dangerous condition”, causing her to slip and fall and suffer bodily harm. (Complaint, paras.4,5,9). The complaint, however, has no averments, wThich if proven, would establish that the salt derived or originated from or had as its source the train platform itself. We conclude, therefore, that Jones’ claim does not satisfy the terms of 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(4), the Sovereign Immunity Act’s real estate exception, and that SEPTA is immune from Jones’ suit under 42 Pa.C.S. § 8521.</p>
