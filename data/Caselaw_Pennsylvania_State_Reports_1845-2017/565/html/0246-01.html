In each instance, Castegnaro knowingly misrepresented to the insureds that their coverage with Aetna had been renewed. The insureds, believing that their coverage with Aetna had been renewed, remitted checks for the premiums to Castegnaro. Castegnaro then fraudulently cashed the premium checks. Eventually, Castegnaro confessed to the fraud and Aetna provided retroactive coverage to the defrauded insureds for the periods during which Castegnaro had represented that the coverage was in place. Based on Castegnaro’s actions, Aetna filed suit against Associated for negligence and vicarious liability.</p>

Pursuant to the policy, Associated gave timely notice to Utica of Aetna’s claims. Utica retained counsel to defend Associated, but informed Associated that it would not provide coverage for any part of a settlement or judgment entered against Associated. On April 29, 1996, Associated and Aetna entered into a stipulation providing for entry of a consent judgment and an assignment of Associated’s rights against Utica under its error and omissions liability policy to Aetna.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Pursuant to the consent judgment, judgment was entered against Associated on April 30,1996, in the amount of $225,968.18.</p>

Aetna argues that the purpose of Exclusion 4 is to prevent a windfall in a situation where an insured retains premiums and then shifts liability to its insurance earner to cover a claim for those • premiums. Because Castegnaro absconded with the premiums, Aetna contends that Associated never truly received the premiums and thus, no windfall situation exists here. Consequently, Aetna argues that it is not reasonable to impute Castegnaro’s receipt of the premiums to Associated and deprive Associated from receiving coverage. We disagree.</p>

As an agent of Associated who was acting within the scope of his duties on behalf of Associated at the time he received the premiums, Castegnaro was undoubtedly “an insured” under Section III of the policy. Exclusion 4 excludes coverage for money received by “an insured” and because Castegnaro was “an insured” under the policy, coverage for any stolen premiums he received is necessarily precluded.</p>

An agent of a company, such as Castegnaro was to Associated, is more properly characterized as an extension of that entity, rather than a separate part of it. In the context of vicarious liability, a principal is hable to third parties for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligent acts and other malfeasances of his agent, even though the principal did not authorize, justify, participate in or know of such conduct or even if he forbade the acts or disapproved of them, as long as they occurred within the agent’s scope of employment. <em>See Aiello v.

Although the issue at hand concerns contract interpretation and not vicarious liability, the reasoning in <em>Aiello </em>is clearly applicable to the circumstances of this case. Here, Associated placed Castegnaro in a position of trust and confidence when it hired him as an agent authorized to bind coverage on behalf of Aetna. Because Castegnaro was acting within the scope of this position when he defrauded Aetna’s policy holders and received the premium checks, it is reasonable to impute the receipt of this money to Associated, even though Associated was unaware of Castegnaro’s fraudulent scheme.</p>
