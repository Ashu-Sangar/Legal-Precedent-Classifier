Mr. Havens gave appellant and his accomplice the cash from his pocket and begged to be released from the vehicle.

The evidence from the- robbery of Mr. Havens’ vehicle was relevant to establish the identity of the person who shot Robert Campbell.

He was the only son of Stan and Rose Campbell. He served in the United States Army and was stationed in Korea. After his honorable discharge he started his career as an ironworker for Local 401 which lasted 24 years. In 1996 he started a new occupation as a security guard. I married Bob on June 24, 1978 and we made our home in the Overbrook section of Philadelphia. Q. Slow down a little bit.</p>

Bob never hesitated to come to the aid of anyone who needed help. Bob was a fun loving guy who loved and respected life. Bob coached and organized little league baseball for the Overbrook AA for many years. He also coached for Our Lady of Lourdes Football and Basketball teams. Bob was an active town watch member and was very involved in his community. Since the death of my husband our family has been devastated. I have now become the sole provider for my family, something I have never had to do before. Our grandson Andrew who will be seven years old remembers when Grandpop taught him to hit his first baseball but Bob never had a chance to see his Grandson play in his first game. Our Granddaughter Samantha who turned two on the 4th of July will only remember her Pop Pop by the pictures we have to show her. Our youngest daughter Amanda will not have her father present at her high school graduation or have him give her away at her wedding like he did our oldest daughter Michelle.

Appellant was formally advised of the intent to call Mrs. Campbell as a victim impact witness at 3:00 p.m. on November 10, 1997. Within a few hours of that notification appellant was provided with a written statement of Mrs. Campbell’s proposed testimony. Appellant was also permitted to redact portions of the proposed testimony prior to Mrs. Campbell taking the stand. Appellant made no objection then, nor does he do so now, as to how additional time would have altered his handling of this witness. Appellant had more than twenty-four hours to discover information relevant to Mrs. Campbell’s credibility and to investigate the specific information about Robert Campbell’s life prior to the statement being presented to the jury.

Victim impact evidence is simply another method of informing you about the nature and circumstances of the crime in question. You may consider this evidence in determining an appropriate punishment.

The majority states that, in the future, the Commonwealth must notify a defendant prior to trial if it intends to use victim impact testimony at the penalty hearing. Inexplicably, however, the majority fails to apply that require<a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>ment to the instant case and baldly declares that giving Appellant “more than twenty-four hours” notice was sufficient.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Contrary to the majority, I do not believe that giving Appellant little more than one day’s notice that the Commonwealth would be introducing victim impact testimony satisfies due process requirements, particularly in a capital sentencing proceeding where the life of the defendant hangs in the balance. Furthermore, by concluding that notice was sufficient in the instant case, the majority seriously undermines its mandate that future capital defendants must be notified prior to trial of the Commonwealth’s intent to introduce victim impact evidence. Thus, I dissent from that part of the majority opinion affirming Appellant’s sentence of death.</p>

As the majority indicates, at the conclusion of the guilt phase, at 3:00 p.m. on November 10, 1997, the Commonwealth notified Appellant that it intended to present victim impact testimony in the penalty phase. The penalty phase was scheduled to commence the morning of November 12, 1997, as the intervening day was a holiday. A few hours after the conclusion of the guilt phase, the Commonwealth provided Appellant with a copy of the victim impact statement.</p>
