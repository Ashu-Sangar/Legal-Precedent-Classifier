For the period from August 31, 1993 through March 9, 1994, the Commonwealth Court agreed with the WCJ that Claimant was “incarcerated after a conviction”, reasoning that that phrase “refers to persons sentenced <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>to partial or total confinement in a jail or penitentiary after conviction in a criminal proceeding.” 738 A.2d at 4. Specifically, Commonwealth Court looked to Black’s Law Dictionary, which defines “incarceration” as follows: “Imprisonment; confinement in a jail or penitentiary. See imprisonment.” Black’s Law Dictionary 522 (6th ed.1990). The Commonwealth Court determined that the word “incarcerated” had to be construed in terms of a criminal proceeding, and noted that during criminal proceeding, the offender receives a sentence after conviction. The court also recognized that sections 9724 and 9725 of the Criminal Code provide for sentences of partial or total confinement in which the prisoner is to be committed to a jail or penitentiary, and that section 9762 provides that such sentences are to be served in the Bureau of Corrections or a county prison. 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9724-25 &amp; 9762.

As we have concluded that Claimant is not entitled to compensation for that period because he was incarcerated after a conviction, we need not address this issue.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[253,662,1159,521]]]'>Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court, which reversed the WCJ’s reinstatement of Claimant’s benefits after March 9, 1994, although we do so on a different basis. Contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s determination, Claimant was “incarcerated after a conviction” subsequent to March 9, 1994 when Claimant was serving probation with the condition of involuntary commitment to NSH. We further affirm the Commonwealth Court’s decision to deny Employer any credit for benefits paid during August 31, 1993-March 9, 1994.</p>

While I recognize that the Court has previously indicated that inpatient custodial rehabilitation may constitute imprisonment for purposes of affording credit for time served related to offenses under the Vehicle Code, that holding was based primarily upon consideration of the purposes sought to be obtained through the mandatory sentencing scheme — rehabilitation, deterrence, and punishment — which were served by the particular rehabilitation program in that case. <em>See Commonwealth v.

This is not to say that an employer is obligated to pay benefits <em>ad infinitum </em>for an institutionalized claimant. Rather, if an employer can demonstrate that the claimant's loss of earnings is no longer attributable to the work injury, and that work would be available but for an unrelated menial illness, benefits may be appropriately suspended. <em>See generally Kachinski v.

Although a connection between Claimant's back injury and mental illness may seem unlikely, Employer evidently did not proceed under this theory of suspension.
