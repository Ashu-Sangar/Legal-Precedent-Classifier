Contrary to the holding of the Superior Court, Appellants contend that this section does not give all grandparents automatic standing, but instead only confers standing to those grandparents who satisfy the specific requirements stated therein. According to Appellants, there are three requirements to afford a grandparent standing to petition for physical and/or legal custody of his/her grandchild: (1) the grandparent has genuine care and concern for the child; (2) the relationship began with the consent of a parent or pursuant to a court order; and (3) any <em>one </em>of the following: (I) the grandparent has <em>in loco parentis </em>status; (ii) the grandparent assumes responsibility for a grandchild who has been adjudicated a dependent child under 42 Pa.C.S.

She asserts that the new legislation was added to address the increasing need for grandparents to obtain physical and legal custody of grandchildren they perceive are at risk due to parental abuse or neglect, whether due to alcohol abuse, drug abuse or mental illness. Grandmother maintains that Section 5313(b) permits a grandparent who is aware of such a situation to petition the court for temporary physical or legal custody until such time as his/her child or partner obtains the counseling they require and the grandchild is no longer at risk. She asserts that, unfortunately, she did not become aware of the parental abuse until after the Agency became involved.

Both provide additional support for the conclusion that Section 5313, on its face, evidences a clear intention of the Legislature to balance the need to protect the right of parents to raise their children with a desire to afford grandparents a statutory basis upon which to seek custody in limited situations in which children are in special need and/or the grandparents have firmly established themselves in the role of primary caregiver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

    <p id="b790-4" data-blocks='[["BL_790.4",790,[244,824,1167,944]]]'>The majority’s conclusion that Section 5313 confers a general right of standing upon all grandparents, regardless of whether they satisfy any of the criteria of Section 5313(b), subjects parents to legal proceedings seeking to deprive them of custody of their children despite having done nothing to suggest that they are unfit. Although such an effort by grandparents who do not meet the statutory criteria must ultimately fail, according to such a construction, parents must nonetheless endure a full-blown custody proceeding. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 451 (“the circumstances set forth in subsections (1), (2) and (3) are questions of fact to be resolved by the trial court after a hearing held to determine ‘[i]f it is in the best interests of the child not to be in the custody of either parent and if it is in the best interests of the child to be in the custody of the grandparent’ ” (citations omitted)).

While the majority’s decision ameliorates the effects <em>of any </em>imprecision in legislative drafting as applied to the circumstances of this case, I would leave it to the General Assembly to make appropriate adjustments where it has evinced its intent to regulate challenges to custody by third parties, and the guiding policy considerations are at least mixed.

Again, I believe that the plain language of the statute should control. Pursuant to the requirements of Section 5313(b)(3), a child who has been removed from a dangerous environment, placed in a secure situation, and whose parents’ rights have been terminated, cannot be considered at risk from parental abuse or neglect. Again, there may be a legitimate concern in the circumstances of the case regarding the best interests of the child as it relates to the environment established by a Children’s Services placement versus the grandparents’ claim to a superior bond based upon the familial relationship. Again, however, in terms of the conferral of third-party standing to challenge an established and ongoing caregiver relationship, I believe that the General Assembly is best suited to balance the salient policies and provide the necessary direction.</p>
