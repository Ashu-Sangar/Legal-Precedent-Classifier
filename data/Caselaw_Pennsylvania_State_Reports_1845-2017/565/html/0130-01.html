She consulted with Lewis T. Patterson, M.D. (“Patterson”) regarding whether she needed surgery to treat her cancer. During this consultation, Duttry claims that she questioned Patterson about his experience in performing the type of operation he recommended. Patterson allegedly told Duttry that he had performed this particular procedure approximately once every month. Duttry ultimately consented to have the surgery performed by Patterson.</p>

In <em>Kaskie, </em>the Superior Court held that evidence regarding characteristics particular to the surgeon, rather than information concerning the procedure itself, was irrelevant to an informed consent claim. The <em>Kaskie </em>court reasoned that to “expand the informed consent doctrine to include matters not specifically germane to surgical or operative treatment!, to include] ... facts personal to the treating physician, extends the doctrine into realms well beyond its original boundaries.” <em>Id </em>at 217. The Superior Court attempted to distinguish the matter <em>sub judice </em>from <em>Kaskie </em>by emphasizing that Duttry had specifically requested information regarding Patterson’s experience; in <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>
      <em>Kaskie, </em>however, the physician was not asked a question regarding his personal competency, but rather merely refrained from divulging this information. Thus, the majority of the panel below apparently viewed information concerning a physician’s experience as being material to an informed consent claim only where the particular patient poses specific questions regarding that experience.</p>

The expansive approach taken by the Superior Court below is in opposition to this commonwealth’s traditional view that the doctrine of informed consent is a limited one. We have historically demanded that a physician acquaint the patient only with “the nature of the operation to be performed, the seriousness of it, the organs of the body involved, the disease or incapacity sought to be cured, and the possible results.” <em>Gray, </em><a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%20663" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="223 A.2d 663">223 A.2d at 674</a>. The requirement of <em>Gray </em>is not a broad one; it clearly focuses on imparting information relative only to the surgery itself. In contrast, in neither <em>Gray </em>nor its progeny did we intimate that personal attributes or experience of the physician are relevant to an informed consent claim. Thus, we hold that evidence of a physician’s personal characteristics and experience is irrelevant to an informed consent claim; such a holding is more in keeping with our case law than the approach taken by the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[253,1738,1160,636]],["BL_297.1",297,[242,323,1150,97]]]'>Furthermore, we note that this holding does not shift depending upon whether a patient inquires as to the physician’s experience. We find the Superior Court’s rationale that evidence of the physician’s personal characteristics is relevant to an informed consent claim whenever the particular patient requests such information to be highly problematic. The Superior Court’s reasoning on this point is divorced from the fundamental principle of the informed consent doctrine that information is material to the procedure at hand, and therefore must be divulged in order to obtain the patient’s informed consent, if a <em>reasonable person </em>would wish to know it. <em>Gouse, supra. </em>This is an objective, rather than subjective, analysis; <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>its calculus does not shift depending on how inquisitive or passive the particular patient is.</p>

Rather, we are merely stating that the doctrine of informed consent is not the legal panacea for all damages arising out of any type of malfeasance by a physician. Nor do we see a need to expand this doctrine into a catchall theory of recovery since other causes of action provide avenues for redress to the injured patient. For example, it is conceivable that a physician’s lack of experience in performing an operation would support a plaintiff’s case in negligence. <em>See Collins v. Hand, </em><a href="/pa/431/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="431 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="1917403" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0378-01">431 Pa. 378</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=246%20A.2d%20398" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="246 A.2d 398">246 A.2d 398</a> (1968).
