In 1988, Sell became a quality control technician, and tested samples from various manufacturing lines to insure that they conformed to specification. In performance of her testing duties, Sell was in daily and direct contact with hot fumes and dust from the processing of a number of chemicals, including formaldehyde.</p>

Sell’s physicians told her that she had emphysema, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that interferes with normal breathing. The cause of the emphysema, however, was not discussed.</p>

At this time, she began to search for a physician with knowledge of the chemicals and dust in her work environment. Despite her efforts, Sell could not find such a physician, and contacted the American Lung Association for help. Finally, in August, 1993, Sell located Dr. John R. Cohn, an allergist. Dr. Cohn treated Sell for her emphysema, and told her that exposure to elevated formaldehyde concentrations at work had exacerbated her illness.</p>

At the same time, Sell informed Ms. Stokes that she was injured at work and explained how formaldehyde had affected her. Sell also described the difficulty she encountered in locating a physician with knowledge of the chemical.</p>

For purposes of establishing that she had satisfied the notice requirement of 77 P.S. § 631, Sell further alleged that she notified LNP Engineering of her work-related injury on August 31, 1993.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> LNP Engineering filed an Answer denying all of Sell’s allegations.</p>

Dr. Herzstein, Sell’s expert, testified that Sell suffered from two conditions: emphysema and an exacerbation of the disease. Dr. Herzstein explained that emphysema is a degenerative disease that develops over time after many years of assault on lung tissues, often from cigarette smoking. She described Sell’s emphysema as moderately severe, without any clear reversible component. Dr. Herzstein testified that the formaldehyde and other chemical irritants at LNP Engineering to which Sell was exposed aggravated the emphysema, triggering additional airway inflammation, bronchospasm, and a tightening of already narrowed airways. According to Dr. Herzstein, the aggravation of the emphysema was progressive and could also become chronic over time. Dr. Herzstein saw the waxing and waning of Sell’s symptoms relative to her work schedule as supportive of her opinion. Dr. Herzstein further opined that Sell could not return to a work environment where she was exposed to odors, fumes and respiratory irritants. Dr. Paul Epstein, LNP Engineering’s expert, testified that Sell suffered from only one ailment, emphysema caused by smoking, and opined that she could resume her job. For Dr. Epstein, Sell’s symptom pattern meant only that she was tired and in need of rest by the time the work week ended.</p>

The WCJ concluded that Sell established that she suffered an aggravation of her underlying chronic obstructive lung disease due to exposure to chemical irritants at work and that the aggravation to her underlying condition substantially contributed to her inability to return to her prior work environment.</p>

Further, the WCJ found Sell’s notice to be timely under 77 P.S. § 631 since she did not know nor did she have reason to know prior to receiving the note from Dr. Cohn on August 31, 1993 that her respiratory ailment was affected by the chemicals at work. Accordingly, the WCJ granted Sell’s Claim Petition.</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.4",281,[249,710,1155,736]]]'>LNP Engineering appealed the WCJ’s decision to the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (the “Board”). The Board reversed on the issue of notice, concluding that the substantial evidence did not support the WCJ’s finding that prior to August 31, 1993, Sell did not have reason to know of the causal relationship between her emphysema and employment. The Board found instead that Sell “knew or should have known of the nature of her injury and its relationship to her employment on November 23, 1992 when she was hospitalized.” Thus, the Board reasoned, “[Sell] had 120 days from that date to give [LNP Engineering] notice. She did not provide notice until August of 1993, beyond the 120-day statutory notice period, and therefore, she was barred from receiving compensation for her work injury.”</p>

In an unpublished opinion, a divided panel of the court affirmed the Board. In reaching its decision, the court focused on the same portions of the record that the Board found dispositive — Sell's testimony regarding her suspicions of the harmful effects of formaldehyde and her testimony that during the time she functioned as a quality control technician, her respiratory symptoms would worsen during the work week, and improve on the weekends. Observing that Sell’s symptom pattern, which the WCJ included in one of his findings, “conflicts with [his] other salient finding that Sell did not know or have reason to know prior to August 31, 1993 that she suffered a work-related aggravation of her underlying respiratory illness”, the court concluded that the substantial, competent evidence credited by the WCJ “merely supports the conclusion that Sell should have given notice to [LNP Engineering] of the work-related aggravation of her underlying emphysema within 120 days from her last <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>day of work in November 1992.” Accordingly, the court held that the record evidence did not support the WCJ’s finding that Sell gave .timely notice to LNP Engineering.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This appeal followed.</p>

Sell, of course, argues that the substantial evidence sustains the WCJ’s finding that until she received Dr. Cohn’s medical diagnosis, she was not chargeable under § 631 with actual or constructive knowledge of her work-related injury. LNP Engineering argues that it does not, and would have us conclude that § 631’s notice period began to run no later than, if not well before, November 23, 1992, rendering Sell’s notice on August 31, 1993 untimely.</p>

The nature and context of the injury for which Sell sought benefits is central to our decision. Sell’s aggravated emphysema was not the result of an accident or some other event of which she would have been immediately aware. Instead, it was the outcome of disease, a slow and silent process. The emphysema, due to cigarette smoking, manifested itself incrementally and developed over time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The exacerbation of the emphysema, the result of Sell’s work environment, also revealed itself in degrees. It caused Sell to experience symptoms like those that characterized the underlying disease. While Sell was developing or suffering from the emphysema and the aggravation of the disease, she also succumbed to bouts of bronchitis or pneumonia. Thus, the substantial evidence relating to the course taken by Sell’s disease provides ample support for the WCJ’s determination that without the benefit of medical consultation, Sell neither knew, nor should have known, that from among all her respiratory difficulties, there was a compensable injury. Moreover, the WCJ’s finding reflects the view that Sell should not have been expected to sort through her many symptoms unassisted and essentially diagnose herself. Based on the evidence regarding the injury with which Sell was dealing, we can only agree.</p>

We conclude, however, that in doing so, the court made too great a leap. While we agree that the evidence reveals a belief on Sell’s part that formaldehyde adversely affected her well being and shows that the chemicals to which she was exposed at work made her feel tired and sick, we do not agree that this evidence provides a basis for rejecting the WCJ’s finding. This is because the discovery rule, as incorporated by the legislature in § 631, calls for more than an employee’s suspicion, intuition or belief; by its terms, the statute’s notice period is triggered only by an employee’s knowledge that she is injured and that her injury is possibly related to her job.</p>

In the exercise of reasonable diligence, and with notable persistence, Sell located Dr. Cohn, a physician who confirmed her suspicions about formaldehyde and informed her on August 31,1993 that exposure to the chemical <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>exacerbated her emphysema. As the WCJ found, it was at this point, with a medical diagnosis in hand, that Sell had the knowledge that § 631 requires. To hold otherwise would, in our view, disregard the substantial evidence that supported the WCJ’s finding, and violate the well-settled principles that mandate a remedially-minded application of the Act and a strict interpretation of § 631’s language.</p>

There is no evidence to support, the finding that Sell "had related [her emphysema] to the fact that she had smoked cigarettes.” The record does not show to what cause Sell attributed her emphysema. During the hearings before the WCJ, Sell was not asked to ascribe a cause to her emphysema, nor did she volunteer one. Regardless, this finding has no bearing on the case. As Sell's claim for benefits was for the aggravation of ihe emphysema, any finding as to Sell’s understanding of her emphysema’s cause is irrelevant. We note, however, that the Board and the Commonwealth Court, set forth this finding in- their respective opinions. Both tribunals, therefore, credited Sell with certain knowledge that the record does not show she had.</p>
