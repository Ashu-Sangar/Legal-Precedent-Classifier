Bruzda and Weiss arrived together at a party at Henry Hobart’s house between 7:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. later that same evening. The couple appeared comfortable together and then left the party for approximately an hour. When they returned to the party, Bruzda’s appearance was messed and she appeared to be upset. Later, Bruzda and Weiss left the party again and they did not return. Before he left the party, Weiss borrowed a jack and a tire iron from Mr. Hobart. Bruzda was never again seen alive and five months later, on March 20, 1979, the body of Bruzda, wrapped in a quilt, was found near a road in a remote area of Indiana County.</p>

Ms. Pearson also testified that a distinctive homemade quilt was missing from the back seat of the car.
