I am troubled by the prospect that a defendant who, for example, instructed counsel to file a direct appeal, was told by counsel that an appeal was being filed, was subsequently reassured by counsel that the appeal was filed, but later found out after the one-year limitation period expired that counsel never filed the appeal, is forever precluded from receiving at least one appellate review of his case. In my view, a rule that penalizes a defendant who reasonably relies in good faith upon his counsel to protect his appellate rights is contrary to the purpose of the PCRA, and such a defendant <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>should be entitled to, at a bare minimum, one appellate review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

In the instant case, the trial court, granted <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief based upon the fact that Appellant sought a timely appeal. Although the record reveals that Appellant told both his trial counsel and the public defender after trial to file an appeal, there is no evidence that Appellant was ever told that an appeal was, or even would be, filed. The record also reveals that Appellant waited for twenty months after his judgment of sentence became final before seeking <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief. I do not believe that merely telling counsel to file an appeal, without more, is sufficient to establish that Appellant had a good laith, reasonable basis to conclude that counsel was protecting his appellate rights when Appellant failed to follow up on his request for an appeal for twenty months after judgment of sentence.</p>
