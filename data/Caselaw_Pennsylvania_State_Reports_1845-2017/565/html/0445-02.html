At the time of the fire, the daughter of Appellant was renting the home. State Farm carried the homeowner insurance policy of Appellant and her daughter’s renter’s insurance policy. State Farm investigator John Christmas (Christmas) and others examined the property, took photographs, and interviewed Appellant. Fire Marshall Edward Copper (Fire Marshall Copper) of Bristol Township also investigated the fire. Christmas’ report, and a subsequent report by Fire Marshall Copper, concluded that the ignition of combustible materials placed on the electric burner of the kitchen stove caused the fire. State Farm denied claims by Appellant and her daughter for payment under their respective insurance policies.

The trial court denied the Commonwealth’s oral motion in limine for the admission of all evidence gathered by State Farm during its arson investigation because State Farm never informed Appellant that the Commonwealth was invoking the ARIA. “Without such disclosure to [Appellant], and without her specific waiver of any rights to confidentiality she may have pursuant to her contractual relationship with State Farm, we could not permit the Commonwealth to circumvent” Appellant’s constitutional protections. Trial Ct. Op., 10/13/98, at 11 (R.R. 22a). The ARIA does not contain a notice provision that places such a burden upon the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b609-6" data-blocks='[["BL_609.6",609,[232,1838,1152,527]],["BL_610.1",610,[240,317,1158,95]]]'>Section 1610.3(c) of the ARIA, “Notification to policyholder”, requires an insurance company to “send written notice not sooner than 45 nor more than 60 days from the time the information is furnished to an authorized agency.” Thus, notification is only required after the requested information has been released. Contrary to Appellant’s contention, the ARIA does not contain language that requires State Farm to notify its insured before it submits information to an authorized agency. In the instant case, the Commonwealth submitted its request to State Farm pursuant to the ARIA on <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>January 2, 1998.

    <p id="b610-6" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[232,766,1166,880]]]'>The record supports Appellant’s assertion that she did not receive notice within the forty-five (45) to sixty (60) day window provided by statute. However, under the ARIA, an insurance company’s failure to notify its insured that it has submitted materials to the Commonwealth does not grant Appellant the remedy she seeks. The language of the statute does not expressly provide any remedy to Appellant for failure to receive notice. Section 1610.6 imposes criminal liability upon any person who violates provisions of the ARIA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Specifically exempted from liability are those individuals who violate sections 3(c)(1) and (2), the sections addressing notification to the insured.

One of our concerns in <em>DeJohn </em>was that bank customers supply personal information to a bank under a reasonable assumption that the information will remain confidential. <em>Id. </em>at 1290. In the instant case, Appellant was aware that the information sought was compiled as part of an ongoing investigation to determine the cause and origin of the fire. If the information compiled by investigators leads to the conclusion that a fire was sparked by an insured’s criminal act, we cannot say that it is proper for the insured to adopt a <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>reasonable assumption that such information will not be submitted to and used by law enforcement officials.</p>

When an insured files a claim for a loss, the insured seeks compensation for that loss, and the insurance company investigates the incident that caused the loss. That investigation may reveal information that allows the insurance company to deny the insured’s claim. This adversarial relationship is exceedingly antagonistic in a case such as this one where the incident that caused the loss was a fire, and the suspected cause is arson. As part of such an adversarial relationship, the insured cannot reasonably believe that the information compiled by investigators would remain confidential. This relationship is appreciably different from that of a bank and its customer where the records obtained were compiled and maintained in the ordinary course of business. As a result, we are not prepared to extend <em>DeJohn </em>to the present case. Appellant’s belief that evidence of arson would not be submitted to, and used by law enforcement officials, was not a reasonable one. Further, the ARIA clearly provides for the release of such information to law enforcement agencies.</p>

In <em>Ball, </em>an attorney for the defendant’s insurance company affirmatively warned the defendants that any disclosures made to their insurance company while conducting its arson investigation could be divulged to government investigators.

See, <em>e.g., Commonwealth v. DeJohn, </em><a href="/pa/486/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="486 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1757589" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0032-01">486 Pa. 32</a>, 45-49, <a href="/pa/486/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="486 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1757589" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0032-01">403 A.2d 1283</a>, 1289-92 (1979) (depositor has reasonable expectation that the information in his bank records will remain <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>confidential).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> I also believe that under ARIA an insurance company acts as an agent of the Commonwealth because ARIA specifically requires insurance companies to notify the Commonwealth of suspected arson and disclose to the Commonwealth, at the Commonwealth’s request, any information that an insured has provided to the company. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1610.3. Given these obligations under ARIA, I would find that in order to adequately protect an insured’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, once an insurance company suspects that an insured has committed arson, the insurance company must notify the insured that any information he or she provides to the company may be turned over to the Commonwealth. This notification should be required regardless of whether or not the Commonwealth has requested the insured’s information pursuant to ARIA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

At this time, State Farm was aware that the fire may have been the result of arson and was also aware of its responsibilities to provide Appellant’s information to the Commonwealth. I believe that <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>on January 3, 1996, before asking Appellant for her consent to take evidence from her home and to investigate her credit history, State F;, " u should have notified Appellant that any information derived from those actions would be disclosed to the Commonwealth. In light of the fact that Appellant was not warned that the information she provided to State Farm would be turned over to the Commonwealth, I agree with the trial court that Appellant did not knowingly waive her Fifth Amendment rights and therefore, the Commonwealth should be precluded from using this information or anything derived from the information. Given that the majority finds otherwise, I must respectfully dissent.</p>

I disagree with the majority (hat the relationship between an insurance company and an insured is clearly distinct from that between a bank and a depositor. Indeed, the view of the majority endorses the idea that the relationship between the insurance company and an insured must always be adversarial. Although the relationship between the insurance company and an insured may often become adversarial, the relationship between a bank and a depositor likewise may turn adversarial.</p>

      <p id="b614-6" data-blocks='[["BL_614.6",614,[245,1929,1162,422]]]'>. I do not believe, however, that an insurance company has to provide notice to the insured before giving the Commonwealth information that the insured has already voluntarily provided to the insurance company. I would find that notification is needed once the insurance company suspects arson because at that point, ARIA mandates that the company notify tire Commonwealth of its suspicion and disclose information given by the insured upon the Commonwealth’s request. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1610.3(b). Thus, in order to assure that the insured thereafter knowingly and voluntarily waives her Fifth Amendment rights, the insurance company should be required to notify the insured of its duties to tire Commonwealth under ARIA.</p>
