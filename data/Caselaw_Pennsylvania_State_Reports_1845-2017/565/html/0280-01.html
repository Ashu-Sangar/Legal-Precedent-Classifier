The Commonwealth subsequently amended the criminal information to add a charge of sexual assault.

The Commonwealth also agreed to dismiss all remaining charges. After conferring with counsel, Appellant rejected the proposed plea bargain and the case went to trial.

We read Section 9543(a)(2)(ii) to encompass all constitutionally-cognizable claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, i.e., all claims that the petitioner was deprived of his or her Sixth Amendment and Article I, Section 9 rights to counsel. We reiterate the position adopted by this Court in <em>Kimball </em>that the language “so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place” merely represents a statutory adoption of the prejudice standard for Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claims as developed in <em>Strickland.

In <em>Lantzy </em>and <em>Chester, </em>however, we declined to interpret Section 9543(a)(2)(ii) narrowly to preclude PCRA review of certain claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that would be eligible for relief in habeas corpus proceedings because such an interpretation would result in bifurcated collateral review. In other words, the claims of a petitioner that qualify under the PCRA would be subject to the pleading, proof, and timeliness requirements of the PCRA, but claims for which there is no remedy under the PCRA but which otherwise qualify for habeas corpus relief could be brought in a habeas petition that would not be subject to the same pleading, proof, and timeliness requirements applicable to PCRA claims. We <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>rejected this sort of bifurcation as inconsistent with legislative intent regarding post-conviction collateral review. <em>Lantzy, </em><a href="/a2d/736/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="736 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="11575941,838560" data-case-paths="/a2d/736/0564-01,/pa/558/0214-01">736 A.2d at 569</a>; <em>Chester, </em><a href="/a2d/733/1242-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="733 A.2d 1242" data-case-ids="11551778,56819" data-case-paths="/a2d/733/1242-01,/pa/557/0358-01">733 A.2d at 1251</a>. Our decision today to interpret Section 9543(a)(2)(ii) as applying to all constitutionally-cognizable claims of ineffective assistance of counsel similarly avoids a bifurcated collateral review process whereby some claims of ineffective assistance of counsel would be reviewed pursuant to PCRA standards, while other claims of ineffective assistance of counsel would be reviewable only in parallel habeas corpus proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[256,908,1164,743]]]'>In the present case, Appellant raised his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a habeas corpus petition because he believed, pursuant to Boyd,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> that the repeal of Section 9543(a)(2)(v) denied him the ability to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a PCRA petition. Because we now hold that such ineffectiveness claims are cognizable under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(ii), we will reverse and remand to the trial court to treat Appellant’s petition as a PCRA petition. Our caselaw makes clear that, where a remedy is available under the PCRA, one may not seek relief outside of the PCRA. <em>See Peterkin, </em><a href="/a2d/722/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="722 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="11773538,765982" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0638-01,/pa/554/0547-01">722 A.2d at 641</a>. Consequently, Appellant cannot use a habeas corpus petition to obtain review of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for which the PCRA provides a remedy.</p>

One of the issues addressed in <em>Peterkin </em>was whether the legislature had eliminated the writ of habeas corpus as a means of collateral attack of a criminal conviction when it enacted Section 9542 of the PCRA, which provides that the PCRA "shall be the sole means of obtaining collateral relief and encompasses all other common law and statutory remedies for the same purpose . .. including habeas corpus and coram nobis.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9542. In light of the prohibition in Article I, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution against suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and the provision in the habeas corpus statute that "[w]here a person is restrained by virtue of sentence after conviction for a criminal offense, the writ of habeas corpus shall not be available if a remedy may be had by post-conviction hearing proceedings authorized by law,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6503(b), we held that these constitutional and statutory provisions, when read together with 42 Pa.C.S. § 9542, demonstrated a legislative intent that the writ of habeas corpus remain viable as a means of collateral review of a criminal conviction only where the PCRA fails to provide a remedy. <em>See Peterkin, </em><a href="/a2d/722/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="722 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="11773538,765982" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0638-01,/pa/554/0547-01">722 A.2d at </a>639 — 40.</p>
