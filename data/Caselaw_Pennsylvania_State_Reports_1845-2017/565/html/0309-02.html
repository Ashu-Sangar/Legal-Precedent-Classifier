Looking to <em>Furman v.

The trial court found such structure missing in the Pennsylvania statute. Specifically, the court pointed to the statute’s failure to set forth a standard of proof, a requirement of unanimity, and an explanation of how within the deliberations of the jury victim impact testimony is to be considered. In addition, the court found that without a structure for the jury to channel its assessment of victim impact testimony, appellate review of the jury’s sentencing determination would be severely impeded. Thus, the court concluded that the statutory sections at issue were not sufficiently restrictive as they opened the jury to arbitrary and capricious considerations in the sentencing process that would evade meaningful appellate review. .</p>

Only after that initial decision has been reached on the existence of at least one aggravating circumstance, and if any of the jurors have found at least one mitigating circumstance can the jury consider victim impact testimony within the weighing process. Thus, appellant argues that the statute as written does not allow victim impact testimony to be used by the jury as a super aggravating circumstance. Appellant further asserts that there is no constitutional requirement that the jury be specifically instructed on how to weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances with all other relevant information at <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>issue before reaching its decision. <em>Zant v.

The basic question concerns the Eighth Amendment and Article 1, Section 13, insofar as these provisions broadly prohibit the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment. However, the discrete inquiry at bar infuses elements of due process and equal protection into that broader question. The constitutional challenge to the legislation at issue addresses the deliberative process by which a sentence of death is imposed in a case where the jury receives victim impact testimony. Thus, the question posed is whether the introduction of this evidence results in cruel and unusual punishment because the process by which the sentence is decided has been rendered fundamentally unfair, and has subjected similarly <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>situated defendants to unequal treatment. Because of the nature of the question posed, our discussion must weave the concepts of due process and equal protection throughout, although the primary focus is on the Eighth Amendment and Article 1, Section 13.

Victim impact testimony is not defined by the legislature as an aggravating circumstance, nor is it tied to a mitigating circumstance as relevant rebuttal to the character evidence offered by the defendant; therefore, it must be precluded from consideration as it will cause the constitutional balance of the sentencing scheme to be disrupted. Appellant counters this position by defining victim impact testimony as a consideration relevant to the selection stage of the sentencing scheme. It is not an aggravating factor, but only a foreseeable consequence of the criminal act in taking a life. As it is not an aggravating factor, there is no need to establish a burden of proof or to delineate additional instructions to the jury on how to weigh the information.

Policy is distilled through, among other things, observation of common practices, customs and legislation reflecting the will of the people. An example of common practice can be found in the courtrooms of this Commonwealth, where on a daily basis sentencing decisions are made after due consideration of the impact the defendant’s actions had on the physical, emotional and financial well-being of the victim. As a matter of custom, reflected in the rules of this court, pre-sentence reports containing victim impact statements are prepared in all non-capital cases. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1403A(4). This practice is of longstanding and reveals no basis to except those cases in which the victim has suffered a fatal injury at the hands of the defendant. Appellee argues that a distinction should be made on the basis that a jurist imposes sentence in a non-capital case while a jury normally serves that function in a capital case. This argument presumes that judges are trained to remain objective, while the average juror is susceptible to passion and bias after hearing emotional testimony from the <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>victim’s family. This argument is of little merit. A pillar upon which our system of trial by jury is based is, that juries are presumed to follow the instructions of the court. <em>Commonwealth v. Baker, </em><a href="/pa/531/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="203" data-cite="531 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1834316" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0541-01">531 Pa. 541</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="204" data-cite="531 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1834316" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0541-01">614 A.2d 663</a>, 672 (1992). Trial judges are uniformly capable of restricting the admission of relevant evidence to only that information which is essential to the issue at hand, devoid of inflammatory, unessential data. <em>Commonwealth v. Holland, </em><a href="/pa/518/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="205" data-cite="518 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1811671" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0405-01">518 Pa. 405</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="518 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1811671" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0405-01">543 A.2d 1068</a>, 1071 (1988). We believe the traditional practices of this Commonwealth regarding inclusion of victim impact testimony in non-capital cases support admission of such information in capital cases, under the control of the trial judge.</p>

Our learned colleague in the dissent argues that the Pennsylvania statutory scheme at issue violates the fundamental fairness provision of the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Specifically, the dissent finds fault with the legislative scheme as it permits the introduction of victim impact testimony in all death cases. The dissent argues that victim impact testimony should only be admissible in those cases where a defendant has placed his own character at issue by offering mitigating evidence under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8) (a defendant may present "[a]ny other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense”.). We respectfully point out. that the legislative scheme at issue is consistent with the majority of states that permit t'ictim impact testimony to be admitted. Further, we note that the framework endorsed by the dissent, following upon the New Jersey legislative scheme, forces the defendant to make the Hobson's choice of presenting character evidence in mitigation and then facing victim impact testimony, or foregoing such mitigation evidence in order to block presentation of victim impact testimony. We believe our legislature chose the fairer course. By allowing victim impact testimony in all death penalty cases, the defense can be forearmed in its penalty phase preparation rather than hamstrung in choosing between a rock and a hard place.</p>
