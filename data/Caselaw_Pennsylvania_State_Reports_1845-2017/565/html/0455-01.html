In connection with the murder conviction, a sentencing hearing was held, as required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711, and appellant was sentenced to death. Terms of imprisonment were imposed for the other offenses. The present direct appeal ensued. We affirm.</p>

When the officers approached the vehicle, appellant emerged, grabbed one of the officers’ guns, and began shooting. Appellant shot one officer in the head and abdomen, causing his death. He shot the other officer in the head and back, rendering him a paraplegic. At the time of this incident, appellant was acting as a drug courier and was transporting cocaine in the vehicle.</p>

The appropriate time for making a <em>Batson </em>challenge was during voir dire. Appellant waited until the post-trial motion stage to raise this matter for the first time. Failure to object to the prosecutor’s use of peremptory challenges during voir dire <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>results in a waiver of the issue. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Further, appellant has not provided a scintilla of proof that any improper exclusion of jurors in fact occurred. It was appellant’s obligation to make a record that would permit review of a <em>Batson </em>challenge. <em>Commonwealth v. Spence, </em><a href="/pa/534/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="534 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="1839654,1839660" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0233-01,/pa/534/0233-02">534 Pa. 233</a>, 246-47, <a href="/pa/534/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="534 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="1839654,1839660" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0233-01,/pa/534/0233-02">627 A.2d 1176</a>, 1182-83 (1993). The transcript of the voir dire, however, contains no references to the race of any of the prospective jurors. The racial composition of the jury that convicted appellant was established during a hearing on post-trial motions. Seven of the twelve jurors were black and five were white. Appellant is black. Nothing in the record indicates the race of any of the jurors who were not selected to serve, but it is clear that the majority of the chosen jury was of appellant’s own race. Appellant has utterly failed to present a cognizable <em>Batson </em>claim.</p>
    <p id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.4",619,[220,1432,1154,743]]]'>Appellant’s next contention concerns an outburst that occurred when the verdict of guilt as to murder of the first degree was announced. When the verdict was read, spectators in the courtroom cheered to show their approval. The court immediately stopped the outburst and admonished the spectators, stating, “Wait a minute, this is a courtroom, this is not a stadium. Now, 1 don’t care if you’re a policeman or the President of the United States, keep your mouth shut.” Proceedings were then adjourned for the day. Appellant contends that the outburst biased the jury towards finding in favor of a sentence of death at the subsequent penalty hearing and that the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial and his motion to direct a verdict in favor of a sentence of life imprisonment. We do not agree.</p>

The jury's sentencing verdict as to the death penalty was rendered in ■ February of 1995, but, due to various postponements and the death of <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>the trial judge, sentencing by the court did not occur until November of 1998. The proportionality of appellant’s sentence is not subject to review, therefore, because sentence was imposed after June 25, 1997, to wit, tire effective date of the repeal of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(iii), pursuant to which proportionality review was required. <em>Commonwealth v.
