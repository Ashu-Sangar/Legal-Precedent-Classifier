    <p id="b327-4" data-blocks='[["BL_327.4",327,[225,517,1157,1444]]]'>Durham contends, however, that assistant district attorneys do not have the immunity that has been afforded district attorneys. In particular, he asserts that assistant district attorneys are not “high public officials,” inasmuch as they serve only at the will of their employer and have only the authority delegated by the district attorney and are not policy-making officials. Assistant district attorneys, however, are essential to district attorneys in fulfilling responsibilities of their high public offices, to wit, in carrying out the prosecutorial function. To nbject assistant district attorneys acting on behalf of the disc „ct attorney to liability would deter all but the most courageous and most judgment-proof from vigorously performing their prosecutorial functions, and would inevitably result in criminals going unpunished. See <em>Matson, </em>supra. The fact that assistant district attorneys, unlike their principal, the district attorney, are not known for policy-making functions is not pivotal to the immunity determination. As we noted in <em>Lindner, </em><a href="/pa/544/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="544 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="463576" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0487-01">544 Pa. at 496</a>, <a href="/pa/544/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="677 A.2d 1194" data-case-ids="463576,7876119" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0487-01,/a2d/677/1194-01">677 A.2d at 1198</a>, the “high public official” umbrella of immunity has in many instances been extended to a wide range of public officials whose policy-making roles were not salient. While it is often the case that “high public officials” have policy-making functions, that is not the sole or overriding factor in determining the scope of immunity. Rather, it is the public interest in seeing that the official not be impeded in the performance of important duties that is pivotal. That interest dictates that assistant district attorneys be immune from suit.</p>
