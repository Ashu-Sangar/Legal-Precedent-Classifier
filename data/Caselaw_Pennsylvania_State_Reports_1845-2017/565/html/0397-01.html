Hellam Township Ordinance No. 1995-10, §§ 2 and 5. Commercial and industrial development were also prohibited, but only to the extent that such development was not serviceable by the existing public sewer system. <em>Id. </em>at § 3.

The zoning officer rejected the plans on the grounds that they appeared to have been submitted under the ordinances being revised rather than the pending ordinances and that they failed to comply with the pending ordinances.

Appellants asserted that neither the MPC nor the Second Class Township Code, Act of May 1, 1933, P.L. 103, <em>as reenacted and amended, </em>53 P.S. §§ 65101-68701, authorized the enactment of a moratorium ordinance, and therefore the ordinance was invalid as a matter of law.

Even construing the provisions of the MPC liberally, we find that the power to <em>enact </em>a zoning ordinance, for whatever purpose, does not necessarily include the power to <em>suspend </em>a valid zoning ordinance to the prejudice of a land owner. <em>Compare </em>53 P.S. § 10609.2 (express grant of authority for municipality to invalidate zoning ordinance for period not to exceed 180 days while it enacts curative amendment). More significantly, the power to <em>suspend </em>land development has historically been viewed in this Commonwealth as a power distinct from and not incidental to any power to <em>regulate </em>land development.

The Board knew that once they announced a new proposed comprehensive plan that substantially altered the existing plan, landowners and developers would flood the Board with applications for subdivision and development pursuant to the existing plan.

I do not believe the legislature intended to place such a burden on municipalities and their planning boards. The Majority’s narrow interpretation of the MPC is unsubstantiated by the MPC’s broad purpose and, “if enforced, would serve to hinder or reduce governing bodies’ ability to effectuate the express purposes of the act, such as coordinated growth, development which follows the comprehensive plan, and proactive problem solving.” <em>Naylor, </em><a href="/a2d/717/0629-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="717 A.2d 629" data-case-ids="12119510" data-case-paths="/a2d/717/0629-01">717 A.2d at 633</a>.</p>

The moratorium was enacted on July 20, 1995 and expired by its own terms on July 25, 1996. While the Board did extend the life of the moratorium by two months on August 1, 1996, the new comprehensive plan became effective September 5,1996. Considering the Board was attempting to make a substantial modification to the subdivision and development ordinance, I believe that thirteen months is a reasonably limited time to impose this moratorium. The Board acted in good faith in enacting the moratorium. The Board noted that it was in the interest of the public to prevent the purpose of the revised comprehensive plan from being defeated via continued development and subdivision. In addition, the moratorium served to ensure adequate public sewer capacity and to promote sanitary sewage disposal. Finally, there is no evidence that the moratorium is discriminatory.
