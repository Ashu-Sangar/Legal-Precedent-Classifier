    <p id="b245-4" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[241,507,1158,1481]]]'>Initially, our examination of the written colloquy reveals two errors that we find are of grave consequence. We note that Appellant did not plead guilty, but rather pleaded <em>nolo contendere. </em>Colloquy question number 20 asks “Do you understand that by pleading guilty, you are admitting that you committed the crimes charges? [sic]” and question number 58 asks “Do you admit that you committed the crimes with which you are charged and to which you are pleading guilty?” At the plea hearing, counsel crossed off Appellant’s “Yes” answers and wrote in “Nolo” next to both of these questions. Appellant apparently then initialed both of these answers at the court’s request. Not a single question of the 59 listed on the colloquy addresses the plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>and the ramifications of entering such a plea. Examples of this deficiency are: question number 18 which reads “Do you fully understand that by pleading guilty you are giving up all of these rights described in the previous questions?”; question number 22, “By pleading guilty you give up certain rights of appeal ...”; and question number 47, “Do you understand that when you plead guilty and your plea is accepted by the Court, all that remains is for the Court to sentence you on the charges to which your [sic] are pleading, but if your plea is rejected, your case will be sent back for reassignment to another judge for trial?” We find it critical that this colloquy makes no mention of the plea Appellant actually entered. If anything, Appellant’s plea and answers to the colloquy indicate that he was aware of the consequences of pleading guilty and was seeking to avoid them.</p>
    <p id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[246,2012,1152,361]],["BL_246.1",246,[252,324,1164,464]]]'>The second deficiency of the colloquy is that two crucial answers were changed. Question number 50 asks, “Are you doing this of your own free will?” The answer appears to be “No” crossed out and replaced by “Yes”. Question number 56 asks, “Are you presently taking any medication which might affect your thinking or your free will?” This time it appears that “Yes” was crossed out and replaced by “No”. Appellant <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>testified at the hearing on his petition to withdraw the plea that, “I felt I wasn’t doing this on my own free will, that’s why I put no and [counsel] says I have to put yes down on there so I crossed it out and I put yes down.” While we acknowledge that the initial responses may have been erroneously entered by Appellant and then corrected, we are extremely concerned that Appellant was not questioned further about these answers for the sake of determining, on the record, that the plea was being entered of his own free will.</p>

Nevertheless, counsel advised Appellant that he did not have to enter a plea and, during the hearing to withdraw the plea, testified that she would have been prepared to proceed to trial if necessary.
