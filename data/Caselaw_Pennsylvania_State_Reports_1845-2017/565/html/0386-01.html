The Tempo crossed the line dividing the two-way road and collided, head-on, with Davis’ fully loaded tractor-trailer. The tractor-trailer traveled up an embankment and turned onto its right side.</p>
    <p id="b549-6" data-blocks='[["BL_549.6",549,[237,1117,1153,366]]]'>From the scene of the accident, an ambulance took Davis to the local hospital, where hospital staff examined, x-rayed, and discharged him the same morning with a prescription to obtain medication for pain. Davis testified that he was in pain over the weekend, but that <em>on </em>Monday, March 20, 1995, he resumed his ten hour-a-day, five to seven day-a-week, work schedule driving the tractor-trailer.</p>

Davis reported to Dr. Owens that he had pain in his low back and neck and a tingling feeling running down his leg. Dr. Owens diagnosed Davis with a muscle spasm and misalignment of the cervical spine. After twenty visits with Dr. Owens, Davis stopped treatment and has not sought any further therapy or taken any pain medication for the injuries.</p>
    <p id="b549-8" data-blocks='[["BL_549.8",549,[237,1960,1152,418]]]'>On March 6, 1997, Davis sued Mullen for damages arising out of the accident. At trial, Mullen admitted liability for the accident, but disputed the extent of Davis’ injury. Dr. Owens testified that he could not say for certain if the spinal injury was related to the accident or from another cause, including any one of the three prior automobile accidents that Davis admitted to being involved in. Davis denied that the other accidents caused his injuries.</p>
