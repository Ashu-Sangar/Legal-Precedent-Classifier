The testimony, which was substantially uncontradicted, established that the kilns are used continuously and exclusively to remove moisture from pre-cut, green lumber to a greater degree than could be accomplished by conventional, open-air drying, thereby rendering the wood suitable for commercial sale and use in a broad range of applications which the wood would not otherwise support. The facility includes large, insulated physical structures (measuring 32 to 37 feet in width, 66 to 123 feet in length, and 22 feet in height) into which quantities of lumber are stacked, frequently for substantial time periods (depending upon the type of wood and customer requirements, the drying process may last from a few days to more than a month); three-million-BTU heating systems (frequently generating temperatures of 120 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) to draw the moisture from the wood; and exhaust/ventilation systems designed to control airflow and eliminate saturated air from the enclosed structures. In addition to the main components, the dry kilns possess numerous additional specialized features, including computer controls and monitoring equipment to adjust interior environment conditions to facilitate even, efficacious drying; interior skins of aluminum alloy and other special alloy structural and non-structural components; concrete flooring capable of supporting concentrated loading; loading doors described as movable walls equipped to be hermetically sealed; systems of fans integrated into false ceilings, as well as bulkheads and baffles in the chambers, directing airflow; motorized roof vents; and high-pressure water-spraying systems employed to equalize the moisture content in the controlled environment. Assembly of the kilns was accomplished on the BFC premises utilizing pre-manufactured, pre-drilled components which can be disassembled for purposes of relocation. Three of the kilns were erected in 1993 and annexed, via plastic weatherproofing, to a storage building, whereas the remaining two were built freestanding in 1997. The dry kilns lack conventional services such as running water, sewage, or heating. From a witness with experience in the manufacture and marketing of dry kilns, BFC elicited testimony that these particular kilns are not well <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>suited to applications other than the drying of lumber, although the common pleas court did not permit extensive development of this line of questioning.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> BFC’s entire facility consists of the dry kilns, an office, storage buildings, and undeveloped real estate.</p>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[251,609,1166,622]]]'>After the conclusion of the hearing, the common pleas court agreed with the Board that BFC’s dry kilns were not excluded from assessment under Section 201(a) of the Law. In its opinion, the court emphasized its conclusion that the dry kilns are not “contained in” any mill, manufactory, or industrial establishment, but rather, constitute the <em>“sine qua non </em>of the business.” Further, after acknowledging the Board’s citation to a Commonwealth Court decision holding that, for purposes of the Capital Stock Tax Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the business of kiln drying lumber did not constitute manufacturing or processing, <em>see Commonwealth v.

Perhaps this is a strained analogy, but one wonders if the kilns are <em>not </em>manufact<em>uring </em>elements of the kiln drying business and are <em>not </em>real estate — -just what are they?</blockquote>

BFC acknowledges that the dry kilns possess incorporated structural elements, but nevertheless, contends that controlling significance should be afforded to the functioning of each kiln as an integrated unit in the performance of BFC’s sole industrial occupation. Citing this Court’s seminal decisions in <em>In re Borough of Aliquippa (Jones &amp; Laughlin Tax Assessment Case), </em>405 Pa.421, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%20856" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="175 A.2d 856">175 A.2d 856</a> (Pa.1961), and <em>United States Steel Corp. v.

More specifically, BFC posits that the integrated components of dry kilns perform a chemical process analogous to that involved in the refinement of oil, which was deemed to be a manufacturing process in <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/357/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="357 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="472073" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0101-01">357 Pa. 101</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20250" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="53 A.2d 250">53 A.2d 250</a> (1947). According to BFC, the Commonwealth Court’s <em>Babcock </em>decision is distinguishable on the ground that the Capital Stock Tax Act’s exemption prescription for manufacturing and processing is considerably narrower in scope than the exclusion for industrial establishments prevailing under the Law. Finally, BFC cites an Internal Revenue Service revenue ruling <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>advising that dry kilns are not considered buildings for federal investment credit purposes, but rather, are essentially items of machinery or equipment for such purposes. <em>See </em>Rev. Rul. 69-557 1969-<a href="/citations/?q=2%20C.B.%203" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 C.B. 3">2 C.B. 3</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=1969%20WL%2019060" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1969 WL 19060">1969 WL 19060</a>.</p>
    <p id="b232-4" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[262,554,1159,742]]]'>The Board, on the other hand, maintains that dry kilns do not qualify for the exclusion expressed under Section 201(a), as, it claims, they may be reasonably utilized for purposes other than the drying of wood, such as storage. Further, according to the Board, to qualify for the exclusion as machinery or equipment used in an industrial establishment under Section 201(a), a business must utilize raw elements to produce a new and different product, whereas, in its dry kilns, BFC does not alter the basic properties of wood, but rather, merely extracts moisture from it. The Board disputes BFC’s assertion that evaporation entails a chemical process and highlights the common pleas court’s citation to <em>Babcock, </em>1 Pa.Cmwlth. at 45, <a href="/citations/?q=272%20A.2d%20522" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="272 A.2d 522">272 A.2d at 522</a>, concerning the status of kiln drying for purposes of capital stock taxation.</p>

The amendatory language of the statute, however, establishes an express exclusion where the following two requirements are met: 1) the property at issue must constitute machinery, tools, appliances, or other equipment; and 2) the property must be contained in a mill, mine, manufactory, or industrial establishment. 72 P.S. § 5453.201(a); <em>see Borough of Aliquippa, </em>405 Pa. at 432, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%20856" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="175 A.2d 856">175 A.2d at 862</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

      <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>Beginning with the latter of these criteria, while BFC does not purport that its facilities should be deemed to be a “mill” or “mine,” and does not press the assertion that they constitute a “manufactory,” its essential position is that the facilities do constitute an “industrial establishment.” In defining such term, this Court has applied an approach emphasizing general usage and understanding. <em>See, e.g., North Side Laundry Co. v.

Indeed, in emphasizing its point that BFC’s dry kilns are its core business asset, the common pleas court affirmatively indicated that “[t]hese kilns <em>are </em>essentially ‘the industrial establishment’ ” (emphasis in original).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Although the common pleas <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>court focused upon the use in Section 201(a) of the phrase “contained in” to hold, effectively, that the kilns constitute too great a component of BFC’s facility to merit their exclusion from assessment, we note that, in fact, the site also consists of office space, storage, and undeveloped real estate. More important, this Court has explained that the “contained in an industrial establishment” phraseology was employed by the Legislature precisely to <em>avoid </em>technical questions as to what constitutes industrial processing or manufacturing which had arisen from the General Assembly’s use of the phrase “used in manufacturing” in other assessment statutes. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=321%20A.2d%20387" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="321 A.2d 387">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=321%20A.2d%20387" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="321 A.2d 387">at 431</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%20856" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="175 A.2d 856">175 A.2d at 861</a>.

A historical perspective concerning Section 201's exclusionary provision also supports the conclusion that BFC's facilities constitute an industrial establishment. Prior to Section 201’s effective date, the significance of this label was to invoke the “assembled industrial plant doctrine,” fashioned by the judiciary', in the context of valuation and assessment decisions in local real estate taxation, to require the inclusion of machinery and equipment essential to the operation of a business, whether or not attached to the underlying realty, within the real estate assessment for an industrial enterprise. <em>See Borough of Aliquippa, </em>405 Pa. at 425-26, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%20856" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="175 A.2d 856">175 A.2d at 858-59</a>. <em>See generally Voorhis v.

This doctrine of liberal inclusion was applied not only to manufactories in the traditional sense, but also to other forms of businesses involved in production and processing of an industrial character. For example, in the laundry cases, the Court had determined that the machinery and equipment of commercial laundries, whether or not attached to realty, was subject to assessment. <em>See, e.g., North Side Laundry, </em><a href="/pa/366/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="366 Pa. 636" data-case-ids="8846212" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0636-01">366 Pa. at 639-40</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.2d%20419" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="79 A.2d 419">79 A.2d at 421</a>. The General Assembly, however, devised the 1953 amendments to Section 201(a) to abolish this doctrine of <em>inclusion </em>in favor of a prescription which expressly required the <em>exclusion </em>of attached or unattached machinery or equipment for purposes of local real estate valuation and assessment, and this Court discerned that the clear legislative purpose , was to provide a form of tax relief to encourage new industrial operations and retain existing ones within the Commonwealth. <em>See Borough of Aliquippa, </em>405 Pa. at 429-30, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%20856" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="175 A.2d 856">175 A.2d at 860-61</a>.
