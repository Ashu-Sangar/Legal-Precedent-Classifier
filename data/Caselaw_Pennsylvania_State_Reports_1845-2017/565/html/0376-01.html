His wife, a resident in obstetrics and gynecology, felt what appeared to be a four-centimeter mass in his lower abdomen. Zieber went to the emergency room of Roxborough Memorial Hospital and was examined by Dr. J. Norris Childs. Dr. Childs felt the mass in Zieber’s stomach and ordered <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>blood drawn. He later contacted Zieber’s primary care physician, Dr. Arthur Bogert, and recommended that he order a CT scan with intravenous (“IV”) contrast, a barium enema and an upper G.I. study.</p>

Dr. Bogert later informed Zieber that the studies had con-finned his prior diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and that his condition could be managed by adjustments to his diet.

Due to a switch in health insurance plans, Zieber went to see Dr. Joan Lit, a participating provider of his new plan. Dr. Lit felt the mass in Zieber’s lower abdomen and ultimately ordered a C-T scan with IV contrast. The scan revealed a large soft tissue mass, suggesting a lymphoma of the small bowel and numerous enlarged lymph nodes. Exploratory surgery confirmed that Zieber had a large cell lymphoma. The surgery also revealed two masses in his abdomen, one measuring eleven centimeters and the other measuring six centimeters. The larger tumor had invaded the bowel and created an obstruction. Zieber underwent surgical removal of the two masses as well as large sections of his colon and small and large intestines. Aggressive chemotherapy followed, which caused life-threatening side effects. Zieber was thereafter placed on a more conventional regimen and later achieved remission of the disease.</p>

Dr. Weiss explained that a patient achieves complete remission when a C-T scan reveals no cancer, although microscopic cancer cells may remain in the patient’s body at that time. Zieber testified as to his fear and mental anguish arising from this increased risk. Additionally, the trial court instructed the jury that this was Appellees’ “one day in court,” and therefore the jury should consider what Zieber’s harm might be in the future as a result of what transpired in this case.</p>

As an element of damages, the plaintiffs sought relief for increased risk and fear of cancer. Unlike the instant case, none of the plaintiffs had contracted mesothelioma or cancer at the time the suits were filed. Instead, they were all diagnosed with asbestos-related pleural thickening, which is the formation of calcified tissue on the membranes surrounding the lungs. Although the condition is detectable by x-ray, it did not cause any lung impairment. The issue for review was whether asymptomatic pleural thickening, i.e., a condition unaccompanied by disabling consequences or physical impairment, is a compensable injury.</p>

    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[251,1476,1166,891]]]'>We explained that the “two-diseaw' rule” in asbestos exposure cases permitted a plaintiff to commence separate causes of action for separate asbestos related diseases — one cause of action for a nonmalignant asbestos related disease which had become manifest and another cause of action for the subsequent development of a separate malignant disease such as lung cancer or mesothelioma. <em>Simmons </em>at 237. The rule was intended to remedy the inequities that arose in cases involving latent diseases that did not surface until years after the initial exposure. Prior to the adoption of the rule, the cause of action for asbestos exposure accrued at the time the first sign of asbestos-related disease was discovered, when the plaintiff might be unaware of the extent of the resulting harm. Based on the unique construct of these cases, we held that the diagnosis of asymptomatic pleural thickening had no statute of limitations ramifications regarding a claim alleging a nonmalignant physiological impairment.</p>

As noted, however, this was not the foundation upon which <em>Simmons </em>rested. Rather, the decision was based on the lack of physical injury and the ability of the plaintiffs, pursuant to the two-disease rule, to file a second action if and when the symptoms arise. Neither of these conditions exist in the instant case. Our decision in <em>Simmons </em>expressly recognized that a plaintiff could seek damages for his mental anguish for fear and increased risk of cancer if and when the cancer develops. <em>Id. </em>at 678, <a href="/pa/543/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="674 A.2d 232" data-case-ids="461530,7859514" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0664-01,/a2d/674/0232-01">674 A.2d 232</a>.

We likewise reject Appellants' contention that the two-disease rule has been adopted without restriction in medical malpractice cases.

In <em>Swain, </em>the plaintiff filed a medical malpractice action, alleging the negligence of a physician in failing to properly diagnose her breast cancer. The physician relied on Florida case law providing that a plaintiff exposed to asbestos may not recover for increased risk of cancer until the patient contracts cancer. He argued that the plaintiff’s claims for fear and increased risk of recurrence of cancer were premature, as there was no evidence of metastasis of the disease. The court rejected the physician’s argument and distinguished toxic tort cases from those involving medical malpractice. The court held that the recovery sought for increased risk of cancer is not a cause of action in itself, but is an element of the damages incurred due to the physician's negligence.</p>
