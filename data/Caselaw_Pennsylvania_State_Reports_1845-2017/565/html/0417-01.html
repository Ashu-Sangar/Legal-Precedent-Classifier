Also present were Cecil Jackson and his brother Edward. Cecil Jackson was a childhood friend of Ligons and the boyfriend of his mother, who lived next door at 322 North Horton Street. The Jackson brothers routinely teased Ligons and were doing so on this occasion. Ligons ultimately left the porch, later telephoning Ms. Williams to advise her that he was going to do something and that he might not return. Ms. Williams observed Ligons <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>leaving his grandmother’s home at 312 North Horton Street and noticed that he was dressed entirely in black.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The caller did not provide a telephone number, stating that he was calling from a neighbor’s home. Shortly thereafter, the caller telephoned again, placing a second order for drinks to be delivered at the same address. At approximately 11:30, Clarence Johnson was given the order for delivery, along with $10.00 with which to make change. Mr. Johnson’s wife, Sonja, accompanied him.</p>

As Mr. Johnson began to climb the steps leading to the porch for the residence, Ligons, who was dressed in black and wearing a ski mask, emerged from an adjacent alley, approached Mr. Johnson from behind, and pushed him onto the porch and against a wall. Holding a gun to Mr. Johnson’s head, Ligons stated, “you know what this is.” When Mrs. Johnson opened the car door, Ligons threatened to kill her husband if she moved. Ligons demanded Mr. Johnson’s money and then pushed him off the porch and into the alley. Mrs. Johnson was able to observe the incident, as she was approximately seven to ten feet from Ligons, and the alley was illuminated by streetlights. In addition, although Ligons was wearing a ski mask, the area around his eyes was exposed, allowing Mrs. Johnson to discern certain of his facial features. Mr. Johnson handed over his money, and Ligons began checking his pockets for any additional money. Ligons turned to Mrs. Johnson and asked whether she had any money, to which she responded that her husband had given Ligons everything. Ligons then taunted Mr. Johnson, repeatedly asking him whether he wanted to live, with Johnson pleading for his life. <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>Ligons responded by shooting Mr. Johnson in the back of the head and fleeing down the alley toward North Horton Street.</p>
    <p id="b582-5" data-blocks='[["BL_582.4",582,[248,459,1165,953]]]'>Residents at the scene called the police, and, within minutes of the shooting, an officer arrived, finding Mir. Johnson in the alley and lying in a pool of blood. Mrs. Johnson described the perpetrator to police as an African American male with a light complexion, hazel colored eyes, approximately five feet eight inches in height, weighing 150-165 pounds, and wearing a ski mask, black Timberland boots, and black clothing. Mr. Johnson was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead; an autopsy confirmed the cause of death as a single gunshot to the back of his head. Forensic analysis of Mr. Johnson’s clothing, in particular, a bandana, indicated that the gun was fired within six to twelve inches of his head. At the scene, police recovered a 9mm casing and a bullet that was consistent with either a .38 caliber or 9mm firearm. In addition, police received an anonymous tip that the perpetrator was located at the residence of either 312 or 322 North Horton Street. Officers knocked on the door of the home, but no one responded.</p>
    <p id="b582-6" data-blocks='[["BL_582.5",582,[244,1461,1165,796]]]'>Following the shooting, Ligons telephoned Ms. Williams, asking her to call a taxicab for him, stating that he thought that he had killed someone, and explaining that the victim had pulled a gun on him. In subsequent conversations with Ms. Williams, Ligons threatened her, on one occasion declaring, “I took a life and don’t you think that I won’t kill again.” As a result, Ms. Williams and her mother left the area to stay with relatives in Salisbury, Maryland. Upon learning of Ms. Williams’ departure, Ligons telephoned the residence of her cousin, Keith Wright, in an attempt to speak with Ms. Williams.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In his conversations with Mr. Wright, Ligons admitted to having killed someone to obtain money to impress Ms. Williams and acknowledged that a woman was present during the crime, but that he was not concerned because he had been wearing a mask.</p>

      <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>Mr. Wright contacted the police, and on April 10, 1998, two detectives traveled to Salisbury, Maryland to interview him and Ms. Williams. Ms. Williams told the detectives of her telephone conversation with Ligons on the night of the murder and of her observations of him shortly thereafter. In addition, Ms. Williams said that, a day or two before the murder, she had overheard Edward Jackson mention that he had a gun, and, on the night of the murder, she had seen Mr. Jackson leave 322 North Horton Street carrying what appeared to be an object wrapped in a jacket, which he then took to Ligons’ house at 312 North Horton Street. Based upon the information supplied by Mr. Wright and Ms. Williams, the police obtained an arrest warrant for Ligons and search warrants for both 312 and 322 North Horton Street.</p>
    <p id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[220,1081,1155,418]]]'>Ligons was arrested at 312 North Horton Street; in his pocket the police found a matchbook with the number for Stavros Pizza written on the inside cover. In addition, police recovered a pair of black boots from the basement of the residence. During the search of 322 North Horton Street, the police recovered menus from Stavros Pizza in the living room of the home. Ligons was charged with murder, robbery, and possession of an instrument of crime.</p>
    <p id="b583-6" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[220,1524,1156,846]],["BL_584.1",584,[260,323,1158,253]]]'>Following his arrest, the police questioned Ligons regarding the crime. Ligons admitted his involvement, stating that he and Ms. Williams had argued and that she was planning to return to Maryland, and he thought that if he could give her some money she would stay. In addition, Ligons said that his grandmother had been hospitalized, that there were a number of bills, and that he did not want her to lose her home. As a result, he decided to call for a pizza and rob the deliveryman, choosing Stavros because he had a menu from that establishment. Ligons indicated that Cecil Jackson had placed the order, and that Edward Jackson had supplied the gun. Furthermore, Ligons’ description of the clothing he wore during the crime was consistent with that described by Mrs. Johnson. Concerning the robbery, Ligons said that he waited for the pizza delivery, and when Mr. Johnson arrived, Ligons explained that he jumped out and announced that it was a <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>robbery. However, Ligons claimed that Johnson had threatened him and brandished a gun. In response, Ligons stated that he pointed.his gun toward Mr. Johnson’s head and that the next thing he knew it discharged. Ligons denied having taken anything from Johnson.</p>
    <p id="b584-5" data-blocks='[["BL_584.4",584,[255,602,1161,788]]]'>Prior to trial, the Commonwealth notified Ligons of its intention to seek the death penalty, asserting as an aggravating circumstance the occurrence of the murder during the perpetration of a felony, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), namely, robbery. At trial, the Commonwealth presented testimony from the investigating police officers and detectives concerning the crime scene and Ligons’ statement. Testimony was also presented from Ms. Williams and Mr. Wright. In the case of Ms. Williams, however, she recanted portions of her statement to- the police. The Commonwealth therefore introduced hér prior statement through the detective who interviewed her. In addition, the Commonwealth presented expert testimony regarding the cause of death, the approximate distance at which the shooting occurred, and the type of weapon used in committing the crime.</p>
    <p id="b584-6" data-blocks='[["BL_584.5",584,[253,1415,1160,953]],["BL_585.1",585,[239,325,1153,311]]]'>Mrs. Johnson also testified, describing her observations at the time of the crime and indicating that she had identified Ligons from a photographic array. Defense counsel objected to the testimony concerning the photographic identification, as the Commonwealth had not disclosed such evidence during discovery. The Commonwealth responded by asserting that Mrs. Johnson’s testimony was unexpected and that she must be mistaken. The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard such evidence. On cross-examination of Mrs. Johnson, however, defense counsel elicited additional testimony respecting the alleged photographic identification. The Commonwealth responded by introducing rebuttal testimony from the investigating detectives, who asserted that a photographic identification was not conducted. The defense did not present any witnesses, and Ligons elected not to testify. In his summation, defense counsel argued that the inconsistency between Mrs. Johnson’s testimony and that of the detectives bore upon her credibility. In her argument, <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>the prosecutor suggested that the jurors disregard the identification testimony of Mrs. Johnson, and the trial court instructed the jury that they must consider her identification testimony with caution. The jury found Ligons guilty of first-degree murder, robbery, and possession of an instrument of crime, and the case proceeded to a sentencing hearing.</p>
    <p id="b585-4" data-blocks='[["BL_585.4",585,[239,660,1152,1711]],["BL_586.1",586,[244,326,1159,203]]]'>During that hearing, the Commonwealth incorporated the record from the guilt phase of the trial in support of the alleged aggravating circumstance, namely, that the murder occurred during the commission of a robbery. As mitigating circumstances, Ligons offered his lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions, his youth at the time of the crime, and the catchall circumstance. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1), (4), (8). In support, Ligons presented testimony from Ms. Williams, who had a child with him and described him as a good father. Ligons also offered testimony from his mother, who stated that he grew up without a father and had difficulty adjusting to her relationship with Cecil Jackson. Ligons’ grandmother testified, however, that his mother did not love him, characterizing their relationship as strained. Ligons’ grandmother also testified that he was a good person and helped her around the house. Finally, Allen Tepper, Ph.D., a psychologist, opined that Ligons had difficulty adjusting to his mother’s relationship with Cecil Jackson, and that Ligons felt abandoned. Dr. Tepper noted that there were also reports of Ligons having been physically abused by his mother. In her closing remarks, the prosecutor noted that the jurors did not hear testimony concerning Mr. Johnson, who could no longer be with his family and who had been only 31 years old and attempting to earn a living. In addition, the prosecutor explained that, in weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the Commonwealth must prove the aggravator beyond a reasonable doubt, while the defense need only “tip the scale a little bit.” The prosecutor thus characterized the death penalty statute as emphasizing the imposition of a life sentence. The trial court, however, instructed the jury regarding the respective burdens associated with the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, noting that such <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>procedure acts as a safeguard against the imposition of unjust death sentences. The jury returned with a verdict of death, finding the aggravating circumstance submitted by the Commonwealth and no mitigating circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b586-5" data-blocks='[["BL_586.4",586,[242,555,1160,524]]]'>On appeal, Ligons claims that the Commonwealth failed to disclose evidence of a photographic identification by Mrs. Johnson, and that when she testified to such identification, the trial court should have granted a mistrial or, in the alternative, stricken the testimony at issue and instructed the jury to disregard it. Ligons further contends that he is entitled to a new penalty hearing as a result of the prosecutor’s arguments inviting the jury to consider victim impact evidence and characterizing the death penalty statute as geared in favor of imposing a life sentence.</p>
    <p id="b586-6" data-blocks='[["BL_586.5",586,[237,1113,1165,903]]]'>Although not raised as an issue by Ligons, in all cases in which the death penalty has been imposed, we review the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, </em><a href="/pa/500/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="500 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1781169" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0016-01">500 Pa. 16</a>, 26 n. 3, <a href="/pa/500/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="500 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1781169" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0016-01">454 A.2d 937</a>, 942 n. 3 (1982). To establish murder in the first degree, the Commonwealth must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendant specifically intended to kill, which fact is established by proof of premeditation and deliberation. <em>See Commonwealth v. Weinstein, </em><a href="/pa/499/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="499 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1778805" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0106-01">499 Pa. 106</a>, 115, <a href="/pa/499/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="499 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1778805" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0106-01">451 A.2d 1344</a>, 1348 (1982). Here, the Commonwealth’s proof consisted of Ligons’ admissions to Mr. Wright and the police, eyewitness testimony, and circumstantial and forensic evidence. Such proof indicated that Ligons planned a robbery, waited in an alley,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> robbed and then shot Mr. Johnson in the back of the head at close range after repeatedly asking him whether he wanted to live. Such evidence provided an ample foundation for the jury to conclude that Ligons was the perpetrator, and that he acted with the specific intent to kill.</p>
    <p id="b586-7" data-blocks='[["BL_586.6",586,[236,2049,1160,203]],["BL_587.1",587,[225,331,1155,689]]]'>In his sole guilt-phase claim, Ligons maintains that he is entitled to a new trial because the Commonwealth failed to disclose during discovery certain evidence, specifically, Mrs. Johnson’s photographic identification. Ligons argues that he <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>suffered prejudice from this omission, since his defense was premised upon mistaken identification, which was weakened by Mrs. Johnson’s testimony of having previously identified Ligons from a photographic array. In response, the Commonwealth contends that it was unaware of the identification evidence and did not possess it at the time of trial. In addition, the Commonwealth notes that the trial court sustained defense counsel’s objection to Mrs. Johnson’s reference on direct examination to the photographic identification and instructed the jury to disregard such evidence, and that defense counsel elicited the details of the purported photographic identification during cross-examination. According to the Commonwealth, therefore, Ligons is not entitled to relief.</p>
