This court noted probable jurisdiction and scheduled oral arguments on the trial court’s order granting the stay of execution. Specifically, we directed that the parties address this court’s jurisdiction to review the trial court’s order, whether 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(c) establishes the exclusive means by which a stay of execution can be granted in post-conviction matters, and the validity of the stay entered by the trial court in the instant case. The Commonwealth’s primary argument is that section 9545(c) provides the sole means by which a stay can be granted. Appellee responds, <em>inter alia, </em>that section 9545 is unconstitutional, or in the alternative, that section 9545 cannot usurp the court’s inherent power to grant a stay.</p>

We will then enumerate guidelines for both applicants and courts to follow when requesting and reviewing stay applications. And finally, we will speak to the validity of the stay entered in the case herein.</p>

The Commonwealth asserts that this court has jurisdiction, since an order staying an execution is a form of injunctive relief and is therefore appealable as of right, even if interlocutory, pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 311(a)(4). Alternatively, the Commonwealth asserts that this court has jurisdiction to review the stay order as a collateral order pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 313.

Notwithstanding the conclusions of our sister jurisdictions and the fact that we have treated stays as injunctions in the past, we do not believe that this is the appropriate manner to consider the instant stay. First, the outcome of the inquiry set forth in <em>Chestnut </em>is discretionary, and thus, can have varying results. Second, and more importantly, the Rules of Appellate Procedure prescribe a mechanism for review of stay orders.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Thus, we will review the provisions of Chapter 17 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure in order to determine whether jurisdiction is granted pursuant to those rules.</p>

The first two rules of Chapter 17 set forth the general effect of an appeal and include the right of the trial court “to take such action as may be necessary to preserve the status quo.” Pa.R.A.P. 1701(b)(1). Rule 1702 enumerates the procedures for reviewing a stay ancillary to appeal, including an appeal from a stay following the filing of a notice of appeal. Pa.R.A.P. 1702(a). In most instances, a stay of execution would be appealable pursuant to this rule, since the trial court would be consistent in its ruling, i.e., denying both the petition for collateral relief and the stay. Thus, the party filing the notice of appeal would be the same as the party appealing the stay and this court could review the stay order pursuant to Rule 1702(a) once the notice of appeal was filed. However, cases will arise, similar to the case herein, where a stay order is appealed before a notice of appeal is filed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> For example, in this case, the trial court’s rulings were inconsistent — it denied the petition for relief, but granted the stay of execution. Therefore, the party appealing the stay <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>was not the same as the party filing the notice of appeal. This inconsistent ruling resulted in the appeal from the stay order before the notice of appeal was filed from the PCRA order.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Accordingly, jurisdiction cannot be conferred pursuant to Rule 1702(a).</p>
    <p id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[250,607,1155,691]]]'>Similarly, jurisdiction cannot be conferred by the other rules in Chapter 17. Rule 1702(b) provides for review before the filing of a petition for allowance of appeal or permission to appeal from an interlocutory order based upon the recognition that there may be a time lapse between the lower court’s order granting or denying the stay and the filing of the petition for allowance of appeal or permission to appeal. Comment to Pa.R.A.P. 1702(b). In this case, the appellee has not filed and will not be filing a petition for allowance of appeal or permission to appeal, since his appeal of the underlying matter is directly to this court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9546(d) (suspended August 11, 1997, reinstating subsection (d) from the 1988 Act).</p>

However, that review is limited to stay orders ruled upon by <em>intermediate courts. </em>In this case, there was no involvement by any intermediate court, nor would there ever be any involvement by an intermediate court, since the appeal in capital cases is directly to this court. Similarly, Rule 1761 provides a vehicle for this court to enter a stay in a capital matter, but that Rule is limited to cases on direct appeal from the judgment of sentence pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 and does not apply to petitions for collateral review. Rules 1731-35 provide for stays for ancillary relief in civil matters. However, these rules cover only specific civil matters, i.e. payment <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>of money and domestic matters, and do not encompass stays of death warrants. As the above discussion illuminates, Chapter 17 fails to provide us with an avenue to review the instant stay. We decline to distort either the language or purpose of these rules to grant jurisdiction over this matter. Rather, we now review whether the exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction may be appropriate in these limited circumstances as that is the only remaining means by which we can exercise jurisdiction over this matter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

In <em>Lonchar, </em>the Court considered whether a lower court could dismiss a first federal habeas petition for “equitable reasons” beyond those set forth in the relevant statutes, Federal Habeas Corpus Rules and prior precedents. The court first established, through a review of the history of the “Great Writ of Habeas Corpus,” that the trend in habeas corpus actions was toward a more formal system of rules promulgated by Congress, the Rule writers and the courts. 517 U.S. at 322, <a href="/us/517/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="517 U.S. 314" data-case-ids="11744701" data-case-paths="/us/517/0314-01">116 S.Ct. 1293</a>.

      <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>Similarly, the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA) prescribes the scope of collateral review in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania only recently adopted a comprehensive system for collateral relief. Prior to this time, the only avenue for collateral relief was the writ of habeas corpus and, to some extent, the writ of coram nobis. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Stevens v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/419/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="419 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1896928" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0001-01">419 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20613" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="213 A.2d 613">213 A.2d 613</a>, n. 9 (1965). In 1965, this Court called for legislation governing collateral proceedings in order to afford “an adequate corrective process for hearing and determining” alleged constitutional violations. <em>Id. </em>at 320, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20613" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="213 A.2d 613">213 A.2d 613</a>. In response, the legislature enacted the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA). The purpose of the PCHA was to provide a procedure which encompassed habeas corpus and coram nobis and to decide challenges to convictions that were imposed without due process. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9542 (repealed). In 1988, the legislature amended in part and repealed in part the PCHA and renamed the act the Post Conviction Relief Act, which provides the current avenue for collateral relief. The PCRA narrowed the grounds for collateral relief in order to establish a scheme for which collateral petitions are to be accorded finality. <em>Peterkin, </em><a href="/a2d/722/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="722 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="11773538,765982" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0638-01,/pa/554/0547-01">722 A.2d at 642</a>. Thus, similar to the writ of habeas corpus in the federal system, collateral review in Pennsylvania has moved towards a more formalized system of rules. Additionally, consistent application of section 9545(c) will reduce uncertainty for both parties, as well as minimize disparate treatment of similar cases. In other words, section 9545(c) limits the trial court’s discretion to enter the stay, so that an applicant’s stay will not be dependent upon the proclivity of the PCRA court. Given that we have concluded that section 9545(c) does not violate either Article V, § 9 or 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and is therefore, within constitutional restraints, we hold a lower court may not exercise its inherent right to grant a stay except within the confines enumerated by § 9545(c). We are mindful of the fact that such a conclusion may seem harsh, especially where death is the ultimate result of the denial of relief in these instances, but we cannot ignore that at some point in the proceedings society’s interest in finality becomes <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>overarching.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> Accordingly, we conclude that a PCRA court is bound by the requirements of section 9545 and can only enter a stay when it has reasonably concluded that such requirements are met.</p>
    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[250,564,1154,692]]]'>This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the criminal rules provide that a stay can remain in effect until the conclusion of the proceedings, including appellate review to this court, if the stay has been granted pursuant to section 9545(c). Pa.R.Crim.P. 1509(A)(2). In other words, so long as a stay is granted by the trial court pursuant to section 9545(c), there is no need for the applicant to reapply for a stay to this court. Thus, we have embraced this section in our own rules of procedure. However, the rules fail to specify any procedures for reviewing and ruling on the application for a stay of execution.

However, where the stay application is filed separately from the petition, <em>see </em>Comment to Pa.

A court should only grant the stay application where it appears that the petition is timely or falls within one of the exceptions to the timeliness requirements.

A stay of an execution warrant is not like the typical stay order usually governed by Chapter 17 of our Appellate Rules. In the typical non-capital case, the movant seeks to stay an order of the lower court pending an appeal of that order. The stay here, however, is not a stay of the order of the PCRA court denying appellee’s untimely, serial PCRA petition. Instead, the PCRA court stayed an executive order, <em>i.e., </em>the Governor’s warrant of execution. In my view, the order staying that warrant is itself a final, appealable order under Pa.R.A.P. 341(b).</p>

The stay order, thus, is final and appealable under Rule 341(b). Moreover, the stay of execution granted PCRA relief for all intents and purposes by rendering the existing death warrant unenforceable. The final, appealable nature of such an order is separately recognized in the Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 1510.

With respect to the first point, the effect of a stay of an execution warrant is decidedly not subject to varying discretionary interpretations. As noted above, since an execution warrant must be acted upon within a specific time or else expire, a stay by the lower court in all instances amounts to an outright denial of the effect of the warrant. With respect to the second point, the existence of Chapter 17 does not prevent this Court from considering the <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>unique nature of a stay of execution, as opposed to a stay of a judicial order, which maintains the status quo pending an appeal of that order.

Moreover, no stay of execution would issue in a first collateral attack in a CURA case both because the Governor could not sign an execution warrant until after completion of the hybrid procedure and appeal, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(i)-(j), and because, under this Court’s rules, the pendency of the hybrid appeal would operate to stay the execution. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1761. CURA made clear that it was only “subsequent petitions” in CURA cases that would be governed by the PCRA. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9578 (no further review of <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>“subsequent petitions” unless petition is filed under Subchapter B <em>(i.e., </em>the PCRA), and alleges one of three extraordinary circumstances [circumstances mirroring the exceptions to the PCRA time-bar found in § 9545(b) ]). Thus, in capital cases which would have been subject to CURA, the PCRA’s stay of execution standard was designed to apply only to serial petitions.</p>
    <p id="b201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_201.4",201,[248,730,1154,855]]]'>The PCRA stay provision is more complicated, of course, because the General Assembly had to account for the many pre-CURA capital cases that had already proceeded through direct appeal to this Court. These cases could not proceed under CURA’s hybrid unitary review approach and, thus, would be governed by the PCRA. As to that class of potential capital PCRA petitioners, the legislature specifically excluded a single sub-class from operation of the new stay of execution standard: first-time PCRA petitioners whose death sentences had recently been affirmed, <em>i.e., </em>between January 1, 1994, and January 1, 1996. As to this sub-class, the PCRA requires no particular showing to secure a stay. First-time capital PCRA petitioners whose sentences had been affirmed before January 1, 1994, however, as well as capital defendants filing serial collateral attacks under the PCRA, would have to satisfy the statutory stay standard.</p>

As to the older cases, there was greater reason to conclude that the failure to seek PCRA review was a deliberate delaying tactic, warranting application of a stricter standard for a stay. In this regard, it is worth noting that capital defendants whose sentences were affirmed before 1994 were not subject to the warrant signing statute, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(j), which took effect March 15, 1995; those defendants thus had no external prompting, such as the issuance of a death warrant, to cause them to seek PCRA review.</p>

Majority op. at 733 n. 11. But, in light of the interrelationship between § 9545(c)(2) and CURA, it would be both accurate and useful to make clear that § 9545(c) (2)’s stay standard was intended to apply only to serial petitions for collateral review and to first petitions in cases where the affirmance of sentence pre-dated January 1, 1994. The General Assembly expressed no intention to have the new standard apply to timely-filed first petitions for collateral review. Furthermore, since the 1995 legislation enacting § 9545(c)(2) also included the new one-year PCRA filing deadline (a provision which survived the suspension of CURA), there is a mechanism in place that assures timely PCRA filings now that the suspension of CURA reestablished the PCRA as the repository for first-time collateral attacks in capital cases. Thus, there is simply no reason, as a matter of statutory construction, to subject timely-filed, first capital PCRA petitions to the statutory stay standard.</p>

      <em>Lonchar </em>stands for the rather unexceptional proposition that federal habeas courts are not free to ignore “this body of statutes, rules, and precedents” and apply additional “ad hoc, equitable” grounds to dispose of a habeas petition. The fact that federal habeas principles embodied in statutes, rules and cases strive to balance objectives does not mean that legislative enactments in the federal habeas arena are subject to judicial disapproval on grounds of “unreasonableness,” much less that the federal constitution mandates that evaluation and disapproval.</p>

Instead, the stay standard is dictated by the statute creating the right of appeal in the first place. Thus, the federal habeas cases do not support the proposition that the PCRA’s stay provision, so long as it -is interpreted as being identical to the <em>Barefoot </em>standard, likewise passes constitutional muster. The PCRA stay question this Court faces derives from a state constitutional provision, and its subsequent legislative restriction, having no federal habeas counterpart. The federal habeas cases are simply not relevant to this question.</p>

Furthermore, certain formulations of the <em>Barefoot </em>probable cause test are squarely at odds with the <em>PGRAJProcess Gas </em>stay language. For example, one formulation of the <em>Barefoot </em>test suggests that “the petitioner need not show that he should prevail on the merits.” <a href="/us/463/0880-01" class="citation" data-index="193" data-cite="463 U.S. 880" data-case-ids="6202178" data-case-paths="/us/463/0880-01">463 U.S. at </a>893 n. 4, <a href="/us/463/0880-01" class="citation" data-index="194" data-cite="463 U.S. 880" data-case-ids="6202178" data-case-paths="/us/463/0880-01">103 S.Ct. 3383</a>. But the PCRA standard explicitly requires “a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits.” Also, the <em>Barefoot </em>Court states that its test is the “primary means of separating meritorious from frivolous appeals,” <a href="/us/463/0880-01" class="citation" data-index="195" data-cite="463 U.S. 880" data-case-ids="6202178" data-case-paths="/us/463/0880-01">463 U.S. at 892</a>, <a href="/us/463/0880-01" class="citation" data-index="196" data-cite="463 U.S. 880" data-case-ids="6202178" data-case-paths="/us/463/0880-01">103 S.Ct. 3383</a>, which suggests that stays should issue in all but frivolous cases.

The PCRA stay provision, aimed primarily at serial state collateral attacks upon final criminal judgments, obviously is animated by a similar concern with finality. Other provisions in the 1995 PCRA amendments, most notably the one-year period of limitations, corroborate the concern with finality. The majority rightly stresses the importance and legitimacy of this concern in addressing the state constitutional question of whether the stay provision unreasonably interferes with the right of appeal. The majority properly cites to federal habeas cases as additional support for the proposition that the General Assembly’s concern with finality in criminal cases is legitimate, which in turn suggests that the stay provision here is not an unreasonable burden on the state constitutional right of appeal. Majority op. at 735-36. But I cannot join in the majority’s reliance upon the federal habeas cases for the broader interpretive propositions embraced therein.</p>

Automatic entitlement to a stay, or even an overly permissive stay standard such as the presence of a “non-frivolous” issue, could destroy any prospect of finality in capital cases. <em>See Sayres v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/88/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="202" data-cite="88 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="1061168" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0291-01">88 Pa. 291</a>, 307 (1879) (“If the legislature may fix no limitation whatever upon the issuing of such writs, it is not too much to say that capital punishment cannot be hereafter enforced in Pennsylvania”). The General Assembly, which was not obliged to afford an avenue for serial collateral attacks in the first place, reasonably could require that a condemned prisoner meet the prevailing standard for stay/injunctive relief before a presumptively valid warrant of execution, issued pursuant to a final, affirmed judgment of sentence of death, could be stayed and rendered nugatory. The reasonableness of § 9545(c)(2) is inescapable when it is understood, as it must be in light of its plain language and its interrelationship with CURA, as primarily applying to serial PCRA petitions. Those petitions invariably will be untimely on their face, such as the one dismissed by the PCRA court in this matter, and the relatively simple question will be whether one of the three narrow exceptions to the PCRA time-bar applies. Requiring a showing of likelihood of prevailing on the merits as to one of those exceptions before a stay may issue is not at all unreasonable. As the majority rightly notes, “at some point in the proceedings society’s interest in finality becomes overarching.” Majority op. at 739. A PCRA petitioner whose serial petition was denied on jurisdictional grounds of untimeliness, and who cannot show that he is likely to prevail on the merits of his claim that he qualifies under one of the exceptions, has reached that point.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_10" id="ref_footnote_3_10">10</a>

In my view, it is <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>essential that we bear in mind that the stay at issue here is not of a judicial order, such as the order denying the serial PCRA petition, but that it is of an executive warrant of execution. Whatever “inherent” stay power the courts may possess over such warrants may certainly be restricted by the General Assembly. The restriction, in this case is perfectly lawful. The General Assembly was not required to provide an avenue to entertain serial collateral challenges at all. Having created the right to challenge in certain narrowly prescribed instances, I see no reason why the General Assembly could not adopt this Court’s <em>Process Gas </em>standard, the usual jurisprudential standard employed when injunctive relief is requested, to ensure that the PCRA would not be used, and abused, to render the death penalty unenforceable in Pennsylvania. The General Assembly having spoken, I agree that a PCRA court has the authority to enter a stay of execution in a case involving a serial PCRA petition only under the standard set forth in § 9545(c)(2).</p>
