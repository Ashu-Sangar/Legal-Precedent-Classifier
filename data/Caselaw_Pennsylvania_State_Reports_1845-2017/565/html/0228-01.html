Appellants purchased 120 acres of real estate in South Bend Township, Armstrong County on December 7, 1994. The deed contained the following encumbrance: “UNDER AND SUBJECT to a certain oil and gas lease given by Frank F. George and Sarah T. George, his wife, to New York State Natural Gas Corporation, dated February 21,1956.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The 1956 lease was a modification of an earlier lease dating from 1907. The 1956 lease permitted appellee to drill and operate wells for the production of oil and gas as well as to use the land for pooling or storage of gas. Appellants were aware of the existence of and had an opportunity to review the lease before purchasing the subject property. In addition, before consummating the purchase, they were aware that appellee was operating an underground natural gas storage pool in a subsurface geological sand formation.</p>

On February 8, 1995, after appellants took possession of the property, they notified appellee of the purchase and demanded that appellee either surrender the gas-bearing sands not being used for storage or begin the development and production of the sand formations. Appellee refused to surrender the gas-bearing sands or develop them. Appellants, believing that the production rights in the lease with appellee had “ceased,” entered into an oil and gas lease with Penneco on March 21, 1995.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellants countered that the oil and gas lease is severable <em>i.e., </em>that the lease grants two distinct rights, the right to drill and operate gas wells for the production of oil and gas and the right to store natural gas.

As to “shallow” gas, the lessee agrees to pay $50 quarterly as a royalty for each well beginning thirty days after a well is drilled and ending whenever the lessee ceases to use the well, gives written notice of its intention to abandon the well or in fact plugs and abandons the well, or ceases to save and market the gas from the property. An additional royalty of one-eighth of the value of the gas is payable for gas saved or marketed from the deeper areas.

    </p>
    <p id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.5",394,[236,914,1164,843]]]'>Appellants argue to this Court that the provisions of this particular lease dealing with oil and gas production are severable from the provisions dealing with gas storage because, although the intent of the parties as to severability is not stated in the contract, under rules of contract construction, the fact that the consideration to be paid for oil and gas production is separate and distinct from that to be paid for storage indicates that the provisions are severable. Appellee counters by arguing that, under Pennsylvania law, before a court may reach the issue of whether a contract is severable, the court must first find that the parties’ intent is ambiguous. The Third Circuit frames this precise question by asking this Court to determine if a finding of ambiguity is a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of severability under our decision in <em>Heilwood Fuel Co. v. Manor Real Estate Co., </em><a href="/pa/405/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="405 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="1303553" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0319-01">405 Pa. 319</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%20880" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="175 A.2d 880">175 A.2d 880</a> (1961).</p>

      <em>Heilwood </em>was a specific performance action involving the construction and interpretation of a January 31,1956, letter of intent that defendant Manor Real Estate Company wrote to Pine Township Coal Company, Inc. The letter of intent, if accepted by Pine Township Coal, was to become an interim understanding and agreement between Manor Real Estate and Pine Township Coal. The letter was divided into two parts, one entitled “Exchange” and the other entitled “Lease.” The “Exchange” section provided that Manor Real Estate would convey to Pine Township Coal and Pine Township Coal would convey to Manor Real Estate "ownership of certain real <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>estate while reserving the respective gas and oil rights in the properties and that, if Manor Real Estate did not so convey its property to Pine Township Coal, the property would be included in the “Lease” portion of the agreement. The “Lease” section then stated that Manor Real Estate agreed to lease to Pine Township Coal certain coal seams under an additional 1650 acre tract of land not included in the “Exchange” provision, set forth the terms of the contemplated lease, and provided that any coal mined and shipped on the property should be routed over Pennsylvania Railroad lines.</p>
    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[226,872,1156,628]]]'>On February 5, 1956, Pine Township Coal accepted the proposal outlined in the letter of intent and informed Manor Real Estate that Heilwood Fuel Company, an allied company of Pine Township Coal, owned the properties Pine Township Coal was to convey to Manor Real Estate, and that Pine Township Coal was in a position to guarantee performance of that portion of the contract. Soon thereafter, Manor Real Estate and Heilwood took physical possession of each other’s property, and each removed timber from the other’s property. In addition, in February of 1956, Manor Real Estate leased to a coal company part of a seam of coal under Heilwood’s property.</p>
    <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[228,1524,1155,521]]]'>The actual exchange of deeds, however, was delayed because Pine Township Coal declared bankruptcy. Three years later, in February of 1959, Manor Real Estate and Heilwood learned that the subject properties could be exchanged despite the bankruptcy, and in November of that year, Manor Real Estate forwarded to Heilwood proposed deeds for approval. Heilwood returned the proposed deeds with some modifications. The deeds were apparently never executed and the properties never conveyed because further negotiations in that regard broke down.</p>
    <p id="b395-6" data-blocks='[["BL_395.6",395,[227,2068,1154,306]],["BL_396.1",396,[245,327,1157,201]]]'>Ultimately, Heilwood filed an equity action in May of 1960 seeking specific performance of the exchange provision of the contract. Manor Real Estate filed preliminary objections, which the trial court granted, finding that the exchange and leasing provisions of the agreement were interdependent and therefore not severable. Accordingly, in the trial court’s view, <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>Heilwood was not entitled to specific performance of one part of the agreement — the exchange provisions — while completely overlooking the lease provisions.

      <blockquote id="AEU" data-blocks='[["BL_392.8",392,[320,1739,1093,620]]]'>It is agreed that this lease shall remain in force for the term of ten (10) years from June 16, 1956 and as long thereafter as the above described land, or any portion thereof, or any other land pooled or unitized therewith as provided in paragraph 4 hereof, is operated by the Lessee in the search for or production of oil or gas or as long as gas is being stored, held in storage, or withdrawn from the premises by Lessee. It is agreed that the cessation of production from wells on the leased premises or upon other land unitized therewith, after the expiration of the original term, shall not terminate this lease whether the pooling units have been dissolved or not, if the land is used for the storage of gas prior to the plugging and abandonment of wells from which oil or gas has been produced. It is understood that a well need not be drilled on the premises to permit the storage of gas, and it is agreed that the Lessee shall be the sole judge as to whether gas is being stored within the leased premises and that its determination shall be final and conclusive.</blockquote>
