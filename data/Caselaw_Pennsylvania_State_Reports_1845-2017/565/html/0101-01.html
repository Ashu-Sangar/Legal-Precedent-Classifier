The action sought compensation for injuries that Harold Leonard, appellant, sustained while employed as an iron worker at a bridge construction site. Appellees, the defendants in this action, are the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and various contractors and subcontractors who were responsible for construction of the bridge.</p>

Kiewit/Perini, as general contractor, agreed to demolish existing structures and rebuild various bridges along <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>the highway. Kiewit/Perini entered a subcontract with High Steel Structures, Inc. (High Steel) to fabricate and erect steel for the bridges. In turn, High Steel subcontracted with Cornell and Company (Cornell) for erection of all of the steel. In addition, PennDOT contracted with Construction Methods and Coordination, Inc. (CMC) for certain supplemental inspection and safety monitoring services.</p>

Leonard sustained injuries to his back and right elbow. There was no safety net below the work area. Although Leonard was wearing a safety belt, the belt was not connected to any safety device. There was no static safety line in place. There was, however, an inspector’s handrail on the steel girder from which Leonard fell, but he had not attached himself to it.</p>

Further, with regard to Kiewit/Perini and High Steel, the court reasoned that such parties had no involvement in erection of the steel, that they had no personnel assigned to the site, and that they exercised no control over Leonard or his working conditions because <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>such work, including compliance with safety requirements, had been contractually delegated to Cornell.

It is because an independent contractor is not subject to control by the one hiring him that there is no basis to hold the latter party liable for his acts. <em>Id.; Brletich v. United States Steel Corp., </em><a href="/pa/445/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="445 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="1940003" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0525-01">445 Pa. 525</a>, 530-32, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20133" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="285 A.2d 133">285 A.2d 133</a>, 135-36 (1971) (no liability for negligent acts of an independent contractor whose work is not subject to control). Thus, inasmuch as Kiewit/Perini and High Steel had no presence or involvement at the work site and maintained no control over the manner in which work was performed by Cornell, they were deemed not responsible for any injuries caused to Leonard by Cornell’s failure to maintain a safe work site.</p>

Hence, our review focuses on Commonwealth Court’s rationale that Kiewit/Perini and High Steel had no duty to Leonard, in that they had no actual involvement in erection of the steel, they had no presence or control with respect to the work site, they had no control over the manner in which Leonard performed his job, and they had contractually delegated all safety responsibility and control over the work site to Cornell.</p>

Specifically, it is asserted that Kiewit/Perini and High Steel were obligated to secure compliance with various Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations governing work site safety, particularly those dealing with safety lines and nets. See <a href="/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201926.104" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="29 C.F.R. § 1926.104">29 C.F.R. § 1926.104</a> (safety lines); <a href="/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201926.105" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="29 C.F.R. § 1926.105">29 C.F.R. § 1926.105</a> (safety nets).

With respect to subcontracted work, the <em>prime contractor and any subcontractor or subcontractors shall be deemed to have joint responsibility.” </em>(Emphasis added). In holding that these provisions do not establish liability of a contractor for injuries to subcontractors’ employees, Commonwealth Court concluded that the provisions do not deal with the assignment of liability among contractors. Rather, the court held that the regulations establish which parties are subject to OSHA enforcement provisions. We agree. The regulations cited by Leonard expressly state that they concern the scope of enforcement of OSHA requirements. In particular, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201926.16" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="29 C.F.R. § 1926.16">29 C.F.R. § 1926.16</a>(d) states: “Where joint responsibility exists, both the prime contractor and his subcontractor or subcontractors, regardless of tier, shall be considered subject to the <em>enforcement provisions </em>of the Act.” (Emphasis added). The fact that OSHA requirements were applicable to the project does not, however, mean that Kiewit/Perini or High Steel had a presence at the site or control over the work done by Cornell.

The contracts in question, as is usual with contracts for federally funded construction projects, included language mandated by the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. That language incorporated specifications that there would be compliance with OSHA requirements and that the contractor would at all times “[k]eep direct control of the contract and see that the work is properly supervised....” The subcontract between High Steel and Cornell, in turn, provided:</p>

Having fully delegated to Cornell the task of erecting steel, the contractors higher in tier no longer had control over the manner in which that work was done. The contract with Cornell provides no basis to conclude that control over Cornell’s work methods was being retained. The mere fact that <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>contracts initially placed responsibility on Kiewit/Perini and High Steel does not make that responsibility nondelegable; nor does it give them a presumed presence at the site or control over the manner in which the subcontractor performed its work. To hold otherwise would mean that one could subcontract for the performance of work but not successfully delegate the safety responsibility that normally accompanies that work. Logically, safety responsibility best rests on the subcontractor doing the work, for that party is most familiar with the work and its particular hazards. As we stated in <em>Hader v. Coplay Cement Mfg.

Traditionally, employers of independent contractors have been immune from liability for the negligence of a contractor or the contractor’s employees because of the employer’s lack of control over the contractor’s work. However, in recent years, courts have abandoned this independent contractor rule and found that in certain situations the employer of an independent contractor should be liable for the negligence of the independent contractor.

      <blockquote id="AZJ" data-blocks='[["BL_270.6",270,[310,1945,1097,272]]]'>The departure from the rule is based in large part on the considerations that the employer is the one who primarily benefits from the work done by the contractor; the employer selects the contractor and is in a position to select a competent and financially responsible contractor; the employer is in a position to demand indemnity from the contractor; and the insurance necessary to distribute the loss is a proper cost of the employer’s business.</blockquote>

Moreover, I believe it is inequitable to allow contractors to reap the benefits of federal contracts, in which they have specifically agreed to undertake these safety responsibilities, without having any accountability whatsoever when the safety responsibilities are not fulfilled. <em>See </em>John L.
