A warrant for Appellant’s arrest and a criminal complaint against him were issued on October 20, 1994. The investigating detectives contacted Appellant’s parole officer and advised him of the new charges filed against Appellant. It was not until February of 1996, however, that Appellant’s parole officer contacted one of the investigating detectives and advised him that Appellant had been located and was incarcerated on a parole violation. A second criminal complaint was then issued on February 27, 1996.</p>

Appellant argued that, pursuant to Rule 1100 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, the charges against him should be dismissed. The trial court concluded that the Rule 1100 period was triggered by the second criminal complaint, and that Appellant had not demonstrated any prejudice from the delay in its filing. The trial court then conducted a jury-waiver colloquy and Appellant proceeded to a non-jury trial.</p>

Appellant received no additional punishment for the remaining crimes. He filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court, and then the trial court directed Appellant to file a Concise Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.1925(b), on or before February 5,1997.</p>

In support of this conclusion, the Superior Court found that <em>Lord, supra, </em>would be rendered meaningless if the court were to consider the waived issue based on Appellant’s re-framing it as an ineffectiveness claim.

The record reflects that Appellant's trial counsel, post-trial counsel and Appellate Counsel are not the same person. However, they are all members of the Allegheny County Public Defender’s Office. As a general rule, a public defender may not argue the ineffectiveness of another member of the same public defender's office since appellate <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>counsel, in essence, is deemed to have asserted a claim of his or her own ineffectiveness. <em>Shannon, </em><a href="/pa/530/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="530 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1833017" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0279-01">608 A.2d at 1023</a>; <em>See also Ciptak, </em><a href="/pa/542/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="665 A.2d 1161" data-case-ids="459054,7880394" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0112-01,/a2d/665/1161-01">665 A.2d at 1161-62</a>.

Under the majority’s analysis in the instant case, however, an appellant may now ignore the mandate of <em>Lord </em>and still obtain appellate review of an issue that was not included in a 1925(b) statement simply by claiming that counsel was ineffective for failing to include <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>the issue in the 1925(b) statement.
