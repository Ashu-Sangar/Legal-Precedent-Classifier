Hall and others (collectively referred to as the Prison Society). The Prison Society challenged the constitutionality of a proposed constitutional amendment to Article IV, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution that was placed on the November 4, 1997 ballot. The Commonwealth Court determined that the ballot question was null and void, as the single ballot question contained five amendments to the Pennsylvania Constitution in violation of Article XI, Section 1. We find that the ballot question in fact proposed two separate amendments to Article IV, Section 9, contrary to the separate vote requirement of Article XI, Section 1. Due to the unique circumstances underlying the proposed amendment to the provision of Article IV, Section 9, governing the confirmation process of gubernatorial appointments to the Board of Pardons, however, we conclude that the ballot question was not constitutionally infirm in this case. For the following reasons, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Thus, according to the majority, although there were two amendments placed before the voters in a single ballot question, there is no reason to declare the ballot question null and void; the failure to offer separate ballot questions to the electorate was, in essence, harmless error.</p>

Const, art. IV, § 9. The proposed amendment would have appointments being confirmed “with the consent of a majority of the members elected to the Senate for terms of six years.” While the majority contends that the elimination of the language “two-thirds or a majority” does not restrict or expand the Senate’s power to confirm appointees to the Board of Pardons by a majority, I believe that the amendment eliminates the legislature’s ability to set confirmation criteria, and thus, substantively alters the law.</p>

The “as is specified by law” refers to the Administration Code of 1929, 71 P.S. § 67.1, which sets forth the appointments which the Governor may make without submission to the Senate for confirmation, the appointments which require a two-thirds vote of the Senate, and those offices requiring approval by only a majority of the <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>Senators.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> 71 P.S. § 67.1; Woodside, Pennsylvania Constitutional Law 385 (1985).</p>

Since there are multiple appointments to be made by the Governor, some will require two-thirds confirmation and others will require only majority confirmation. 71 P.S. § 67.1. However, in the context of Article IV, § 9(b), where there is only one position to be confirmed, membership to the Board of Pardons, the. reason for the alternative language, at first blush, is unclear. To the majority, this alternative language is superfluous and devoid of meaning. Similarly, appointees to the Board of Pardons currently require confirmation by only a majority of the Senate. 71 P.S. § 67.1(d)(2). Thus, on the surface, it appears that the proposed amendment to eliminate the “two-thirds” confirmation language has effected no substantive change to the confirmation process.</p>

Under the current language, confirmation by “two-thirds or a majority” of the Senate “as specified by law,” the legislature has the ability to amend the Administration Code, which now requires majority approval for appointments to the Board of Pardons, to require <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>confirmation of such appointees by two-thirds of the Senate. Under the proposed amendment, the legislature could no longer alter the percentage of Senate members needed for confirmation to two-thirds; confirmation will be constitutionally cast, requiring only the approval of a majority of the Senators.

As noted above, Article XI, § 1 requires separate ballot questions for separate amendments to our state’s Constitution. This requirement acts as a safeguard to ensure that our citizenry is fully informed of the proposed amendments to the Constitution in a manner that the amendments be easily understood.

We do not know whether combining multiple amendments in a single ballot question led voters to abstain from voting on the amendment. As the impact upon the electorate is fraught with uncertainty, we should not dismiss a violation of the required amendment procedure as mere harmless error. In other contexts, engrafting a harmless error analysis onto the court’s review might be entirely reasonable and appropriate.
