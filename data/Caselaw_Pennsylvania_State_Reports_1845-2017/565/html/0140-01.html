    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[245,764,1152,628]]]'>The Duquesne Police Department received numerous complaints about drug trafficking activity in the G-Service Convenience Store at 418 Crawford Avenue, in Duquesne, Pennsylvania. In response to the complaints, the police set up surveillance outside the store. On December 18, 1994 and January 4,1995, the surveillance officer noted the patrons who visited the store and the short length of time many of those patrons spent inside the store. Several weeks later, the police sent a confidential informant into the store to make a controlled buy. The informant returned with crack cocaine that he had purchased from Eric Gooden, the owner of the G-Service Convenience Store.</p>
    <p id="b305-6" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[247,1427,1151,420]]]'>Based upon the information gathered from the surveillance and the informant’s controlled buy, the police obtained a search warrant authorizing a search of the G Service Convenience Store. On January 20, 1995, a search team effectuated the warrant. Inside the store, the police found Gooden and a large quantity of crack cocaine behind a counter. While part of the search team remained with Gooden, two officers went down a set of stairs and into the basement of the building.</p>
    <p id="b305-7" data-blocks='[["BL_305.7",305,[248,1878,1149,255]]]'>In the basement, the officers encountered Taylor, sitting in a barber’s chair and wearing a black plastic apron over his torso.

Fearing that Taylor could be reaching for a weapon, Officer Adams removed the apron and <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>patted the exterior of Taylor’s pocket. Officer Adams felt a hard object and removed it from Taylor’s pocket. The object was a plastic prescription bottle, which appeared to contain crack cocaine.</p>

Officer Adams did not find anything incriminating on Mahone. Then, Officer Adams handcuffed Mahone, while Constable Gordon McIntyre (Constable McIntyre) searched two coats, which were draped on a chanten feet from Taylor and Mahone. Constable McIntyre discovered additional pieces of crack in Taylor’s coat and several baggies containing marijuana in Mahone’s coat.</p>

In a fragmented memorandum opinion, the Superior Court reversed the suppression of the evidence. Writing for the court, Judge, now Justice, Saylor concluded that the search of the basement barbershop had been outside the scope of the warrant, however, the search could be justified as a legitimate protective sweep of the premises in conjunction with the arrest of Gooden. Judge Olszewski filed a concurring opinion in which he disagreed that the search of the basement could be justified as a protective sweep. In his view, the search of the basement had been lawful because the barbershop is open to the public, and therefore Taylor and Mahone did not have a reasonable <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>expectation of privacy in the basement. Judge Popovich dissented and stated that he would have affirmed based on the reasoning of the suppression court. We granted Petitions for Allowance of Appeal filed by Taylor and Mahone to consider whether the searches conducted in the basement were beyond the scope of the warrant, and if so, whether such searches were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</p>

While the barbershop was located in the same building as the convenience store, the suppression court found the barbershop to be a separate and distinct facility from the convenience store. The record, which contains evidence that the basement housed only barbershop equipment and activity, sufficiently supports the finding of the suppression court.

In addition, Officer Dawley recognized the hard object in the defendant’s back pocket as a candy bottle, but shined his flashlight into the defendant’s pocket anyway. Here, Officer Adams placed his hand on the object in Appellant Taylor’s pocket. N.T. 12/18/96 (Suppression Hearing), at 62-63 (R.R. 81a-82a).

Immediately after encountering police, Taylor reached for his pocket, despite being told not to move several times. After observing Taylor fumble under the black barber’s apron, Officer Adams touched Taylor’s pocket. Officer Adams felt a hard, cylinder-type object. Because an officer need only be reasonably, and not absolutely, certain that an individual is armed in order to investigate for weapons, we conclude that Officer Adams was reasonable in suspecting that Taylor could be armed and dangerous. Therefore, Officer Adams justifiably reached into Taylor’s pocket in order to protect his safety and the safety of others in the basement.</p>

After Officer Adams had patted-down Taylor’s clothing for weapons and had arrested Taylor, he placed Taylor in handcuffs. N.T. 12/18/96 (Suppression Hearing), at 62-65 (R.R. 81a — 84a). Then, Officer Adams directed Taylor to sit in the barber’s chair. N.T. 12/18/96 (Suppression Hearing), at 67 (R.R. 86a). Taylor complied and sat in the chair with his wrists in handcuffs. N.T. 12/18/96 (Suppression Hearing), at 67 (R.R. 86a). Officer Adams also <em>Terny </em>frisked and handcuffed Mahone, who stood next to the chair. N.T. 12/18/96 (Suppression Hearing), at 67 (R.R. 86a). Then, Officer Adams stood with the two handcuffed men and directed Constable McIntyre to search the coats. N.T. 12/18/96 (Suppression Hearing), at 79-80 (R.R. 98a-99a). Like the briefcase in <em>Johnson, </em>the two coats were located ten feet from Taylor and Mahone, well beyond either man’s reach. N.T. 12/18/96 (Suppression Hearing), at 80 (R.R. 99a). Neither Taylor nor Mahone made any movements toward the coats. There is no indication in the record that the police had any reason to believe that the men would immediately attempt to secure a weapon or destroy contraband contained in the coats. While <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>it is not clear if Officer Adams knew who owned the coats before he directed the search, Officer McIntyre testified that he did not know to whom the coats belonged prior to searching.

The opinion of judgment picks out a few isolated statements made by various Commonwealth witnesses and concludes that based on these statements, the officers involved in the search of the convenience store must have feared that dangerous third parties were located in the basement. However, none of the Commonwealth’s witnesses testified that they suspected potentially dangerous third parties in the basement. Rather, the Commonwealth's witnesses explained that they entered the basement simply because it was easily accessible to the convenience store. Moreover, in its argument to this Court, the Commonwealth does not rely on the witnesses’ statements cited by the opinion of judgment but rather, only argues that the search was a legitimate protective sweep due to the possibility that other individuals may have been present in the basement because of its accessibility from the convenience store. Thus, based on my reading of the record and the argument framed by the Commonwealth, I disagree with the opinion of judgment that the Commonwealth presented the specific and articulable facts necessary to satisfy its burden of proving that the warrantless search of the basement was a legitimate protective sweep. <em>See Buie, </em><a href="/us/494/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="494 U.S. 325" data-case-ids="5456" data-case-paths="/us/494/0325-01">494 U.S. at 327</a>, <a href="/us/494/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="494 U.S. 325" data-case-ids="5456" data-case-paths="/us/494/0325-01">110 S.Ct. 1093</a>; <em>Jeffers, </em><a href="/us/342/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="342 U.S. 48" data-case-ids="640927" data-case-paths="/us/342/0048-01">342 U.S. at 51</a>, <a href="/us/342/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="342 U.S. 48" data-case-ids="640927" data-case-paths="/us/342/0048-01">72 S.Ct. 93</a>.</p>
