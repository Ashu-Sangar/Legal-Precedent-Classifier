Green (“Taxpayers”), are the owners of a 6,344-square-foot, single-family residence situated on 1.8 acres in Schuylkill County. The residence is a two-story home, built in 1987, with, <em>inter alia, </em>a stone and brick exterior, a shingled roof, four bedrooms, two full baths, several partial baths, a four-car garage, and a basement that is 60 percent finished. In 1997, pursuant to a <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>countywide reassessment, Taxpayers’ home was assessed based upon a fair market value of $612,580. Taxpayers appealed the assessment to the Schuylkill County Board of Assessment Appeals (the “Board”), which denied the appeal following a hearing. Taxpayers then appealed the Board’s decision to the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County.</p>

To counter the Board’s evidence, Taxpayers presented the testimony of Anthony Matsell, a real estate appraisal expert, who offered the opinion that the fair market value of Taxpayers’ property, as of January 1, 1996, was $360,000, The path by which he reached this conclusion was explored in depth on direct and cross-examination.</p>

Consequently, he reasoned, “people in that market area won’t pay the amount it would cost to reproduce this house,” which he estimated at $500,614, since they would not be able to recoup that amount in a later sale.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> More generally, the expert noted, he had <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>never seen a buyer rely on the cost approach in determining how much to pay for a residential property. As for the income approach, Mr. Matsell testified that this method of valuation was also inappropriate for Taxpayers’ property, a personal residence that does not generate any income.</p>
    <p id="b350-4" data-blocks='[["BL_350.5",350,[246,607,1164,580]]]'>Accordingly, Mr. Matsell explained, he relied primarily upon the comparable sales method — “comparing your property against similar properties that had sold on the market [recently]” — in establishing a fair market value for the property. Owing to the over-improved nature of Taxpayers’ property, Mr. Matsell had a “very, very hard time finding anything like it.” Homes in Taxpayers’ neighborhood ranged in value from $150,000 to $300,000, with an average of $180,000, and most were - 3,000 to 3,500 square feet in size; countywide, Mr. Matsell “found no properties that [had] sold in excess of ... $400-450,000.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Using the comparable sales method, Mr. Matsell calculated the fair market value of Taxpayers’ home as $360,000, adding that “nobody’s paid anything much more than I have appraised the subject property at.” After Mr. Matsell concluded his testimony, Taxpayers rested; the Board did not present any testimony or evidence in rebuttal.</p>

After adjustments, comparable number 3 had an adjusted sales price of $444,000, which was in contradiction to his testimony as to the maximum fair market value that the subject property could demand within the market area. Furthermore, his testimony that he could find no properties that sold in excess of $400,000 to $450,000 was contradicted by his own testimony under cross-examination.

In response, the taxpayer presented the testimony of an expert witness, Teresa Hoberg. Ms. Hoberg testified that she had valued the property using the three standard valuation methods (comparable sales, cost, and income approach). The comparable sales method produced a valuation of $24 million. The cost approach, according to Ms. Hoberg, was inappropriate given the age of the building. To arrive at a valuation via the income approach, Ms. Hoberg performed two computations: one based on the stabilized income approach, which produced a valuation of $25.5 million; and another based on a discounted cash flow analysis, which produced a valuation of $25 million. Ms. Hoberg explained that she combined thése results for an income-approach valuation of $25 million, and then correlated this figure with the comparable-sales valuation, for a final fair market value of $25 million. <em>See id. </em>at 1211-12.</p>

The likelier explanation for the comment is that the trial court was expressing the view that Comparable # 3 deserved greater weight than was given to it by Taxpayers’ expert. Comparable # 3, as noted earlier, had the highest adjusted fair market value of the three comparables, but was discounted by the expert because it was farther away from the subject property and had been sold two years earlier than the other comparables. The weight to be given such factors is, in our view, for the trial court to determine in accordance with such principles as it may derive from the record.</p>

First, the particular examples cited by the trial court as underlying its suspicion that Mr. Matsell’s testimony was internally inconsistent appear to be flawed. Contrary to the trial court’s assertion, Mr. Matsell did not testify that “it was impossible to find a comparable sale in excess of the value he had placed upon this particular property.” Rather, he observed that “nobody’s paid anything <em>much more </em>than I have appraised the subject property at”; arguably this was a fair statement, as he valued the subject property at $360,000, and the highest actual sale price among the comparable properties was $415,000. The comparably sized residences that had recently been built could not be utilized as comparables, Mr. Matsell explained, because they had not yet sold. <em>See supra </em>note 3. Nor did Mr. Matsell <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>contradict Ms own statement “that he could find no properties that sold <em>in excess of </em>$400,000 to $450,000”; even the highest adjusted sale price among the comparables ($444,000) was within this range.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

We note, for example, that Comparable # <em>3 </em>had an adjusted sale price of $444,000, the highest among the comparables, even though it was one acre less than the subject property. According to Mr. Matsell, it was not necessary to adjust the comparable’s sale price to reflect the difference in acreage. However, when asked on cross-examination whether a purchaser would not have paid more for the additional acre, he replied that “in the real world they may have.” In addition, while the comparably sized residences may have been recently constructed and therefore lack sales data, the mere fact of their construction arguably suggests that the expert’s estimation of the market for such properties (“people in that market area won’t pay the amount it would cost to reproduce this house”) is not universally shared.</p>

The language chosen by the trial court, <em>see supra, </em>implies that its evaluation of the expert's testimony involved a credibility determination. In this regard, it is important to distinguish between credibility as a matter of personal veracity and as a matter of the substantive reasonableness of a witness's testimony.

The court may thus decide on a fair market value which was not specifically offered by the expert so long as that decision is supported by evidence of record. Based on this understanding of the holding, I join in the majority opinion.</p>
