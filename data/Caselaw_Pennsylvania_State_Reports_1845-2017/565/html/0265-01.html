During his 26 years as a police officer, Ryder had been continually assigned to the 7th Police District. On May 4, 1996, Ryder received a radio call reporting that there was a disturbance at a house located on Stevens Road and that there was a “man with a gun.” The assignment to respond also <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>went out by radio call to a wagon crew with two officers. Ryder, who was on patrol closer to the location, arrived first.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[245,450,1157,361]]]'>Ryder had intended to wait for the other police officers to back him up, but decided to enter the house alone when he heard a woman screaming. He went to the front door and shouted out, asking whether everything was all right, to which a woman responded “no.” When Ryder opened a screen door, he saw the woman. The woman told him that her son had a gun and was upstairs.</p>
    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[243,837,1158,367]]]'>Ryder directed the woman to leave, but was told that the woman’s disabled mother was in the room. A man yelled that he had a gun and started to come down the stairs, carrying a semi-automatic rifle which he pointed towards Ryder. Ryder aimed his own weapon at the man and ordered him to put down his weapon. There was a standoff lasting approximately five minutes, until the man ran back up the stairs.</p>
    <p id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.6",428,[240,1228,1160,363]]]'>Ryder moved the women into the kitchen and used his police radio to communicate that there was an armed male on the second floor of the house. The man came back down the stairs without the weapon. Ryder subdued him and placed him in the police car. The wagon crew then arrived approximately 12 minutes after Ryder had responded to the radio report.</p>
    <p id="b428-7" data-blocks='[["BL_428.7",428,[237,1618,1162,356]]]'>A preliminary hearing was held on the charges brought against the man whom Ryder had arrested; however, the charges were dismissed.

He spoke to Detective Mike Connolly who told him that there would be an attempt to have the charges reinstated.</p>

When Ryder returned to work following his surgery, he was informed that, after 26 years in the same district, he was being transferred to the 89th Police District. On his first shift in the new district, Ryder began to experience anxiety and feelings that he was unable to function. He <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>developed concerns that he was going to be killed or was going to have to kill somebody. Ryder did not return to work after his first day in the 39th District.</p>
    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[234,506,1152,524]]]'>Ryder again contacted EAP and was referred to Dr. Paul DiKun, a psychologist. Dr. DiKun diagnosed Ryder as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and began treating him for the disorder. On October 14,1996, Dr. DiKun submitted a report to EAP’s Officer Connolly stating that Ryder would be able to return to work on a restricted basis, effective October 21, 1996. Dr. DiKun recommended that Ryder be detailed to the police administration building or a similar setting. He advised against assigning Ryder to regular patrol duty.</p>
    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[235,1053,1153,686]]]'>The City referred Ryder to Dr. Julia Kessel, a board-certified psychiatrist, lor an evaluation to determine whether he had a psychic injury and for a recommendation regarding his condition and ability to return to work. Dr. Kessel evaluated Ryder on December 12 and 15, 1996. She also diagnosed Ryder as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the standoff incident on May 4, 1996. Dr. Kessel determined that the circumstances of the incident did not appear to be outside of what could be expected in the normal course of the duty of a police officer. She concluded that Ryder could return to work in a restricted duty capacity, but should not be put in a position that required him to carry a weapon.</p>

Pursuant to Philadelphia’s Civil Service Regulation 32.121, Ryder appealed that determination to the Civil Service Commission of the City of Philadelphia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the hearing <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>before the Civil Service Commission, Ryder testified regarding the May 4, 1996 incident. In addition to Dr. DiKun’s report that Ryder was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder, Ryder introduced the testimony of Lieutenant Daniel Avington and Officer John Finor.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[252,608,1173,833]]]'>Lieutenant Avington testified that the situation was under control when he arrived at the scene on May 4. He indicated that it was unusual for a police officer to confront the situation alone, but that the incident had occurred during the change of roll calls. The timing of the incident resulted in the delay in the response time of the other officers, and led to a city-wide call for assistance, referred to as a triple assist. He further testified that he was aware of only 1 or 2 similar situations that had occurred during his 27 years of service with the police department and that police officers did not often run-into the type of weapon involved in the incident. Officer Finor, a 16 year veteran with the Firearms Identification Unit, also testified that the weapon involved was not rare, but was uncommon. He indicated that the police department was encountering more high capacity weapons than it had ten years ago.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.6",430,[248,1466,1165,624]]]'>The City offered the testimony of Lieutenant Martin O’Donnell, an 18 year veteran serving as an instructor for the Police Academy, and Lieutenant Edward Nolan, an investigator assigned to the Internal Affairs shooting team. Lieutenant O’Donnell testified that police officers are trained to respond to an armed suspect using guidelines on how to respond'to certain incidents because it is difficult to predict a person’s reaction in any given situation. Lieutenant Nolan testified that incidents of the nature involving Ryder were increasing in regularity and that triple assist calls could be a daily event depending on the hour of the day, the tour of duty, and the availability of manpower.</p>

She concluded that the specific trigger to the development of Ryder’s anxiety appeared to be Ryder’s transfer out of the 7th District after 26 years that occurred on July 3, 1996. Dr. Kessel indicated that her original diagnosis had been based on her assumption that Ryder had developed significant symptoms of anxiety prior to his transfer; however, Ryder’s testimony indicated that he had developed such symptoms only after his transfer rather than very soon after the May 4 incident. She testified that post-traumatic stress disorder is usually fully developed within one month of the stressful event. Dr. Kessel concluded that the specific trigger to the development of Rider’s anxiety was the transfer, but continued to recomme.,.! that Ryder return to restricted duties.</p>

The Civil Service Commission accepted the medical expert evidence that Ryder could not return immediately to active duty and directed that Ryder perform active duty after being evaluated by a medical facility chosen by the police department. The City appealed to the common pleas court, which affirmed on the basis that Ryder had sustained a psychic injury as a result of the May 4, 1996 incident.</p>
    <p id="b431-5" data-blocks='[["BL_431.5",431,[222,1788,1157,577]],["BL_432.1",432,[264,323,1154,96]]]'>On appeal before the Commonwealth Court, the City asserted that the common pleas court had erred in concluding that Ryder had been subjected to abnormal working conditions because a confrontation with an armed suspect was a situation that a police officer could expect to occur. The Commonwealth Court rejected the City’s argument and affirmed the order of the common pleas court. The court acknowledged that psychic injury cases are to be considered in the context of the specific employment, and that police work is inherently highly stressful. Nevertheless, the court concluded that Ryder had sustained his burden of proof regarding a psychic <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>injury because the May 4,1996 incident was an actual extraordinary event that caused Ryder’s post-traumatic stress injury.</p>

Unless it is established that these events are so extraordinary and cannot be envisioned as part of the work, the psychiatric injury is not considered abnormal but merely normal stress that flows from the normal wear and tear of everyday work events to which the claimant has a subjective, i.e., an abnormal reaction to these events. As a result, any psychological injury is considered to be brought by the employee’s own subjective reaction to normal events and not the work itself, making the injury non-compensable. However, where there is an extraordinary event that can be pinpointed as causing the psychological trauma, almost always an event that exposes a claimant to great physical danger, there is no requirement that the event be one that <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>cannot be envisioned as part of the claimant’s duties.
