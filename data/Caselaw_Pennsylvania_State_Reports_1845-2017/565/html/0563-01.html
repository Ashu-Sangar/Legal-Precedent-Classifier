The criminal charges stemmed from Perrone’s filing of false and misleading fee petitions which requested payment for legal services purportedly provided to indigent defendants in the City of Philadelphia (“City”) Perrone was sentenced to five years probation for the theft by deception and tampering with public records convictions, and two years probation on the other charges, to run concurrently. Perrone was also ordered to pay $130,000.00 in restitution, which was promptly paid in full. On November 30, 1995, this Court entered an order disbarring Perrone from the practice of law retroactive to September 1, 1993. Perrone now petitions this Court for reinstatement pursuant to Rule 218(c)(6) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement (“Pa.R.D.E.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> For the reasons that follow', we deny the petition for reinstatement.</p>

The Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed a brief on exceptions to the recommendation, and the matter was adjudicated by the Disciplinary Board at a meeting on August 18, 1999.

      <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>The misconduct in this matter arose from Perrone’s filing of false and misleading fee petitions with the City. From 1990 to 1992, Perrone submitted 254 fee petitions requesting payment for legal services provided to indigent defendants in Philadelphia. The fee petitions contained itemized statements of time expended, services rendered and expenses allegedly incurred by Perrone in performing legal services. Each fee petition also contained Perrone’s notarized affidavit that the facts averred in the petition were true. After the Deputy Court Administrator and trial court judge reviewed each fee petition, Peixone was issued ’checks by the City. From 1990 to 1992, Perrone received checks totaling $345,755.12 from the City.</p>
    <p id="b727-4" data-blocks='[["BL_727.4",727,[214,1052,1158,1104]]]'> Perrone’s misconduct continued for three years until it was discovered as a result of an investigation conducted by a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer. A review of Perrone’s fee petitions, as a whole, revealed that he actually billed for more than 40 hours a day for three separate days, 24 hours per day on 85 separate days, and more than 18 hours per day on 140 days. This billing meant that Perrone would had to have worked 11.5 hours per day, seven days a week, 365 days a year from 1990 through 1992. Perrone’s methods of defrauding the City included filing fee petitions and receiving compensation for representing defendants in non-existent cases, representing defendants when official court records showed that he was not present in court on the dates and times listed in the fee petition, researching and writing petitions for allowance of appeal to the Supreme Court when he submitted the identical brief submitted to the Superior Court, and drafting petitions in such a way that it appeared that he represented a defendant on more than one matter when, in fact, he provided legal representation for handling a single matter.</p>

Since his disbarment, Perrone has completed his probationary period, paid his court ordered restitution, volunteered for charitable organizations and spent time with his family. Perrone also worked as a record keeper for a restaurant supply company and as a paralegal, where he had the opportunity to review advance sheets and other legal publications. In addition, Perrone kept up with his legal education by attending CLE courses, completing 42 hours of course work in the year preceding his filing for reinstatement. At his reinstatement hearing, eight character witnesses, including Perrone’s employers, community members and attorneys, testified in support of Perrone’s reinstatement. Perrone also submitted twenty-four “character reference” letters supporting his petition for reinstate<a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>ment. In addition, Perrone testified that he recognized his wrongdoing and admitted that he is solely to blame for his misconduct. Although this evidence suggests that Perrone is working towards rehabilitation, we do not believe that a sufficient amount of time has passed to dissipate the detrimental impact of his misconduct on the public trust. Nor do we believe that he has performed an acceptable amount of community service given the type of misconduct involved here, i.e., the misappropriation of public funds earmarked for indigent representation.</p>

Not only did Perrone knowingly and intentionally engineer a systematic scheme to defraud the City, he did so in his capacity as a court-appointed public defender. As noted by the dissent to the Disciplinary Board’s recommendation, Perrone misappropriated public funds that were specifically intended to be used to provide representation for indigent individuals.

The individuals are those that could least afford the services of a private attorney and must turn to the Courts to appoint representation for them. The misappropriation and theft was incurred by the fee petitions submitted by [Perrone] that potentially deprived an indigent person from representation.</blockquote>
