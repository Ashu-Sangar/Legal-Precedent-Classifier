    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[251,552,1166,625]]]'>The notion that the seven-year restriction of the high risk dangerous offender provisions applies to the third strike subsection simply ignores the actual language and structure of § 9714(a). The third strike provision never refers to “high risk dangerous offenders” at all; only the two strikes provision does. Furthermore, the three strikes provision specifically states that its mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years must be imposed “notwithstanding any other provision of this title or other statute to the contrary,” _ which, of course, includes subsection (b).

It is not just that the two strikes provision refers to the high risk dangerous offender limitation while the three strikes provision does not. The two strikes provision addresses the issue at some length, and sets forth specific sentencing contingencies depending upon whether the presumption of high risk dangerous offender has been rebutted. This is not accidental: the contingencies are essential, since the presumption is neither automatic nor irrebuttable. In contrast, the three strikes provision contains no such contingencies.

      <em>Fonner, supra </em>(citations omitted). The two and three strike provisions appear back-to-back; one mentions high risk dangerous offenders, and accounts for the consequences of an inquiry into that issue, while the other does not. Had the <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>General Assembly intended for the high risk dangerous offender limitations to apply to the three strikes provision, it could have accomplished that result explicitly, as it did in the two strikes provision. But it did not do so. Also, had it intended a high risk dangerous offender inquiry, it would have accounted for the contingent results of the inquiry — unless we are to believe the statute was intended to be absurd. There is simply no principled basis allowing this Court to ignore the actual language of the statute and imply an unmentioned restriction, in a section immediately following one where the restriction was explicitly mentioned and accounted for.</p>
    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[222,919,1157,902]]]'>That applying the seven-year restriction to § 9714(a)(2) ignores the plain meaning of the statute is also demonstrated by a consideration of §§ 9714(c)(4) and (c)(5). These provisions address the ultimate order the trial court is directed to enter after concluding its inquiry into high risk dangerous offender. Significantly, they make reference only to the ten-year mandatory provided for in the two strikes provision; no mention whatsoever is made of the 25 year sentence required under the three strikes provision. The fact that these sections say nothing about the three strikes sentence, while they specifically account for two strikes sentences, strongly corroborates that the high risk dangerous offender provisions, including the seven-year restriction, apply only in “two strike” cases. In contrast, the Superior Court’s reading, approved by this Court, simply ignores these parts of the statute — a rather startling circumstance since the Superior Court dissent relied upon them.</p>

This provision merely defines when the presumption of high risk dangerous offender applies. When the provision rather innocuously states that it is providing this definition “[fjor purposes of subsection (a),” it obviously refers only to those portions of subsection (a) which discuss or involve the presumption of high risk dangerous offender. To pretend that the reference somehow amounts to a substantive amendment <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>and expansion of the subsection to which it refers ignores the definitional nature of the provision, and is a most tortured construction of the overall statute.</p>
    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[255,495,1163,1483]]]'>The construction of the statute adopted by the Superior Court would lead to absurd results. In addition to the fact that it would be curious for the legislature to adopt the same time restriction for two offenses as for one, the construction approved by the Court could lead to defendants with one previous conviction being punished more severely than defendants with multiple prior convictions. Under the two strikes provision, a defendant with one previous conviction for a crime of violence who has successfully rebutted the high risk dangerous offender presumption would still be subject to a minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment. On the other hand, the three strikes provision, as noted above, has no such contingencies. It prescribes no minimum sentence for a defendant with two or more previous convictions who has successfully rebutted the high risk dangerous offender presumption. Thus, a defendant with multiple previous convictions who rebuts the high risk dangerous offender provision would receive no mandatory minimum sentence at all, while a defendant with a single previous conviction who rebuts the presumption would receive a minimum sentence of 5 years. It is inconceivable that the General Assembly, in its effort to punish repeat violent offenders more harshly, would enact a statute that punished second-offenders more harshly than those with three or more prior convictions. That this absurd result follows upon a tortured construction of the statute that ignores its plain language and overall structure in favor of inferring language which does not exist shows just how wrong the decision below, and this Court’s affirmance of it, is.</p>

In December 2000, it deleted §§ 9714(b) and (c) as well as those portions of § 9714(a)(1) which referred to the high risk dangerous offender provision. The fact that the legislature eliminated altogether the high risk dangerous offender provisions — provisions <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>which formed the basis of the Superior Court’s conclusion that the recency requirement applied to defendants with two or more previous convictions for crimes of violence — is a clear indication that it disagreed with the Superior Court’s interpretation of the previous § 9714. In light of this legislative action, it is inconceivable that this Court would affirm the Superior Court’s construction of § 9714 without explanation. It is worth noting that, as a consequence of the amendments precipitated by the Superior Court’s construction, the statute has been made more harsh and inflexible. Now, upon being convicted of a second crime of violence, a defendant automatically receives a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years’ imprisonment regardless of the date of the prior conviction, and a third strike still results in an automatic mandatory minimum of 25 years. Such is the cost of the misinterpretation the majority now affirms without explanation.</p>
