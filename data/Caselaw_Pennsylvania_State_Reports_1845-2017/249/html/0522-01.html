In that capacity he was sent, on the 4th day of December, 1912, to a point just west of Birmingham, where the defendant company maintains and operates three tracks, all used in interstate commerce. The plaintiff was engaged in drilling holes in the ends of the rails, for the purpose of bonding them together, on the north track, known as track No. 3. He was in company of a fellow employee, but without any foreman, the latter having joined the rest of the gang which was working at another point on the defendant company’s road. Information had been given the plaintiff by his foreman that the middle track, known as track No. 2, would be used on the day in question for eastbound trains only. Shortly after 10 o’clock in the morning, while plaintiff was engaged in operating his drill, a freight train approached on track No. 3. The plaintiff, upon observing the train began to unfasten his drill from the south rail, to which it was attached. When the drill was released the train was so close to the plaintiff, according to his testimony, that he concluded it would be dangerous to cross over track No. 3, upon which he was working, to the embankment, and, therefore, stepped on track No. 2. While standing on this track, waiting for the freight train to pass, and without receiving any notice or warning, a passenger train, west-bound, running at a high rate of speed, struck plaintiff, and injured him.</p>

The rail was to be utilized in connection with the new signal system, but it also entered into and formed a part of the roadbed.

The court held that the act under discussion would not apply before the track equipment, etc., had become an instrumentality, but work done on an instrumentality during its use makes it applicable. Mr. Justice VanDevender says, “True, a track or bridge may be used in both interstate and intrastate commerce, but when it- is so used it is none the less an instrumentality of the former; nor does its double use prevent the employment of those who are engaged in the repair or in keeping it in suitable condition for use from being an employment in interstate commerce.”</p>

It was held that he was injured while engaged in interstate commerce. The court said: “It is argued that so far as appears deceased had not previously participated in any movement of interstate freight, and the other cars had not yet been attached to his engine, his employ in interstate commerce was still in futuro. It seems to us, however, that his act in inspecting, oiling, firing and perparing his engine for the trip to Salem were acts performed as a part of interstate commerce, and the circumstances that the interstate freight cars had not yet been coupled up is legally insignificant.” Otherwise, if a workman would stop for a. moment to observe his work, go a few feet to get a tool, etc., and be injured, he could not recover under the law.
