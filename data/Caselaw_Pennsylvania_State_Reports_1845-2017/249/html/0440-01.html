She entered the employ of the defendant on or about the 4th day of February, 1913, and was set to work on a machine where she worked during the days of February 4th and 5th. She finished the work on. this machine about ten o’clock in the morning of the 6th day of February, and was then directed by the assistant foreman to operate another machine, of the. operation of which she had no knowledge, or means of knowledge.</p>

Tbe lower or stationary part of tbe press was a steel plate with a groove extending across it into wbicb tbe joint of tbe binge was pressed in tbe process of offsetting by tbe die wbicb was attached to tbe upper or movable part of tbe press, termed tbe plunger. Tbe plunger or movable part of tbe press, when not in use, was automatically locked when at its highest position and was set in motion by pressing a foot pedal, wbicb released tbe dog or catch, throwing in tbe clutch and causing tbe plunger to descend upon tbe plate to offset tbe binge.</p>

About three o’clock in the afternoon, according to her testimony, a hinge became displaced and was cut partly in two by the plunger and in some way became fastened or stuck in the machine in such a way that she was unable to remove it with the stick furnished her for that purpose. When she attempted to remove it with her hand, the plunger repeated and descended, chtching her left hand and wrist between the plunger and the plate and so completely mangled it as to leave her left hand and wrist in a stiffened condition and practically of no use to the plaintiff.</p>

And the extent of the instruction that should be given to a girl of seventeen years of age who had had no experience whatever in operating such a machine is, in our opinion, a question for the jury, especially where as in this case, the instructions were given by a person who spoke English so brokenly that it was difficult to understand him when giving his testimony as a witness in court. The duty of the defendant in this respect is very clearly set forth by Justice Dean in Tagg v. McGeorge, <a href="/pa/155/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="155 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="983318" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0368-01">155 Pa. 368</a>, as follows:</p>
