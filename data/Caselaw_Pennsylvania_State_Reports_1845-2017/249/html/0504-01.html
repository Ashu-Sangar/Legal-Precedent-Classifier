As a judgment creditor of Hershberger he would have had no lien on the land even though the recorded title was in him, for the real ownership was in another. Until the Act of 1901 was passed, a judgment was a lien only upon lands actually owned by the defendant and against it a secret or resulting trust and an unrecorded title could prevail: Sill v. Swackhammer, <a href="/pa/103/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="103 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="449174" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0007-01">103 Pa. 7</a>. Such trusts and titles were, however, unavailing against mortgagees of the holder of the recorded title or purchasers from him without actual or constructive notice that he was not the real owner of the land. This was the situation when the Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 425, was passed, and the question is as to the change which it made.”</p>

The legislature wisely concluded that such protection was needed, and those against whom it is enforced have no ground of complaint in view of the very simple mode prescribed by the act for their own protection.
