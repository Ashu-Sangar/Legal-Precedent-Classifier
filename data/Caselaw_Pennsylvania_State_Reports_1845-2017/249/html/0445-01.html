The license granted to the defendant company does not show ad exclusive right to that side of the street; that the City did not give up <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>its right to grant a similar right to other companies desiring to use that portion of the city for other purposes. Later there was created in the City of Erie an electrical department, over which is placed an officer termed City electrician, and after the creation of this office the plac-' ing of the poles was given in his care and control, and at the time of the erecting of the poles of the Mutual Telephone Company the city electrician had charge, and he granted a permission to set poles along the line of the poles formerly erected by the defendant company, at such place that the pole would extend up through the wires carried on the poles of the defendant company.</p>

A permission was granted, according to the testimony of the City Electrician, to plant this pole exactly in the line of the poles set by the defendant company. There is no evidence that the defendant company ever objected to the poles being located in this way; and they were in this condition on the 11th day of July, 1911, when the decedent, the husband of the plaintiff, was employed as a lineman by the Mutual Telephone Company, and on the afternoon of this day had been sent by his employer to this place, with the other men in the gang, to repair some broken wires or some difficulty at this junction pole. Upon arriving at the place he was directed by the superintendent of the <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>gang to climb the pole, with a rope attach it to the wire and then throw it over to the men on the ground, when they could pull the cable and the wire over the arm and repair the damage of the broken wire of the company.</p>

The testimony of one witness is that the weather-proofing would be more dangerous than the naked wire itself: others of the witnesses state the weather-proofing is not placed there for the purposé of protection of people operating around or near the wire, but more for the protection of the metal of the wire itself. One of their witnesses states that the only proper insulation is distance; that there is no covering that <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>would make a wire of this character safe, or reasonably safe.

Lewis, <a href="/pa/58/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="58 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="1013159" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0463-01">58 Pa. 463</a>; Rick v. N. Y., Chicago &amp; St. L. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/232/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="232 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="977912" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0553-01">232 Pa. 553</a>; Levin v. Clad &amp; Sons, <a href="/pa/244/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="244 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="1003462" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0194-01">244 Pa. 194</a>. The action was brought to recover' damages for the death of plaintiff’s husband caused by the negligence of the defendant in the construction and maintenance of a system of electric wires in Sassafras street between 21st and 23d streets in the City of Erie. The statement laid the place of the accident at 21st and Sassafras street which, by the amendment, was changed to 22d and Sassafras street where the accident occurred.</p>
    <p id="b485-7" data-blocks='[["BL_485.9",485,[155,1612,1145,802]]]'>It will be observed that the negligent act, the cause of action, was committed during the construction and maintenance of the system of wires on Sassafras street between 21st and 23d street which included the point where the accident occurred, whether at 21st or 22d street. The accident resulted in death for which damages are claimed. As pertinently suggested by counsel, the victim of the defendant’s tort could die but once, at one time and at but one place, and necessarily there could be but one action by the widow for his death regardless of the point or place between 21st and 23d streets where the tort, laid in the statement, was committed. It is equally true that the amendment did not change the measure of damages nor the evidence required to prove the cause of action set forth in the statement.</p>

      <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>. The recent case of Hippie v. Edison Elec. 111. Co. of Pottsville, <a href="/pa/240/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="240 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="993066" data-case-paths="/pa/240/0091-01">240 Pa. 91</a>, is controlling as to the merits of the case. The question of contributory negligence was not for the court but for the jury and was properly submitted in a charge to which no error is assigned.</p>
