The Orphans’ Court held (1) that the interest of the son in the corpus of the estate was contingent upon his surviving his father and that upon his death, in the. lifetime of his father, it vested in the nephews and nieces of the testatrix, subject to the life estate of the father; (2) that after the death of the son, the husband was entitled' to thé entire income during his life. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

After the death of her husband, if the son be living, the whole estate to go to. the son.. Anticipating that Daniel might die during the life of his father she provides that if Daniel should , die without leaving issue living at the time of. his death, then subject to the life interest of the .husband, the same <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>to go to her nephews and nieces. In other words, I give <em>my </em>estate in trust to my husband during his life. If Daniel survive him, then to the said Daniel. If Daniel die during the lifetime of my husband leaving no living issue then the estate to go to my nephews and nieces. It is apparent, it seems to us, from the language of the will that the testatrix, when she used the words, “but if my son, Daniel, should die without leaving issue living at the time of his death then subject to the life interest in income payable to my husband” meant die during the lifetime of Andrew R. Schnebly and not during the lifetime of the testatrix.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b244-5" data-blocks='[["BL_244.5",244,[291,1010,1147,1287]]]'>This same will and this same question was raised in Washington County, Maryland, with reference to the real estate of testatrix situate in that county. It was there held that the real estate under the will vested in the nephews and nieces as the auditor has held here. The decree was appealed from, passed on by the Court of Appeals of Maryland and the decree of the Circuit Court affirmed. In that court the case was entitled Booth v. Eberly and is found reported in the Atlantic Reporter, Yol. XCI, p. 767. It seems to us we might well rest our judgment on the opinion as delivered by that court. There is, however, an abundance of authority found not only in the text books but in the Pennsylvania cases as well, for the conclusion reached by the auditor. It is true, as a general rule, that in case of an immediate gift with a bequest over in the event of the death of the first or preceding legatee the event of the death is referable to the lifetime of the testator. This is so however, only when the language of the will is such that there is no other point of time to which such dying may be referable. McCormick v. McElligott, 127. Pa. 230. Other authorities strengthening the conclusion held by the auditor are: Sharpless’ Est., <a href="/pa/209/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="209 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="936116" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0409-01">209 Pa. 409</a>; McAlpin’s Est., <a href="/pa/211/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="211 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="940081" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0026-01">211 Pa. 26</a>.</p>

In the event the said Daniel Hoke die during the lifetime of his father leaving no living issue then subject to the interest or devise of income to the husband the same to vest in the nephews and nieces. Without further elaboration and further discussion of technical rules it follows from the clearly expressed intention of the testatrix that the auditor was right in his construction of the will, in so far as the corpus of the estate is concerned. It does not follow, however, that the report of the auditor is to be confirmed. The nephews and nieces, as we have seen, take the estate in fee subject, however, to the rights of Am drew E. Schnebly during his life. When we look at the will it is apparent that the first object of the testatrix’s bounty was her husband. She was anxious that he should be well provided for as long as he lived. The estate was principally real estate and if no will had been made the husband would have been entitled to the income during his life. She provides that the income shall be divided between the husband and the son. In anticipation of the son’s death in the lifetime of the father she says “but if my said son Daniel should die without leaving issue living at the time of his death then subject to the life interest in the income payable to my husband.” There is no intention anywhere in the will that the testatrix meant to hamper her husband in any way. She appointed him executor and gave him power to convey any and all real estate, taking only the precaution that he should preserve the fee in the residuary legatees. The presumption from all the surrounding circumstances as well as from the language of the paper itself <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>is that she meant that in the event of her son dying during the life of the father, the husband should have the whole income. The residuary legatees were scattered over the country. Some of them at Mercersburg but most of them in other parts. Daniel Hoke Schnebly died in 1899. From that time until after the death of Andrew E. Schnebly there is no evidence that any attempt was ever made or intimated that he should account for the income. Of course that of itself does not debar them from recovering now because if Andrew E. Schnebly is liable his estate cannot plead the bar of the statute. There is nothing to overcome the presumption raised by the language of the will. The testatrix never intended that he should be yearly compelled to account for these crops. That he should be, we are convinced, was an afterthought which came to the residuary legatees only after the old man was dead.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b246-3" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[310,1289,1143,368]]]'>It follows that the auditor erred in surcharging the accountant with oné-half of the income from the time of the death of Daniel until the death of Andrew E. Schnebly. He also erred in allowing him credit for expenditures on account of said real estate. Andrew E.
