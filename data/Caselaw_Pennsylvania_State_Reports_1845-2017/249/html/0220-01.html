    <p class="summary" id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.11",251,[163,741,1150,429]]]'>Mari Von der Lindte, widow (who died June 6,1912), devised the remainder of her real estate (after a specific devise of 2117 Orleans street), to her son, William, In Trust, to collect the income therefrom and to pay the same to her two children (William Gr. and Mary Schweinsberg) in equal shares, and directed that upon the death of the, survivor the real estate was to be divided between the “issue in equal shares by representation.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b251-8" data-blocks='[["BL_251.13",251,[164,1453,1147,424]]]'>In using the word “proceeds” she must have meant profits, interest, or income. Otherwise, there is such inconsistency that the two clauses cannot both stand. By interpreting “proceeds” to mean “profits,” we give full weight to the expression “during the lives of the children.” If testatrix had intended a distribution of the principal, received from such sale or sales, “during the lives of the children” are meaningless.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b251-9" data-blocks='[["BL_251.14",251,[159,1888,1152,537]]]'>•. ■ That she did not contemplate that a sale terminated the trust, and that she did have in mind a continuing trust ending with the life of the survivor is apparent when we examine the codicil bearing even date with the will and evidently prepared after she had heard the will read, wherein she provides that if the daughter, Mary, shall leave her husband her surviving and no issue, he is to have one-half of the income for life. This evidences the fact that testatrix had in view a trust, irrespective of the- sale of her residuary real estate.</p>
