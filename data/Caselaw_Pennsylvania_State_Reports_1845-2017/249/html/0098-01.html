January 12, 1898, Timothy Lavelle, et ux., conveyed the same lot to James Kirwin; after the description in this deed, the following appears: “Coal and minerals reserved to the legal owners thereof as the same are reserved in the deed of the said premises from William Connell and wife, dated March 11, 1891, and recorded in......Deed Book No. 82, page 216, etc., as by reference thereto will more fully appear”; the grant being, “except as above reserved.” December 11, 1911, James Kirwin and wife conveyed this lot to Agnes L. Loftus, and by deed of like date Agnes L. Loftus conveyed the land to James Kirwin and Margaret Kirwin, the plaintiffs at bar. These latter deeds were made subject to the same “exceptions, reservations and conditions” as appear in the deed from William Connell and wife to Timothy Lavelle. At the trial, it was agreed between counsel that the conveyance to the plaintiffs was of “such title to the land as had been acquired by the said Timothy Lavelle by his deed from William" Connell and wife,” that is to sáy, whatever title passed from William Connell was vested in the plaintiffs at the time of the injury. It was further agreed that William Connell, by deed dated May 31,1905, granted and conveyed to the defendant, inter alia, áll the coal and- minerals lying and being in, under and upon the plaintiffs’ premises, and that the deed contained the following: “Together with the rights and privileges in connection with the mining and fémoval of the coal and minerals hereby conveyed as ;the'said parties of the first -part or any of them now-have or possess so far as the surface of the land 'herein described is nów owfiéd'by them is concerned, and subject to the same "restrictions and stipulations with reference thereto as aré binding upon the parties of the first part, the party of the-second part to have and possess the shhiev rights/, privileges and exemptions as to the excep<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>tions and reservations in the deeds duly recorded in the recorder’s office of Lackawanna County to the various grantees of surface lots, the coal under which is hereby conveyed, which said provisions are hereby made part hereof as herein fully set forth.”</p>

The plaintiffs neither averred nor proved negligence in the manner of mining; on the contrary, the proofs showed that at the time of the injury complained of, and prior thereto, the defendant company conducted its mining operations in accordance with usual and proper methods. We find no material distinguishing facts between the case at bar and Graff Furnace Co. v. Scranton Coal Co., <em><a href="/pa/244/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="244 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1003511" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0592-01">244 </a></em><a href="/pa/244/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="244 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1003511" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0592-01">Pa. 592</a>, 596, where, speaking by our Brother Mestrezat, we said, “The owner of the entire estate may......grant the surface of the land and reserve the mineral estate with the right to mine and remove it without liability for any injury or damage done to the surface, and in such case the grantor or those claiming through him may mine and remove all the coal without being compelled to support the surface” ; the decision in that case rules the present one, and reference is therein made to all the contentions presented at bar, with the ex<a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>ception of the claim that the judgment of the court below contravenes the right of property guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States; this latter contention was not pressed at argument, and it is sufficient to say that we see no merit in it.</p>
