He and nine other workmen, employees of the defendant company, entered a boat at the bottom of. the slope for the purpose of being lifted out of the mine.

In other words, that the defendant was negligent in requiring the hoisting engineer to look after the oiling of the air compressors in addition to operating the tender engine; that too much work Was required of the hoisting engineer; that too many duties were imposed on him, and that because of that fact, the defendant was negligent and such negligence caused the accident and as a consequence, O’Donnell’s death.</p>

In fact it would not have happened except for his carelessness in leaving the engine while the boat was being lifted up the slope. It required from three to four minutes to make the hoist after the engine was started. The indicator on the dial in full view of Gaughan, indicated the location of the boat as it came up the slope. Up to the time of the accident Gaughan had proved to be a competent engineer. He had been in the employ of the defendant as hoisting engineer at the place where the accident occurred for eleven months before the accident. He did not complain of having too much work to do. Prom eight o’clock in the forenoon until approximately two o’clock in the afternoon, he had but little work to do. In fact, during that time he had nothing to do except to remain at his post and make an occasional hoist and fill the oil cups on the air compressors, and that, according to the evidence, would not take more than from four to five minutes approximately i every two hours.</p>

We cannot see that it is of any consequence what his reason was for attempting to stop the engine. It was. not. his desire, or this attempt to stop the engine, no matter from what cause, that of itself alone, caused the accident, but the manner of stopping it. Stopping the engine would have prevented the accident, and this is what the engineer attempted. There was no defect in the machinery that prevented him from stopping it just when he wanted to stop it. But he pulled the reverse lever a little too far, and that, and that alone, let on the steam and caused the upward motion. The upward motion caused the apprehension of the deceased, and that apprehension caused him to do the very rash act of jumping from the cage when it was in rapid motion, and thereby losing his life. Had the engineer pulled his lever more carefully and stopped it when he intended to, in the centre notch of the ratchet, the upward motion of the cage would not have taken place, and the accident would not have occurred. How then is the defendant to be held responsible, unless it is legally responsible for the fault, or the mistake or negligence of the engineer, who was the.fellow servant of the deceased? We cannot see* and therefore are of opinion that the judgment should be reversed for that reason.”</p>
