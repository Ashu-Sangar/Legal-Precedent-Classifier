      <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>At the time of the accident, the plaintiff had charge of and was operating a paper making machine in the plant of the defendant company in the City of Erie, Pennsylvania. The machine, upon which the plaintiff was working, was about 125 to 150 feet in length and composed of three parts or presses, which presses were referred to in the evidence as press number one, two and three. Each of the parts is composed of one large pair of felt rolls termed the “press” and in addition thereto, a series of similar rolls or presses termed “driers,” there being on the entire machine in addition to the three principal rolls or presses, twenty-five or more driers, distributed along the entire length of the machine, through which the paper passed in the course of its. manufacture. Arranged at convenient intervals along the side of the frame or housing of the machine, were foot-boards or steps to enable the operator to pass forward and backward from the one set of presses and driers to another, in following the course of the paper through the machine. These foot-boards or steps attached to the machine about twenty to twenty-six inches above the floor, were necessary for the reason that the course of the paper through the press was at such an elevation that it could not be reached by the operator from the floor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b487-3" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[162,1659,1146,697]],["BL_488.1",488,[281,351,1140,99]]]'>The foot-board or step is made of iron, being about fifty-four inches long by thirteen inches wide, and on the inner side is a flange at right angles with the top or surface of the step containing two slots. The step itself being held in position at the side of the machine by two wrought iron brackets or dowels bolted on to the frame of the machine and slipped through the corresponding slots on the flange of the step, permitting the step to rest loosely upon the brackets. The foot-board opposite the third press, where the accident occurred, was at an elevation from the floor of twenty-six inches. The next step or foot-board was placed opposite or nearly opposite the drier of the third press, a distance of about <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>thirty-two inches from the step of the third press and at an elevation of about twenty inches above the floor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[279,460,1143,862]]]'>It is the custom of the operator to pass along the side of the machine by stepping from one foot-board to another in either direction. The evidence for the plaintiff tends to show that the brackets upon which the foot-board or step of the third press rested, fitted loosely into the slots on the flange of the step, and for this reason a very slight pressure was sufficient to displace or cause the step to slip from the brackets when used by the operator in stepping upon it from another step. This evidence is corroborated by the introduction in evidence by the defendant of a step, testified to be similar in construction to the step on the third press of the machine in use by the operator at the time of the accident, but admittedly not the step in use at the time of the accident. The step introduced fix evidence by the defendant was easily displaced by a slight kick or pressure.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.6",488,[278,1331,1144,696]]]'>The machine, upon which the plaintiff was working, was known as a Moore &amp; White, and had been recently installed in the plant of the defendant company, and had been in operation under the charge of the plaintiff for about fifteen days. The evidence for the plaintiff further shows that on machines of like character to the one in use, and which are in general use in the paper making trade, the steps are in some way fastened or made secure to the brackets by dowels, bolts or set-screws, in such a way as to prevent slipping of the steps from the brackets. It is further shown that the plaintiff had no knowledge, or means of knowledge, that this step was not so secured in the customary way.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b488-6" data-blocks='[["BL_488.7",488,[279,2037,1143,371]],["BL_489.1",489,[135,370,1146,645]]]'>The evidence also shows that the paper in its course through the machine frequently breaks, which makes it necessary for the assistant or operator to step backwards on the machine from one step to the other to secure and start the paper on its course again through the presses and driers. On the day of the accident, this had occurred several times, and the back tender or assistant <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>failing to get thé paper started, the plaintiff attempted to step backward from the drier foot-board or step of the third press to the step or foot-board of the third press, in order to start the paper on its course. When he placed his foot upon the foot-board or step of the third press, one end of the step slipped from the brackets, Causing him to lose his balance, and he was thereby thrown between the press and drier and his right hand caught in the rolls of the third press and crushed to such an extent that it was necessary to amputate two fingers and a part of the third finger; his hand and wrist were also badly bruised and lacerated.</p>

The injuries resulting from such defects are regarded as accidents, mere casualties, and the resultant misfortune must rest upon the servant. However, the servant does not assume those risks which arise from structural defects which are or by the use of reasonable care and inspection, ought to be known to exist by the master. The degree of care required by the master differs from that required by the servant; it being the absolute duty of the master to provide a safe place in which to work, together with safe machinery and appliances, and to maintain and keep the same in a reasonably safe condition by inspection and repair. The servant on the other hand may assume that the master has done his whole duty in this respect and is. therefore not bound to exercise an active inspection of the place and appliances, and consequently he assumes only those risks which are obvious and known to both, or which by the use of ordinary care, should be known to both parties.</p>

A machine of this character consisting of so many pairs of rolls, is admittedly a dangerous one and would naturally call for a high degree of care on the part of the master in looking after and making secure the steps which the operator is compelled through necessity to use in operating the machine, and as to whether the step on this machine was of proper construction under the evidence in this case, was clearly a question for the jury.</p>
