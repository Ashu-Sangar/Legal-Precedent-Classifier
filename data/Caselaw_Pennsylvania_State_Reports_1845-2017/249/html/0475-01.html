A testator bequeathed 23 per cent, of his estate to trustees with direction for the payment of certain legacies and annuities and provided that “after providing for the payment of the legacies and bequests......herein specifically above mentioned, the aforesaid trustees and executors, for charitable purposes, shall use and apply the rest, residue and remainder of said 23 per cent, of my said estate, so as aforesaid given to them in trust and they are hereby authorized, empowered and directed to use and apply the same to such charitable uses, objects and purposes as they may ■ from time to time select, or deem most desirable, hereby giving to them the full and absolute power to select and apply the whole of said rest, residue and remainder of said 23 per cent, so to be received, to charitable uses, objects and purposes, as fully and completely as I myself could do if living.” The trustees having been awarded 23 per cent, of the estate petitioned the Orphans’ Court for leave to set aside certain specified bonds which had already been “designated and alloted by them to provide for the payment of the respective specific bequests” and that they might distribute the balance of the residuary estate for charitable purposes. One of the legatees demurred to the petition on the ground that the estate must be kept in the hands of the trustees intact until all the annuity legatees had received their legacies. The attorney general filed an answer alleging that the amounts set aside for the payment of the legacies were excessive. The court overruled the demurrer and held the answer insufficient and granted the prayer of the petition. <em>Held, </em>that while the practice of petitioning the court for leave to set aside the securities' was open to criticism, yet as it appeared in fact that the securities designated in the petition Bad actually been set aside, and that the Orphans’ Court had not in fact exercised an advisory jurisdiction but had passed upon the action of the trustees in a proceeding which had been contésted by a legatee and by the attorney general, the objection that the <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>court had no jurisdiction was without merit and that the trustees in setting aside the securities had carried out the directions of the will, and the decree was affirmed.</p>

Kimberly died in June, 1905, possessed of a large estate, which he disposed of by will, the first section of the first paragraph whereof provides, inter alia, as follows: “I will, devise and bequeath all my property and estate......to John C. Owsley,......Ira B. Bassett, ......and George A. Baird,......; they to have and hold the same, to themselves and their successors or successor as trustees and executors upon the trusts and for the uses and purposes and subject to and under the directions following, that is to say; ......” The provision just quoted is followed by six other sections in which extensive powers and wide discretion are vested <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>in the executors and trustees. In the second paragraph of the will, the testator gave his executors and trustees, for purposes of distribution, seventy-seven per centum of his estate, and named numerous devisees, with the exact proportion to be received by each. The “executors” distributed the full seventy-seven per centum accordingly; their accounts concerning that part of the estate were confirmed absolutely, and, all debts of the decedent and claims allowed against his estate, having been paid, the executors were “legally discharged” as such.</p>

(23 per cent.) of the whole of my said estate: In Trust, nevertheless, for the following purposes”: here follows section “No. 1,” containing five gifts, or “legacies,” in the nature of annuities, aggregating $500 per month, and one bequest of $5,000; then the will proceeds thus: “After providing for the payment of the legacies and bequests in (section). No. 1 of this paragraph......, herein specifically above mentioned, the aforesaid trustees and executors, for charitable, purposes, shall, use and apply the rest, residue and remainder, of said twenty-three per. cent. (23 per cent.) of my said estate, so as aforesaid given to them in .trust, and they are hereby authorized, empowered and directed to use and apply the same, to such charitable uses, objects and purposes, as they may from time to time select or deem most desirable; hereby giving to them the full and absolute power to select and apply the whole of said rest, residue and remainder of said twenty-three per cent. (23 per cent.) so to be received, to charitable uses, objects and purposes, as fully and completely as I myself , could do if living......” The bequest of $5,000. was paid in full, and one of the legatees, to whom, the trustees were directed to. pay. $50 <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>per month, died prior to the present proceeding ; the. remaining gifts to the other legatees named in section No. 1 of the third paragraph of the will are still in full force and payments thereon are being made each month, the total sum required for this purpose being $450 per month, or $5,400 per year.</p>

In response the attorney general of Pennsylvania filed an answer in which, after admitting the main allegations of the petition, he averred that the several blocks of securities set aside to provide for payment of legacies were excessive in amount. In addition, a demurrer, was filed by Abner Rush, one of the legatees mentioned in section No. 1 of the third paragraph of the will, to the effect that “under the terms of said will of Peter L. Kimberly, deceased, the said trustees have no authority to set aside any part of said estate for the purposes set forth in the above mentioned petition, but must hold and keep said estate now <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>in their hands intact and undivided until all the annuitant legatees named in said paragraph 3 of said last will have died and have received the full amount of each and every of their respective specific legacies and bequests thereunder.?’</p>

He contends that “the court below, erred in assuming jurisdiction of the case ......; in finding that the trustees had authority under the will to release part of the property from the charge of the annuities......; in assuming......to advise the trustees as to the extent of their powers under the will”; and, generally, in entering the above quoted decree.</p>

Here, the third paragraph of the will of Peter L. Kimberly, deceased, is the controlling law of the case before us, and thereunder the trustees are specifically directed to provide for the payment of the legacies and bequests mentioned in section No. 1 thereof, and after so “providing,” to “use and apply,” meaning to distribute (see Kimberly Est., No. 1), the remainder of the residuary estate “so as aforesaid given to them in trust.” The paragraph in question does not state that, after payment of the legacies mentioned in Sec. No. 1, the trustees are to apply, or distribute, the remainder of the twenty-three per centum held in trust by them, but the phrasing is, “after providing for the payment of the legacies, etc.,” the trustees “shall use and apply, etc.” We construe the provision under. consideration to mean that the trustees are. directed to provide for securing the monthly payments mentioned in Sec. No. 1 Of the paragraph in question, and, within a reasonable time, to distribute for charitable uses, according to their best judgment, the balance of the residuary estate; the assets segregated as security for . the aforesaid monthly payments gradually to be released for. charitable distribution as the decease of the several legatees, for whose benefit they were set aside, occurs. In providing for these payments, however, the. trustees followed the practice indicated by the Act of February .23,1853, P. L. 98, relating to the exoneration <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>of residuary real estate from liability -for annuities,' instead of formally setting aside tbe securities necessary for the purpose, showing this fact in their account and having the propriety of their action determined on exceptions thereto. While the practice pursued below may be open to criticism, yet, we are not convinced that it constitutes reversible error in this case. As already indicated, the trustees had the right and were obligated to set aside securities sufficient to insure the payment of the legacies provided for in section No. 1 of paragraph 3, and, by plain implication, under the will' before us, when they segregated such securities the balance of the residuary estate became exonerated from any charge or liability accruing from such legacies; this being so, no harm was done by the terms of the decree.</p>
    <p id="AM3" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[164,1179,1146,1241]],["BL_512.1",512,[301,354,1141,642]]]'>This is the situation: the -trustees had filed an account and were about to distribute part of the funds of the trust estate, but, before so doing, they segregated certain designated assets to provide for the payment of the before mentioned legacies; the decree in terms recognizes this fact and “approves and affirms the action of the said testamentary .trustees. in setting apart certain assets ......for the purpose of providing for the payment of the "special bequests, etc.” The setting aside of these assets was, in practical effect, a supplement to the account: then pending before the court; when the fact of their segregation was thus placed óf -record, one of the legatees mentioned in Sec. No. 1 of ■paragraph 3 promptly challenged the right of-the trustees , in the premises, saying that the whole fund in their hands had to remain as security for his and other similar legacies. On the other hand,- the attorney general, representing the State in its relation to the charities provided for in the testator’s will, contended that the fund, set aside was unnecessarily large in amount, and, therefore, encroached upon thé charity fund which otherwise would be immediately aváilable for distribution; thus there was.á lis mota as to the right to set aside the fund in question <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>and concerning the amount proper for the purpose in view, and this controversy, until settled, stood in the way of the distribution of the estate provided for in the will, hence, the Orphans’ Court was the proper tribunal to determine the issues involved. The fact that, in stating its determination, the court below incidentally declared that the effect of the exercise of the right and duty vested in and put upon the trustees, to provide for the payment of the legacies, was to exonerate the other securities in their hands, in no sense harms the appellant, nor, under the circumstances at bar, does it represent the exercise of forbidden advisory jurisdiction.</p>
