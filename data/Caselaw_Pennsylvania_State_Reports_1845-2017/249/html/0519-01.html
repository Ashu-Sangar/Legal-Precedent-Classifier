This tower is , located on the old tow path. Twenty-five or thirty feet distant, to the north thereof, is a public highway, along which has been constructed and maintained substantial guard rails. To the south of the tower flows the Juniata river. There are no houses in the immediate vicinity, but in the summer this location was used at times by campers, Ashers, picnickers and others in pursuit of pleasure. Surrounding the base of the tower was a five-strand wire fence. A child of eight years of age, living on the other side of the river and about a half mile distant, strayed over to the tower. He climbed between the wires of the fence and by means of a temporary wooden ladder reached the lower girder of the tower. <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>From the uprights of the tower there extend short posts or pins, which were used by the boy in scaling the tower. At a distance variously estimated from 25 to 50 feet from the ground, he came in contact with the charged wires and was thrown to the ground and badly injured.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b551-3" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[160,623,1149,1134]]]'>Under these circumstances was the defendant company liable? Could they have reasonably anticipated that a child of that age would crawl through the wire fence and ascend the steel structure by the means afforded? We think not. This company was in possession, and in so far as this case is concerned had the right of possession of the land enclosed. The photographs offered in evidence indicate that the pins, by means of which the boy made the ascent, were short and far apart. The fact that the boy reached the top of the tower shows that it was possible for a venturesome boy to accomplish that feat, but it certainly was not within the realm of reasonable probability, and that is all the defendant company could or was required to anticipate, especially when there was no testimony that children were accustomed or permitted to use or play on the ground within the enclosure or on the tower. In so far as the evidence reveals this was the first boy to obtain admission to or climb the tower, thus distinguishing it from the line of cases of which Mullen v. Wilkes-Barre Gas &amp; Electric Co., <a href="/pa/229/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="229 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="971813" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0054-01">229 Pa. 54</a>, is an example.</p>

Superior Ct. 282</a>, as in the case at bar, there was no evidence to show that there was an invitation, permission or knowledge of use of the defendant property, and no recovery was allowed. It cannot be gainsaid but that a company using wires of this dangerous character must exercise great care, but they are not bound to anticipate the highly improbable occurrence. The facts in the case at bar show that all the precautions were taken that were imposed, under the law, upon the defendant company in making these wires inaccessible</p>
