In an action upon mortgages by the receiver of a trust company, it is no defense that the mortgagor and her husband, who was the former treasurer of the company, had given the mortgage to cover a shortage in the funds of the trust company, in view of the examination of its assets by a bank examiner, and that a contemporaneous oral agreement had been made that the mortgages should never be enforced; as the oral agreement was not omitted from the writings through fraud, accident or mistake, it would be unavailable in any case, and if the agreement was for the purpose of deceiving the bank examiners, it would be illegal and therefore no defense.</p>

When all the offers of testimony, both those accepted and rejected, are considered, the defense amounts to this: that S. H. Ridall was the treasurer of the plaintiff trust company at the time the instruments in question were executed; that the mortgaged property belonged to his wife, Iva G. Ridall; that a shortage existed in the funds of the trust company, due to misconduct of its president; that the board of directors, desiring to “repair the assets of the trust company,” had its representative see the defendants and request them to execute the mortgages in suit, “to cover the shortage of the ......president of the......company”; that, thereupon, the bonds and mortgages were signed, sealed and delivered by the defendants; that they asked for the as<a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>sistance of counsel, but were told tbe matter could not be made public, for, if known, there would be “a run on the bank and the trust company would be closed”; that when the bonds and mortgages were delivered, a treasurer’s check for the amount thereof was given to Mrs. Ridall, which was indorsed by her and handed back to the trust company; that the defendants never actually received a cash or other tangible consideration for the bonds and mortgages; finally, that, at the time of the execution of these instruments, a contemporaneous parol contract was entered into, whereby it was mutually agreed that, despite the terms of the writings, under no circumstances would the defendants be required to pay either the principal or interest thereby secured.</p>
