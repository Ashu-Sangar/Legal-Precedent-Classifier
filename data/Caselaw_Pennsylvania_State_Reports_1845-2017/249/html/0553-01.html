At the time of the accident plaintiff was seventeen years old. He had been taught to operate the press and had worked on it during the period of his employment. The press was operated by a foot treadle, the machine stopping when the foot was taken off the treadle. The use of the machine was for the punching of tin. Sometimes the piece cut out stayed in the hole and when this occurred the defendant’s instruc<a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>tions were that the operator should use a stick or rod to push it through. Plaintiff testified that on the day of the accident he had been instructed to use his hand instead of the rod as the latter nicked and spoiled the die. Defendant denied this instruction. The plaintiff testified that- the accident occurred while using his hand to push through the waste, the machine repeating after he had taken his foot off the treadle, and the punch catching his hand. The court left to the jury the question as to whether plaintiff was negligently instructed by the defendant.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b584-5" data-blocks='[["BL_584.6",584,[353,1004,958,42]]]'>The court charged the jury, in part, as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b584-6" data-blocks='[["BL_584.7",584,[304,1057,1147,1182]]]'>“We can easily imagine a case where it might have been necessary for the jury to consider whether or not this machine ought to be guarded, and whether or not it was apt to slip the cog, or to suddenly come down when under the operation of the machine that would not happen, but we eliminated those things for this reason, that under the theory of the plaintiff himself, in the trial of the case, the issue was narrowed, and also under the theory of the defendant it must necessarily have been narrowed. It is immaterial how this accident happened as far as the punch coming down is concerned, whether it happened because the cog slipped, or whether it happened by the plaintiff’s unconsciously putting his foot upon the treadle, unless if he put his foot upon the treadle he did so because he was carelessly operating the machine. We have eliminated all these other questions for the reason that the plaintiff, in his testimony, stated that he had, previously to Mr. Stern’s instruction that morning, removed this waste by a stick or an iron rod, and if he had continued in that then this accident could not have happened to him, because he would not have had his hand under the machine.” (1)</p>
