    <p class="summary" id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.10",572,[287,693,1147,970]]]'>It appears from the record that the accident in which the plaintiff suffered the injuries complained of occurred where Harrison street, a public street in the Village of Hazelhurst, was crossed by tracks of The Pittsburgh, Shawmut &amp; Northern Railroad Company at grade. At the time of the accident, which was about 7:30 o’clock on the evening of January 16, 1912, the railroad company’s employees were switching across the Harrison street, crossing. Plaintiff testified that he approached the tracks, stopped at a point about 15 feet from the rail, beside the station of the company, and looked and listened. At this point his view to the west was unobstructed for several hundred feet, but the view to the east was entirely cut off by the depot. After stopping he proceeded and was struck by a switching train backing from the west. The evidence as to lights on the train and the sounding of warning signals was conflicting. There was no safety gates or watchman at the crossing.</p>
