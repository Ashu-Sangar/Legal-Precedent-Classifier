It might constitute a sufficient reason for the <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>legislature to regulate the practice of optometry by special enactments, or, by suitable enactments or amendments, to bring optometrists within the regulative control of the defendants making up the board entrusted with the supervision over such matters as are involved in the present case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[150,687,1147,754]]]'>A good deal has been made in the case, of the prohibition in the first section of the Act of 1911, applicable to persons who “diagnose diseases.” It has been claimed that the plaintiffs and other optometrists do diagnose diseases. The proofs in the case are to the effect that optometrists, examining the eye of a patient, either with or without the aid of artificial means, in case they find that, the interior of the eye is clouded and gives ground for suspicion that there is some disease of the eye, inform the patient that for his own protection and safety, he should consult a physician. We understand that under such circumstances the optometrists decline to furnish lenses for the patient. Now, is that diagnosing diseases?</p>

The word, etymologically and in its general interpretation, signifies, as we understand it, a discrimination, a passing of judgment, as to physical conditions. In a sense, we suppose it may be said that a mother having a child giving signs of whooping cough or some febrile condition, passes judgment upon the case. Is that diagnosis within the meaning of the statute? If a barber finds that the man in his chair shows signs of a diseased scalp or skin, does he diagnose the disease in reaching such a judgment? We think not. We think that a fair and usual construction and interpretation of the words “diagnose diseases,” such as we ought to give to them in determining the meaning of the acts of assembly in question, is that the mental act involved in the matter of diagnosis should be something more than the <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>mere determination that there were indications of disease.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b294-4" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[314,449,1142,859]]]'>The optometrist does not undertake to determine what disease, if any, exists in an eye which he examines. According to the proofs, it is sufficient reason for a reference of the case to a physician, if there is that which gives him reasonable ground for suspecting that a disease exists. It seems to us that it would be applying a severe rule and stretching language beyond its natural force, if we should say that such action on the part of an optometrist is “diagnosing diseases.” The use of the plural noun seems to us to indicate what otherwise would appear to us to be a proper construction, that to “diagnose diseases” meant to distinguish, discriminate, between two or more diseases. If, however, that is too narrow a view to take of the case, the quoted phrase must involve the act of determining what disease exists. This the optometrist does not attempt to do.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[313,1317,1143,973]]]'>. It might be said with a great deal of force that the evil which the legislature intended to provide against was that incompetent physicians and surgeons, those who held themselves out to the public as physicians and surgeons, either generally or in a limited sphere, should be subjected to examination by the medical board and to the necessity of obtaining a license to practice medicine and surgery. The enacting clauses of the statute must be interpreted, under familiar rules of construction, with reference to the purposes of the statute as set forth in the preamble as well as in the title. Undoubtedly, whatever would naturally, legitimately, fall within the scope of that which is described in these parts of the statutes, could properly be regarded as covered by the terms of the enactment. Applying this standard, it seems to us that the scope of the defendants’ powers is not large enough to embrace the conduct and the occupation of the plaintiffs.</p>
