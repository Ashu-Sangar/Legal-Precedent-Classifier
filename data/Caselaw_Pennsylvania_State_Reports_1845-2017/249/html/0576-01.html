W. Scott, Esq., between Mr. Cope, Mrs. Florence R. Veile and Mr. Scott, her counsel, an agreement was reached which was in fact a compromise and family settlement, and that thereupon the receipt (Finding No.' 4) was drawn up find duly executed by Mrs. Florence R. Veile, who re<a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>ceived a check for the first monthly payment of $40.00. This receipt contains this clause: “And hereby on behalf of the said Clarissa Yeile declare that I accept all the provisions contained and set forth in the said last will and testament (Theresa Yeile’s) and codicil thereto.” The master cannot agree to this view. The only proper party to make a valid agreement or compromise affecting the estate of this minor was her duly appointed guardian. The Easton Trust Company had been appointed to that office but a few days before this meeting. This guardian had the sole authority to act in this matter, but was not present or. consulted. The testimony as-to what took place at this-meeting is very meagre. It does not appear that there was any discussion as to the estate, no disclosure as to its value or annual income, nothing said upon which it is possible to base an idea of a fair adjustment or compromise. The amount to be paid was the exact sum which Theresa Veile directed should be paid monthly for the proper education, maintenance and support of Clarissá M. Yeile by the executor and trustee of her will. There does not seem to have been any compromise at all, certainly.no mutual concessions; just the payment of the amount due Clarissa M. Yeile under the will of Theresa Veile, and which Belle E. Seip was bound to make so long as she held the estate under the terms of that will. The receipt itself so describes the payment. This paper passed through the hands of careful attorneys. If it had been intended to be a written statement of an agreement to settle amicably any dispute under the will of Xavier Veile or Theresa Yeile, such fact would certainly have appeared therein in terms. It may well be, as claimed by plaintiff’s counsel, that counsel for Mrs. Yeile permitted her to sign this receipt because he knew that the minor’s estate could not be divested by it, and it was therefore harmless. Mr. James for the guardian may have had the same view but the master, regards it as significant that the receipt for the second payment, June 7, 1894, written in <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>the same book by Mr. James, makes no reference to the previous receipt which contains Mrs. Veile’s acceptance of all the provisions of Theresa Veile’s will, and is in these words: “Easton, Pennsylvania, June 7,1894. Received of Isabella R. Seip, executrix and trustee under the last will and testament of Theresa Veile, deceased, $40.00, being the amount of monthly payment set ap'art for the maintenance and support of Clarissa Veile. (Signed Florence R. Veile for Clarissa M. Veile.)” If Mr. James had wished to take some action at this time to put the guardian on record as approving the previous receipt or the alleged family settlement, and making the guardian responsible in any degree for what Mrs. Veile had done, he would have taken advantage of this opportunity, when he had in his possession the check for the monthly payment of $40.00, payable to the order of the ward, and the receipt book in which to receipt for the payment. Instead of doing anything of this kind, he drew a carefully worded receipt for Mrs. Veile to sign for the regular monthly payment due under the will of Theresa Veile, and gave her the check unendorsed by the guardian. His action makes it plain that the legally constituted guardian would have nothing to do officially with the arrangement which had been entered into by the mother of the ward. The master is of the opinion that this adjustment could not be sustained under the authorities. They speak of family settlements that “if fair and equitable” should not be disturbed, etc; Johnston v. Furiner, <a href="/pa/69/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="69 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="1026489" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0449-01">69 Pa. 449</a>; or “if fairly made,” Walworth v. Abel, <a href="/pa/52/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="52 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1002254" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0370-01">52 Pa. 370</a>; or “when made in good faith and with full disclosure,” Bierer’s App., <a href="/pa/92/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="92 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="490914" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0265-01">92 Pa. 265</a>. As the master finds the fair rental value of these three properties is now and was at that time $4,800.00, it could not be claimed that a settlement based on a payment of $480.00 per year, and without any disclosure as to the value of the estate and the yearly rental, complied with these essential requirements. If this is the correct view with regard to this arrangement with Mrs. <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>Florence Veile, it necessarily follows that the plaintiff is not estopped because of the payments made by Isabella R. Seip, executrix and trustee, to plaintiff’s mother from 1894 to 1911. That the plaintiff is entitled'to recover from hér cotenant mesne profits or rents cannot be disputed. The right of a tenant in common out of possession to recover his share of the income of the common property from his cotenant in possession was given by the English statute of 4 Anne c. 16, sec. 27. Tenants in common being seized per my et per tout, under the common law each one was entitled to the joint possession of the whole, and therefore there was no liability to account where one was in possession and the other was not. To remedy this the Statute of 4 Anne was passed. The English courts construed this act to apply only when one tenant in common receives the money from another person to which both parties are entitled, and keeps it all, or more than his just share. This statute is in force in Pennsylvania, and under it our courts have held that a tenant in possession need not account to his co-tenant unless he had actually received rent from a third party for the premises, or had entered into a contract to pay rent to his cotenant for the property occupied and used by him. See Norris v. Gould, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20W.N.C.%20187" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="15 W.N.C. 187">15 <em>W. </em>N. C. 187</a>. This is a decision by Judge Thayer of the Common Pleas of Philadelphia, which Justice Mitchell in Enterprise Oil &amp; Gas Company v. National Transit Company, <a href="/pa/172/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="172 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="874100" data-case-paths="/pa/172/0421-01">172 Pa. 421</a>, commends and approves as “the best summary of the law in our own books” on this subject. See also Kline v. Jacobs, <a href="/pa/68/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="68 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="1024605" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0057-01">68 Pa. 57</a>; Coleman’s App., <a href="/pa/62/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="62 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="1017263" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0252-01">62 Pa. 252</a>. Under these decisions a tenant in common out of possession' in this State was without redress as against his cotenant who was occupying and using the common property until the passage of the Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 237. This act gives the tenant out of possession the right to sue for Kis share of the rental value for the time the real estate was in the possession of the cotenant. Section one of this act provides: “In all cases in which <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>any real estate is now or shall he hereafter held by two or more persons as tenants in common, and one or more of said tenants shall have been or shall hereafter be in possession of said real estate, it shall be lawful for any one or more of said tenants in common, not in possession, to sue for and recover from such tenants in possession his or their proportionate part of the rental value of said real estate for the time such real estate shall have been in possession as aforesaid; and in case of partition of such real estate held in common as aforesaid, the parties in possession shall have deducted from their distributive shares of said real estate the rental value thereof to which their cotenant or cotenants are entitled.” Upon his act and the Statute of 4 Anne is founded the right of the plaintiff to recover from the defendant mesne profits or rents not only for the Garren and Gies properties, rented by her to third parties, but also for the brewery property occupied and used by her. These two acts are considered in Lancaster v. Flowers, <a href="/pa/208/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="208 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="998094" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0199-01">208 Pa. 199</a>. The court said “The English Statute of 4 Anne, c. 16, sec. 27, enables one tenant in common to maintain an action of account against this cotenant as bailiff for receiving more of the income than his just share or proportion, and the English courts have held that the statute applies only where ‘one tenant in common receives the money from another person to which both parties are entitled by reason of their being tenants in common and their interests as such, and of which one receives and keeps more than his just share,’ Henderson, v. Eason, 79 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 701. The Act of June 24,1895, P. L. 237, contemplates that where the property is held by tenants in common that the parties in posses; sion shall have deducted from their distributive shares the rental value to which their cotenants may be entitled. These statutes supply the remedies not existing at common law, and cover the case where the cotenant out of possession, is entitled to rental values and contemplate that these remedies shall be applied to such cases <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>of tenancy in common.” In Dorrance v. Ryan, <a href="/pa-super/35/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="35 Pa. Super. 180" data-case-ids="872760" data-case-paths="/pa-super/35/0180-01">35 Pa. Superior Ct., 180</a>, speaking of the Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 237, the court say “The ground upon which a tenant in common is liable to be called upon by his cotenant to account in an action of assumpsit for a proportionate share of the money which he has actually received as rent from a stranger is entirely different from that which makes him liable for mere use and occupation. The Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 237, gave to tenants in common who have been out of possession a right to recover from , those who have been in exclusive possession, their proportionate part of the rental value of real estate held in common. Prior to this statute one tenant in common could not maintain either trespass for mesne profits, as assumpsit or account render in order to compel a co-tenant to pay for mere occupation of the premises, without showing either an ouster or an express promise to account or to pay something. But prior to the Act of 1895 a tenant in common was allowed to recover in assumpsit his share of the profits received by the cotenant from a stranger.” See also Wells v. Becker, <a href="/pa-super/24/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="24 Pa. Super. 174" data-case-ids="849806" data-case-paths="/pa-super/24/0174-01">24 Pa. Superior Ct. 174</a>. The question of ouster does not arise in this case. Between tenants in common ouster must be proved by decisive acts of hostile character: Solomon v. Rogers, <a href="/pa-super/13/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="13 Pa. Super. 70" data-case-ids="825589" data-case-paths="/pa-super/13/0070-01">13 Pa. Superior Ct. 70</a>. Denial of title is not of itself ouster: Filbert v. Hoff, <a href="/pa/42/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="42 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="481484" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0097-01">42 Pa. 97</a>. Ouster will not be presumed merely because cotenant takes the rents and profits: Watson v. Gregg, <a href="/watts/10/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="10 Watts 289" data-case-ids="1850969" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0289-01">10 Watts 289</a>. It follows from these decisions that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff under the Statute of 4 Anne for the rents received by her from the Garren and Gies properties, but ' as to the brewery property she is liable for rental value under the Act of 1895. In the first case the courts regard her as a trustee for her cotenant of the rents collected, and hold her to a strict accountability. She cannot plead the statute of limitations and is liable for interest on the annual rents. In regard to the brewery property the master is of the opinion that she can be <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>compelled to account for rental value for a period of six years only, that is from April 8, 1906, the action of ejectment having been begun April 8,1912. In regard to the Garren and Gies properties the case of McGowan v. Bailey, <a href="/pa/179/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="179 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="886920" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0470-01">179 Pa. 470</a>, is directly in point. This was a dower case. The owner died in 1863, leaving a widow and children. No dower was set out. The real estate ultimately passed to defendants who, in 1884, opened a coal mine and by 1893 had taken out most of the coal. In that year the widow filed a bill for her one-third of the value of the coal with interest, as a tenant in common. The Supreme Court, in allowing the claim, said, “A tenant in common exercises his undoubted rights to take the common property, and he has no other means of obtaining his own just share than by taking at the same time the share of his companions.” Cotenant “had a right to mine and receive all the money for the coal including her one-third. It was not therefore an act hostile to or in denial of her right. As to her thirds they were merely trustees for her, and long before lapse of time raised a presumption of payment she made a demand for an accounting. It was held over and over again ever since Dillebaugh’s Est., <a href="/watts/4/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="4 Watts 177" data-case-ids="1842733" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0177-01">4 Watts 177</a>, that ‘the statute of limitations in such cases is out of the- question.’ ” The court also decided that she was entitled to interest for the whole period the meantime being 1890, three years before the action was commenced. It is very plain from these decisions that Mrs. Seip has received these rents as trustee, that the statute of limitations cannot be pleaded and therefore she must account for them from April 8, 1894, with interest.</p>

From April 8, 1894, to June 24, 1895, Mrs. Seip was rightfully in possession of this property and could not be called upon to pay anything. But from June, 1895, she became answerable to <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>her cótenant fór the. rental va-lne. The plaintiff, by her guardian, could have demanded at that time from the defendant a fair, annual rent, and in case of failure to agree could have began an action to protect her rights áhd recover the rent:' Nothing of this kind was done, and the. matter, was permitted to remain undetermined and ■uncontested until after the Easton Trust Company retired from the guardianship in 1912, when on April 8th, of that, year, Eassit, the then guardian, brought the action of .ejectment above mentioned. The question now to be "determined is. whether the plaintiff shall recover the rental value or mesne profits for the whole period from June' 24, 1895; oi*, being barred by the statute of limitations, only, from a time six years prior to the ejectment suit,; that is from April 8,1906. The statute of limitations of March 27,1713,1. Sm..L. 76, sec. 5, expressly exempts infants from its operation, and if no guardian had ever been.appointed for this plaintiff, it is •not at all likely that this question would have been raised. But. the fact-that there has always been, since plaintiff’s right first arose, a custodian with legal possession of her estate and authorized and empowered to protect her rights entirely-changes the case. Is a guardian privileged to slumber upon the rights of his ward, while executors, administrators and. trustees must be ■alert to prevent the bar of the statute, even though the beneficiaries of the estates they administer may be minors? There, is every reason why a minor ignorant of •the fact that he is the owner of property, or without capacity to take care of it orto proceed to protect his title, should have the benefit of the exemption of this 'act, but there is none whatever when his estate is. in the custody of a guardian. 1 This summary of the authorities is found, in 25 Cyc. 1261: “In the majority of juridictións, where the title, or right of action vests in a personal representative, guardian or trustee, who is under no legal disability, the statute of limitations begins to run, notwithstanding the minority of the ¡beneficiary, <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>and where the former is barred the latter is likewise barred.” In Meeks v. Olpherts, <a href="/us/100/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="100 U.S. 564" data-case-ids="4661" data-case-paths="/us/100/0564-01">100 U. S. 564</a>, the court say, page 569, “Whatever doubt may have existed, at one time on the subject, there remains none at the present day, that whenever the right of action of a trustee is barred by the statute of limitations, the right of the cestui que trust thus represented is also barred. This doctrine is clearly stated in Hill on Trustees, 267, 403, 504, and the authorities there cited fully sustain the text, both English and American.” Citing Smilie v.

Veile in 1892, while they were operating the ' brewery, agreed to furnish to Jacob W. Garren, who had just leased the property for a term of years, as their contribution towards the cost of certain alterations and improvements to the property, which Garren had undertaken to make. Mrs. Seip agreed to this only after Theresa Veile, the life tenant, had promised to pay the $500.00, cost value of the beer. Edward S. Veile died two days after Garren took possession in 1893, and Theresa Veile died the following year without having paid for the beer donated to Garren. The master thinks that the objection is well taken as this is clearly a debt of Theresa Veile and should have been collected from her estate. The credits allowed for repairs, taxes, insurance and water tax appear in Finding No. 18. As has been found above there is a difference between the brewery and the other two properties in regard to rents. There is also a difference in the matter of liability to contribute towards the cost of maintenance, repairs and taxes by the tenant <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>out of possession. It would be manifestly most inequitable to require such’ tenant to contribute anything whatever towards these items. The tenant in possession having the sole occupancy without rent, using and wearing out in the operation of the plant the fixtures and appliances and causing the rotting away of the floors and other portions of the buildings liable to decay, and generally bringing about a condition of disrepair and disintegration in the buildings themselves, is certainly not in position to ask contributions for up-keep from a co-tenant who is getting nothing whatever out of the property.

The amount as appears in the statement presented from T896, to April 8, 1906, is $4,543.22. The original brew, house, a one-story brick structure, was taken down almost to the foundation and rebuilt as a two-story structure with addition for office. A new one-story building, called the wash house, 26 feet by 47 feet, was erected of brick, iron and concrete, with small addition known as pitch house. New floors of iron beams, ■hollow brick and concrete were put into the ice house, and generally this same material was used in making repairs and replacements in the most substantial manner wherever needed. Ab entirely new stable was built. Repairs and improvements of this character are clearly within the inhibition of the rule in Crest v.

H. Kress, who was called as an expert witness. He is a builder of large experience in Reading, Pennsylvania, who had also been in the distilling business for five years, had owned’and operated a brewery for three years, had been called upon as an expert to appraise three other breweries, one of them at Northampton, this county, and is a large owner of real estate in and near Reading. He was able and clearly compe: tent to estimate the value and capacity of this brewery, and with information as to its average output give such an opinion as to the value of the property in 1894 and its rental value as is of material assistance in' this-inquiry. Xavier Veile bought the half interest of his partner, Christian Tache, in this real estate in 1871, for $10,000. He subsequently, in 1878, built the ice house, a two and a half story brick building, at a cost of $13,-000. At the time of his death the brewery was producing more than 2,800 barrels of beer and had a capacity of more than 4,000. Cost of beer in 1894 was about $4.00 and the selling price from $5.50 to $8.00. The cost has increased since then, but there is still a profit if sold at $5.50. By 1900 the output was 5,900 barrels. In the opinion of Mr. Kress, a brewery of the capacity of 4,000 barrels was worth $30,000, and had a rental value of $3,000, repairs and taxes to be paid by the tenant. His valuation of the property was fully confirmed by the defendant, who, a few weeks after he testified, bought it at the figure named. The master is of the opinion that the finding of a rental value of $3,000 per annum is fully sustained by the evidence.</p>

The amount of this indirect rent as found, $300, added to the $600 actual cash received, is $900. Compare this with rents paid for saloon properties in this neighborhood.

As Mrs. Seip is entitled to credit for taxes paid on the Xavier Veile Estate portion of the property from. April 8, 1906, some apportionment must be made. A method can be devised from the city assessments. Prior to 1905 the assessment was $20,000. From that date, about the time the improvements on Mrs. Seip’s individual property were added to the plant, the assessment was raised $15,000, representing these improvements.

There was also tbe will of Xavier Veile wbicb gave defendant a life estate in half of this property. It must be that all these contributed to tbe result. Besides tbe defendant gets tbe property at its value in 1894, and tbe fact that sbe gets it saves her from any loss by reason of her expenditures on tbe adjoining property. Such improvements as sbe made were essential to a modern brewery, and are just as valuable to tbe plant as when they were first put in. Sbe got possession of this brewery fully equipped to produce beer. It was certainly incumbent upon her to maintain it.

It is claimed on the part of the defendant that this was a family agreement which was intended to protect the defendant and also the interests of Clarissa M. Yeile, the plaintiff, by giving her the income provided in the will of her grandmother. It is contended that the agreement was a compromise of possible litigation and accepted by all the parties in interest and that it bars the plaintiff from recovering from the defendant her share of the rental value of the property which was in the defendant’s occupancy from 1894 until 1913, when it was determined by this court that the title to the premises was in the plaintiff and defendant as tenants in common. The agreement in question is a writ: ing signed by Florence R. Veile for her daughter, Clarissa M. Veile, in which is recited a codicil to the will of Theresa Veile, the grandmother of the plaintiff and the mother of defendant, who claimed the property, by which the defendant was required to pay the plaintiff forty dollars per month, during the defendant’s lifetime, and which writing acknowledged the receipt of forty dollars, being the first monthly payment under the codicil, and declared “that I accept all the provisions contained and set forth in said last will and testament and codicil thereto.” This paper is dated May 7, 1894. At this time Clarissa Veile was not quite two years of age and the Easton Trust Company was her guardian. It is strenuously contended by the defendant, in an elabor: ate argument dealing with the testimony and the law, that this was a family settlement or compromise which is binding on the plaintiff, and deprives her of the right to recover her share of the rental value and income of the property from the date of the death of the life tenant, Mrs. Theresa Veile, until it was determined in 1913 by the decision of this court that the plaintiff was the owner of the undivided one-half interest in the property.

The guardian was not present when the paper was executed by the mother of the child, was not consulted beforehand about it, and had no knowledge of it until the mother had signed it. It is unnecessary to discuss what took place between Mr. Scott and Mr. Cope, the attorneys alleged to have represented the interests of Mrs. Seip and the minor child and her mother, or the telephonic communication with Mr. James, the president of the Easton Trust Company, as the writing executed by the mother of the minor must be relied on to establish the family agreement. It is clear that she had no authority to bind her minor child or to make any agreement which would affect the latter’s rights in the real estate in question or the income or profits arising therefrom: Senser v. Bower, <a href="/pen-w/1/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="1 Pen. &amp; W. 450" data-case-ids="1826157" data-case-paths="/pen-w/1/0450-01">1 P. &amp; W. 450</a>; Heft v.

It must be assumed that the eminent counsel, acting for the parties in the transaction, were fully aware, not only of the interest of the minor in the property but also of the only legal way in which it could be affected or divested. The president of the Easton Trust Company, the guardian, was also a lawyer of high professional standing and, therefore, manifestly knew that the mother’s signature to the paper in question could not bind, her infant child. The guardian did not sign the <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>paper and thereby become á party to the alleged family settlement. It received none of the annual payments directed to be made by the will of Theresa Yeile. The annual installments were all paid to the mother and receipted for by her. In fact, Mrs. Seip and her counsel dealt entirely with the mother, to the exclusion of the guardian. Why the guardian did not act for its ward and execute the paper in question does not appear, but may be inferred from the fact that the alleged compromise was manifestly against the interests of its ward. • The guardian repudiated the alleged settlement by bringing the action of ejectment in 1912 and subsequently filing this bill for an accounting of the rents, income and profits of the property while it was in the possession and occupancy of the defendant. The learned counsel who acted for Mrs. Seip and for the child’s mother respectively and the president of the trust company knew that the guardian was the only party who could legally represent the child in effecting a settlement. There could be, therefore, no reasonable ground for the defendant’s belief that the paper in question was a valid legal family settlement which bound Clarissa Veile, the two year old child. Mrs. Seip could not have been misled as to the effect of the paper in view, of the fact that she was represented by such eminent counsel. In fact, the paper signed by the mother was not a release to Mrs. Seip, or anything but a receipt and a declaration that the mother, on behalf of her daughter, accepted all the provisions of Theresa Veile’s will and codicil. The only inference that can be drawn from the whole transaction is that Mrs. Seip was willing to deal with the mother of the child instead of the guardian, and that the latter did not intend to bind itself or its ward by the paper executed by the mother. A chancellor cannot make an agreement for parties nor enforce an agreement against one who is not a, party to it.

An examination of the evidence does not convince us that the master erred as to the rental value for which the defendant should account. As said by the learned court below, the master fixed the rental value of these properties upon testimony that commended itself to him, and his findings have the effect of a verdiet of a jury unless clearly erroneous.</p>

With the exception of these credits, the defendant’s appeal must be dismissed.

As to tbe other two parcels be held that the statute of limitations could not be invoked to prevent an accounting for tbe whole period of tbe defendant’s occupancy of tbe property, and required her to account from tbe death of tbe life tenant in 1894. Tbe plaintiff contends that tbe defendant cannot set up tbe statute to defeat an accounting for tbe whole period because (1) she was under legal disability, being a minor; and (2) because defendant both expressly and impliedly acknowledged liability to account, promised to pay tbe amount found due, and waived tbe statute.</p>

The master found that the rental value of the brewery property was $3,000 per annum during the whole time of its occupancy by the defendant. The latter is compelled by the court below, under its ruling, to account for the ' rentals for only six years prior to the institution of the action of ejectment, or from the year 1906, and not from the year 1894 when the defendant went into possession of the premises.</p>

The legal title to the property was in the infant and not in her guardian and, therefore, the right of action was in the infant and not in the guardian. We can see no reason for the distinction made by the learned master and the court below be- - tween an infant without a guardian and one having a guardian. It is true, that a guardian may bring an action to protect his ward’s interest, but if he fail to do so the infant may institute an appropriate action for enforcing his rights after he becomes of age. If the legal title was in a trustee or in a guardian it would be different, and in such case if the action was not brought within the statutory period it would be barred as to the person under disability during the period of limitation.

The fact that a guardian or the infant himself brings a suit before the disability is removed does not operate as a waiver of the saving clause in favor of the disability.” In 25 Cyc. 1260, 1261, citing many authorities to sustain the text, it is said: “In many jurisdictions, by express statutory enactment, or by judicial construction, where the statute excepts persons laboring under disabilities from its operation, without mentioning infants specifically, infants are within the saving clause of the statute, and the statute does not run against them during such disability, even where such infant has a guardian who might <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>maintain the action in his or her name, provided the title or right of action is in the infant.” The rule announced in the text hooks is supported by numerous decisions: Fink v.

If this right was reserved, why was not the right to plead the statute of limitations also reserved if it was so intended? This action was brought prior to the date of the agreement and the statute of limitations had not then been pleaded.
