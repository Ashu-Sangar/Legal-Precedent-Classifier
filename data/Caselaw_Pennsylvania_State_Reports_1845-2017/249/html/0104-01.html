In an action to recover damages for death of a laborer at the plant of the defendant, a cement manufacturipg company, the case was for the jury where it appeared that the deceased was killed by the fall of a block of hard cement, which had been left hanging for a considerable length of time on the wall of a bin which the deceased was cleaning, there being no testimony that deceased had ever before that time been inside of the bin in question, though he had worked in similar bins, and it further appearing that, although the deceased had been warned to be careful and instructed as to a proper and safe method of clearing cement from the bins under ordinary conditions, he had never been cautioned concerning the <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>existence of the hardened cement block at the top of this particular bin, or instructed how to avoid that element of danger.</p>

Kunkel, who was killed on June 19, 1913, while engaged at work as an employee of the defendant company; she sued on her own behalf and for a child of the deceased, alleging that <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>her husband’s death was caused by the defendant’s negligence; the jury returned a verdict in her favor, and the defendant has appealed.</p>

    <p id="b137-3" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[142,964,1151,1464]],["BL_138.1",138,[315,356,1154,1078]]]'>Inasmuch as the testimony in the case was capable of sustaining the foregoing findings of fact, there can be no doubt that the issues were for the jury. The appellant contends, however, that two errors were committed in the trial judge’s rulings on evidence: first, that the court erred in not permitting an expert, called by the defendant, to give a full answer to a certain question put on his examination-in-chief. Counsel for the defendant asked: “What are they (men who work in cement bins, in the trade generally) cautioned to do?” The reply was: “To never remove cement from the bottom of a pile, or, in other words, form a cave in the cement, because”—at this point the witness was stopped by a general objection from counsel for the plaintiff, which was sustained. It will be observed that the expert had given a responsive, and apparently full, reply to the question put, so no error was committed in stopping him from stating reasons to reinforce his answer, when such reasons had not been asked by the examiner. The next assignment complains that the court erred in sustaining the plaintiff’s objection to the following question asked the expert by counsel for the defendant: “Assuming that the top of the pile of cement had been formed into a cake of the dimensions of the cake indicated here in this trial, what warning or instructions are given to the men cleaning out the cement as to that cake or crust?” The notes of testimony show that one witness for the plaintiff said <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>this cake of hardened cement.was “about 8 feet long and 4 feet across and about 8 inches thick,” and another stated it was “about 8 feet long, 4 feet wide and 8 or 12 inches thick”; whereas, on the other hand, most of the witnesses for the defendant said that the bin had been absolutely cleaned out several times before the accident, and there was no block .of hardened cement left in it; one of them, however, stated that there was a “little bit of cement, wet......on top......,” and when asked the question, “How big a block was there on top?” he replied, <em>“2y2 </em>feet long” and “about <em>2y2 </em>feet wide.” With the testimony in this condition, it can readily be seen that the interrogatory in question was not intelligible, for, had it been answered as put, it would have been impossible for the jury to tell whether the witness had in mind a “cake” or “block” of cement of the size indicated by the witnesses for the plaintiff, or of the much smaller dimensions stated by the witnesses for the .defendant; this fact alone is sufficient to justify the ruling of the trial judge here complained of.</p>

Here clearly we have a natural condition of affairs, such as you find in any stone quarry, with stones and earth intermingled, especially at the top, and due care consequently to be taken by those removing the ground, so that the stones which are imbedded in it do not lose their support, slide and injure a workman. What Mr. Justice Elkin says applies to this natural condition, as is clearly shown, where on page 40 we have: ‘It has been expressly held that when an employee engages to work in such places, he assumes the risks and dangers incident thereto and resulting from natural causes’”; and the .other <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>cases cited by the appellant are likewise., readily distinguishable on their facts.
