March was tried first and convicted of murder of the first degree. The murdered man, S. Lewis Pinkerton was overseer of the Brick House Farm but did not live there. Both March and the defendant were employees under Pinkerton. Before the time of Pennington’s employment and after that up to the time of the <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>commission of the offense George March lived on the Brick House Farm with a certain Mary Louise Barber, with whom he had illicit relations. The defendant had been employed by Pinkerton on October 7, 1913, and boarded with March from the time of his employment down to and after the commission of the crime on November 7,1913, There was no denial that the defendant participated in the affair and there was ample evidence to justify the conviction, if defendant was mentally responsible. The defense set up was that the defendant was not mentally responsible but was an imbecile and unable to distinguish between right and wrong. The jury found a verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree, and sentence of death was passed. The record did not disclose that when the jury returned and asked that the judge’s charge to the jury concerning expert testimony should be read, the court while it did not read the charge as originally given, fully instructed the jury on the question of expert testimony. Defendant appealed.</p>
