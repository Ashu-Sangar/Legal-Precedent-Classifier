L. 352, resulting in an injury which rendered necessary the amputation of four fingers of his right hand.

The wheel on the machine used for the purpose of stopping and starting the same was missing and in order to stop or start the machine it was necessary for the plaintiff to use a pair of pincers or pliers.</p>
