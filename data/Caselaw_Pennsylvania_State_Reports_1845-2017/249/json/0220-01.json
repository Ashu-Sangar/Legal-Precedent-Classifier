T., 1915, by Anna Maria Schweinsberg, from decree of O. C. Philadelphia Co., April T., 1914, No. 469, dismissing exceptions to adjudication; in Estate of Mari Von der Lindte, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Elkin and. Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nThe adjudication of Lamorelle, J., was in part, as follows: \u25a0\nMari Von der Lindte, widow (who died June 6,1912), devised the remainder of her real estate (after a specific devise of 2117 Orleans street), to her son, William, In Trust, to collect the income therefrom and to pay the same to her two children (William Gr. and Mary Schweinsberg) in equal shares, and directed that upon the death of the, survivor the real estate was to be divided between the \u201cissue in equal shares by representation.\u201d\nBy the' succeeding item of her will she appointed her said son* William G. Muhlhauser, executor and trustee, authorized him to sell the real estate and directed that the proceeds of such sale \u201cduring the lives of the children should be divided equally between them.\u201d\nIn using the word \u201cproceeds\u201d she must have meant profits, interest, or income. Otherwise, there is such inconsistency that the two clauses cannot both stand. By interpreting \u201cproceeds\u201d to mean \u201cprofits,\u201d we give full weight to the expression \u201cduring the lives of the children.\u201d If testatrix had intended a distribution of the principal, received from such sale or sales, \u201cduring the lives of the children\u201d are meaningless.\n\u2022. \u25a0 That she did not contemplate that a sale terminated the trust, and that she did have in mind a continuing trust ending with the life of the survivor is apparent when we examine the codicil bearing even date with the will and evidently prepared after she had heard the will read, wherein she provides that if the daughter, Mary, shall leave her husband her surviving and no issue, he is to have one-half of the income for life. This evidences the fact that testatrix had in view a trust, irrespective of the- sale of her residuary real estate.\nGummey/J., filed the following opinion, dismissing exceptions to the adjudication:\nA majority of the court agree with the learned auditing judge that this trust continues until the death of the survivor of the testatrix\u2019s children.\nConceding that it is unusual to consider \u201cproceeds\u201d as \u201cincome,\u201d nevertheless we believe that in adopting this construction we are correctly ascertaining the intention of the testatrix, and, if authority is needed, it is found in Robert\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 407.\nThis view is supported by the language of the codicil which provides that in the event of the death of the testatrix\u2019s daughter in the lifetime of her husband, one-half of the income to which the daughter would be entitled to if living shall be paid to the husband for life; while if we are to adopt the construction contended for by the exceptants, the contingent bequest to the husband as well as the estate in remainder given to the daughter\u2019s children, if any, could be defeated by a sale of all the real estate and the distribution of the proceeds.\nIt appears, however, that Katharine Muhlhauser is testamentary guardian of the estate of Mary Theresa Muhlhauser who is still a minor and, therefore, the award in her favor will be paid to her guardian and the adjudication is so amended.\nThe exceptions are dismissed.\nAnna Maria Sehweinsberg appealed.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing exceptions to the adjudication.\nGustav A. Schwab, for appellant.\nNo paper book for appellee.\nApril 19, 1915:"
