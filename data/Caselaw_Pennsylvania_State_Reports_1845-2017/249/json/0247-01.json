Bailey Company.\nNegligence\u2014Master and servant\u2014Safe place to worJc\u2014Fellow servant\u2014Transitory danger\u2014Manger signs.\nIn an action by an employee to recover damages for personal in* juries, binding instructions for the defendant are proper where it appears that the plaintiff, a pipe fitter, was walking through a passageway in his employer\u2019s establishment to a room in which he was to work and was injured by bales thrown down by laborers employed in the same establishment who neglected to warn him or to place in the passage the warning signs marked \"Danger\u201d provided by the employer, which they had been ordered to place in position before throwing down the bales.\nArgued March 24, 1915.\nAppeal, No. 101, Jan. T., 1915, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 5, Philadelphia Co., Dec. T., 1912, No. 2247, on directed verdict in case of Martin Larsen v. John T. Bailey Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestbezat, Elkin, Stewart and Moschziskeb, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries.\nPlaintiff was a pipe fitter, employed by the defendant, and was walking through a passageway when he was injured by bales thrown down by another employee.\nAt the trial Martin, P. J., instructed the jury as follows :\nGentlemen of the jury,\u2014The plaintiff claims that the defendant was guilty of negligence in failing to furnish a reasonably safe place for him to work. There was nothing in the construction or location of the passageway which made it unsafe, and the defendant had provided f\u00f3r the safety of those who used it by directing that when bales were thrown down there should be danger signs put up as a caution, or that a man should be stationed in the passageway to prevent the use of it during such time. It appears from the evidence that Killian threw down seven bales and Mealey stood them up to be trucked away, and that he then went back and threw down the other three, but there were no danger signs put up, although the defendant had proper signs prepared for just such an occasion, and it was the duty of employees who threw down bales to put up the signs. It was Mealey who was negligent in not performing the duty of warning the plaintiff as he approached the passageway; and Killian who neglected to put up the danger signs. The negligence which caused the injury to the plaintiff was that of his fellow servants, and he has failed to show any negligence oil the part of the defendant, or of anyone acting as vice-principal.\nThe point submitted by the defendant is affirmed, and I direct you to find a verdict for defendant.\nError assigned was in directing a verdict for defendant.\nGeorge J. Edwards, Jr., with him I. Hazelton Mirkil -, for appellant.\n\u2014The master , is charged, with the express duty of providing a safe place in which his employee may work and this duty extends to providing a safe passageway which they may use in passing to and from their work. It is a duty of which he may not relieve himself by delegating it to another employee. . Under the law that other employee, upon whom devolves the duty of making the place safe, immediately becomes a :vice-principal: Ricks v. Flynn, 196 Pa. 263; Barry v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Co., 234 Pa. 367; James v. Snellenburg, 244 Pa. 365; Curry v. Atlantic Refining Co., 239 Pa. 302; Powell v. S. Morgan Smith Co., 237 Pa. 272; Martin v. Atlantic Transport Co., 237 Pa. 15; Metzger v. Cramp, 235 Pa. 17; Ferry v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., 232 Pa. 403.\nF. B. Bracken, for appellee.\n\u2014Where an employer provides proper safe guards to protect employees from the transitory risks arising in the course of business, he is not responsible for the failure of the employees to use them when he has no knowledge of this neglect: Snyder v. Longmead Iron Co., 244 Pa. 325; Duffy v. Platt, 205 Pa. 296; McGregor v. Penna. R. R. Co., 212 Pa. 482; Staebler v.
