Grace Contracting Company.\nNegligence\u2014Master and servant\u2014Employee moving rails\u2014Unnecessarily dangerous position\u2014Assumption of rish\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014N onsuit.\nIn an action by an employee against a contracting company engaged in doing grading work, a compulsory nonsuit was properly entered where it appeared that the plaintiff was moving by means of horses one of the rails used by a steam shovel; and was injured by reason of the rail swinging to one side and striking him, immediately after the horses were started, and that while plaintiff contended that defendant was guilty of negligence by reason of its foreman having required him against his will and judgment to drive both horses together in doing the work, when he claimed that by \u201csingling\u201d them the danger might have been avoided, it further appeared that plaintiff assumed an unnecessarily dangerous position when there were several other positions which he could have occupied in safety, and that he was thoroughly familiar with the work he was doing.\nArgued April 26, 1915.\nAppeal, No. 323, Jan. T., 1914, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Crawford Co., Sept. T., 1913, No. Ill, refuging to take off compulsory nonsuit in case of M. K. Gray v. Tbe Robert Grace Contracting Company.\nBefore Mestrezat, Elkin, Stewart, Moschzisker and Frazer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries.\nThe facts appear in the following opinion by Prather, P. J., sur plaintiff\u2019s motion to take off compulsory non-suit :\nThe defendant company had a contract with the Nypano Railroad Company to do certain grading necessary for the construction of a double track system. Plaintiff on the day of the accident was engaged by defendant company to move the iron rails which formed the temporary track for its steam shovel. The moving consisted of drawing the rails backward along the temporary track for eight or ten feet and then hitching to the front ends to draw them in front of the steam shovel.\nPlaintiff was driving his own horses. He hitched to the first rail by means \u00f3f a rope three or four feet long, and when he started his team, the rail swung to one side and crushed the bones of one leg, which injury resulted in its amputation.\nThe negligence complained of is that plaintiff was required by the foreman against his will and judgment to drive two horses in doing this work, when by \u201csingling\u201d his horses, he might have been at the horse\u2019s head, and thereby avoided the danger and escaped the injury.\nPlaintiff testified that his horses were pulling slightly at an angle from the line of the rail; that the off horse was walking about a foot from the end of the ties; the plaintiff himself was walking slightly to the rear of his horses and slightly to the left of the near horse. It appears undisputed that there was plenty of room to the left of plaintiff\u2019s path where he might have walked in safety in driving his team.\nThere is no suggestion, either by inference or evidence that he might not have walked to the right of the rail with perfect safety.\nIt is quite apparent that with some three feet between the end of the rail and the double tree, he might have had perfect control of a manageable team by a position two or three feet to the rear of the near horse.\nIt seems that any one of these three positions as driver might have been adopted by plaintiff with absolute safety.\nSome evidence was offered to the effect that a driver could not manage his team if he stood farther to the left in driving. This evidence was of\u2019doubtful competency, particularly when we consider that the rail was only to be moved from six to ten feet; when the plaintiff urges that one horse ought to have handled the load, and when plaintiff was driving his own team which was so quiet that it practically required no managing by lines. From his testimony, we quote: \u201cIf you would say whoa, they would stop any time; they was rather mild; when you would tell them to stop, they would stop quick.\u201d\nThe fact that defendant company\u2019s foreman directed plaintiff to hitch to the rail with a team instead of one horse, does not convict defendant of negligence, particularly when plaintiff in the exercise of ordinary care might have avoided the injury that befell him.\nOur conclusion is that under the undisputed facts plaintiff assumed the risk incident to his employment; that he might have avoided the injury by the exercise of due care, and lastly, that there is no evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence. It follows that the motion to take off compulsory nonsuit should be refused.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was in refusing to take off the nonsuit.\nFrank J. Thomas, for appellant.\nRichard W. Martin with him George F. Davenport, for appellee.\nMay 10, 1915:"
