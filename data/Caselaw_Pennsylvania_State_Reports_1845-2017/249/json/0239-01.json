T., 1910, No. 4799, dismissing exceptions to amended decree in case of Samuel Rea, Trustee, v. Pennsylvania Canal Company, John Cadwalader, Jay Cooke, 3rd, Edward Bailey, Donald McCormick, Henry S.

Before Ralston, J.\nA bill in equity was filed by a trustee under a mortgage issued by the Pennsylvania Canal Company to foreclose the mortgage. The foreclosure was not resisted but bondholders intervened and challenged the allegations contained in the bill of the trustee, that the fund produced by the sale of the mortgaged premises should be used, first, for the payment of coupons owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, which were more than sufficient to absorb the entire fund. The case was heard upon bill, answer and proofs. The lower court decided that the bondholders were first entitled to. be paid. On appeal the decision was reversed by the Supreme Court in Rea v. Pennsylvania Canal Co., 245 Pa. 589, and the case was sent back for further proceedings.\nAm amended decree was thereupon entered by the court below, awarding priority not only to the coupons in the hands of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, but also .to interest upon each coupon from its due date until the date, of payment. The court , dismissed exceptions to the amended decree. The bondholders appealed.\nError assigned was in dismissing the exceptions.\nThomas Raeburn White, with him John Oadwaladef, Jr., William F.
