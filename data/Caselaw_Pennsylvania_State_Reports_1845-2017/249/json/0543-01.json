After a careful consideration of the assignments of error and the argument of learned counsel in support of them, we are of one mind, that the learned trial judge committed no error during the progress of the trial or in his charge submitting the case to the jury.\nJudgment affirmed.",

T., 1915, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Northampton Co., June T., 1912, No. 30, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Thomas A. H. Hay, William O. Hay, M. P. McGrath and Robert M. Petty v.
