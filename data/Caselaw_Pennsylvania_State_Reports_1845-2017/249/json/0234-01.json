        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nThe plaintiff recovered a verdict for damages suffered through the death of her husband, who, on January 22, 1912, at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, was knocked \u00b0 down and killed by the defendant\u2019s automobile. Judgment was entered on the verdict and the defendant has appealed; she assigns for error the refusal to give binding instructions and the subsequent refusal of judgment non obstante veredicto in her favor.\nSince the jury found for the plaintiff, the evidence must be looked at in the light most favorable to her, and whenever it is in conflict, so that either of two inferences or conclusions is possible, that which most strongly supports the verdict must be adopted. When the testimony is so viewed, these facts appear: Mr. Miller was struck by the defendant\u2019s automobile while he was in the act of crossing from the west to the east side of 5th street, about midway between Chestnut and Market streets, in the City of Philadelphia. A large building, known as The Philadelphia Bourse, is located at this point, on the east side of 5th street between Ludlow street, on the north, and Ranstead street, on the south. Ranstead street runs from 4th to 5th streets, and directly opposite its entrance into 5th street, running westward from the west side of that highway, is an alley called Crockett\u2019s Court. The roadway of 5th street, from Chestnut street to Ranstead Street, a distance of about 58 yards, is 26 feet wide, but immediately above Ran-stead street, in front of The Bourse, this widens to 39 feet. A single line of car tracks is located in the center of 5th street, as of the width of 26 feet, and upon this line trolley cars run to the north. At the time of the accident, some wagons were standing on the west side of 5th street immediately south of Crockett\u2019s Court, and an. automobile was standing directly opposite on the east side of, 5th street, at the corner of Ranstead street A doubl\u00e9 team, hauling \u00e1 silgar wagon, at a slow trot, was coming northward on 5th street in the car track, and the defendant\u2019s automobile was back of this wagon, proceeding in the same direction. About 18 feet north of the north line of Crockett\u2019s Court some crossing stones \u2018 were laid from the west curb of 5th street to the car track, and this was \u00e1 usual and customary place for many pedestrians to cross that thoroughfare. During the last ten years, the defendant\u2019s chauffeur had frequently visited the neighborhood of 5th and Chestnut streets, at all hours of the day, and he admitted familiarity with the prevailing conditions at the point of the accident. The custom and traffic regulations of Philadelphia require that, when a driver desires to pass a vehicle in front of him, he must turn to the left, when possible; that is, one passes a conveyance going north on the west side. When approaching Ranstead street the driver of the defendant\u2019s automobile decided to pass the vehicle in front of him; instead of keeping in the track, behind this wagon, until he reached a point beyond the place where the west side of 5th street was obstructed by the standing teams, he then and there turned his car to the east, and, after clearing the wagon and team which he desired to pass, swung his machine to the northwest, in order to regain the track; to accomplish this the motor had to go through a space of from 10 to 20 feet between the moving wagon it had just passed and the automobile which was standing on the east side of 5th street at the corner of Ranstead street. The plaintiff\u2019s husband was walking eastward across 5th street on the before-mentioned crossing stones; when he reached a point near the middle of the car track, about 12 feet from the west curb of 5th street, the defendant\u2019s motor, which had been hidden from his view, suddenly emerged from the east side of the sugar wagon and team, then approaching in the track, and struck and killed him. The chauffeur\u2019s seat was so low that he could not see over the horses\u2019 heads, and, in consequence, he did not see Mr. Miller until . actually upon him. At the time of the accident the car was running from 20 to 25 miles an hour, and gave no warning of its approach; after coming in contact with Mr. Miller, the machine ran about 20 feet beyond the point of the accident before it was stopped, dragging his body under it. Although the testimony depended upon by the defendant would show a somewhat different condition of affairs, yet, the foregoing facts could be found from the evidence relied upon by the plaintiff.\nThe case was well presented by the trial judge, and neither side excepted to his charge; but, on this appeal, it is most strenuously contended that the plaintiff\u2019s husband was so plainly guilty of contributory negligence, in stepping in front of the moving automobile, that judgment should be entered here for the defendant. It is true, Mr: Miller was not crossing the street at the end of a block, still he was doing so at a point which the defendant\u2019s chauffeur knew was customarily, and very generally, used for that purpose. The presumption is that Mr. Miller exercised due care according to the surrounding circumstances; although some of the evidenc\u00e9 depended upon by the defendant would indicate a lack of proper care on the part of the deceased, -in not seeing and avoiding the approaching car, 'yet the de: f\u00e9ndant\u2019s chauffeur, while stating at one point in his testimony that Mr. Miller \u201cmust have seen me befor\u00e9 I did him,\u201d plainly said, more than once, that he could not see the man he struck until he was actually upon him, and that the latter could not see him (the driver) until approximately the same time, saying, \u201cI couldn\u2019t see him for- the hors\u00e9s........he couldn\u2019t see me either\u201d\u2014 \u201cI'couldn\u2019t see him-for the horses, and he couldn\u2019t see me\u201d\u2014\u201cI said I couldn\u2019t see Mr. Miller; until I hit him, nor he couldn\u2019t see me.\u201d On the whole, it seems clear that the : issues of contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff\u2019s-husband and of the defendant\u2019s negligence were both properly submitted to the jury.\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.",

Tiedemann, Appellant.\nNegligence\u2014Automobiles\u2014Pedestrian\u2014Customary street crossing\u2014Traffic regulations\u2014Contributory negligence.\nIn an action to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband resulting from being struck by an automobile owned by defendant and operated by defendant\u2019s chauffeur, it appeared that plaintiff was struck while crossing a city street at a point which though not a street crossing was a usual and customary place for pedestrians to cross, with which fact defendant\u2019s chauffeur was acquainted. There was evidence to show that the chauffeur passed a wagon in front of him on the right instead of the left side as prescribed by the traffic regulations of the city and that the deceased was struck as the automobile emerged from the side of the wagon, and that neither the defendant\u2019s chauffeur nor the deceased were able to see each other until practically at the instant of the collision.
