    "head_matter": "Fink v. Smith, Appellant.\nNegligence\u2014Railroads\u2014Grossings\u2014Stop, looh and listen\u2014Case for jury.\nIn an action against a railroad company to recover damages for personal injuries the questions of defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence are for the jury where it appears from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that on approaching a railroad crossing on a dark night he stopped, looked and listened at a point 15 feet from the track, from which he could see more than 400 feet in the direction from which the train afterwards approached, and that hearing and seeing no train he then proceeded, walking at an ordinary gait toward the track, and was struck by defendant\u2019s switching train, and where the evidence as to whether the train was properly lighted, and whether a warning was given, is conflicting.\nArgued May 3, 1915.\nAppeal, No. 187, Jan. T., 1915, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. McKean Co., Oct. T., 1913, No. 21, on verdict for plaintiff in case of James Fink v. Frank Sullivan Smith, as Receiver of The Pittsburgh, Shawmut & Northern Railroad Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Elkin, Stewart and Frazer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before Bouton, P. J.\nIt appears from the record that the accident in which the plaintiff suffered the injuries complained of occurred where Harrison street, a public street in the Village of Hazelhurst, was crossed by tracks of The Pittsburgh, Shawmut & Northern Railroad Company at grade. At the time of the accident, which was about 7:30 o\u2019clock on the evening of January 16, 1912, the railroad company\u2019s employees were switching across the Harrison street, crossing. Plaintiff testified that he approached the tracks, stopped at a point about 15 feet from the rail, beside the station of the company, and looked and listened. At this point his view to the west was unobstructed for several hundred feet, but the view to the east was entirely cut off by the depot. After stopping he proceeded and was struck by a switching train backing from the west. The evidence as to lights on the train and the sounding of warning signals was conflicting. There was no safety gates or watchman at the crossing.\nVerdict for the plaintiff for $3,452, and judgment thereon. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was in refusing binding instructions for the defendant.\nThe tenth assignment referred to in the opinion of the Supreme Court was to the following portion of the charge:\n\u201cThe evidence of the trainmen is that the bell was ringing, just how, what volume of sound was coming from that bell, just how loud it was, just with what frequency it was ringing is not in evidence at all, simply tell you the train bell was ringing, was it loud enough to give warning to Fink, but they say the bell was ringing.\u201d\nJohn G. Johnson and Edwin E. Tait, with them Edgar W. Tait, for appellant.\nJ. E. Mullin, with him F. J. Woods, for appellee.\nMay 17, 1915:"
