        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered,\nby Agnew, J.\nThis was a feigned issue to try the question whether a certain bond, on which judgment had been entered under a warrant of attorney, was the deed of Peter Copley, as one of the sureties of Thomas Fogarty, a collector of taxes. It was proved on the trial that Fogarty obtained the signature of Copley, who was an illiterate man, by representing to him that the paper was a petition to the county commissioners for his appointment as tax collector. The county contended that the deception mattered not, unless it be shown that the county had a knowledge of the fraud before accepting the bond. The court below held that the misrepresentation of the contents of the paper avoided it as a bond. The issue, therefore, was the same as if, to a declaration on the bond, non est factum had been pleaded. The instruction of the court was right and follows the distinction stated in Green v. North Buffalo Township, 6 P. F. Smith 114, between a defence resting upon facts which are misstated in order to induce a party to enter into a bond, the contents of which he knows; and one resting on a misrepresentation of the contents of the instrument itself, to an illiterate person. In the-former it was said the bond is the obligation of the party who seals it, but is avoided by the false inducement to enter into it; in the latter it is riot Ms deed or bond at all. No authority.-was cited for this elementary principle,-and it is argued .that the second proposition is unsound. But it was the first resolution in Thoroughgood\u2019s Case, in the time .of Lord Coke, 2 Reports, 9 b, in these words: \u201cFirst, that although the party to whom the writing is made, or other by his procurement, doth not read the writing; but .a stranger of his own head read it;in other words than it in truth is; yet it. shall not bind the party who delivereth it ;\u2022 for it is not material who readeth the writing, so as he who maketh it be a layman, and being not lettered, be (without any covin in himself) deceived, and that is proved by the usual form of pleading in such a case, that is to say, that, he was a layman and not learned, and that the.deed was read to him in other words, &c.; generally,, without showing by whom it was read.\u201d The second' resolution in Thoroughgood\u2019s Case was that an illiterate man need not execute a deed before it is read to him in a language he understands; but if he do, without desiring - it to be read, the deed is binding. And see 2 Black\u2019s Com. *304-308. And says Mr. Chitty, in his Pleadings, Vol. I., *483, The defendant may give evidence under the plea non est factum that the deed was void at common law db initio; or that it was obtained by fraud; or whilst the party was drunk, a married woman or. a lunatic; or that it became void after it was made and before the commencement of the action, by erasure, alteration, addition, &c. See also 1 Saunders on Pl. & Ev. *407. The-very point in this case was decided in Stoever v. Weir, 10 S. & R. 25. That was an action on a single bill to which a defence was set up that the writing had been obtained by falsely reading\u2019it as a receipt, apd requesting the defendant to sign it as a witness. The plea setting forth the facts specially was treated as a special non est factum. See also Bauer v. Roth, 4 Rawle 93, 94, per Kennedy, J. These authorities show that the learned judge committed no error in his charge.\nBut we think the court erred in the rejection of Thomas Fogarty .as a witness on the ground of infamy: Fogarty had been convicted and'senteneed for embezzlement of the county\u2019s money, as a tax'collector, under the 65th section of the Act of 31st March 1860, Brightly\u2019s Dig. 229, pl. 73; and was in prison- under his sentence. The punishment of the offence of embezzlement under this section is imprisonment by separate or solitary confinement at labor not exceeding five years, and a fine equal to the amount of the money embezzled. . The punishment is the same kind as that inflicted for infamous offences in Pennsylvania; but it is\u2019now settled that it M not the nature of the punishment, but of -the of-fence, which determines its infamous, character: 2 Russell on Crimes 974; 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., \u00a7 372, in note 3; 3 Casey 465. Infamous crimes are treason, felony, and every species of the crimen falsi, such as forgery, perjury, subornation of perjury, and offences, affecting the public administration of justice; such as bribing a witness to absent, himself, and not to give evidence, and conspiracies \u2022 to obstruct the administration of justice, or falsely to accuse one of an indictable crime: 2 Russell- on Crimes 973; 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., \u00a7 373. This is clearly the limitation of the infamous crimes as understood in this state; as may be seen in the following cases: Commonwealth v. Shaver, 3 W. & S. 342-3; Bickel\u2019s Ex\u2019r. v. Fasig\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 9 Casey 464-5. And see argument of counsel in Commonwealth for use v. The Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 1 Grant 331, 2, 3, 4.\nThere are many offences,- involving both falsehood and fraud; which' are punished as infamous crimes are usually punished in this state, and yet are not infamous crimes, and .will not exclude the offenders as witnesses : Commonwealth v. Shaver, and Commonwealth v. Ohio and Penna. Railroad Co., supra; 1 Greenleaf's Ev., \u00a7 373. In Massachusetts it is held that the offences of receiving stolen goods knowingly, and cheating by false pretences, will not render the offenders infamous : Commonwealth v. Rogers, 7 Metcalf 500; Utley v. Menich, 11 Id. 302; and see 1 Whart. C. L. \u00a7 761. As remarked by Woodward, J., in 9 Casey 465, the tendency of the judicial mind is against objections to competency. -Such also is the direction of legislation, to be seen in \u00a7 181 of the Act of 31st March 1860, Brightly\u2019s Dig. 247, pl. 190, which gives to a convict who endures his punishment, for a felony or any misdemeanor punishable with imprisonment at labor, the advantage of a full pardon, except as to wilful and corrupt perjury. Fulfilling his' sentence, therefore; restores the offender to competency as a witness. The Act of 15th April.1869, declaring that no interest or policy of law shall exclude a party or person from being a witness in any civil proceeding, runs in the same direction. In all these cases the objection goes to the credibility of the witness rather-.than to his. competency. Fot the error in rejecting the witness, the judgment is reversed, and.a venire de novo awarded.",

The tendency of the judicial mind is against objecting to testimony.\nJanuary 20th 1871.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Read, Agnew and Williams, JJ. S\u2019harswood, J., at Nisi Prius.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill county:, Of January Term 1870, No. 369-|. .\nThis was a feigned issue, directed on the 21st of March 1868, to he formed between Peter Copley as plaintiff and The County of Schuylkill defendant, to try whether a bond, on which judgment had been entered, purporting to have been executed by Copley and others to the county of Schuylkill, was'the bond of Copley.\nThe bond in question was an official bond, dated June 30th 1865, and was in the penalty of $26,012; it purported to have been executed by Thomas Eogarty, Peter Copley,, and fourteen other persons to The County of Schuylkill. It recited that Fogarty had been appointed tax collector of Mahanoy City and had received a tax duplicate amounting to $13,006, and had taken upon himself the duty of collector aforesaid. The condition was that Fogarty should collect and pay over to the county treasurer or account for the whole' amount of taxes charged in the duplicate.\nCopley\u2019s name appeared on the bond with his mark, witnessed by Edward Britt.\nOn the trial, January 31st 1870, before Ryon, P. J., Copley testified, that he could not write, that he never made his mark to the bond nor authorized any one to make it for him ; that he did not go bail for Fogarty; that Fogarty asked him to sign a petition \u201c to get the tax instead of Michael Groody.\u201d\nEdward Britt testified that the name \u201cEdward Britt\u201d as witness was not his signature; that he did not see Copley sign or make his mark; that witness was never asked to sign as witness; that he could not write his name; that he did not authorize any one to write his name for him; that he never saw the bond till he- \u2022 saw it in court.-\nThe defendant gave evidence tending to show that Copley did isigu the paper under representations that it was a petition on ..behalf of Fogarty for his appointment as tax collector.\n.The defendant offered Thomas Fogarty, a convict serving out a term of imprisonment for defaulting as tax collector. Defendant offered to prove by him that the plaintiff signed the bond, &c. \u25a0\nPlaintiff objected upon the ground of the incomp\u00e9tency of the witness, the offer was rejected and a bill of exceptions sealed.\nThe defendant asked the court to charge:\u2014\n\u201cThat if the jury believe-that Copley put his name to this bond, or authorized any one to sign it for him, it is immaterial whether he was deceived by Fogarty in the matter or not, unless it be shown that the county was aware of that before taking the bond.\u201d\nThe court eh\u00e1rg\u00e9d, that if the plaintiff .made his mark, or authorized it to be made for him as surety upon this bond, the verdict should be in favor of the defendant.\nIf, however, that mark was forged or signed by the plaintiff under fraudulent misrepresentations, that it was but a petition to get the appointment to collect the duplicate, the plaintiff not being informed of the contents of the paper, and if he could- not read, the verdict should be for the plaintiff.\nThe verdict was for the plaintiff.\n' The defendant took a writ of error and assigned for error, not affirming defendants\u2019 point, the charge as above\u2019given and rejecting Fogarty as a witness.\nA. W. Schalck (with whom was G. D. B.

Gonter, 6 Wright 143. A bond in the hands of the obligee cannot be declared invalid, because of some alleged understanding among the obligors themselves: Keyser v. Keen, 5 Harris 327; Grim v. School Directors, 1 P. F. Smith 219. A party who seeks to relieve himself from his bond for actual fraud must establish that there was a false representation which actually misled him to his hurt: Fulton v.
