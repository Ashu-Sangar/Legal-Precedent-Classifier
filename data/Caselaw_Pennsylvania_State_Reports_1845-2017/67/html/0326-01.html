These circumstances were, that there existed a small judgment against the mortgagor, which was a prior lieri to the first mortgage on the property covered by both, the existence of which was unknown to both parties, and the effect of which was to discharge the. lien of both under the sale made by the junior mortgagees or the judgment-bond accompanying their mortgage. Not only was there an understanding, as the jury have found, that the junior mortgagees should buy subject to the prior mortgage, but notice to that effect was given at the sale, and was read, it is true, as a matter of accommodation to the party who was to read it for the senior mortgagee, by one of the counsel for the junior mortgagees, but when the sale proceeded, he bought in the property, at the sum of $250; which of itself shows that it was bought in under the agreement proved by the witnesses below. The learned judge submitted the question to the jury, whether, under the evidence, there was a contract or understanding between .these mortgagees about the purchase of the property, and instructed them that if they found 9that the defendants had so purchased the plaintiff was entitled to ^recover whatever was due on the mortgage.in his trust and charge for the building association.</p>
