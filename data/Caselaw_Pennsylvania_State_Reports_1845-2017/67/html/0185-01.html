Did Andrew Walker execute this conveyance, at or about the time it bears date ? Under the testimony given previous to its being offered in evidence it was admitted as an ancient deed, without actual proof of the genuineness of the signature purporting to be Andrew Walker’s. That it has been so admitted does not relieve you from determining whether or not it was duly executed. The plaintiffs are not precluded from calling it in question, and offering evidence tending to show that the signatures are not genuine, or other evidence to impeach it. Did William Walker have the custody of this writing from the time or about the time it bears date ? Were all the signatures attached about that time, and before the death of Robert Walker, and are some of them actually proven to be genuine by a subscribing witness and one of the parties ? Did the defendant perform his part of the agreement recited in the writing ? Did the parties, until some five or six years ago, so act in reference to this land as to show that the defendant had such possession as the nature of the case would admit, and acquiesced in by the other ? If you so find, and there is no sufficient evidence to rebut it, you may infer that it was executed and delivered by Andrew Walker. Should <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>you find that it was not so executed, your verdict will be for tbe plaintiffs.</p>

On its face, as well as by other proof, it appears to have been made between the children of Robert Walker in his lifetime. It recites that [heir father was old and infirm in health, and unable to manage his property and estate, and that William, at the special instance and request of the others, had agreed to remain with their father during his life and take care of him and his estate in a proper manner. This is the real inducement and consideration, for which the other children released and for ever quit claimed unto William Walker, his heirs and assigns, their right, title and interest which they had, or might afterwards have as heirs of Robert Walker in the land described, being the same ,in suit, so that the said William Walker, his heirs and assigns shall and may have the land with the appertenances free and clear of any claim or demand of the grantor, and so as utterly to bar and exclude the grantor from the said land or any part thereof for ever. At the time of making this deed none of the parties had any interest in the land, and it did not and cannot operate as a legal conveyance thereof. Robert Walker could have disposed, of the land by deed, or devised it by will, as well as if no such conveyance had.been made. He was not bound to accept the offices of his son William to take care of him and his property. Whether or not he had other property than this land there is no evidence. His will is dated prior to the date of the deed. Did William perform his agreement as recited in the deed ? This is a material question, and you must answer it from the evidence. Without actual performance by him in good faith of his part of the agreement he ought not to have the benefit in equity of the deed. This was a valuable consideration to be performed, and if the reason set out in the recital be true, one that all the parties naturally felt an interest in. Conveyances of expectant interests in land by those who in the future may be entitled to it as heirs at law, are not to be encouraged, and will always be carefully scrutinized. If attended by any fraud or imposition, they will not in equity estop the heir from setting up his claim and holding the land. [But if all the children of an aged and infirm parent, without any fraud or imposition, make an agreement by which one of their number is to remain with and take care of him and his property during his lifetime, and for this make a conveyance of a certain piece of land owned by such parent, those conveying expressly stipulating that they shall for ever be barred and excluded from setting up any title or claim to said land as against the grantee or his heirs, it is not a legal fraud upon the parent, and if it has been performed with entire good faith without imposition on the part of the grantee upon the parent, will not be held <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>void in equity on the ground of public policy and justice.] [The grantee undertakes to perform certain things, and if he does so, it is a valuable and sufficient consideration to support a conveyance in equity.] He runs the risk of obtaining nothing for his care and services, for the parent may dispose of the land as he chooses. His performance may exceed its actual value, the value of the land, or it may fall far short of it. As between children such an agreement may be fairly made, and be performed by one party with entire good faith, acquiesced in by all connected with it, and then after the lapse of many years, it ought not to be avoided by one of the grantors. Were the transaction of a recent date, the performance of the agreement and every other essential should be proved satisfactorily by direct evidence. After the lapse of over thirty years it is difficult to prove clearly every point by direct evidence, and the' jury may consider the acts of the respective parties and their claims to the land along with the other evidence. How has William occupied the land and claimed it ? Some five or six years ago, you may infer from the evidence, the land was- considered valuable for its coal, and then and since Andrew Walker and some of the others asserted claims to the land. Did they ever do so before ? These and other like questions you will consider. Robert Walker was in the possession of the land up to the time of his death. By the will and admitted facts, his widow, Margaret, was entitled to the possession during her life, and none of the parties had a right to enter. Upon her decease, the heirs or rather the devisees had the right to the possession in common. In the absence of evidence to show otherwise those in the actual occupancy will not be presumed to hold adversely to the others, and those in possession are presumed to hold for all. Upon the admitted facts, the Statute of Limitations does not bar the plaintiffs. The evidence falls short of showing an actual ouster as between tenants in common, and an exclusive and hostile possession on part of defendant for any length of time. But you will consider the evidence as to the actual occupancy of William Walker, and what he did, not only in the lifetime of his father, and of his mother after his decease and since her decease and prior to the commencement of this suit, as bearing upon the question of actual performance by, him of his agreement, how he held, and how the grantors in the deed treated his holding. [If from all the evidence you find that the agreement recited in the deed was fairly made without imposition, in good faith performed by William Walker in the manner hereinbefore stated, with such actual occupancy and to as full extent as was consistent with the ownership of the land by Robert Walker when living, and of Margaret Walker during her life, each of them acquiescing in his occupancy and use of the land, that he claimed to hold it under the agreement or deed, and that for about fifteen years after Mar<a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>garet Walker’s death, the claim was known and acquiesced in by the grantors, the other heirs and devisees of Robert Walker, deceased, then the deed, though not a legal conveyance of the land, estops the plaintiffs from recovering in this action] the share of Andrew Walker, as one of the heirs and devisees of Robert Walker, deceased — and if you do not so find, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.”</p>

It was admitted as an ancient deed, and the objection to its admission is, that no such accompanying possession was shown under it as would make it evidence without proof of its execution. Where possession is the only circumstance relied on, the rule undoubtedly is, that nothing less than proof of possession for thirty years, in conformity with the deed, is sufficient to raise the presumption of its authenticity. But is proof of actual possession under the deed indispensable <em>1 </em>May not its absence be supplied by other satisfactory and corroborative evidence ? Whatever may be the leaning of the earlier determinations, it has never been expressly decided in Pennsylvania that nothing but proof of actual possession under the deed for thirty years is sufficient to raise a presumption in favor of its authenticity: Williams <em>v. </em>Hillegas, 5 Barr 492; and the weight of authority elsewhere is clearly against the establishment of so rigid a rule; and the prevailing doctrine now is, that where proof of possession cannot be had the deed may be read in evidence, if its genuineness is satisfactorily estab<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>listed by other circumstances: 1 Greenl. Ev. § 144, note 1; B Phil. Ev. 1310, note 903. In this case' proof of actual or exclusive possession under the deed for thirty years cannot be had. If genuine, it conveyed no present estate or immediate right of possession; and no actual or exclusive'possession could have been taken under it until the death of Margaret Walker in 1846, to whom a life estate was given by the will of Robert Walker. But if the defendant did not have the exclusive possession of the land, he had such possession of it for more than thirty years as the parties to the deed intended that he should have; and why should not this, in connection with the other corroborating circumstances in evidence, be sufficient to raise the presumption of its genuineness without express proof of its execution ? The deed required the defendant to remain with Robert Walker, who was living on the land and the owner of it, during his lifetime, and to take care of him and manage his estate in a proper manner. The evidence showed that he lived on the land from the date of the deed until the commencement of this action, a period of more than thirty-five years, that he remained on the land during the lifetime of his father and until the death of his mother, and that since then he has continued to reside there, making improvements and claiming the land as his own; that it was assessed in his name from 1835 to 1869, and the taxes paid by him during that time; and that Andrew Walker, who lived within two or three miles, did not set up any claim to the property until a short time before the commencement of -this action, when the land began to be considered valuable for its coal.- Besides all this, there was direct proof of the execution of the deed by Samuel Walker by the testimony of the subscribing witness to his signature, and of its execution by Elizabeth Walker and Ann Walker by the admission and testimony of the latter. There was nothing suspicious about the deed. It purported to be signed by all the parties named in it with the exception of William Gibson and Mary Gibson, and it was expressly proved that they refused to sign it. It was shown to have been in existence from the time it bears date, and to have been in the possession of the defendant — the party interested in its preservation and entitled to its custody — and there was nothing in the evidence tending to rebut or weaken the presumption arising from all these corroborating circumstances in favor of the genuineness of the deed, and of its execution by Andrew Walker. The proof given to establish its authenticity was therefore sufficient to allow it to go to the jury.</p>

It does not follow that if Mary Gibson and Jane Sample, who were married women, did not so execute and acknowledge the deed as to make it binding on them, that it was not binding upon the other parties who executed <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>it. There is nothing on the face of the deed showing that it was not intended to .operate or have any effect unless it was so executed by all the parties as to be valid and binding on all; and if the agreement contained in the deed was fairly made and fully performed by the defendant as the jury have found, it is binding on the other parties, whether Mary Gibson and Jane Sample are bound by it or not. Nor was the deed a legal fraud upon Robert Walker, if he did not actually agree or. consent to it. As it was made for his benefit, his consent, if necessary, will be presumed, and the law, instead of condemning such a contract as productive of public mischief and against sound public policy, should sanction and uphold it as not only lawful but praiseworthy. The jury were therefore rightly instructed that if the agreement recited in the deed was performed by the defendant, it was a valuable and sufficient consideration to support a conveyance in equity; and if it was fairly made without imposition and in good faith performed by the defendant, then the deed, though not a legal conveyance of the land, estops the plaintiffs from recovering in this action.</p>
