    <p id="b62-9" data-blocks='[["BL_62.13",62,[332,1401,1158,763]]]'>Sixteen years before the American Revolution, Lord Mansfield held, in Miller <em>v. </em>Race, 1 Burrow 452, that bank notes, though stolen, became the property of the person to whom they are bond fide delivered for value, without knowledge of the larceny. Forty-three years afterwards, in Lawson <em>v. </em>Weston, 4 Esp. 56, Lord Kenyon held, that if a bill has been lost, and the loser has advertised it in the newspapers, and it is discounted for the person who found it, and so came fraudulently by it, this entitles the person discounting it to recover the amount, if done bond fide, and without notice of the way in which the holder became possessed of it. Lord Kenyon said: “ I think the point in this case has been settled by the case of Miller <em>v. </em>Race, in Burrow. If there was any fraud in the transaction, or if a bond fide consideration had not been paid for the bill by the plaintiffs, to be sure they could not recover; but to adopt the principle of the defence to the full extent stated, would be at once to paralyze the circulation of all the paper in the country, and with it all its commerce.”</p>

The Lord Chief Justice said, “ for these reasons, notwithstanding the unfeigned reverence I feel for everything that fell from Lord Kenyon, by whom Lawson <em>v. </em>Weston was decided, I cannot think the view taken by that learned lord at that time was the correct one.” This cautious ruling, although carped at and quarrelled with, remained the law for ten years, when the discredit of the Bank of England hills on the continent, and the complaints of the commercial community, brought the matter before the King’s Bench—which had been remodelled — for consideration: Crook <em>v. </em>Jadis, 5 Barn. &amp; Ad. 909; and Backhouse <em>v. </em>Harrison, Id. 1098, were followed by Goodman <em>v. </em>Harvey, 4 Ad. &amp; E. 870, in which Lord Henman said, “ we have shaken off the last remnant of the contrary doctrine.
