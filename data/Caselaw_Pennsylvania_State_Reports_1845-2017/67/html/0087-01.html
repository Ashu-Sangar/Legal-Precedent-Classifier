The company was organized about June 1st 1853, and located their road from the Pennsylvania Railroad near Blairsville through Armstrong, Butler, and Lawrence counties. On the 18th of August 1853, Butler county subscribed for 5000 shares of stock ($250,000), to be paid for in bonds due in 20 years from their date, with interest payable semi-annually; the company to pay the interest until the road should be completed. On the 20th of August, Lawrence county subscribed for 4000 shares of stock ($200,000), payable in all respects as the Butler county subscription ; the company to pay the interest on the bonds in like manner. The City of Philadelphia also subscribed $750,000 to the stock of the company payable by their bonds. Malone &amp; Co. contracted with the company to construct the entire road, five-sixths of their estimates to be payable monthly in the bonds of the two counties and Philadelphia, <em>pro raid </em>of the amount those municipalities were to issue, the remainder in stock of the company; and after those bonds should be exhausted, payable in the bonds of the company; all the bonds to be taken at par and the contract to be forfeited at the option of the company on failure by the contractors to perform. The prices of the work were to be fixed by J. E. Thomson and Herman Houpt, Esqrs. They “ having taken into consideration the terms and modes of payment,” made out a list of prices, which was not satisfactory to the contractors ; the company then raised the prices about 24 per cent, above those arranged by Messrs.

All the bonds of Lawrence and Butler counties were delivered to the company prior to June 12th 1856. The interest on the bonds being in arrear and there being no provision for its payment, they were unavailable to the contractors. The company, in consequence, on the 6th of August 1856, released the contractors from their contract, except a portion of the work between Blairsville and Ereeport, they to take for what was then and might become due them, the notes and mortgage bonds of the company, and under the agreement they restored to the company $332,500 of the bonds of the two counties which had been received by them.

On the 14th of April, F. W. Higgins, Esq., appeared for the company, and by agreement a preliminary injunction was issued, with leaye for the defendants to move at any time for its dissolution. By proceedings under a mortgage given to secure the company’s bonds, the railroad and its franchises were sold in July 1857, to William L. Hirst, Esq., for the bondholders. On the 18th of November 1858, the county filed an amended bill, averring that the company had wrongfully released Malone’ <em>&amp; </em>Co. from their contract to build the roads, had paid out the bonds at 36 per cent, below their par value, and that since the granting of the injunction the company had, in violation of it, paid out an unknown amount of the bonds. The prayer was that the county’s subscription to the stock might be declared null, and the bonds delivered up to be cancelled. The company answered, January 12th 1859, that at the granting of the injunction they held but $184,500 of the bonds, that they owed more than that amount, that they needed the bonds to pay their debts, and were unable to pay the interest; they admitted that on account of the depreciation of the bonds in the market, they had so increased the prices to Malone &amp; Co. as to reduce $59,000 of the bonds which they had paid out shortly before the injunction to 64 per cent, of the par value, but that the other bonds which they had disposed of had been paid out at their par value, that the bonds were in the custody of the Commercial Bank of Pennsylvania, and that the company did not design to make any use of them till the injunction should be dissolved.</p>

Indeed nothing else was ever pretended. Surely the law will not imply any joint liability, from the mere circumstance that these counties subscribed to the same stock, under the same law, and on the same terms. Any liability of the one to contribute to the losses which might be sustained by the other, does not rest in an implication of a contract ; there is no ground for such, nor upon any express arrangement, for none is pretended.

The contractors not being able to negotiate them on the terms agreed upon, to wit, at par, an arrangement was made between the company and its contractors to evade this stipulation, by adding a percentage to the contract price of the work, which should in effect reduce the bonds to about sixty-four cents in the dollar. That is to say, in place of doing one hundred dollars worth of work for a hundred dollars in bonds as agreed, only $64 worth of work would be done. This was a palpable .fraud on the counties, and for this precisely, this court declared that the contract of subscription was avoided, in the case of Lawrence County v. The North Western Railroad Company, 8 Casey 144, which case had been preceded by Crawford County <em>v. </em>The Pittsburg and Erie Railroad Company, 8 Casey 141, and Mercer County v.

Whilst in this situation, Butler county filed her original bill, praying for an injunction to restrain the re-issue of them, on the ground of the failure of the company to pay interest. A preliminary injunction which covered $184,000 of, the bonds returned, was granted, $59,000 of them having been passed away by the company before the service of <em>the injunction. </em>Afterwards the plaintiff amended her bill, charging the company with a violation of one of the fundamental conditions of the subscription, namely, that none of the bonds should be disposed of at a less rate than par. At the time of the return of the Butler county bonds, somp $98,000 of Lawrence county bonds were also <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>returned to the company; but, less fortunate than her neighbor, although she filed a similar bill to restrain the reissue of her bonds, she failed by reason of strenuous opposition and delay, not useful to recite, until in 1859, she got an injunction as prayed. The court granted a perpetual injunction to restrain their re-issue, and rescinded the subscription and ordered those issued to be returned, and their amount in cash to be paid by the company to the county. All the bonds saving only $2000, had disappeared from the treasury of the company by this time. The company some short time after this failed, was utterly insolvent, and it is needless to say the decree has never been complied with. On the 22d March 1860 its charter was repealed, and a new charter granted to another company, the Western Pennsylvania Railroad Company.</p>
    <p id="b93-6" data-blocks='[["BL_93.4",93,[133,1021,1160,1325]]]'>Now Lawrence county claims a right to intervene to prevent a final decree in favor of Butler county, that her subscription be declared void by reason of the facts set forth in the bill, viz., nonpayment of interest, and contracting and endeavoring to negotiate her bonds at a less rate than par, and because of the actual negotiation of most of them at such less rate. Upon what solid ground can she be successful in this ? If I understand it aright, she claims as creditor of the company; and that as to creditors, the plaintiff cannot have a rescission of her contract of subscription and her bonds returned, until she contributes to the amount actually out of pocket by Lawrence county. The postulate for this claim is, that her bonds have gone to pay debts due by the company, therefore she has right to equitable .substitution in the place of creditors, to whose debts her means have gone to pay. But she was. not a lender to the company of a dollar, and this is the only relation which could with any plausibility be urged as a ground for a substitution as against the company, and through it to its uncollected assets. Lawrence was not a creditor to the company, but a part of it. Her bargain was to pay her subscription, and look for reimbursement through the company by means of the profits it might realize. If a failure to complete such an enterprise should take place, and a sale of its property and assets follow, a&gt; stockholder could not be regarded as a creditor entitled to a distribution of proceeds. Creditors, that is the lenders of money, contractors and the like, must be first paid, not the company or any of its members as such. That one stockholder should be the debtor of another by virtue of his stock subscription-, is an unheard-of thing. Through the company all stock subscriptions may be collected, and it may be compelled to collect all of them to carry on the enterprise or pay its debts, but not for distribution to stockholders.</p>

This is something approaching so nearly a self-evident proposition that it is hardly possible to aid the statement by argument. This being so, Lawrence county has no authority at law or in equity to proceed against a stockholder to reimburse herself for loss by virtue of her subscription. There is no privity in law between them, and none by contract has been, shown. If she could have compelled the company to proceed to collect the stock, it would only have been, as I have said above, to carry on the work or pay debts, and then for that purpose only could it have collected subscriptions that were valid, consequently it would have been met, by way of defence, so far as Butler county is concerned, with the very matter she now claims as a ground for a rescission of her subscription, viz., fraud of the company upon her, and which we held in Lawrence County v. N. W. Railroad Co. was a good ground for rescission, and is <em>á fortiori </em>a good ground of defence. The other cases already cited, show that by the fraud of the company a stock subscription will be rescinded. But Lawrence county has not even the corporation to resort to, to compel delinquent subscribers to pay. Its charter and authority were entirely repealed by the Act of 22d March 1860, and before Lawrence county moved in the matter in this case, and a new company — the Western Pennsylvania — was incorporated in its stead, but without any authority over its stock subscriptions.</p>

In that case, the company became embarrassed and had no authority to raise any more money on mortgage than had been raised under the act of incorporation. Its financial agent, David Leopold Lewis, advanced large sums of money to carry on the enterprise, but himself becoming embarrassed, procured'the company to issue a large amount of bonds, called “Lloyd’s Bonds,” and on these he raised a very considerable amount of money, <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>■which was disbursed in payment of debts of the company; but, with all this assistance, the company went into the hands of a general liquidator. The company, with its property and assets, •were sold, and the proceeds came into the liquidator’s hands. The bondholders, Mr. Lewis among them, claimed as creditors for a <em>pro raid </em>on their bonds; this was refused by the liquidator on the ground that the bonds issued were not authorized by Act of Parliament. This was certainly true. The company was prohibited issuing them. The holders of them claimed to stand in the ■ shoes of the creditors of the company, whose debts their money had paid, and this ground was sustained by Lord- Chancellor Hatherley, and Lord Justice Gifford, who heard the appeal from the decree of Vice-Chancellor Malins. This was a case of lenders of money to a corporation, which the legal representatives of that corporation wished to pocket for the benefit of the corporation, because of the irregularity of the loan merely. In order to effectuate justice, therefore, equity subrogated the lenders to the rights of the creditors, whose debts had been paid, and refused the claim of the stockholders to any money until the bondholders were satisfied. This was manifestly just, and operated nowhere unjustly. But the case gives no countenance to the idea attempted to be derived from it. It does not at all establish the idea that one stockholder who has lost more than another, can turn upon him and compel him to contribute to his losses as a creditor, more especially when the company could not compel him to pay anything. I cannot see, in anything that has been, written or said, why Lawrence county has any superior equity to escape from loss by this company than Butler has. If Butler county had beguiled her into the loss, or promised to share it, or even had given countenance to the doings of the company by management of its affairs, as if all were right in her own case, there might have been more plausibility in the ground assumed by the appellant; but nothing of the kind appears in the case. We think she is not entitled to interpose here in any manner whatever. The case of Henderson <em>v. </em>The Royal British Bank, 7 E. &amp; B. 90, Com. Law Rep. 355, was also somewhat relied on as authority for the ground assumed by the appellant’s counsel. That was a case under the English “Joint Stock Winding-up Act” of 1848, and supplement of 1849. It is so manifest that this proceeding was under the provisions of a special act relating to joint stock companies in England, that I have not thought it necessary to examine it. But there is a feature of liability under the supposed parallel to this case, which this case is entirely clear of, and which defeats its applicability, even in appearance, to this case. There,' a stockholder endeavored to withdraw his name from the register of stockholders and escape liability for stock, on the ground of imposition and fraud on him in making <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>the subscription. But this was met <em>by the fact, </em>that after full knowledge of the fraud by the subscriber, he acted as if his stock were free from all taint whatever, voted his shares at elections and received dividends on them, like other shareholders, and it was only when the winding up of the concern took place, he endeavored to escape liability upon his stock, and sought a withdrawal from the register. It was on this ground that his application was refused. But Butler county has not been visited with any such equitable estoppel — this we have shown already — and she is not within the principle of this case, even if the Winding-up Act of 11 &amp; 12 Viet, and supplements, eliminated any general principles applicable to corporations generally.</p>
    <p id="b96-6" data-blocks='[["BL_96.4",96,[325,930,1159,118]]]'>The result of all this is, that the appeal of Lawrence county is dismissed at her costs, and the decree of the court below is affirmed.</p>
