Wunder, the wife of the defendant in the execution; both deeds were recorded October 5th. On the 18th of October 1866, Samuel A. Wertz recovered a judgment against Wunder for $614.90, on which $150 were afterwards paid. On the 15th of March 1869, the judgment on which the execution issued was recovered in the District Court.

From this, it is said to follow, since only claims which are liens upon property sold by the sheriff, are payable out of the proceeds of the sale, that the judgments against Wunder are not payable out of the fund in court, and thus there being no claims upon said fund, it is to be absorbed by the execution raising it.</p>

The money was <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>made on the judgment of the appellee for use, and it is now claimed that as the title was out of Wunder when the judgments of the claimants were obtained, that neither had any lien on the property sold, and therefore the execution on which the money was made was entitled to it in preference to the prior judgment. The auditor found that the conveyance was without consideration and while the grantor was indebted. This established fraud in law, at least as against subsequent creditors. As to them it was no conveyance. In Hoffman’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%2095" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Wright 95">8 Wright 95</a>, Strong, J., speaking of a ease like this, said: “ Still it is the estate of the debtor which was.sold at the sheriff’s sale, and therefore the liens upon it which attached after the fraudulent grant, must be paid in their order.” This authority settles this case, and sustains the distribution by the auditor and decree of the court to the first lien.</p>
