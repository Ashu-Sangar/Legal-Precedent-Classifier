First, then, you will inquire, Whether the plaintiff was injured by the fall of the pole ? It is not'denied by the defendants that he was, nor could such a denial successfully be made; and it is conceded that the pole did fall upon him and inflict the injury under which he is now laboring. But this is a question of fact entirely for you. If you should determine that the plaintiff was thus injured, you have advanced one step on the way which leads to a verdict in his favor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b358-12" data-blocks='[["BL_358.10",358,[292,1880,1164,561]],["BL_359.1",359,[179,432,1167,1209]]]'>“ Your next inquiry will .then be, Whether the pole was within the limits of a public street, opened for. public use, within the corporate limits of Norristown ? If you should find it was not, you need inquire no further; for if it was not within limits in which the municipality are vested with municipal authority, there being no power there would be no duty, and where there is no duty there can be no liability for default. The evidence upon which the plaintiff relies to establish that it was, is first, an authorized map of the borough, made by authority of the charter, in which this street is designated ; and second, certain ordinances of the town council, made from time to time in reference to it, the first of which seems to have been enacted as far back as 1835. These ordinances are briefly as follows: — Ordinance of July 13th 1835, <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>directing footwalks on each side of Washington street to be graded. Ordinance of July 27th 1836, requiring by section 4 that these sidewalks be paved; supplement to that ordinance (without date), extending the order for paving. Ordinance of June 2d 1838, defining the width of Washington street and the sidewalks. Ordinance of August 7th 1848, providing for the paving of a part of Washington street. Ordinance of September 19th 1850, directs the regulators to cause the height, situation and range of the curb along the south side o.f Washington street, between certain points, to be adjusted. Ordinance of April 23d 1853 directs the same authority to perform the same duty upon another section of the same street. Ordinance of September 26th 1853 requires the. same duty to be performed for still another section of the same-street. Ordinance of August 12th 1839 regulates the use of the street by the railroad company, and in Ordinances of June 17th 1844, May 9th 1846, September 27th 1847, August 7th 1848, June 12th 1854,'Washington street is frequently designated as one of the public and opened streets of the borough, and municipal authority in and over it claimed and exercised. The width of the street and its boundaries are established; and if you believe the testimony it would seem, although this is entirely for you, that the plaintiff has established that Washington is a public street, laid out and opened for public use in the borough of Norristown, and controlled by the municipality; and that this pole, at the time of the accident and for a long time before, was standing within its limits. If you should determine these facts with the plaintiff, you have made a second step towards that point at which he can demand your verdict.</p>

These, although questions of fact, are allied with certain well defined legal principles, an intelligent comprehension of which is necessary to a proper finding. The public possess, in a public highway, the right of transit and of transit only. The use, by every citizen of public ways, must be a use appropriate to the purposes for which they are intended, that is of transit; - with such stoppages as business necessity, accident, or the ordinary exigencies of travel, either in vehicles or on foot, may require. I will illustrate: — if.one of you, for the purposes of a social visit, place your carriage before a door, where it remained in the way while you enjoyed your social intercourse within, this not being such a stoppage as is required by'the necessities of business, accident or the exigencies of travel, such occupation of the highway by the carriage would be .an obstruction of it, that is, would constitute a nuisance. If,- however, you drove to a store, and left your wagon in the highway before it, for the <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>time necessary to unload the freight you had hauled for the store, or to load the' purchases you had there made, such occupation of the public highway, growing out of the business necessities of the occasion, and continued only so long as was reasonably necessary, would be lawful. It is upon this general principle that the infamous habit of corner. lounging, when not prohibited by special local legislation, is illegal. The loungers who occupy the public highway are, while lounging, not using it for the purposes of passage, and are therefore obstructions of the public right of way— that is, nuisances. Those are the general principles of the law. You will apply them- to the facts; [was the plaintiff on the street for a lawful purpose ? If you believe the testimony he was there, by virtue of his employment, to unload lumber from a car. Did he execute that purpose lawfully ? Did he consume an unnecessary length óf time in the work ? These are questions for you to answer — then, if you answer them for the plaintiff, if there be no ordinance of the town council, which <em>per se </em>rendered his acts illegal, he was lawfully on the street, for a lawful purpose, and was executing that purpose lawfully]. Do the borough ordinances modify these general rights of user by the public in the streets of this borough or specially in Washington- street? If there be ordinances regulating and controlling the general right of user, they supersede, under the -charter of the defendants, these general principles and constitute the law governing, the facts in this case : —for,' by § 5 of Act of 1853, Pamph. L. 228; § 4 Act of 1834, Pamph. L. 86; § 6 Act of 1812, Pamp. L. 255, the burgess and town council are vested with power to make ordinances for the government, regulation, use, &amp;e., of the public streets, lanes and alleys within the corporate limits. The Ordinance, August 12th 1839, by § 1, regulates the use of Washington street by the railroad company (who was empowered, by legislation, to occupy that street with their track); and by § 2 provides, that it shall not be lawful for any person, in that street, <em>“ </em>to load or unload any railroad car or carriage on the railroad in Washington street, at any place between Green alley and Cherry alley, &amp;c.” This is a negative pregnant, a prohibition in a specially named section of the street, of the power to load or unload, would necessarily imply, that the act was licensed, and would be recognised as lawful in other sections of the same street, <em>mentio unius exalusio alterius. </em>The plaintiff was unloading, not between the points designated, but in another part of the street, to which the prohibition did not extend. It- is apparent, therefore, that he was not in contravention of an ordinance, and it -would be no strained construction to say he was in the exercise of a right, which by implication, was licensed by the ordinance. But, be this as it may, your inquiry is left unembarrassed by any ordinance, and is to be decided by the general rules unmodified in this case by any municipal regula<a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>tion. You will say then, under these instructions, whether the plaintiff was on the street lawfully for a lawful purpose, and was executing that purpose lawfully at the time he was injured. If you should decide these inquiries with him, you have made a third step in his favor. If you should find against him, you need inquire no further, for' the defendant would be. entitled to your verdict. If you should find with the plaintiff, however, you will next inquire: — Whether he was guilty, of negligence, that contributed in a degree, however slight, to the infliction of the injury ?</p>

What then is negligence ? The answer to some extent must be by the court, for it is a mixed question of law and fact; but it is your province, gentlemen, to determine, under our' instruction, whether it exists under the facts proven in the case. ‘Negligence,’ said Mr. Justice Williams, in McCully <em>v. </em>Clarke &amp; Thaw, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20402" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Wright 402">4 Wright 402</a>, ‘is the want of proper care, caution and -diligence — such care, caution and diligence as, under the circumstances, a man of reasonable and ordinary prudence would exercise. It consists in nonfeasance, that is, omitting to do, or not doing, something which ought to be done, which a reasonable and prudent' man would do; and a misfeasance, that is, the doing of something which ought not to be done, something which a reasonable man would not do, or doing it in such a manner as a man of reasonable and ordinary prudence would not do it, in either case leading to mischief or injury.</p>

It would not be negligence to carry a bucket filled with water through a double row of torches, uncovered and unshielded from the flames and sparks; 3but it would be negligence to bear through the same torches an uncovered quantity of gunpowder or nitro-glycerine. It would-be a misfeasance to carry the latter through such dangers, and. it would be nonfeasance, if so carried, to neglect to protect them by enclosures impervious to the fire. Why is the one act negligent and the other not ? Because the first substance is not inflammable or combustible, while the latter substances are so in a very high degree; and the difference in these circumstances varies the degree of care required in accordance with it, and determines the quality of the act. You will accept these definitions and illustrations, and be guided by them in determining, the question of negligence on the part of the plaintiff. I charge you that if any negligence on hi.s .part, however slight, contributed' to his injury or the cause which produced it, he cannot recover, no matter how <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>grossly the defendants may have neglected to perform their duty.

      <em>“ </em>It has' been earnestly contended, that in order to render the municipality liable, the neglect must be shown to be wilful, and that, before a recovery can be had on this issue, it must be established that the municipality had notice of. the condition of the pole. I have already charged you- that it is not material, where the charter enjoins a duty, whether the neglect to perform that duty was wilful or' otherwise; and I now charge you positively, that it is not necessary to a recovery in this case that the plaintiff should show that the defendant had notice of the condition of the pole prior to its fall: Erie <em>v. </em>Schwingle, <em>supra; </em>Bartlett' <em>v. </em>Crozier, 15 Johns. N. Y. Rep. 250. It is.only necessary to establish that the neglect was wilful, where the suit is against a public officer as an individual; but where the liability of the corporation is involved, neglect of a duty, whether, wilful or otherwise, is sufficient to maintain the action. The rule.- in criminal prosecutions would be different — but this is a civil action. This distinction is based upon sound reasons of public policy, and public safety, which could readily be vindicated if it were necessary to do so. But you, gentlemen, are to be governed by the law as it exists, and not to inquire as to its foundation or. propriety. '</p>

If this were shown to be the fact, the position would be well taken; but the charter of the company vests- no such exclusive authority, and the borough ordinances would seem to establish (although that is a matter entirely for you) that the municipal authorities regulated and controlled this street from time to tiene. I charge you, however, gentlemen, that the charter of the railroad company merely confers an' easement in Washington -street upon the company, and that the existenpe of that easement does not relieve the municipality, in . relation to Washington street, from the duty imposed upon them by the charter in § 5 of Act of 1853, and the other acts referred to in that connection.</p>

But the charter imposes upon the defendants the duty of repairing the streets, and removing nuisances therefrom, and if this pole was in the-limits of a public opened street, it was where the defendants had power, and were bound to perform duties. If, being within those limits, it was in an unsafe, rotten and dangerous condition, it was a nuisance, and it became their duty to exercise that power and remove it. It is immaterial, therefore, in this case, whether it impeded public rights, and was an obstruction to the actual travel or not, if you find it was rotten, unsafe and dangerous. Other legal obstacles to the recovery of the plaintiff have been urged, but as they will be answered by.the court in reply to written points presented by the defendant’s counsel, I shall not further notice them in detail, and I charge you, if your finding be with the plaintiff upon the several inquiries submitted, that he is entitled to your verdict.</p>

It is conceded that he can recover nothing but compensatory damages; that is, a pecuniary payment for the actual injury sustained. You will therefore inquire as to the extent of that injury. You have seen him, and witnessed his present condition, and you have heard the medical and surgical evidence as to its character, extent and effects. From this you will determine its nature and gravity. You will carefully bear in mind that your verdict must be limited to simple compensation; that is, the payment in dollars and cents for the injury. How much his effective capacity is diminished, and what his pecuniary loss in consequence of that diminution. You will remember that he was not a tradesman, artist or clerk, but simply a laborer, and the rate of compensation must be based upon the character of his avocations, and the consequent loss arising from the quality of the injury. I do not mean to imply that the arm of a laborer is of less value to him, than the arm of an artist; but the remuneration derived from their respective labors is upon a totally different scale, and as that scale determines the amount of the loss, it must be considered in rendering a verdict for compensatory damages. Among- the injuries sustained for which pecuniary compensation can be given, you may take into consideration the physical pain suffered by the plaintiff; but you must estimate this reasonably and moderately, and not be led away by sympathy or speculative ideas of suffering. Pain is but a temporary evil, and you must avoid an extravagant allowance for it. I regret that it is an element of consideration that can enter into your verdict — for, being a matter of feeling, there is no standard of estimate — but it is my duty -to say, you have a right to consider it ini assessing the damages: Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Allen, 3 P. F. Smith 278-9. But in this case I do not think, though it <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>is for you, that the verdict for the plaintiff should be greatly increased upon this ground. You can also take into consideration the expenses for nursing and medical attendance, and you will make no deduction because the,plaintiff was aided by charity; individual benevolence cannot be made a set-off by the municipality.</p>

      <em>“ </em>In assessing these damages you will throw out of view all feeling of sympathy, compassion and charity, for these elements, if allowed to influence your assessment, will lead you widely astray; neither are you to adopt a different scale-of valuation in this case, because the defendants are a corporation, from that which would govern were they private individuals. The measure of damages does not change with the corporate character of the defendants. You will then make- up your verdict, based upon the principle of compensationthat is, a sum that will make him pecuniarily whole. You will allow nothing for his poverty, for'this would be robbery; nothing for charity, for no charity can be honest which draws its bounty illegally from the pockets of another ; but you will decide -what amount of damages áre the pecuniary compensation for the injury sustained. To this he is entitled, and to not one cent beyond it.”</p>
