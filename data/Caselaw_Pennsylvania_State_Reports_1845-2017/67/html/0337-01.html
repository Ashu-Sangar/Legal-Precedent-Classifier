The first two acts gave the city councils certain authorities relative to the cleansing of the docks on the Delaware and Schuylkill front of the city, and the last act vested these powers in the port wardens. All the powers therefore relating to cleansing the docks given to councils by the Acts of 1856 and 1858, were transferred to and vested in the port wardens, who were to carry them into effect according to the constitution of their own body. The councils could by their fundamental law, act only by ordinance, and the Act of 1864 never did so absurd a thing as force a power to pass ordinances on an executive body, the port wardens.
