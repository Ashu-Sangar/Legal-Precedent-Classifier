In 1860, all William’s interest in the trust land was sold by the sheriff under judgments against him and conveyed to Ballantine. The opinion of the parties interested was that the conveyance of B:- by his father to William was a good execution of the trus^t, and that the remaining trust estate passed to the surviving children and the children of the deceased daughters in ninths.

    <p class="summary" id="b180-6" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[302,528,1174,637]]]'>“ All the one undivided ninth part of that certain piece of land situate, &amp;c., containing 45 acres (describing it by adjoiners), and being the same premises of which the late Thoma3 Perkins died seised, and from whom David J.

Also, all the right, 'title, interest and claim of the said David, of, in and to all the real estate late of his father, Thomas Perkins, deceased, to which he is in any manner entitled and wheresoever the same may be situate.” The habendum of this deed is “to have and to hold the said undivided ninth part of said described land, hereditaments and premises hereby granted or mentioned, and intended so to be, with the appertenances, unto the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, to and for the only proper use and behoof of the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns for ever.”</p>

From this it resulted that David’s interest at the time he made the deed to Ballantine was an undivided one-seventh in each of lots B and C.</p>

Perkins to Nathaniel Ballantine was written in Robb <em>k </em>McConnell’s office, by Eugene Snowden, who was a student of Robb &amp; McConnell. I think David J. Perkins and N. Ballantine were both* in the office at the time the deed was written. I know they were both there when the instructions were given to- write -the deed. My impression is, and it is but an impression, that after the description of the property was blocked out in rough, Mr. Ballantine wanted it drawn so as to contain all the interest this young man had in the property, making some suggestions that there might be something outside of the one-ninth part to which it was alleged that this young man was entitled. I think a deed had been written in our office for one of the heirs some time previous to the writing of this deed. I refer to the deed from Charles P. Quigley to N. Ballantine. Mr. Ballantine suggested that the Quigley deed was not quite strong enough, and he wanted the deed from David J. Perkins to cover everything, that is, all his. interest as one of the heirs of Thomas Perkins. I wrote off the clause in the deed, beginning with ‘ also,’ after the description of the property in the deed, and instructed Mr. Snowden to incorporate that in the deed. That clause was put in for the purpose of covering all his interest in the property as heir of his father, Thomas Perkins. I could not state anything at all in regard to the habendum. I have no recollection whatever of giving Mr. Snowden any instructions -in regard to the habendum. My impression is that both David J. Perkins and Mr. Ballantine were there when the deed was drawn, and remained there until it was drawn.”</p>
