It was proved on the trial that Fogarty obtained the signature of Copley, who was an illiterate man, by representing to him that the paper was a petition to the county commissioners for his appointment as tax collector. The county contended that the deception mattered not, unless it be shown that the county had a knowledge of the fraud before accepting the bond. The court below held that the misrepresentation of the contents of the paper avoided it as a bond. The issue, therefore, was the same as if, to a declaration on the bond, <em>non est factum </em>had been pleaded. The instruction of the court was right and follows the distinction stated in Green <em>v. </em>North Buffalo Township, 6 P. F. Smith 114, between a defence resting upon facts which are misstated in order to induce a party to enter into a bond, the contents of which he knows; and one resting on a misrepresentation of the <em>contents </em>of the instrument itself, to an <em>illiterate </em>person. In the-former it was said the bond is the obligation of the party who seals it, but is avoided by the false inducement to enter into it; in the latter it is <em>riot Ms deed </em>or bond at all. No authority.-was cited for this elementary principle,-and it is argued .that the second proposition is unsound. But it was the first resolution in Thoroughgood’s Case, in the time .of Lord Coke, <em>2 </em>Reports, 9 b, in these words: “First, that although the party to whom the writing is made, or other by his procurement, doth not read the writing; but .a stranger of his own head read it;in other words than it in truth is; <em>yet </em>it. shall not bind the party who delivereth it ;• for it is not material who readeth the writing, so as he who maketh it be a layman, and being not lettered, be (without any covin in himself) deceived, and that is proved by the usual form of pleading in such a case, that is to say, that, he was a layman and not learned, and that the.deed was read <em>to </em>him in other words, &amp;c.; generally,, without showing by whom it was read.” The second' resolution in Thoroughgood’s Case was that an illiterate man need not execute a deed before it is read to him in a language he understands; but if he do, without desiring - it to be read, the deed is binding. And see <em>2 </em>Black’s Com. *304-308. And says Mr. Chitty, in his Pleadings, Vol. I., *483, The defendant may give evidence under the plea <em>non est factum </em>that the deed was <em>void </em>at common law <em>db initio; or that it was obtained by fraud; </em>or whilst the party was drunk, a married <em>woman </em>or. a lunatic; or that it became void after it was made and before the commencement of the action, by erasure, alteration, addition, &amp;c. See also 1 Saunders on Pl. &amp; Ev. *407. The-very point in this case was decided in Stoever <em>v. </em>Weir, 10 S. &amp; R. 25. That was an action on a single bill to which a defence was set up that the writing had been obtained by falsely reading’it as a receipt, apd requesting the defendant to sign it as a witness. The plea setting forth the facts specially was treated as a special <em>non est factum. </em>

The punishment of the offence of embezzlement under this section is imprisonment by separate or solitary confinement at labor not exceeding five years, and a fine equal to the amount of the money embezzled. .

In Massachusetts it is held that the offences of receiving stolen goods knowingly, and cheating by false pretences, will not render the offenders infamous : Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Rogers, 7 Metcalf 500; Utley <em>v. </em>Menich, 11 Id. 302; and see 1 Whart. C. L. § 761. As remarked by Woodward, J., in 9 Casey 465, the tendency of the judicial mind is against objections to competency. -Such also is the direction of legislation, to be seen in § 181 of the Act of 31st March 1860, Brightly’s Dig. 247, pl. 190, which gives to a convict who endures his punishment, for a felony or any misdemeanor punishable with imprisonment at labor, the advantage of a full pardon, except as to wilful and corrupt perjury. Fulfilling his' sentence, therefore; restores the offender to competency as a witness. The Act of 15th April.1869, declaring that no interest or policy of law shall exclude a party or <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>person from being a witness in any civil proceeding, runs in the same direction. In all these cases the objection goes to the credibility of the witness rather-.than to his. competency. Fot the error in rejecting the witness, the judgment is reversed, and.a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>
