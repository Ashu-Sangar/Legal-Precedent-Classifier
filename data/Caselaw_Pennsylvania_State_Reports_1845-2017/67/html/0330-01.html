It is true, that under the Supplemental Act of 3,0th of March 1865, Pamph. L. 46, it was lawful for him to make his contribution to the common stock of the partnership in goods or merchandise if the same had been first appraised under oath by an appraiser appointed by the Common Pleas of Philadelphia, and if the nature and value of the said goods had been fully set forth and described in the certificate of partnership, as required by the 1st section of the act. But this was not done. Nor was a sign put up in front of the building where the business of the partnership was carried on, with the names of all the members of the partnership painted thereon, stating the name of the general partner and the name of the special partner, as required by the 2d section of the Supplemental Act. The evidence shows that the name of James H. Smith was over the store where the business was carried on, but there was no proof that the name'of the special partner was painted on the sign. The claimant having failed to comply with these essential requirements of the law, it needs no argument to prove that he is not entitled to the rights and immunities of a special partner, but is to be regarded and treated as a general partner for all intents and purposes; and, therefore, the goods contributed by him to the common stock were subject to all the. liabilities and incidents of property belonging to a general partnership. When levied on by the sheriff, the goods were not the sole <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>and exclusive property of the claimant, but they belonged to the partnership of which he was a member. It follows that there was no error in refusing to charge as requested in the plaintiffs’ first point: Myers <em>v. </em>Prentzell, 9 Casey 482; Stewart &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20450" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Wright 450">6 Wright 450</a>.</p>
    <p id="b334-6" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[316,635,1163,936]]]'>Nor was there any such error in the qualified answer court to the second point, as did the plaintiff any harm. It is undoubtedly true that under an execution against one partner, the sheriff can levy only on the right, title and interest of such partner in the property of the firm. He cannot seize and sell the partnership property on an execution against one of the partners, as the authorities show: Knox <em>v. </em>Summers, <a href="/yeates/4/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Yeates 477" data-case-ids="6775725" data-case-paths="/yeates/4/0477-01">4 Yeates 477</a>; Doner <em>et al. v. </em>Stauffer <em>et al., </em>1 Penna. Rep. 198; Deal <em>v. </em>Bogue, 8 Harris 228; Reinheimer <em>v. </em>Hemingway, 11 Casey 482. It was said by Woodward, J., in delivering the opinion of the court in Deal <em>v. </em>Bogue, <em>supra, </em>that partners are joint-tenants of all the stocks and effects employed in their business. No partner can have a separate interest in any part of the property belonging to the partnership, though each has an entire as well as joint interest in the whole of the joint property. A levy then, to affect the interest of a partner, cannot touch a specific proportion of the goods, nor the whole, because others have property in every part, as well as the whole, coupled with a right, resting in contract, to use them for the purposes for which the partnership was instituted. The only levy that can be made, consistently with the relation the partners sustain to the goods, is of the debtors’ interest in the whole, and that is to be measured by final account.</p>
    <p id="b334-7" data-blocks='[["BL_334.5",334,[316,1572,1157,858]]]'>But if the court was mistaken in qualifying the affirmance of the plaintiffs’ point with the instruction that “ in such case the sheriff might seize the property — the corpus,” the error did the plaintiff no harm, because it was wholly irrelevant to the issue, and for this reason the court might have declined to answer the point. The issue was as to the claimant’s ownership of the goods levied on by the sheriff. If he was the owner, he was entitled to a finding in his favor; but if he was not, then he was not entitled to recover, though the sheriff may have had no right to seize the goods on the execution against his copartner. If the goods had been claimed as the property of the firm, and the partnership had been made plaintiffs in the issue, it would then have been the duty of the court to have given the instruction prayed for, and the qualified affirmance of the point would have been such error as would have entitled the plaintiffs to a reversal of the judgment, for it would have prejudiced their right to recover. But as the issue was formed, it did the claimant no harm, for the evidence showed that he was not the sole and exclusive owner of the goods, and was therefore not entitled to a finding in his favor. Judgment affirmed.</p>
