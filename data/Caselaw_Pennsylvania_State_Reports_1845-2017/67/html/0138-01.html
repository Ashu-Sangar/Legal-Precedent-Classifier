Amongst other facts he found, that the Butler congregation was united with a similar association at Brady’s Bend; the joint charge, called -the “ Butler Mission,” was under the charge of St. Paul’s Classis. Mr. Limberg was appointed pastor of the mission in 1865. Mutual dissatisfaction in the pastor and congregation soon appeared, and in 1868 Mri Limberg tendered his resignation to the Classis. The Classis hesitating about the matter, the congregation, December 26th 1868, requested that the resignation should be accepted. There was some correspondence between the congregation or members pf it and the Classis, and about March 1869 the name of a Mr. Vogeline was suggested as pastor. The Brady’s Bend consistory were “willing to give him a trial,” and Miller, one of the plaintiffs, took their, proceedings in the matter, to lay them before the Butler consistory when the church doors were locked against Mr. Limberg. In June 1869, Mr. Limberg’s resignation was accepted by the Classis, and on his own request he obtained permission to supply “Butler Mission,” till a pastor could be obtained. In <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>accordance with this permission and an appointment announced to the Butler congregation from the pulpit two weeks previously, he went to the church and found it locked; he and his adherents were compelled to hold service in the Orphans’ Home. Sinee July 1869 the defendants had retained possession of the church property, excluded Mr. Limberg and the Classis, and “ appropriated it to uses not sanctioned by the constitution of the German Reformed Church.” On the 22d of November 1869, the other defendants, <em>“ </em>by an instrument in writing,” declared themselves independent of all synods, and absolved from the government of the <em>“ </em>German Reformed Church,” and made the defendant Schnorr pastor,; he not being connected with the German Reformed Church nor approved by St. Paul’s Classis. Since Mr. Limberg was excluded from the church, the plaintiffs had,attended on his ministry at the Orphans’ Home, and adhered to the doctrine and discipline of the German Reformed Church. On the 6th of January 1870, the Classis directed that proceedings at law should be commenced on behalf of the Butler congregation for possession of’the church. On Easter Monday 1870, at an election held at the Orphans’ Home, the plaintiffs, together with Henry Grupen, B. K. Fulcason and M. Fiehl, were chosen as consistory.

This fact then made the relation between the classis and the congregation, one not only of corporation, but of maintenance. Dependent therefore upon the classis for assistance of this nature, the congregations could not claim the attributes of <em>a </em>pastoral station,’ nor could they possess any other privileges than those of a ‘ missionary charge.’ It is true the proper ecclesiastical judicatory might, in its discretion, grant to a congregation advanced so far as this one, rights not common to a mission, in a more primitive stage.

Had the defendants yielded so much two months sooner, it can hardly be doubted that they would have been regarded as members and that there would have been no occasion for filing the plaintiff’s bill. But omitting to abandon their irregularities until after the Classis had directed legal steps to be taken, and failing to accomplish the concession until after the bill was filed, the burthen of the consequences must be borne by them. The fact that the defendants had given notice a week, or even two weeks before, that a meeting would be held to rescind the ordinance of secession, does not relieve them from the responsibility.

I do so the more freely because it was entirely extrajudicial to any question in the case. Courts which have the supervision and control of all corporations and unincorporated societies <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>or associations, must be guided by surer and clearer principles than those to be derived from the nature of intellectual and spiritual life. The guarantee of religious freedom has nothing to do with the property. It does not guarantee freedom to steal churches. It secures'to-individuals the right of withdrawing, forming a new society, with such creed and government as they please,, raising from their own means another fund and btdlding another house of worship; but it does not confer upon them the right of taking the property consecrated to other uses by those who may now-be sleeping in their graves.' The law of intellectual and spiritual life is not the higher law, but must yield to the law of the land.</p>

The German Evangelical Reformed St. Paul’s Church of Butler, Pennsylvania, was inoorporated by the Court of Common Pleas of Butler county. The charter recites that the subscribers with others had <em>“ </em>associated for the purpose of worshipping Almighty God according to the faith and discipline of the German Evangelical Reformed Church in the United States of America,” and in the third section of the/ first article it is expressly provided that “ it shall be subject to the control of the Synod of the German Reformed Church of United States, and shall, in all respects, be governed by its rules and regulations;” and the fourth section of the third article declares that <em>“ </em>every minister of the gospel who may become a candidate for the office of pastor, must, before he can be chosen to, or at least before he can be inducted into office, be in good standing in connection with the Synod of the German Reformed Church.” As though to obviate all possible doubt or question upon the subject, the last paragraph of the charter expressly declares: <em>“ </em>This congregation was organized only as a German Evangelical Reformed Church in Butler county, Pennsylvania, and that it .be known hereby, that no alteration can be made in this congregation for another denomination.” Under a charter thus carefully guarded, the building, which is the bone of con-V tention here, was erected with funds raised by voluntary contribution from the subscribers upon a lot given for the purpose. It is unnecessary'to refer to the''troubles in the church, or to pass any judgment upon the acts of either party. The defendants, on the 22d of November 1869, by an instrument of writing declared themselves independent o.f all synods, and absolved from the government of the German Reformed Church, and elected a clergyman as pastor not connected with the German Reformed Church. They took and held possession of the building. Those who were dissatisfied with these proceedings withdrew, and on Easter Monday 1870, the day fixed in the charter, held an election at'the <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>Orphans’ Home, at which the plaintiffs were chosen members of the consistory, and they now file this bill to obtain possession of the building. The defendants also held a meeting at the church on the same day, and elected a consistory. There can be no question that the plaintiffs and those whom they represent were on Easter Monday 1870, the true church adhering to the ecclesi/astical oxder and denomination under which the organization originally took place^and'tEearticles of which organization impressed it expressly with a law, which forbade its ever becoming disconnected with that denomination. No provision in the charter required the election of the consistory to be at the church, and the wrongful act of the defendants in holding possession dispensed, so far as they were concerned, with the necessity of any notice in the church, of an election to be held elsewhere. It does not lie in the mouth of the defendants to object in any way in this proceeding to the regularity of the election of .the plaintiffs. The defendants are strangers. They made themselves so by their solemn act, throwing off their connection with the German Reformed Church. That they then seceded and withdrew from the church cannot be doubted. How, then, can their meeting after-wards and rescinding the resolution of secession restore them to membership, much less constitute them the true church, and authorize them to elect a consistory? The plaintiffs, and those whom they represent, were the true church ; with them 'the defendants ought to have reunited, if, as they contend, they had not lost their membership, and voted at their election. It is clear, then, that the plaintiffs had the legal right to the possession and control of the church property, and that the decree below was in all respects proper.</p>
