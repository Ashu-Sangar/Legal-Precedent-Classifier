Thé complaint is that the finding of the inquest, that restitution of the demised premises be made to the lessor, is not explicitly set out on the record. But even if this were true, it is apparent that it was a mere error, for the intention to set it out accurately and enter the. judgment on the finding is also apparent, and it could be corrected by the inquisition itself. In fact, it is part of the record. But I do not think the objection well taken. The record here follows with the utmost strictness the form given in Binns’s Justice in such cases, edition of 1870, by Brightly, p. 535. That form has been in use <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>for more than a third of a century, and is copied from Graydon, which is much older.
