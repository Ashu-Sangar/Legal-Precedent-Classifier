Wagenhorst. The premium due August 10, 1935, was not paid. She was then 74 years old and, as the parties have agreed, was “totally blind, senile and mentally and physically unable to take care of her own affairs.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> When the policy issued, the <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>insured was 59 years of age; she died February 14,1943. The insurance was payable to her “executors, administrators or assigns.” The policy bears an endorsement dated April 23, 1935, stating that “at insured’s request . . . the amount due on the death of the insured shall be payable” to the insured’s son, who is the plaintiff. The case was tried on an agreed statement of facts.</p>
    <p id="b465-3" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[214,689,1152,648]]]'>The plaintiff sues for $5,000 with interest and contends that when the default in the payment of premium occurred in 1935, defendant misconstrued what the policy required it then to do; that defendant should not have applied the provision for automatic extended term insurance for $5,000 (expiring in 1941) but should have applied another provision of the contract under which, if applied (so the contention runs), the policy would have been in force at the time of the insured’s death, nearly eight years after default, even though the insurance would then have been for an amount less than the face of the policy.</p>
    <p id="b465-4" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[219,1358,1152,777]]]'>The defense alleged was that the policy “lapsed for non-payment of the premium of $362.25 due and payable in accordance with its terms on August 10, 1935, and that in accordance with the clause of the Policy headed ‘Non-Forfeiture Options on Surrender or Lapse,’ said Maria S. Wagenhorst not having exercised either of the other options mentioned therein, said policy according to its terms went on automatic extended insurance (the first option set forth in the policy) and the then cash value according to the table contained in the policy, plus the dividend then payable, purchased extended term insurance for the face of said policy, Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) for six (6) years, which extended insurance expired August 9,1941.”</p>

There was no ambiguity in phraseology; the words and the meaning of the policy were clear. The time to decide what the policy required at default was in 1935 when the default occurred: Compare <em>Toncich v. Home Life Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/309/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="309 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1141524" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0336-01">309 Pa. 336</a>, 339, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20A.%20673" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="163 A. 673">163 A. 673</a>. The uncertainty concerning the future arose at that time not from the words of the policy, but from ignorance of the period during which the insured would live. The question had to be decided then in the light of such knowledge as was available to the parties. The court below appropriately said, “No one can tell at the time of the default which of the options permitted an insured will be most beneficial to him. If he takes his cash surrender value, he is no longer insured. He may die the next day, and there would be lost the difference between the cash received and the face amount of the policy. If he takes a paid-up policy for a lesser amount, the same result might follow. If ‘upon satisfactory request from the insured prior to default’ (as provided by the policy) he makes premium loans, then in case of death, such loans would have to be deducted from the face of the policy on payment of the claim.”</p>

To automatic non-participating paid-up term insurance for the amount insured by this policy, for such time as the <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>surrender value will purchase.

While it gave the insured certain options, the defendant, not hearing from her in response to letters to her (found after her death to have been in her possession unopened) applied the first option — automatic non-participating paid up term insurance for such time as the surrender value would purchase: Compare <em>Hitner v. Penn Mutual Life Ins.

It provides: “In lieu of automatic extended insurance, and on satisfactory request from the insured prior to default in the payment of any premium hereon, the Company shall first apply any withdrawable surplus to pay the same; and the remainder due, if any, shall be charged against this policy as a loan at five per centum interest, if the respective loan value specified below be sufficient to cover such advance, in addition to existing liens and accrued interest; provided that if the credits be not .sufficient to cover the entire premium then due, the Company shall apply the same, if sufficient, to pay the premium for a shorter period, but not less than one month’s premium.

    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[205,474,1154,1524]]]'>The insured never surrendered the policy for its cash surrender value or for a paid up policy for $2,770; she never made any request for loans. Plaintiff contends that although the insured never requested any loan, the defendant nevertheless should have made loans to her and thereby kept the policy alive. We can find no possible support for this contention. Plaintiff refers to <em>Girard Life Ins. Co. v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/97/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="97 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="444762" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0015-01">97 Pa. 15</a>, as supporting it. In that case the court applied the general principle that when the insurance company had money in its possession (in that case a dividend<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> payable) the company could not declare a forfeiture of the policy, for non-payment of premium, two days after the premium became due when the amount of the dividend in its possession was more than sufficient to carry the insurance over the period. That principle has no relation to plaintiff’s contention that defendant (1) should have rejected the first option (for automatic term insurance) and (2) should have ignored the express provision requiring a request from the insured before encumbering the policy with a loan, and (3) should have made premium loans and charged them against the policy.
