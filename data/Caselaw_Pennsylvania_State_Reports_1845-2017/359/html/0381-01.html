Neville Road is a straight level concrete highway fifty feet in width, with a concrete curb in the center two feet wide, dividing the North bound from the South bound traffic. Running along the outside edge of each side of the highway is a set of tracks imbedded in a slag roadway upon which street cars of the defendant are operated. It had been raining very hard. Plaintiff straddled the street car track, the left wheels of his automobile being on the <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>concrete and the right wheels on the slag, so that he could see the road more clearly and obtain more traction to prevent skidding. Dawn was breaking, the rain had ceased, but it was semi-dark and damp. As plaintiff was driving in this position at a speed of about 35 miles per hour, his motor stalled. Plaintiff continued to feed gas to the engine in an effort to start it. The car finally came to a complete stop. When it stopped the right wheels of the automobile were still straddling the left track with the left wheels of the automobile on the concrete highway. The two red taillights were lit as were the two front headlights of his car. At the point where the automobile stalled, the road was straight for a distance of three quarters of a mile to the rear of the vehicle. When the automobile came to a stop plaintiff got out of his car, raised the hood and tried to locate the trouble in the coil and wires. Being unsuccessful, he closed the hood and looked back along the car tracks to see if anything was coming. Seeing no lights or hearing no sound of a bell or any other warning, he got back into his car and attempted to find the trouble in the ignition wires under the dashboard. While in this position his automobile was struck in the rear by defendant’s street car with a blow which carried the automobile forward about 100 feet, throwing plaintiff over into the back seat. Plaintiff suffered personal injuries. His automobile was damaged. Plaintiff’s headlights and taillights remained burning (with the exception of the taillight on the side of the car straddling the track) after the collision. The entire operation from the time plaintiff raised the hood of the motor to the time the accident occurred lasted only three to four minutes.</p>
