Kimble, instituted two actions in trespass to recover damages sustained as a result of her husband’s death allegedly caused by the roof of defendant’s foundry falling upon him. The first suit was a “'death action” brought by plaintiff to recover expenses and for financial loss suffered by her and her children. The second suit was a “survival action” whereby plaintiff as administratrix of decedent’s estate sought to recover the present worth of Harry P. Kimble’s future earnings. These were cumulative suits. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff as personal representative of decedent in the sum of $5,823.20 and in favor of plaintiff as administratrix of the estate of Harry P. Kimble in the sum of $10,000. Defendant’s motion for judgment n. o. v. was denied. This appeal followed.</p>

The main part of the plant consists of a foundry building 740 feet long, 150 feet wide, and 64 feet high, with a monitor roof. The framework of the roof consists of steel trusses to which are attached steel purlins extending from the comb of the roof to the eaves. Wooden nailers are bolted to the purlins by carriage bolts. Spiked to the purlins and extending lengthwise of the building is 2 x 6 wooden sheathing. Over this sheathing is 1 x 8 sheathing, laid crosswise of the underlying sheathing. The lower deck was spiked to the <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>nailers in the purlins, and the top deck was nailed to the under deck.</p>

On November 14,1944, the defendant company leased to the Construction Company trackage and operating rights over a railroad siding serving defendant’s plant and connecting with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. The Construction Company agreed to move defendant’s freight cars to and from its plant. These cars were moved by the engine owned by the Construction Company and operated by its employees.</p>

Kimble was struck by boards and timbers falling from the roof of defendant’s foundry building. Decedent died an hour later from injuries thus sustained. When the crash came, Rubino was almost struck by .a piece of board. He immediately got out of the cab to look for Kimble. He testified: “I didn’t spend more than ten or fifteen seconds [looking for Kimble]. I had to run, because that other roof was coming down.” The first section hit the engine and the second section “hit about ten or fifteen feet away, towards the east.” About three seconds elapsed between the falling of the two sections, which measured 100 feet long, 22 feet wide and weighed 12 tons.</p>

Witnesses testified that the lumber in the roof was rotted. James H. Cregar, a shipping helper at Treadwell, when <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>asked “what was the condition of this part of roof lumber, and what not, that you found there on Harry Kimble?” replied: “Well, the roofing, why, it was good, but the other stuff was rotten.” He described “the other stuff” as “heavy boards; it was rotten; there wasn’t anything to it. That was one reason we didn’t have any trouble getting it off of him.” Charles O. Baker, another employee in the shipping department at Treadwell testified that “the lumber was in very poor condition. These two by fours that was bolted on to the purlins was very rotten, and the bolts had pulled right through the bolt holes, and the two by fours were rotted, and that is why they ripped loose in the roof. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have come off like that; it probably would have busted up in different pieces, and part of it would have stuck to the roof — .” When asked: “What was the condition of the two by fours, that you saw on the ground?” he answered : “Why, the bolt holes were rotted out of it.”</p>

When questioned as to the condition of the nailers on that date, he said: “They were rotten.” The bolts “were rusted away”. As for the nailers and the tongue and groove in the part of the blown off roof, he stated “The nailers were not much account, at all.” Mr. Williams was asked: “Could the condition of these nailers, and this tongue and groove, nailed to the nailers — have been disclosed by an inspection from the interior of that building, on March 31st, 1945, or a reasonable length of time ahead of that date?” He replied : “Yes, it could.” There was other testimony of the same purport.</p>

An employee of defendant company, Erwin C. St. George, stated: “I heard a ripping and tearing sound, and an awful crash. So, we had been nervous, all morning, about the wind. It was an unusually high wind, to begin with, and the buildings around there had been swaying, and the trees, on the Crucible side were swinging back and forth, and I made everybody get out of there; and, when I got down there, I seen Mike running down.” Charles H. Bryan, Chief of the Fire Department of East Liverpool, Ohio; Fred Hilditch, a resident of Midland for forty-one years; Delmar Manning, a fireman in East Liverpool for thirteen years, and Ira W. Cunningham, a policeman from East Liverpool for six years all testified that in their opinion the wind on that day was the strongest they had observed. W. S. Brontzman, employee of the U. S. Weather Bureau in charge of the Pittsburgh office, testified that at 12:28 P.M. the wind in Pittsburgh at the Allegheny County Airport (which is 30 to 35 miles from Midland) was south-south-west a velocity of thirty-eight miles per hour with fifty mile per hour gusts. At 1:00 P.M. the wind was south-southwest velocity of 38 miles per hour. At 1:28 P.M. the wind was west-southwest velocity of forty-three miles per hour. In comparing the <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>East Liverpool record with the Pittsburgh record, it seemed there was about an hour’s difference, that is, what occurred in East Liverpool would occur in Pittsburgh about one hour later. Arthur J. LaComb, observer for the U. S. Weather Bureau stationed at the Airport at East Liverpool, Ohio, stated that at twelve-twenty seven the wind was west-southwest with a velocity of thirty-five miles with gusts up to sixty-five miles per hour.</p>
    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[199,789,1148,698]]]'>Plaintiff’s witnesses contradicted the evidence with regard to the severity of the wind on the date of the accident. Mr. Cregar was asked: “What was the condition of the weather, in Midland, about a quarter to one, or thereabouts, on the 31st day of March, 1945, in the vicinity of those two plants, Treadwell and Mackintosh Hemphill? He answered: “Well, in my judgment — you are referring to the wind, is that what you are referring to? Q. All right; let’s go to the wind. A. To my judgment, the wind wasn’t any stronger, at the time I went out there, then it was several times that I have seen it around that vicinity, before.” He added: “There was a high wind ... I have seen winds just as heavy as that.”</p>

Whether or not the fatal injury to plaintiff’s decedent was due to an act of God or to defendant’s negligence was a question of fact for the jury. The condition of the roof, the intensity of the wind on the date of the accident and on previous occasions at the same place were factual questions. The charge of the court was comprehensive and accurate. The trial judge charged: “It is the law that no person is answerable for what is termed an act of Providence, that is, if some visitation of Providence comes along that in our ordinary experience we are not . . . anticipating, then no one can be held to answer for that act, so that if the wind on this day was of such severity that it could <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>not be reasonably anticipated by the Defendant, and that by reason of that wind, a part of the roof was blown off, then the Defendant would not be liable. However, if the storm were not of that severity, if it were only such a storm as occasionally happens, but is reasonably to be anticipated on occasions of every year or two, then that would not be an act of Providence ... if they were such as were reasonably to be expected to occur occasionally, then such storms should be guarded against. An act of Providence as related to cases of injurious negligence is one against which ordinary skill and foresight is not expected to provide. Whether the injury in this case is attributable to such a cause or is the consequence of negligence is a question of fact for you to determine. . . . Even if, with an extraordinary wind or storm there is concurring negligence, the party chargeable with it will be relieved from liability if the wind or storm is so overwhelming in character that it would of itself have produced the injury complained of, independently of negligence if there were negligence.”</p>

These are matters exclusively for the jury”: <em>Sabach et ux. v. Antonoplos, </em>supra. Although individuals are not required to guard against every risk they conceive to be possible, they are under a legal duty to prevent hazards which they can forecast as possible. Theré must be antecedent probability. An act which may be prevented by the exercise of ordinary <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>care is not an act of God since the latter is a casualty not due to or in any way contributed to by human agency.

The word ‘circumstances’ is comprehensive. It embraces the entire sum of the attendant facts, including the operation of the forces of nature so far as they bear upon or relate to the happening of the central event. A person is charged with ordinary knowledge of the workings of these forces, and his conduct, if it is to escape being stigmatized as wanting in care, must conform to the normal workings of the forces of nature. At common law it was held that every man must have some knowledge ‘of the quality of his beast’ (1 Hale P. S. 430) and use appropriate means to keep that beast from harming people. Public welfare requires that this same salutary rule apply to the inanimate objects in a man’s possession and subject to his intelligent control.” In the instant case, defendant by using ordinary diligence and attention could have prevented the serious consequences which resulted from its failure to inspect and correct the faulty condition of the foundry rooof. We said in <em>Fitzpatrick v. Penfield, </em><a href="/pa/267/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="267 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="1057768" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0564-01">267 Pa. 564</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20653" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="109 A. 653">109 A. 653</a>: “High winds are not of infrequent occurrence, and this particular wind was termed an ordinary wind occurring three or four times in a year.

The event was not within the foreseeable risk of harm. The orbit of duty is determined by the reasonable foreseeable risk of harm. In <em>Irwin Savings &amp; Trust Company v. Penna. R. R.

    <p id="b494-4" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[211,514,1150,694]]]'>Negligence does not of itself create liability. Back of the negligent act or failure to act must be sought and found a duty to the person injured, the observance of which would have averted or avoided the injury. Even though it be assumed that the roof was negligently maintained, the unusually high wind was an independent intervening force effecting an unforeseeable event for which appellant should not be held responsible. The duty extended only to reasonably foreseeable circumstances and injury which appellant could reasonably anticipate as a result of such negligence. The event which is the basis for the instant suit was clearly beyond the periphery of the duty.</p>
