A separation occurred. Two actions in divorce were instituted by the wife against the husband, both of which are still pending. The securities were registered in both names and were deposited in the safe de<a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>posit box in a bank registered in both their names. The husband, without the knowledge of his wife, removed the securities and placed them in a safe deposit box of another bank in his own name. The wife, without the knowledge of her husband, secured access to this box and removed all the securities and put them in the hands of her attorney. Some of the securities were sold and the proceeds used to pay some arrearages of a support order. With full knowledge of all the facts, the husband and wife entered into a written agreement of division of the assets above referred to, effective <em>after </em>a divorce had been obtained by the wife. It was stipulated in the agreement that the cause for divorce would be alleged to be any cause except that of adultery. The agreement was drafted by the attorneys for both parties and was written by the attorney for the husband. For the convenience of the husband, the agreement was executed at his place of business in the presence of the two attorneys and a justice of the peace who took the husband’s acknowledgment to a deed. In pursuance to the agreement, the securities were delivered <em>in escrow </em>to the president of a bank who still holds them in his possession. The husband also executed and delivered a written release to the bank, whose employe improperly gave the wife access to the husband’s individual safe deposit box.</p>
