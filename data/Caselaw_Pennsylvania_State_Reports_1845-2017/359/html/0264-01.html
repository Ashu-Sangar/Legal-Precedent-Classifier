L. 458, and prays that an injunction be issued restraining the Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh, created under the authority of that Act, from exercising the powers therein granted, and restraining the City of Pittsburgh from appropriating to it any public funds or entering into any agreement with it for the waiver of taxes on its properties. This Court took original jurisdiction of the bill. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Downtown Parking Association, a voluntary association of owners and operators of parking lots and facilities in the downtown area of the city, were given leave to intervene.</p>

Therefore it is declared to be the policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to promote the safety and welfare of the inhabitants thereof by the creation in second class cities of bodies' corporate and politic to be known as “Parking Authorities” which shall exist and operate for the purposes contained in the Act.

Its purpose is to study the public needs in relation to parking and to establish a permanent coordinated system of parking facilities by acquiring, improving, maintaining and operating land and facilities to be devoted to the parking of all kinds of vehicles, but it shall not engage in the sale of gasoline, the sale of automobile accessories, automobile repair and service or any other garage service, or the sale of any commodity of trade or commerce. It is empowered to charge reasonable rates for its facilities for the purpose of providing for the payment of the expenses of construction, improvement, repair, maintenance and operation of its facilities and properties and the payment of the principal of and interest on its obligations, the reasonableness of such rates to be subject to determination by the courts. It is vested with the power of eminent domain within the limits of the city.

But a legislative declaration with respect to that question, while not conclusive, is entitled to a prima facie acceptance of its correctness: <em>Dornan v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, </em>supra; <em>Belovsky v. Redevelopment Authority of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/357/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="357 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="472112" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0329-01">357 Pa. 329</a>, 334, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20A.2d%20277" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="54 A.2d 277">54 A. 2d 277</a>, 280. Not only is the declaration of legislative findings in the present Act impressive in pointing out the urgent need of legislation of this type, but the conditions it portrays are well known to all inhabitants of our larger cities. It is unfortunate that many operators of automobiles habitually ignore the fact that highways are intended primarily for travel and not for the storage of vehicles other than by way of transitory stops for loading and unloading. The conges<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>tion caused by such misuse of the streets and by the ever-increasing amount of motor vehicle traffic has become a major problem of municipal administration, — a problem particularly acute in a city like Pittsburgh where it is aggravated by the concentration of the downtown business section in a “Golden Triangle” of comparatively narrow streets and tall office and commercial buildings, many of the occupants of which use private automobiles to and from their offices and stores. Studies made by the Pittsburgh Regional Planning Association and the Allegheny Conference on Community Development reveal that parking facilities in that city are grossly inadequate and that private enterprise has not been able to solve the problem because private parking lots are frequently temporary in nature and located without much regard for actual parking requirements, vacant land being utilized for parking purposes in more or less haphazard fashion merely for the purpose of earning taxes on the land pending profitable disposition of it for construction purposes. Under such circumstances, as was said in <em>Belovsky v. Redevelopment Authority of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/357/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="357 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="472112" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0329-01">357 Pa. 329</a>, 339, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20A.2d%20277" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="54 A.2d 277">54 A.2d 277</a>, 282, “public aid must accompany private initiative if the desired results are to be obtained”. The widespread need of legislation to furnish such aid can be gleaned from the fact that in 1946 alone 65 cities opened new parking lots, and, by 1945, 22 States and the District of Columbia had enacted laws in some form dealing with parking facilities.</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[210,1884,1151,492]],["BL_292.1",292,[221,293,1152,859]]]'>Those attacking the constitutionality of such a law as that which is here under consideration obviously labor under the mistaken notion that its purpose is merely to cater to the convenience of the owners and operators of motor vehicles; on the contrary its effect may be to interfere with the perhaps greater convenience of parking on the public streets; its real purpose is to promote the larger and more general good of the community by freeing the streets of the impediments and perils arising <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>from dangerous and often intolerable conditions of traffic congestion. And since tbe Act is concerned with the regulation of the transportation of persons and property along the highways of the municipality, and since the evils it seeks to remedy vitally affect conditions for the transaction of business, the prevention of accidents, the effective operations of fire and police forces, and, in general, the enjoyment of many phases of city life and activities, its justification stems directly from the exercise of the police power, which is the supreme power of government. The right of eminent domain which it gives to the Authority must be viewed, therefore, not as though it were an independent and unrelated grant of such a right, but with regard to the major and primary object of the legislation, which is to facilitate and make safe the use of the highways.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

As governmental activities increase with the growing complexity and integration of society, the concept of ‘public use’ naturally expands in proportion”. It is no constitutional objection to the statute, nor does it derogate from the public character of its objective, that the Authority will to some extent conduct what may heretofore have been regarded as a private enterprise; to hold otherwise would mean that the State would be powerless, within constitutional limitations, to act in order to preserve the health and safety of its people even though such action were imperative and vital for the purpose.</p>

Indeed, such a project is but a mild advance on the existing plan employed by many municipalities of designating individual parking spaces on the streets and making a charge for such facilities through the use of parking meters, a right confirmed by this court in <em>William Laubach &amp; Sons v.

For the same reason all the other objections to the constitutionality of the statute automatically evaporate. Thus there is no merit in the contention that the exemption from taxation of the property and bonds of the Parking Authority is in contravention of Article IX, sections 1 and 2 of the State Constitution; the use of the property being public, such exemption would follow even in the absence of an express statutory provision to that effect: <em>Dornan v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, </em><a href="/pa/331/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="331 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1184280" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0209-01">331 Pa. 209</a>, 228, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.%20834" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="200 A. 834">200 A. 834</a>, 843. The objection that the Act permits the appropriation or donation by cities of public funds to the Parking Authority and that this is contrary to Article IX, section 7 of the Constitution must likewise fail, since that constitutional provision is applicable only to the appropriation of public funds to a purely private enterprise and has no application to a public corporation such as this Authority: <em>Tranter v.
