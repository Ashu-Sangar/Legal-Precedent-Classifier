    <p id="b221-4" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[258,418,1152,1474]]]'>That the so-called “assembled industrial plant doctrine” has always been used in assessing for taxation the specific subjects mentioned in the Act, such as “mills and manufactories of all kinds, furnaces, forges, bloomeries, distilleries, sugar houses, malt houses, breweries, tan yards, fisheries, and ferries, wharves”, cannot be legally questioned. See <em>Defense Plant Corp. Tax Assess. Case, </em><a href="/pa/350/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="350 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="461139" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0520-01">350 Pa. 520</a>, 522, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20713" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="39 A.2d 713">39 A. 2d 713</a>. That it was the legislative intent that that same doctrine was to be applied in assessing all industrial plants seems to us to be obvious. The statute specifically set forth certain subjects, and then, rather than attempt t!o enumerate all of the numerous types of industrial plants, the catch-all words, “all other real estate”, were used. The Act does not contain the word “buildings”, yet no one could seriously question the fact that they, when appurtenant to the land, properly are assessable and taxable, under the general term of “all other real estate.” Clearly, it was the intendment of the Legislature also to cover and tax, under that same general term, machinery and equipment necessary to the operation of such plants as that of appellees. No legitimate distinction can be found anywhere between what constitutes an integral unit of real estate under the Act of 1933, as amended, and what constitutes an integral unit of real estate under the general property law of this Commonwealth, as stated in <em>Titus v. Poland Coal </em>Co., supra.</p>

L. 509, §4. There it was provided that the real estate subject to assessment was “All houses, lands, lots of ground and ground rents, mills and manufactories of all descriptions, all furnaces, forges, bloomeries, distilleries, sugar-houses, malt houses, breweries, tan-yards and ferries.” Realizing that this Act did not fully cover the entire field of real estate desired to be assessed and taxed, the <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>Act of April 29,1844, P. L. 486, §32, was enacted. It was there provided that “all real estate, to wit: houses, lands, lots of ground and ground rents, mills and manufactories of all kinds, furnaces, forges, bloomeries, distilleries, sugar-houses, malt houses, breweries, tan yards, fisheries and ferries, wharves, <em>and all other real estate not exempt by law from taxation, . </em>. . shall be valued and assessed . . . for all state and county purposes.” (Italics added.) The only logical reason for adding this latter portion to the statute was to make assessable and taxable all real estate of such plants as those of appellees under the “assembled industrial plant doctrine.”</p>
    <p id="b222-4" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[218,967,1147,1409]],["BL_223.1",223,[231,320,1150,1198]]]'>In <em>Patterson v. Delaware County, </em><a href="/pa/70/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="70 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="1028207" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0381-01">70 Pa. 381</a>, the Act of 1844 came before us, and, in a per curiam opinion, we affirmed the judgment for the reasons given by the learned court below. That case is particularly significant, since the question there involved was whether or not the machinery of a cotton factory could be taxed, and the court below held that it could be, inasmuch as the machinery in question was real estate under the general provision of the statute, to-wit “all other real estate”, as well as under the specific classification of “mills”. There it was said (pp. 382-3) : “Language more comprehensive could not have been employed. After designating real estate in general terms, an attempt is made to enumerate the several descriptions or kinds, apparently for greater certainty; and then, as if fearful of having overlooked and omitted something that belongs to the class, general terms are again resorted to, that nothing may escape. And this act, it will be observed, differs in this respect from that of 1834 — the latter closing with the enumeration of certain kinds of real estate; and the enumeration, also, falling short of that contained in the Act of 1844. And this difference is significant. The legislature evidently intended by the subsequent act to embrace all real estate of <em>every description. </em>That the property taxed in the case before us is <em>real estate, </em>is n!ot, of course, doubted. But the plaintiff <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>thinks <em>this particular hind </em>of real estate was <em>not intended </em>to be taxed. He argues that the enumeration of certain kinds in the act, as ‘houses, lands, lots of ground, ground-rents, mills,’ etc., was to designate precisely what the legislature intended by the preceding terms ‘all real estate’, and that everything not embraced in this enumeration is excluded. But this view seems to overlook the very important language, before referred to, which follows the enumeration: ‘all <em>other </em>real estate.’ But suppose we adopt the plaintiff’s view — that the operation of the Act of 1844 is to be confined to the several descriptions of real estate enumerated; what then? Does not the property here taxed fall within the enumeration? The machinery in a mill is as much a part of it as are the <em>walls. </em>As the Supreme Court has said in Gray v. Holdship, 17 S. &amp; R. 413: ‘the machinery, the wheels, stones, and even the bolting-cloths, are a part of the mill,’ and <em>therefore </em>a part of the real estate . . . (p.386). We cannot therefore, adopt the views of the able counsel who represent the plaintiff, whether we consider the general terms used in the act, or the special terms on which they rely.”</p>
