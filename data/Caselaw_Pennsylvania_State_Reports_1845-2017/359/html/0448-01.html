Defendants’ farm adjoins plaintiff’s property to the rear and side and the private lane is the only means of access thereto. Plaintiff’s bill alleges that the defendants contracted with codefendant William N. Raphial for the digging of certain holes on the private lane to erect poles and to string copper wire from the lines of The Philadelphia Electric Company on Ashland Avenue to defendants’ property for the purpose of providing the farm with electrical facilities; that holes are being dug on plaintiff’s property despite her warning to defendants and their employees to cease work and remove themselves from the premises. Plaintiff avers that the continuing trespass will cause immediate and irreparable loss and damage, and that the right of way created by the partition proceedings is limited to ingress and egress of passenger and vehicular traffic and does not include ingress and egress of electricity.</p>

It is a rule in the interpretation of contracts that a contract “should be construed in the light of the circumstances surrounding them [the parties] at the time it is made, it being the duty of the court to place itself as nearly as may be in the situation of the parties at the time so as to view the circumstances as they viewed them, and so to judge of the meaning of the words and the <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>correct application of the language of the contract. For this purpose in construing a contract the court will consider the nature of the agreement itself, together with all the facts and circumstances leading up to and attending its execution, the relation and condition of the parties, the nature and situation of the subject matter, and the apparent purpose of making the contract”. 13 Corpus Juris 542, 543, sec. 514 (citing numerous cases).

At that time telephones, electric lights and electric washing machines and electric cooking stoves, electric heaters, electric radios and electric vacuum cleaners were totally unknown. Today in almost every American home in localities such as the one in which this litigation has its situs electricity is almost as much of a necessity as is water. Even under the narrow interpretation contended for by plaintiff, Mr. and Mrs. Reid could keep the road cluttered with vehicles (ox-driven, if they so desired) bringing them kerosene oil for oil lamps and fuel oil for an oil heating apparatus and electric storage batteries for the purpose of supplying them with electric light and power. No matter how large their <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>habitation might be or how much oil they might need or how many storage batteries they might require, their right to bring these supplies over this road in some kind of motor-driven or animal-pulled vehicles could not be questioned.</p>

We answer this question “Yes”, and in so answering we are in accord with the weight of authority.</p>

R. 455</a>, it was held that the right to the maintenance of a farm crossing by a railroad, the right of way of which divides a farm and cuts off the buildings thereon from access to the highway, under a provision in the deed to the railroad requiring it “to permit and maintain two farm crossings,” <em>includes the right to install a conduit underneath the right of way to carry electricity from an electric line on the hightoa,y to the buildings </em>to be used for farm and domestic purposes, provided that such conduit is constructed in such a way as not to make it dangerous to operate the railroad over the crossing. The Supreme Court of Indiana stated:. . . The reservation was for a ‘farm crossing,’ and it must be concluded that it was intended to afford a means of access to the divided portions of the farm and to the adjacent and only available highway. It is true that at the time the deed was made the crossing was only used as a pedestrian crossing or for animals or animal-drawn vehicles, but there is no express limitation of the use to such traffic. It is sometimes said that reservations of easements are strictly limited to the purposes in the minds of the parties, but we believe a proper application of the rule puts the limitation not upon the character of traffic upon a reserved way, but <em>upon the purpose to be served by the traffic. </em>Without the reservation, public policy would have implied an intention that the dominant estate should have a way of passage over the servient estate <em>because such a way is necessary to the full and fair enjoyment of the dominant estate, </em>and it is against public policy that estates be cut off from use and profitable enjoyment. ... In Jones on Easements, § 323, p. 263, it is said: ‘The extent of a way of necessity is a way such as is required for the complete and beneficial use of the land to which such way is impliedly attached.’ ... it has sometimes been said that the right is limited to such a way as was necessary at the time. But we <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>think the limitation is upon the use of the dominant estate served, in this instance a farm home, and that <em>the way may be used in any manner that is reasonably required for the complete and beneficial use of the dominant estate as a farm or home.” </em>(Italics supplied.)</p>

E. 1042</a> (1918), a court of equity had ordered a telephone company to remove the poles and wires erected or being erected by it along and over the right of way of the defendant, running through the land of plaintiff. The right of way owned by the. defendant was granted to him along with a tract of one hundred and four acres in 1884. It was described as “a right of way for the benefit of the land hereby conveyed” <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>along certain lines. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia said: “The first proposition relied on to sustain the decree is that the grant of the right of way to Ramey does not specifically give him the right to erect and maintain a telephone line over and along said way even for his personal and private use at his home on the land granted him, and that therefore the telephone company had not the right to so enter upon said right of way even under its contract with Ramey. . . . The general rule is that where a right of way is granted or reserved without limit of use it may be used for any purpose to which the land accommodated thereby may naturally and reasonably be devoted.

And anciently it was decided in England that the grantee of such an easement is entitled to vary his mode of enjoying the same, and from time to time to avail himself of modern inventions; if, by so doing, he can more fully exercise and enjoy the object or carry out the purpose for which the easement was granted, applied in the case of a mine owner with right of a sufficient ‘wayleave’ to his mines, and where it was held that he was entitled to lay down a railway for the purpose of carrying his minerals, though railways were unknown at the date of the grant. [Citing cases] In 9 R. C. L. p. 787, it is said, ‘An unlimited conveyance of an easement is in law a grant of unlimited reasonable use,’ citing many decisions. And our case of Uhl v. Ohio River R. Co., <a href="/w-va/47/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="47 W. Va. 59" data-case-ids="8638219" data-case-paths="/w-va/47/0059-01">47 W.

To deny them such right would be to stop to some extent the wheels of progress, and invention, and finally make residence in the country more and more undesirable and less endurable. Where there has been such an unlimited and unrestricted grant of a way we think it may be reasonably implied that the parties intended an unlimited reasonable use thereof, as distinguished from an unreasonable and improper one. It is fully shown in the evidence in this case that the poles and wires are so set and hung as to constitute no invasion of plaintiff’s right or any obstruction to the enjoyment by him of the residue of his land.”</p>

And with respect to the supposed additional servitude created by the use of the way for such poles and wires, we can see no distinction in principle between the grant of a way for a public road and one for a private one, certainly there is nothing in the character of the burden to distinguish them. ...

Poles and wires along the highways are concomitants of this mechanized age and the sensitivity of those who find the sight of them offensive is somewhat beyond the pale of a court of equity’s protection.
