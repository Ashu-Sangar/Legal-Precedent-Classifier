In 1936 negotiations were entered into for the allowance by the Distilling Company to the Board of so-called “quantity discounts” for that year; the result was that, in correspondence dated April 15 and 16, 1936, the Distilling Company agreed to allow such discounts according to certain specified percentages on purchases made by the Board, and in December, 1937 and January, 1938 the Distilling Company paid the Board the sum of $8,634.72, which was the amount due for such discounts according to the schedule agreed upon.</p>

Accordingly the Board agreed, in a letter to the Distilling Company dated February 10, 1939, that it would not deduct the $9,503.95 from current payments, but would allow the Distilling Company to liquidate the debt by paying $869.23 at once and instalments of $2,158.68 each on February 28, March 31, April 30, and May 27, 1939. It was stated in the letter that “Deduction of the amount due will not be made from our remittance unless we fail to receive payments as noted above. If it is determined that any portion of the above total claims should not be collected, we will adjust the above schedule of payments.” By letter dated March 14, 1939, the Distilling Company accepted this arrangement except that it requested that the first instalment should be deferred to March 28 instead of February 28. It is clear that the phrase “If.it is <em>determined </em>that any portion of the above total claims should not be collected, we will adjust the above schedule of payments” meant that if, before the instalment payments all became due, a decision was rendered by the Auditor General and State Treasurer or the Attorney General to the effect that the quantity discounts were <em>illegal, </em>proper adjustment would be made with the Distilling Company in regard to the payments it had made of such discounts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

On April 10, 1942 the Trust Company presented to the Auditor General for settlement its claim against the Board on these invoices in the amount of $7,494.97, which was the balance then due on the Distilling Company’s notes. The Board, while admitting liability on the invoices, defended on the basis of the $8,634.72 deduction it had made from the Distilling Company’s account and which it now presented as a setoff to the Trust Company’s claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The Trust Company thus attempted to cancel or overcome the setoff presented by the Board by claiming on its part the amount of the discounts which had, because of such alleged misrepresentation, been improperly paid by the Distilling Company to the Board in 1937 and 1938 in pursuance of the 1936 agreement.</p>

By the agreement entered into in the letter of February 10, 1939 from the Board to the Distilling Company and the letter of March 14, 1939 from the Distilling Company to the Board it was clearly provided that the indebtedness of $8,634.72 was to be paid by the Distilling Company in instalments ending May 27, 1939, and if the instalments were not so paid the Board was to have the right to deduct the amount due from its remittances to the Distilling Company. The Board subsequently availed itself of this right and is now justified in relying upon it. The attempt of the Trust Company, as assignee of the Distilling Company’s invoices, to overcome the Board’s setoff by claiming what amounts to a refund of the quantity discount allowances must fail for several reasons: (1) By the agreement entered into in the letters of February 10 and March 14, 1939, the recognition of any claim of the Distilling Company to such a refund was conditioned upon its being determined by the Auditor General and State Treasurer or the Attorney General that the quantity discounts were illegal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> No such determination or decision was ever made; on the contrary, the Auditor General and State Treasurer, in settling the Trust Company’s claim in May, 1946, held that the agreement for the allowance of the discounts was valid and did not violate the Robinson-Patman Act; therefore the obligation of the Dis<a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>tilling Company to pay the $8,634.72, and the right ol* the Board to demand it or to assert it as a setoff against the Board’s indebtedness to the Distilling Company, became absolute and unconditional. (2) Even if the Chairman of the Board did make any factual misrepresentation which would have entitled the Distilling Company to rescind the agreement of 1936 and seek a refund of the allowances paid thereunder, such right would be one wholly distinct from, and independent of, the agreement of February 10 - March 14,1939, and could not defeat or impair the right of the Board to recover, or to use as a setoff, the $8,634.72 due it under the terms of the latter agreement. (3) Even if there were any right on the part of the Distilling Company to rescind the agreement in regard to the quantity discounts and to secure a refund of the payments made thereunder, that right would be wholly personal to the Distilling Company and could be invoked by it alone: <em>McEvoy v. M. Samuels &amp; Sons, </em><a href="/pa/277/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="277 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1079510" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0370-01">277 Pa. 370</a>, 373, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20A.%20189" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="121 A. 189">121 A. 189</a>,190; Black on Rescission of Contracts (2nd ed.), p. 1359, § 550; 17 C. J. S. 518, 519, § 165a. (4) Even were the claim for rescission and for refund assignable it was not in fact assigned to the Trust Company, which was the transferee only of the invoices assigned as collateral on the Distilling Company’s notes, and if such claim passed to any one it passed to the Distilling Company’s trustee in bankruptcy by operation of law, and there is no basis whatever for the Trust Company’s assertion of any right in regard thereto: cf. <em>Morris, for use of Rupp, v. Mc-Culloch, </em><a href="/pa/83/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="83 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1050804" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0034-01">83 Pa. 34</a>. (5) Even if the Distilling Company had desired to assert such an alleged misrepresentation as the basis for rescission and refund it would have been incumbent upon it to do so promptly after it had discovered, or by reasonable diligence could have ascertained, that not all the distilling companies had made the quantity discount allowances, and where, as here, the facts are undisputed, the question whether there has been an unreasonable delay is one of law for the court: <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>

It is not sufficient in such a case for one merely to aver ignorance; there must be an explanation, here wholly lacking, as to why knowledge of the fraud was so belatedly acquired: <em>Stimson v.
