McKnight, a daughter of decedent) the income which she had been receiving during her lifetime should continue to be paid to her son, William E. Hetzel, Jr., testator’s great-grandson. This ruling was based on the finding that a reading of the entire Will showed that testator’s use of the word “children” was in the sense of “issue” and that this was confirmed by the “applicable authorities” and hence the great-grandson took his deceased mother’s share in the trust estate.</p>

Fairman (daughter of decedent), her grandchildren, children of her daughter, Mary Fairman Sailer, who predeceased her, i. e., great-grandchildren of the testator, were entitled to participate, along with her son, in the one-fifth share of income which their grandmother had been receiving during her lifetime. Judge Hunter decided that the manifest general intent of Mr. Clark’s will was to send the share of each of his children (in equal shares) down in the line of her (and his) blood, per stirpes, and that he used the word “children” (in the gift of income to his children’s children) in the sense of “issue” and hence that, under the language of Mr. Clark’s Will and the applicable authorities, the three great-grandchildren were entitled to the share of income which their mother would have received had she survived her parent.</p>

The grandchildren ask us to exclude from any share of the trust estate amounting to $940,512.37 the great-grandchildren. These latter constitute 52 percent of all of the testator’s living descendants. These 52 percent belong to two of the five lines of direct descendants of testator. All descendants of testator have been receiving income from the trust estate during the period of the trust. No exceptions were filed to the adjudications awarding them such income.</p>
    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.6",438,[215,1112,1150,959]]]'>The trust did not terminate until Mary Janet Paul died on March 3, 1947. At that time the question of the distribution of the principal came before the court for the first time. Judge Bolger held on June 30, 1947, that the thirteen living great-grandchildren of the testator should participate in the distribution of the principal together with John S. Clark’s nine living grandchildren. This decision was based on the finding that the term “children” should be construed to mean “issue” and that, therefore, great-grandchildren should be included in the distribution. Exceptions to this adjudication were filed in behalf of the nine living grandchildren and the Orphans’ Court in an opinion by Judge Hunter dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the adjudication absolutely. On January 27, 1948, the Schedule of Distribution was approved and filed and thereafter, nine appeals were duly taken on behalf of the living grandchildren.</p>

We said: “The rule in such cases is, as Judge Gest said in Williamson’s Estate, 3 D. &amp; C. 1, adopted by the Superior Court, <a href="/pa-super/82/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="82 Pa.

The terminology employed by the testator in <em>Campbell’s Estate, </em>supra, is similar to the use in the will now being construed. The pronoun “them” in the phrase “the children of such of them” in <em>Campbell’s Estate </em>modifies its antecedent “surviving brothers and sisters”. Under a narrow literalness of construction, the issue of testator’s children would have been barred from taking under Campbell’s will, but this Court rejected such a construction and as a result none of testator’s lineal descendants was disinherited. In <em>Ziegler Estate, </em><a href="/pa/356/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="356 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="470659" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0093-01">356 Pa. 93</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20A.2d%20608" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="51 A.2d 608">51 A. 2d 608</a>, where testator provided that his estate should be “divided unto my six children or their lawful heirs . . . But if the Daughter of my deceased son . . . should die without children in such case all the money she drew out of my estate shall fall back to my other children now living or their lawful heirs,” it was held that testator intended the remainder interest to vest in the children of the daughter, or their issue, and did not intend to restrict the class to his grandchildren living at her death, and that the word “children” was intended by the testator to mean “issue”. Mr. Justice Patterson speaking for this Court said: “As in all cases where this Court is interpreting a will, it is the actual intent of the testator, as ascertained from the language of his will which must prevail: Keefer Estate, <a href="/pa/353/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="353 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="465978" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0281-01">353 Pa. 281</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20A.2d%2031" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="45 A.2d 31">45 A. 2d 31</a>. . . .

Testator’s scheme being clearly of a family or a per stirpes distribution, and the word ‘children’ manifestly having been employed in a broad sense, rather than a technical one, the court below properly awarded one-half of the balance of the estate to G.

E. 859</a> [860], (2) ‘In determining the testator’s intention the court should place itself as nearly as possible in his position, and hence . . . should take into consideration the situation of the testator and the facts and circumstances surrounding him at the time the will was executed . . ., the state of the property devised,’ the amount and character of the property of the testator when he made his will (McGlathery’s Estate, <a href="/pa/311/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="311 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1146311" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0351-01">311 Pa. 351</a>,<a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20886" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="166 A. 886">166 A. 886</a> [887]), and ‘the testator’s relation to the beneficiaries, their condition or necessities :’ 69 C. P., p. 63, sec. 1120.” The application of these canons to the will now before us leads to the conclusion that although the terminology employed by the will is susceptible of two interpretations, it is more “agreeable to reason and justice” to reject the narrow interpretation of the word “children” contended for by appellants and hold that the word “children” as used in the third paragraph of the will in connection with the phrase “per stirpes, that is, they shall take by representation of their parents, respectively, and not per capita” includes the grandchildren of testator’s immediate children. When a testator directs, as did this testator, that after the death of all his children, his estate shall be divided among “their living children, per stirpes”, he Avas obviously thinking of his descendants as thejy stemmed from his children and he directed that they take his estate by “representation of their parents, respectively, and not per capita.”</p>

The Court of Appeals of Ohio in awarding a portion of the estate to the great-granddaughter said: “. . . the well-settled rules of construction require us to ascertain the intention of the testator from the language of the will, giving, if possible, to the words used a meaning that will avoid intestacy, vesting the interests at as early a date as is consistent with the expressed intention of the testator, and withal remembering that we are not forced to give language a technical construction unless the intent of the will clearly requires it, and that words are flexible and capable of many shades of meaning. ... We are also called upon to construe the meaning of that portion of the will disposing of the corpus of the estate, ‘and upon the death of the last survivor of my children, the trust herein created shall cease, and my estate vest in my grandchildren, per stirpes and not per capita.’ Here, again, a rigid construction of the word ‘grandchildren,’ as meaning the children of the testator’s children, only produces results which we consider wholly contrary to the testator’s intention. Manifestly there can be no vesting of the corpus until the death of the last child of the testator. Again we revert to the whole will and conclude that it is manifest that the testator wished the .shares of his children to descend to the ‘issue’ — the lineal descendants — of his children, to his ‘grandchildren,’ without regard to any number of prefixes, great or great-great. As a general rule the word ‘grandchildren’ is a word of definite meaning, limited to children <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>of <em>children; </em>but where the manifest intention of the testator, as gained from the whole will, requires an extension of the meaning past the strict limitations, a court of chancery is amply warranted, and is, in fact, required, to so extend the meaning.”</p>
    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[232,587,1147,695]]]'>It must be taken for granted that during the seven years which elapsed between the making of the Clark will and its becoming operative at the time of its maker’s death, Mr. Clark knew that the corpus of the trust fund he created would not be divided among his heirs until after the lapse of a long period of time (in fact it proved to be 69 years after the date of the will). It must also be assumed that he knew that at the time the corpus would be divided there would probably be not only grandchildren but also great-grandchildren and that there was at least a natural likelihood that the Clark-blooded parents of some of these great-grandchildren might not then be living.</p>

Disston Estate, in the emphasis which it gives to the phrase ‘per stirpes’, is a further abatement and relaxation of the rule excluding remote issue, . . .” When <em>Disston’s Estate </em>was before this Court, Mr. Justice Allen M. Stearns did not sit because he had been a member of the court from which the appeal was taken. In that case he, as a member of the lower court, was one of a majority of five who held that the language of Disston’s will was such as to give to the great-grandchildren the right to share per stirpes with grandchildren. When the case was heard before us, we divided three to three on the question. We said: “The order appealed from is therefore affirmed.” The controlling words in <em>Disston Estate </em>are heretofore quoted in this opinion. Their resemblance to the controlling words in the instant case is so close as to make the decision in the <em>Disston </em>case the law in this case.</p>
