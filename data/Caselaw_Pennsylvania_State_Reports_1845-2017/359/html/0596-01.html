As a matter of fact there is nothing in common between a liquor license fee and a mercantile license tax and they do not in any sense duplicate one another. The former, which results from the necessity of policing a business requiring public supervision, is a flat charge for the privilege of dealing in intoxicating liquors; the mercantile license tax, on the other hand, which is imposed solely for revenue purposes, is a tax on the privilege of selling goods and merchandise of any kind or nature whatsoever, and, unlike a liquor license fee, is measured by the gross volume of business transacted annually: <em>Commonwealth v.

A dealer in intoxicating liquors really enjoys two privileges, — one, which he shares in common with <em>every </em>vendor, of engaging in the business of selling; for this he is required to pay, like all others, a mercantile license tax; another, which is granted to him specially, of dealing in intoxicating liquors, a business over which the State is compelled to exercise regulation and control; for this he is required, therefore, to pay a special license fee.</p>

He relies largely upon the decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Iron City Brewing Co., </em><a href="/pa/146/0642-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="146 Pa. 642" data-case-ids="827879" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0642-01">146 Pa. 642</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.%20384" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="23 A. 384">23 A. 384</a>. That case held that the effect of the liquor license Acts of May 13, 1887, P. L. 108, May 24, 1887, P. L. 194 and June 9, 1891, P. L. 257, which established the so-called “high license” system, was to make inapplicable to dealers in intoxicating liquors the then existing mercantile license taxes prescribed by the Acts of May 4,1841, P. L. 307 and April 22, 1846, P. L. 486. In considering, however, the relevancy of that decision to the present question there is this important difference to be noted, namely, that <em>there </em>the liquor legislation <em>followed </em>in point of time the mercantile tax legislation and consequently superseded it so far as there was any inconsistency in their respective provisions, whereas in the present case the situation is reversed because the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Act of 1933 <em>preceded </em>the mercantile license tax Act of 1947, so that the latter would control if there were any question of conflict or overlapping between them. It may be added that we are not dealing here, as in the <em>Iron City Brewing Company </em>case, with saloons of the type which then existed, but with restaurants which enjoy liquor <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>licenses only in connection with, and presumably incidental to, the sale of food to their patrons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b623-3" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[187,440,1152,1305]]]'>The real and, indeed, the sole question here involved comes down to this: Does the phraseology of the Act of 1947 clearly and unequivocally indicate an intention on the part of the legislature that the tax thereby imposed is to be paid by operators of restaurants holding liquor licenses the same as by persons conducting any other business enterprises? In our opinion the statute plainly manifests such an intention. It provides that such payment shall be made by vendors of, or dealers in, “goods, wares and merchandise”, which is language certainly broad and comprehensive enough to cover vendors of intoxicating liquors: <em>Ellis &amp; Connor v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/ky/186/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="186 Ky. 494" data-case-ids="2362081" data-case-paths="/ky/186/0494-01">186 Ky. 494</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=217%20S.W.%20368" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="217 S.W. 368">217 S.

Moreover, in the added phrase: “persons engaged in conducting restaurants or other places where food, drink or refreshments are sold”, the word “drink”, both as used in ordinary speech and as defined in standard dictionaries, certainly embraces “intoxicating liquor” as one of the principal meanings, if indeed not the chief meaning, to be ascribed to it.</p>

In the present case the injunction issued by the court below would relieve the operator of a restaurant holding a liquor license from the payment of the mercantile license tax even in respect to the sales of food and other items not in any way dependent on the liquor license.</p>
