The case was tried by a judge without a jury. This appeal is from the decree of the court below dismissing appellant’s exceptions to a decree holding the tax sales null and void for the reason that the assessments and returns did not sufficiently describe the property.</p>

Humphrey, on February 21, 1920, acquired title to 420 acres of unseated land in Derry Township, Westmoreland County. He died testate and by his will dated M[arch 24,1936, duly probated in the County of Allegheny, gave to his son, Wm. Humphrey, III, appellee, “All [his] real estate in the counties of Allegheny, Westmoreland and Bedford, in the state of Pennsylvania.” A copy of the will was filed in the office of the register of wills of Westmoreland County. The deed to William G. Humphrey and his will represent the common source of title. The land has been, since 1933, variously assessed in the names of “Wm. Humphreys &amp; Son”, “Wm. Humphrey heirs” and “Wm. Humphreys.” The tax returns for the same period have designated the owner variously as “Wm. Humphreys &amp; Son”, “W. Humphrey’s heirs” and “Wm. Humphreys.” The county commissioners, with the approval of court, on March 29, 1945, conveyed the entire tract of 420 acres to W. C. Miner who in turn conveyed to Ernest W. Clark, appellant. On June 3, 1946, appellee instituted this action in ejectment.</p>

This element consisted of a name connected with a title of some kind once existing in connection with the land, or of a number or a known designation, an ad joinder, a settlement or some other circumstance to lead to knowledge of the land that was assessed.” In that case, as in <em>City of Philadelphia v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/49/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="49 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="998522" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0440-01">supra,</a> it was held that a prior assessment in the name of John Trembel, where the warrantee’s name was James Trembel, could not be resorted to under a subsequent assessment in the name of John Turnbull. The reason that this could not be done was because there was no other circumstance of identity and the name John Turnbull had never been connected in any manner whatsoever to the title of the land. In <em>Vandermark v. Phillips, </em><a href="/pa/116/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="116 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="554327" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0199-01">116 Pa. 199</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.%20257" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="9 A. 257">9 A. 257</a>, this Court <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>held that an assessment on land situate in the City of Wilkes-Barre “Hughes, Thomas — vacant lot — s'old three years ago — bridge, . .,was too defective in form to constitute a valid basis for a sale for the non-payment of taxes. In <em>Woodside v. Wilson, </em><a href="/pa/32/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="32 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="986684" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0052-01">32 Pa. 52</a>, the number of the tract was improperly designated but it was shown that the land was known by the name of “Rockwell”, the same as that in which it was assessed, and that “Rockwell” was the name of a person in whose name it had theretofore been assessed and sold, and who had in fact been the owner and taxpayer for ten years. This Court held that the designation “Rockwell” was sufficient to afford a means of identification..</p>

The name Humphrey has been associated with the land since 1920. It is not asserted that the assessor, collector, or any other person having to do with the land did not know to what land the assessment and return referred. Nor is there any suggestion that any person was misled thereby. It does not appear from the record that there was any other 420 acres with which the name Humphrey had been in any way connected. The names “Wm. Humphreys”, “W. Humphreys heirs” and “Wm. Humphrey &amp; Son” referred to a known holder in the chain of title and furnished sufficient identification for purposes of assessment. The sales for delinquent taxes, based upon the assessments and returns, were valid.</p>

The' assessment was made in the name Horton although the subjacent and surface estate had long been severed. There was the further fact that the collector made return that he could not find <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>the property assessed.

It is sufficient in the circumstances of this case that the assessment made of a given number of acres of land without other descriptive identification than the name of a person known in connection with the title to the land, supports the sale of the land for taxes.</p>
