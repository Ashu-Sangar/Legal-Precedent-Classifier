Defendant Lee Ivory Johnson, alias Ivory Johnson, was indicted for the murder of Spencer L. Jackson, a fellow inmate at the Eastern State Peniten<a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>tiary. Jackson died from a stab wound of tbe heart inflicted by defendant between 8:10 and 8:15 a. m., September 24, 1947. Defendant and Jackson had been cell mates until about one week prior to the killing when they had been assigned separate cells by the authorities at defendant’s request.</p>
    <p id="b311-3" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[211,627,1151,1077]]]'>In his signed statement, defendant confessed that on the morning of the crime, as he started down to the Officer’s Mess to work, Spencer Jackson said he wanted to talk to him. He told defendant to keep away from him “or they were going to give it to me [defendant]”. Defendant went to Guard O’Brien, who was standing at the end of the block where defendant and Jackson met, and told him that “Spencer had something to tell him”. He said the deceased then spit in his face and a fight ensued. Officer O’Brien tried to break up the fight, ran outdoors into the cell yard and called for assistance. Defendant said he heard “someone holler back that Big Day [another inmate] was coming”. He saw an opened penknife laying in the corner, picked it up and stuck Spencer Jackson with it. Guard O’Brien testified that he saw the defendant pull the knife from his pocket and that Big Day was not in the corridor. Defendant denied having a knife but testified that other inmates had been carrying knives concealed on their persons. Defendant’s criminal record and prison record were both bad.</p>

When the verdict of the jury was being taken, the crier asked: “Do you find Lee Ivory Johnson, alias Ivory Johnson, charged with murder, guilty or not guilty.” The foreman replied: “Not guilty.” From this point the record reads as follows (until the proceedings on the following morning, hereinafter referred to) : “The Crier: Members of the jury, harken unto your verdict as the Court hath recorded it. You say you find the defendant at the bar of the court, Lee Ivory Johnson, alias Ivory Johnson, not guilty, and so say you all.” Thé Court: “I am satisfied, in my own opinion, that the jury made a mistake, <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>but, after all, it is their verdict, and we abide by it and find no fault with it.”</p>

The Assistant District Attorney said to the court that “intimation has been given to the District Attorney by several members of this jury that tried the case of the Commonwealth v. Lee Ivory Johnson, charged with the death of Spencer Jackson, that yesterday they rendered, not their full verdict, but an incomplete verdict . . . that the Jury were unanimous in their complete verdict, and they desire to offer their full verdict to the Court”. He then moved that the jury be polled and the jurors be requested to give their full verdict. Defense counsel objected. The objection was overruled. The court then said to the jury: “It has been brought to my attention . . . that your verdict as given yesterday — Not Guilty to the indictment for murder, was not fully expressed. . . . What was your real and complete verdict in this case?” The foreman answered: “It was guilty of voluntary manslaughter, but not of first degree murder.” The foreman further stated that the verdict was unanimous. The court then directed the polling of the jurors. All those who had been on the jury were then polled and they each answered that the defendant was “guilty of voluntary manslaughter”. Defendant’s counsel later in the colloquy said: “I would like to get on the record — the Jury was dismissed and left the Court room [yesterday].” The court: “I will agree that the Jury had been dismissed and most of them had left the Court room, when some appeared and stated they could not go home because they were worried sick about the verdict because it was not the correct verdict, not the complete verdict; . . . but most of them had gone. I will agree to that.” Defendant’s counsel then said: “There is another thing — the verdict of not guilty had been recorded.” The Court: “Eight; that is a legal proposition.” Defendant’s counsel stated: “When these jurors came to you then you summoned the defendant’s Counsel, <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>the defendant and the jurors back to the box this morning.” The Court: “After the trial was ended to all intents and purposes.” Defendant’s counsel: “They returned this morning.” The Court: “That is a legal proposition ; you are right about that. . . The court then imposed the following sentence: “I sentence you, Lee Ivory Johnson, to a term of not less than six years to not more than twelve years in the Eastern State Penitentiary, for voluntary manslaughter, commencing at the expiration of your present term.” To all these proceedings the defendant excepted and the Court said: “You may take an appeal.”</p>

The Assistant District Attorney likewise remained mute and passive. After the verdict was announced and recorded and the jury discharged from further consideration of this case, the Commonwealth’s opportunity to bring to light the hidden verdict was gone forever. The judge’s act in later reassembling those who had constituted the jury was in law a nullity.

Both the Federal and State Constitutions protect individuals from being deprived of life, liberty, and property without due process of law. To deprive a man of his liberty because of a certain criminal charge made against him, <em>after he had been formally acquitted of that charge by a jury </em>would be a violation of his constitutional rights. The “verdict” rendered on January 16, 1948 by the former members of the jury which had tried this defendant and had acquitted him was rendered by a body that was functus officio, and since as a body it was legally defunct, its action as a body was of no legal effect.</p>

It is not too much to say that if it were abolished, few influential culprits would be convicted, and that few friendless ones, pursued by powerful prosecutors, would escape conviction.
