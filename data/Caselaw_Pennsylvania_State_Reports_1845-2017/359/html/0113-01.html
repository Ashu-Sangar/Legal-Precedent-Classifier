L. 733, 24 PS § 581.1-581.16) which imposed a personal property tax upon the residents of first class school districts “. . . for public school purposes . . .”. There are two such districts in the State, viz., Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The plaintiff, a resident of the School District of Philadelphia, is a testamentary trustee and, as such, holds the title to intangible personal property which, by the terms of the Act, is expressly subjected to the tax. He challenges the validity of the Act on the ground that it is unconstitutional; there are no facts in dispute; and the matter is now before us on original jurisdiction. As a decision would automatically bind the School District of Pittsburgh, the latter and its Board of Public Education were, upon petition, permitted to intervene as parties defendant, make oral argument and file printed brief.</p>

In that case, there was involved a statute of Colorado which levied “ a Special School Tax” to maintain the public school system of the State. The Act had originated in the Senate and was attacked on the ground that it violated the State’s Constitution, cit. supra. In ruling that the Act was not a revenue measure and, therefore, not violative of the State Constitution in the particular indicated, the Supreme Court of Colorado held that “The levy and collection of taxes for the maintenance of a school system is not taxation for ‘defraying the expenses of the government’ . . . or . . . [the] ‘levying of taxes in the strict sense of the words,’ . . .”. The Court quoted from one of its own earlier decisions <em>(People v. Commissioners, </em><a href="/colo/12/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="12 Colo. 89" data-case-ids="2583961" data-case-paths="/colo/12/0089-01">12 Colo. 89</a>, 93, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20P.%20892" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="19 P. 892">19 Pac. 892</a>, 894) where, after having stated that “The doctrine is elementary that no act of the general assembly should be declared unconstitutional unless it is clearly and palpably so”, the Court stressed the peculiar pertinence bf the doctrine when treating with constitutional objections to statutes intended to promote and maintain public schools, saying in that connection that “In a matter so important as the maintenance of public schools, the courts should incline to uphold, rather than to defeat, the action of the officers charged with the execution of the laws”. The obligation so resting upon a court in the given circumstances can be no less in this State where “the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public schools” is a constitutional <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>mandate (Art. X, Sec. 1) laid directly upon the General Assembly whose agencies for the discharge of the duty are the various school districts. See <em>Wilson v. Philadelphia School District, </em><a href="/pa/328/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="328 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1179655" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0225-01">328 Pa. 225</a>,231,<a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2090" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="195 A. 90">195 A. 90</a>. It could be only in a very plain and indisputable case of constitutional impingement that the courts would be justified in thwarting the legislature in its chosen manner bf fulfilling its constitutional duty. Again, in <em>Evers v. Hudson, </em><a href="/mont/36/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="36 Mont. 135" data-case-ids="2321254" data-case-paths="/mont/36/0135-01">36 Mont. 135</a>, <a href="/mont/36/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="36 Mont. 135" data-case-ids="2321254" data-case-paths="/mont/36/0135-01">92 Pac. 462</a>, 466, an act imposing a tax to supply funds for current school expenses which had originated in the Senate was attacked as a violation of Art. Y, Sec. 32, of the Montana Constitution which provides that “All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives;” etc. The Supreme Court of the State rejected the contention on the authority of an earlier decision by the same Court <em>(State v. Bernheim, </em><a href="/mont/19/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="19 Mont. 512" data-case-ids="4371102" data-case-paths="/mont/19/0512-01">19 Mont. 512</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20P.%20441" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="49 P. 441">49 Pac. 441</a>) where it was held, in the language of Story, that “the provision of the Constitution n'ow under consideration must be confined in its meaning to bills to levy taxes in the strict sense of the words, and has not been understood to extend to bills for other purposes which may incidentally create revenue”. The Court further pointed out in the <em>Evers </em>case that “In any event, the tax is only upon the property bf the county, and the funds to be raised belong exclusively to the particular school for which they are raised. No part of the funds can by any possible means find its way into the state treasury, and the provisions of this section of the Constitution clearly refer to revenues of the state.” There are a number of other supporting decisions, but it is unnecessary to labor the point.</p>

As in the <em>Evers </em>case, supra, the impost is laid upon personal property of residents of designated school districts and the taxes collected will be used for public school purposes within such districts. The Act so stipulates. It is true that thq <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>described personal property is directly made taxable by the Act, but the annual levy, within the statutorily specified maximum and minimum limits, is a matter for the independent action of the respective boards of public education of the designated districts. If the tax be not so levied annually, there will be none, save upon the happening of one contingency, with which we are not now confronted (cf. <em>English v. Robinson Township School District, </em><a href="/pa/358/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="358 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="8844952" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0045-01">358 Pa. 45</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20803" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="55 A.2d 803">55 A. 2d 803</a>), viz., that the Act be judicially declared an unconstitutional delegation of the State’s taxing power: see Sec. 16(c) of the Act. In that event, and in that event only, the Act would impose a tax but, even then, specifically for public school purposes of the particular districts. For the reasons given, we are unanimous that the Act in question is not a bill for raising revenue within the meaning of Art. Ill, Sec. 14, of our State Constitution.</p>

Lowe, </em><a href="/f/226/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="226 F. 135" data-case-ids="6737281" data-case-paths="/f/226/0135-01">226 Fed. 135</a> (D. C. S. D. N. Y.), involved the Federal Cotton Futures Act which, in an effort to prevent cotton futures contracts, imposed a punitive tax. The question whether the Act, which had originated in the Senate, was a revenue measure within the meaning of Art. I, Sec. 7, of the Federal Constitution was not before the court for decision. As Judge Hough states at p. 137, he was “saved from inquiry whether the Cotton Futures Act is a ‘bill for raising revenue’ by the agreement of counsel . . .” that the Act was “a revenue bill within the constitutional meaning”. However, in passing, Judge Hough gave it as his view “that nothing was further from the intent or desire of the lawmakers than the production of revenue, . . .”. Moreover, the taxes assessed were payable into the general funds of the United States in the Treasury and there utilizable for governmental purposes generally. The latter circumstance alone plainly differentiates the <em>Hubbard </em>case from the present. In <em>Wofford Oil Co. v. Smith, </em><a href="/f/263/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="263 F. 396" data-case-ids="3941768" data-case-paths="/f/263/0396-01">263 Fed. 396</a> (D. C.

True enough, the Act was also attacked on the ground that it proceeded from a bill to raise revenue which had been introduced in the State Senate in violation of Sec. 70 of the Constitution of Alabama; and, by way of obiter dictum, the court went on so to hold. Nonetheless, the conclusion in such regard is readily explainable. As the court there found, “90 per cent, of all the funds raised and paid into the state treasury is left free from the cost incident to inspection, and obviously is to be used by the state for general purposes”. Again, <em>In Re Opinions of the </em>Justices190 So. 824, the Supreme Court of Alabama gave the State Senate an advisory opinion that a pending bill, intended to amend the State Sales Tax Act, was a revenue bill within the meaning of Sec. 70 ¡of the Alabama Constitution. By the titles to both the original Act and the proposed amendment, their purpose was to provide “for the general revenue of the State of Alabama” which, of course, was sufficient to make the bill one to raise revenue in the constitutional sense.</p>

Ill, Sec. 14, of- the State Constitution. The clause concerning the place of origin of a bill for raising revenue is a procedural directive and not a substantive interdict. The legal distinction between directory and mandatory laws is as applicable to fundamental as it is to statutory law: <em>Armstrong v. King, </em><a href="/pa/281/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="281 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="1086984" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0207-01">281 Pa. 207</a>, 216, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.%20263" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="126 A. 263">126 A. 263</a>. The provision in question could not reasonably be deemed other than directory. It is not a denial of the Senate’s power as a coordinate and essential branch of the legislature. Indeed, a further clause of the same Article and Section expressly confirms the Senate’s own important function <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>and discretion in the due enactment of revenue legislation. Specifically, “the Senate may propose amendments as in other bills”: Art. Ill, Sec. 14. In pursuance of its appropriate power in such regard, the Senate may amend a House revenue bill even to the extent of. striking out everything following the enacting clause and substituting therefor a bill taf its own creation. It follows, therefore, that a revenue statute, once enacted, is not inherently defective simply because the bill originated in the Senate and was passed first by that body. And, inasmuch as the particular constitutional provision is merely directory, any failure to follow it in practice must be objected to timely. If that is done, as on a point fof order, the objection would, of course, be efficient to block the passage of the measure. The members of the legislature are to be presumed to intend due respect for all constitutional requirements concerning the enactment of statutes. Such provisions, however, are mandatory only “So far as the duty and the consciences of the members of the legislature are involved . . .”: <em>Kilgore v.

In the <em>Kilgore </em>case, supra, this Court said at p. 412 that “In regard to the passage of the law and the alleged disregard of. the forms of legislation required by the constitution, . . . <em>the subject is not within the pale of judicial inquiry”. </em>(Emphasis supplied.) The same sentiment was voiced by Mr. Chief Justice White in <em>Rainey v. United States, </em><a href="/us/232/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="232 U.S. 310" data-case-ids="3672156" data-case-paths="/us/232/0310-01">232 U. S. 310</a>, where, in approving the ruling of a lower court that the amendment there in question was “not void as a bill for <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>raising revenue originating in the Senate and not in the House of Representatives”, the learned Chief Justice cautioned that the court was not “intimating that there is judicial power after an act 'of Congress has been duly promulgated to inquire in which House it originated . . . It so happens that there is no decision in this State on the particular constitutional provision now under consideration. Sutherland, in his work on <em>Statutory Construction </em>(3rd Ed.), Vol. 1, § 806, observes that “The question of origin is not litigated frequently”. The reason for that, undoubtedly, is that in many States, as in Pennsylvania, after the enrollment of a duly signed and certified enactment, the courts will not go behind the face of the statute in order to search out and act upon a' possible rioncompliance, during its passage, with a purely procedural direction. <em>Kilgore v. Magee, </em><a href="/pa/85/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="85 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="440458" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0401-01">supra,</a> is in point by close analogy. It was there held (p. 412) that “. . . when a law has been passed and approved and certified in due form, it is no part of the duty of the judiciary to go behind the law as duly certified to inquire into the observance of form in its passage”. And in <em>Rainey v. United States, </em>supra, at p. 317, the Supreme Court spoke to like effect that “Having become an enrolled and duly authenticated Act of Congress, it is not for this Court to determine whether the amendment was or was not outside the purposes of the original bill”.</p>

The 1893 Act was assailed on the ground that it was unconstitutional for a number of reasons, <em>inter alia, </em>that notice of the contemplated passage of the Act (being local or special) had not been published and exhibited as required by Art. Ill, Sec. 8, of the Constitution. This court, by a vote of four to three (see p. 547), held that the abolishing Act of 1893 was unconstitutional as viola<a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>tive of certain constitutional provisions (see opinion at p. 555 et seq.) but rejected the contentibn that the Act offended against Art. Ill, Sec. 8, saying in that connection (p. 568), — “As to the averment, that the act also violates section 8, article 3, because notice of the proposed legislative action was not published in Philadelphia at least thirty days before the introduction of the bill, we can only say, it is nbt our duty to go behind the law to inquire whether all the precedent formalities have in fact been complied with. The evidence that notice has been published is to be exhibited to the general assembly ; it is not directed to be entered on the journals. The law before us is certified by both houses and approved by the governor. We must presume the requirement as to notice was complied with; to this effect are all the authorities of numerous adjudicated cases on the same question.” Obviously, on that point, this Court was unanimous, for the three dissenters were of the opinion (see dissents p. 568 et seq.) that the Act did not violate any provision of the Constitution.</p>

Ill, Sec. 14, of the Constitution. This contention is based upon the fact that the Bep'ort of the Committee of Conference on the bill (Printer’s No.-624) shows that the Act was Senate Bill No. 852; and a copy of the conference report, with the Act appended, was placed in the record in this case by stipulation of counsel. The information thus supplied is entirely <em>dehors </em>the Act which, as enrolled, bears no indication whatsoever of the place of its legislative origin. It is manifest, therefore, that, in order to show that Act No. 319 was introduced in the General Assembly as a Senate bill, evidence <em>aliunde </em>is necessary for which purpose legislative journals, records and reports are not competent.

In <em>Field v. Clark, </em>the case above cited by the Supreme Court, it had been stated (p. 680), —“We are of opinion, for the reasons stated, that it is not competent for the appellants tb show, from the journals of either house, from the reports of committees or from other documents printed by authority of Congress, that the enrolled bill designated H.

The provision is designed to obviate purely accidental double taxation under the same Act and does not make for a want of uniformity. The scheme of equitable adjustment 'of a tax in the given circumstances is <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>not new to the law of this State. The amendment of June 19, 1939, P. L. 413, of the Personal Property Tax Act of June 17,1913, P. L. 507, 72 PS § 4821, provided that, where personal property was held by two or more persons as trustees and such trustees resided in different counties, there should be paid to each county such pbrtion of the tax as the number of trustees domiciled in a taxing county bore to the total number of trustees. That provision was upheld by this Court in <em>Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/337/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="337 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1197341" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0034-01">337 Pa. 34</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20A.2d%20547" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="10 A.2d 547">10 A. 2d 547</a>. In speaking for this Court in that case, Mr. Justice Linn found no constitutional objection to the provision and further said (p. 40) in justification thereof, — “For the purpose of distributing the proceeds of such a tax among the counties for whose benefit the state imposed the tax, their classification according to the respective residences of do-trustees is not unreasonable. The court may not require the legislature, in making such classification, to disregard the legal protection afforded by a county to a. resident co-trustee who is part holder of the legal title of the subject of taxation: [citing cases].” Under Sec. 3(d) of the Act here in question, the same trust or jointly ¡owned property will pay totally the equivalent of one school district tax under the Act of 1947, supra.

See Story, <em>Constitution, </em>Fifth Ed., Vol. 1, Sec. 874 et seq.; Cooley, <em>Constitutional Limitations, </em>Eighth Ed., Vol. 1, pp. 267-268; Sutherland, <em>Statutory Construction, </em>3rd Ed., Vol. 1, Sec. 806.

I, Sec. 7, Cl. 1, <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>of the Federal Constitution. At that time (1787) and thereafter until the adoption (in 1913) of the Seventeenth Amendment providing for the direct election of Senators, the members of the United States Senate were elected for each State by the joint vote of both houses of the legislature of the respective State and, hence, were removed from the people. The provision was first imported into a Constitution of this State in 1790. That was evidently done as a conforming gesture to the similar requirement of the Federal Constitution of three years before, for all members of the legislature have been elected in Pennsylvania by a direct vote of the people since our first Constitution of 1776. Incidentally, that Constitution, which was formulated in a convention presided over by Franklin, did not follow the English pattern by specifying a house of origin for revenue-raising bills for the obviously sufficient reason that, under the Constitution of 1776, Pennsylvania had a unicameral legislature,— the first in America.</p>
