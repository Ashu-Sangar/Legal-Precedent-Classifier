L. 177.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Act of 1915 is an Escheat Act. As amended, it provides that bank deposits which have not been increased or decreased, nor credited with interest at the request of the depositor for a period of ten successive years, shall be escheated to the Commonwealth. Reports of such deposits are required to be made by the banks, and a procedure by which the Commonwealth may recover the money is established. Proceedings under this Act, if successfully pursued, result in a decree that the money has escheated and shall be paid to the State Treasurer for the use of the Commonwealth, thereby foreclosing any claim on the part of the depositor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Act of May 16, 1919, P. L. 177, as amended, is quite different; it establishes an alternative procedure for the taking over of unclaimed deposits by the State. It provides “That whenever any . . . bank, national bank, . . . shall hold or be possessed of any items of money or property which are or shall be made escheatable by any act of the General Assembly, the Auditor General may and shall, after such items have been reported to or otherwise ascertained by him, and after notice and advertisement of such items shall have been given and made as required by the provisions of the act under which such items are escheatable, . . . suggest to the Attorney General that, instead of proceeding for the escheat of such items . . . the Attorney General apply by petition to the proper court for an order upon the . . . bank, national <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>bank, . . . holding or possessed of snch items of money or property, directing the payment of the same into the State Treasury to the credit of the Commonwealth, . . . all amounts and proceeds so paid to be subject to being refunded as hereinafter provided. . . The Act then provides that the Attorney General shall thereupon file such a petition, and the court, if the facts warrant, shall order the unclaimed money to be paid into the State Treasury to the credit of the Commonwealth, and, upon such payment being made in compliance with the court’s order, the bank shall be relieved from all liability for the money so paid. By section 504 of the Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, as amended by the Act of June 6,1939, P. L. 261, section 2, it is provided that the owner of any money thus paid into the State Treasury, or his legal representatives, may at any time apply to the Board of Finance and Revenue for a refund thereof, and, upon satisfactory proof of ownership, the money shall be paid to him with interest at the rate of two per centum per annum from the time of the payment into the State Treasury to the time of such refund.</p>
    <p id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[193,1513,1150,371]]]'>It is thus immediately obvious that the two Acts, that of 1915 and that of 1919, have little in common.

Its validity is challenged on the ground that it impairs the obligation of the contract between the bank and the depositor. This contention is wholly without merit; a similar charge was made against the far more drastic Act of 1915 and rejected in <em>Germantown Trust Company v. Powell, </em><a href="/pa/265/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="265 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="1051941" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0071-01">265 Pa. 71</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.%20441" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="108 A. 441">108 A. 441</a>. The Court there pointed out (pp. 77, 78, A. p. 443) that “The agreement of the bank or depositary . . . <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>is merely to keep the money of the depositor until it is demanded by the owner, or his duly authorized representatives. It agrees to pay on demand. When demand is made the contractual relation ceases, there being no vested right to continue the contract in force thereafter, or for any definite time. ... A statute of escheat, in effect, simply provides for a termination of the contract of deposit, at the instance of the Commonwealth and by virtue of its sovereign power, where there are no heirs to claim the property, after the death of the owner, or after expiration of such reasonable time as may be fixed by law to raise a presumption of death. . . . The right of escheat has been recognized under the English law from the earliest times and has also been the subject of continuous statutory regulation in Pennsylvania from colonial days, . . .; the validity of these acts has been sustained without suggestion that their enforcement violates any contract between the owner of the property and the person or institution in whose hands the property was deposited or placed for keeping.” Certainly if the actual escheat of the deposit does not impair the obligation of a contract the much milder operation of merely taking custodial possession of the money subject to its being returnable to the owner on demand cannot be considered a violation of the constitutional provision: <em>Provident Institution for Savings v.

It may be questioned whether such option is in fact given in the case of proceedings under the Act of 1919 <em>toithout escheat, </em>since the particular clause which provides that publication is not to be considered a condition precedent to the institution or <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>prosecution of any action is expressly made applicable only to actions for the <em>escheat </em>of the unclaimed moneys.

In dealing with a substantially similar statute this Court said, in <em>Commonwealth v. Dollar Savings Bank, </em><a href="/pa/259/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="259 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1038281" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0138-01">259 Pa. 138</a>, 146, 147, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20A.%20569" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="102 A. 569">102 A. 569</a>, 572, that . . since the proceedings on the part of the State to obtain possession of these deposits were not instituted for the purpose of declaring an escheat or of passing the property in question over to another, in short, were not in antagonism to the owners, but for their benefit, there exists no absolute necessity for any form of notice to such owners, as the latter are presumed to know that, after expiration of the thirty-year period, the Commonwealth, at any time, may take over the custody of their deposits in the manner provided by the act dealing with the subject in <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>hand.” Since the transfer here of the moneys is simply a change of custody and not a confiscation or an ultimate adjudication involving title, and since the deposits may be reclaimed at any time, the rights of the owners are in nowise affected; in such a situation the statute itself, followed by the taking over of the funds upon filing of the petition, is sufficient notice: <em>Brooklyn Borough Gas Co. v.

All persons having property located within a state and subject to its dominion must take note of its statutes affecting the control or disposition of such property and of the procedure which they set up for those purposes. . . . The statutory procedure, so far as it affects depositors, is in the nature of a proceeding in rem, in the course of which property, against which a claim is asserted, is seized or sequestered, and held subject to the appearance and presentation of claims by all those who assert an adverse interest in it. In all such proceedings the seizure of the property is in itself a form of notice of the claim asserted, to those who may claim an interest in the property. . . . The mere fact that the state or its authorities acquire possession or control of property as a preliminary step to the judicial determination of asserted rights in the property is not a denial of due process.”: <em>Anderson National Bank v.

In considering this question we start with the proposition that, generally speaking, there is no constitutional objection to extending the provisions of a state statute to cover national banks. Although national banks are instrumentalities of the federal government and used by it to conduct some of its important operations, “All their contracts are governed and construed by State laws. Their acquisition and transfer of property, their right to collect their debts, and their liability to be sued for debts, are all based on State law. It is only when the State law incapacitates the banks from discharging their duties to the government that it becomes unconstitutional”: <em>National Bank v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/us/76/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="76 U.S. 353" data-case-ids="3441992" data-case-paths="/us/76/0353-01">76 U. S. 353</a>, 362. National banks “are subject to State legislation, except where such legislation is in conflict with some act of Congress, or where it tends to impair or destroy the utility of such banks, as agents or instrumentalities of the United States, or interferes with the purposes of their creation”: <em>Waite v. Dowley, </em><a href="/us/94/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="94 U.S. 527" data-case-ids="5643469" data-case-paths="/us/94/0527-01">94 U. S. 527</a>, 533. It is only where the attempt by a State statute to define the duties or control the conduct of the affairs of national banks “expressly conflicts with the laAvs of the United States, and either frustrates the purpose of the national legislation or impairs the efficiency of these agencies of the Federal government to discharge the duties for the performance of which they were created”, that such an act is in-A7alid. “It is certain, that in so far as not repugnant to acts of Congress, the contracts and dealings of national banks are left subject to the state law”: <em>Davis v.

The success of almost all commercial banks depends upon their ability to obtain loans from depositors, and these might well hesitate to subject their funds to possible confiscation.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Such a reason for invalidation has obviously no application to a statute which, as the one here under consideration, involves no confiscation or transfer of title from the depositor to the Commonwealth, no escheat by reason of mere dormancy of the bank account, and therefore no danger of causing depositors to refrain from making deposits in national banks, especially in view of the fact that they may at any time secure a return of their deposits from the State which meanwhile bear interest and are in the hands of the safest-possible custodian. <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>This distinguishing feature became the basis of the decision, contrary to that in the <em>San Jose </em>case, in <em>Anderson National Bank v.

The Supreme Court of the United States held that this statute did not conflict with the national banking laws and that it was not an unconstitutional interference by the State with national banks as instrumentalities of the federal government. The court said (p. 241) that “it is within the constitutional power of the state to protect the interests of depositors from the risks which attend long neglected accounts, by taking them into custody when they have been inactive so long as to be presumptively abandoned.” The Court pointed out (pp. 250, 251, 252) that the decision in the <em>San Jose </em>case “turned rather on the effect of the state statute in altering the contracts of deposit in a manner considered so unusual and so harsh in its application to depositors as to deter them from placing or keeping their funds in national banks. ... It will be noted that the statute required no proof <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>that the forfeited accounts had been in fact abandoned, . . . Upon mere proof of dormancy for the prescribed period, the statute declared the accounts to be es-cheated to the state. . . . Here there is no escheat or forfeiture by reason of dormancy. Dormancy without more is made the statutory ground for the state’s taking inactive bank accounts into its custody, the state assuming the bank’s obligation to the depositors. . . . This is not confiscation or even an attempted deprivation of property. Escheat or forfeiture to the state may follow, but only on proof of abandonment in fact. We cannot say that the protective custody of long inactive bank accounts, for which the Kentucky statute provides, and which in many circumstances may operate for the benefit and security of depositors, . . . will deter them from placing their funds in national banks in that state.”</p>

All that the Commonwealth here seeks is to have the moneys or property paid into the State Treasury to its credit, there to be held for the benefit of the owners or claimants entitled thereto.
