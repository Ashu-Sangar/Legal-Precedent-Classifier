Appellant averred in the petition that the property was owned by its ward and George L. Prichard, her husband, as tenants by the entireties and that it was to “the best interests of the estate” to have the sale allowed. Appellee did not object to this petition. An ap<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>propriate decree was entered forthwith authorizing the sale of “the interest of Hilda Carroll Prichard as tenants by the entireties.”</p>

Prichard claimed the right to exclusive ownership, control and management of one-half the net proceeds of sale.” Appellee filed an answer thereto averring that he believed “he was entitled to one-half of the proceeds thereof else he would not and could not have agreed to said sale, since the anticipated funds to be derived therefrom were needed by him to assist him in maintaining his wife in the institution in which she was required to be and in supporting his four minor children who range in ages from six years to 15 years.” On November 28, 1947, the court modified its prior decree and authorized and directed appellant to agree with appellee to sell the real estate and “to divide the net proceeds of said sale — one-half to the guardian and one-half to the said George L. Prichard . . .” This appeal is from the decree of the court <em>en banc </em>dismissing appellant’s exceptions.</p>

The court and its officers represent the incapacitated ward in all dealings with regard to property and family, the ward, however, remaining the equitable owner of the property.</p>

Such a result is predicated on an agreement, and an estate by entirety with the incidents of survivorship may always be destroyed by agreement of the parties.” If neither party were under a disability, the property held by the entireties could have been sold, the incidents attaching to said estate destroyed and the proceeds of sale divided equally between them. The guardian may be authorized by the court to hold all of the proceeds of the sale by agreement with the other spouse. The court, possessed of all powers which the incompetent could have exercised, may likewise direct that the entireties estate be terminated and the guardian hold one-half the net proceeds for her.</p>

If, on the other hand, she predeceases him, the entire fund passes to his hands. For all practical purposes, the fund would be, therefore, immobilized and could not be used for the benefit of either the ward or her family. Here, the husband needs financial assistance for food, clothing and shelter for himself and their four children. If the court were without power to terminate an estate by the entireties, on behalf of the ward, great hardship would be visited upon all concerned. That power, however, does exist and the court below properly directed termination of the estate and an equal division thereof.</p>
