The ordinance, enacted pursuant to the Act of 1931, P. L. 932, Section 2601, as amended, 53 PS Section 12198-2601,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

A preliminary injunction was awarded. An answer was filed and a hearing held.

Pursuant to this enabling legislation, Council of the City of Meadville, appellee, duly enacted an ordinance and an amendment thereto which provided: “. . . no person or persons, firm or corporation, shall at any time have in their or its possession within the City of Meadville, any mechanical device, machine or apparatus whatsoever, for the playing of games and amusements, commonly known as ‘pin ball’ machines, upon which baseball, football, and <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>other games are played, or for the playing of music, commonly known as ‘juke boxes’, operated through the insertion of a coin or any other metal disc, slug or token, without first having procured a license therefor and thereafter exhibiting a seal thereon, as hereinafter provided.” The ordinance further provided: “. . . no such license shall be issued until an annual fee therefor shall have been paid to the City Clerk as follows: For ‘pin ball’ machines $25.00 and for ‘juke boxes’ $50.00 for each and every device so installed and used under the terms of this ordinance, which amount, so paid shall cover such license fee to and including December 31st of each year.”</p>
    <p id="b574-4" data-blocks='[["BL_574.5",574,[240,1025,1149,1133]]]'>Appellant corporation, organized and associated for the benefit and protection of owners of phonograph and music boxes in Northwestern Pennsylvania, filed this bill in equity to enjoin, preliminarily until hearing and permanently thereafter, enforcement of the ordinance as amended, asserting the same to be beyond the power of the city. The answer filed, after a preliminary injunction was awarded, asserted that the ordinance represented “a valid and legal exercise of the powers of the defendant (appellee) as a municipality of the third class. . . At a hearing on the matter, it was stipulated that “the City is not contending nor does it here assert that the Ordinances in question are passed under police power but that said Ordinances were enacted by the City of Meadville solely for revenue purposes and that if said Ordinances cannot be sustained as a revenue measure they may be considered null and void”. Thereafter, the chancellor entered a decree <em>nisi </em>dismissing the bill and dissolving the preliminary injunction. This appeal is from the decree of the court <em>en banc </em>dismissing appellant’s exceptions thereto.</p>

Appellee city contends that although the business of operating <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>juke boxes or pin ball machines is not specifically mentioned in the statute “the general tenor of Section 2601 is such that it may reasonably be construed as including within its scope the conducting of any kind of entertainment as a profitable business enterprise, and this may properly be applied to the business of operating music boxes”. It is said that the fee or tax imposed is upon the business privilege of possessing and operating the boxes. However, at the hearing, Gr. S. Maxwell, City Clerk for the City of Meadville, was asked: “Q. The City has not been administering this license so that the payment on one annual fee of $50.00 would authorize the possession of more than one machine? A. That is right. Court: In other words they were licensing the machine instead of the business.” It is also asserted that inasmuch as appellant or its associated members have not proven irreparable damage, the injunction was properly dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b575-4" data-blocks='[["BL_575.5",575,[173,1305,1148,535]]]'>Whether the Act of 1931, as amended, supra, empowers the City of Meadville to enact the challenged ordinance should not have been determined by either the chancellor or the court below. The record does not establish any right in appellant to maintain this bill. The pleadings do not reveal, nor does the record establish, that appellant is in any way subject to the terms of the ordinance. It is not subject to any penalty for neither it nor its members possess pin ball machines or juke boxes within the meaning of the taxing ordinance.</p>

These averments are insufficient to establish appellant’s right to maintain the instant action.</p>
