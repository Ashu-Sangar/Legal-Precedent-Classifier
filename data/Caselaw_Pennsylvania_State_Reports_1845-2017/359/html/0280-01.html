These restrictions provided that “there shall not be at any time hereafter erected or used on the above described lot of ground or on any part or parts thereof any stable, public garage, or any building for manufacturing purposes or offensive occupations; and that the character of buildings to be erected thereon shall be limited exclusively to private dwellings, private dwellings with private garages, apartment house or apartment hotel, which shall be in style and nature suitable and in conformity with the surrounding neighborhood”.</p>

Plaintiffs have succeeded to the ownership of this property. At the time of the creation of the restrictions in the deed to Pennington, the entire block between 47th and 48th Streets and between Spruce and Pine Streets was virgin land and the object of the restrictions was obviously to preserve it for residential purposes and to prevent industrial and commercial encroachments thereon. What happened, however, was that in 1927, Siegel, who had meanwhile become the owner of the entire block, intending, but never carrying out the intention, to build a large apartment house thereon enclosing a garage under the central court, built merely the garage. The main portion of this garage is in the center of the block, rising one story above the ground with an underground floor for the storage of cars; it fronts 120 feet on the north side of Pine Street <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>with a 95 foot entrance way; immediately within is a vestibule extending to the north for about 85 feet and then the garage proper widens out to 263 feet (partly overlapping the Price servient tract) and extends further north 161 feet, the portion contained in the Siegel servient tract covering over 40 percent thereof; the garage has a capacity of over 400 cars and enclosed within its structure are an antique shop toward the Spruce Street side, and a tailor shop, a gift shop and a delicatessen store on the Pine Street front.</p>

On the other hand, equity will <em>not </em>enforce a restriction if the nature of the neighborhood changes has been such as to make it impossible to accomplish the objects for which it was designed, even though such changes may have resulted from circumstances over which neither of the parties had any control. It being a general policy of the law that land shall not be burdened with permanent or long-continued restrictions which have ceased to be of any advantage, equity will not, in such cases, prohibit or retard improvements simply to enforce the literal observance of a condition or covenant. Nor will equity grant injunctive relief if the enforcement of a restriction would make the land unfit or unprofitable for use and development, or result in a far greater hardship to the servient than a benefit to the dominant tenement.

Undoubtedly the original purpose of Siegel in imposing the restrictions on the block west of 47th Street was for the benefit of the apartment house which he was then engaged in erecting on the east side of that street, — to preserve for it the physical and aesthetic advantages accruing from the proximity of residential rather than commercial structures. But that purpose has been almost completely frustrated; not only has three-quarters of the block been covered by the Garden Court Plaza, the extremely large garage, the gasoline station, and several stores to which a number are about to be added on the Price servient tract, but it happens that the stores which defendant now proposes to erect are in a portion of the block by which plaintiffs are, from a physical standpoint, least adversely affected.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Spruce Street is a wide thoroughfare with a double line of trolley tracks and with considerable traffic as a through highway; the proposed stores along its southern side will scarcely, if at all, effect any change in existing conditions of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, nor, as already stated, will they extend down 47th Street to any point directly opposite, the dominant tenement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> That there would be any substantial benefit to plaintiffs, therefore, in the enforcement of the restriction is extremely doubtful, whereas the hardship to defendant would be enormous because the place where the stores <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>are to be erected is utterly unfit for residential purposes, — certainly for residences of the type existing in some of the surrounding blocks; the space between the south house line on Spruce Street and the north wall of the garage is but 85 feet, which would hardly permit of desirable residences being erected there; there would be no adequate room for yards, much less lawns or other open spaces; moreover, any such houses would be flanked by the gasoline station and the stores now permitted to be built on the Spruce Street frontage of the Price servient tract. The portion of the block in question being unmarketable, therefore, for residential development, its entire value would be lost to defendant if he could not use it for the only purpose for which it is now adapted. In short, the Court is of opinion that, if the covenant were to be specifically enforced, there would be such a gross disproportion between any possible benefit that would accrue to plaintiffs and the harm that would certainly be done to defendant, that equity, in accordance with the principles previously stated, should not, under the circumstances, grant the injunctive relief which plaintiffs seek.</p>
