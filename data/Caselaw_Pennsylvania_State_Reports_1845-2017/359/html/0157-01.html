The preliminary injunction was granted and thereafter an answer was filed asserting that (1) the grant of a right of way to appellants’ predecessor in title did not describe or in any way determine the location of the right of Avay, and (2) assuming the location to have been sufficiently described, appellants’ user imposed a burden upon the servient estate greatly in excess of that contemplated by the parties to the grant. This appeal is from a decree holding that the asserted right of way had never been clearly defined and dismissing the bill.</p>

This business was active until 1932. During 1928 to 1932 business invitees of the Deans used the Heffner property as a means of ingress and egress. During this period use of the road was principally by horse and wagon, with an occasional automobile. Thereafter the property was used less frequently and for the purpose of securing feed and caring for livestock. On or about July 10,1946, one of appellees informed appellants that the road could not be used for <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>the hauling of coal. Thereafter, on August 5, construction of a fence was begun and gates IS feet wide were placed at either end of the road. The gates were locked and a key thereto was left at the residence of Y. B. Dean. On August 13, 1946, appellants filed the present bill in equity and secured a preliminary injunction restraining appellees from interfering with appellants’ use of the right of way. The preliminary injunction was continued pending final hearing on October 28, 1946. This appeal is from the decree of the court <em>en banc </em>dismissing appellants’ exceptions to the decree of the chancellor dismissing the bill and dissolving the preliminary injunction.</p>

Appellants contend that (1) the reservation in the 1935 deed to appellees of “a right of way for a driveway forty feet (40) wide, as now used from Center Street, Northeastward across said lands to and through-under the trestle of the Cobaugh Colliery Company branch railroad, for use in reaching lands at and East of said branch railroad right of way” sufficiently locates the easement; (2) the land having been used for commercial purposes at the time of the grant, the present user does not unreasonably burden the servient estate; and (3) the locking of the gates across the right of way constituted an unreasonable interference with appellants’ right of user.</p>

The Court, quoting from TT Am. Jur., Easements, section 86, said (p. 17): “ ‘. . . if an easement is granted in general terms which do not fix its location, the owner of the servient estate has the right, in the first instance, to designate the location of such easement. This right, however, must be exercised in a reasonable manner with due regard to the rights of the owner of the easement ... if the owner of the servient estate does not designate the location, the person entitled to an easement may select a suitable route, taking into consideration the interest and convenience of the owner of the land over which the easement passes.’ ” The deed from Ransbottom, trustee of the Hawthorn Pottery Company, the common owner of both tracts, to appellees in 1935, designating a driveway forty feet in width for the use of land presently owned by appellants, constituted a recognition of the location of the right of way. See <em>Ozehoski v. Scranton Water Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/157/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="157 Pa.

The words <em>“as now used” </em>refer to the location of the easement and not to the manner of use. In <em>Crosier v.

E. 607</a>, it was held that the words “as now used” related to the location of a right of way and not to the type of vehicle used over the right of way. In these circumstances the court below erred in holding that the right of way was not clearly defined and that there was no information as to its location on appellees’ land. It is also immaterial that at no time was it described in any grant as being an open road.</p>

Here, however, the purpose remains the same, namely, commercial. The hauling of material for business purposes to and from the dominant estate remains the use to which the servient estate is subjected. It cannot be said that because motor vehicles were rarely used at the creation of the right of way that it was within the contemplation of the parties not to permit the dominant estate to use improved means of travel. Where, as here, the grant of the easement is unrestricted, the grantee is given such rights as are necessary for the reasonable and proper enjoyment of the thing granted: <em>Hammond v.
