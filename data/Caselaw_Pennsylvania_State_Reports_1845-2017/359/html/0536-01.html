L. 905, 75 PS 233, prohibits any person from authorizing or permitting a motor vehicle owned by him to be operated by any person who has no legal right to do so. Section 615 of Art. VI of the Code, as amended, provides that the Secretary of Revenue <em>may </em>suspend an operator’s license where, inter alia, “. . . such person has committed any violation of the motor vehicle <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>laws. ...” Section 616 of the Code provides for an appeal to the court of common pleas.
