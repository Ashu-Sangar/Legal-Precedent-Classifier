Six gasoline and diesel fuel tanks having a capacity of 2000 gallons each were to be installed underground and six electric pumps on three separate islands to be. used for drawing off the gasoline.

The entire district west of North Mount Vernon Avenue extending west four blocks to Oakland Avenue and north of West Main Street, extending three blocks to Gilmore Street, is exclusively residential and composed of single family dwellings with the following exceptions: St. Mary’s Catholic Church and rectory in the third block to the north, and several homes which have in recent years been divided into apartments.

It is estimated that more than 160 vehicles will drive in and out of the proposed station per day. At least one-third of the children attending St. Mary’s School, and a large proportion of those attending the public elementary school south of West Main Street, must cross at the intersection of Main Street and Mount Vernon Avenue.</p>

It concluded that there was doubt whether the value of surrounding properties would depreciate by reason of the <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>erection and operation of the proposed service station; that “Dust, dirt, noise, smoke, lights, odors and fumes from the nearby garages and public gasoline filling service stations reach and permeate the residences on both sides of Mt. Yernon Avenue for one block north and south of the intersection”; that the quiet and cleanliness of the residential properties has already been substantially interfered with; that the district is “in a transitory stage and slowly becoming commercialized”; and, that the proposed station could be operated without materially or substantially increasing existing dangers to health and safety. It stated as a matter of law that: “The district in question can no longer be classified as a predominantly residential district because its business enterprises have so far invaded the district as to substantially interfere with its quiet and cleanliness”; that “The operation of a public drive-in, gasoline filling and service station on the proposed site will not constitute a nuisance in fact”; and, dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill.

There is no evidence that there has been any invasion of this exclusively residential district by commercial interests. There has been no change as regards its exclusive residential nature. Commercial interests and the railroad referred to by the court <em>en bane </em>have been in the district for many years. Nevertheless, Gilmore Addition remained exclusively residential. The record conclusively establishes that the portion of the K-Y Building wherein are located the several stores has been for many years “the line, the business line, between the business and residential district”. That no commercial enterprise has, prior to appellees’ venture, undertaken to come into the neighborhood east of West Main Street and north of Mount Yernon Avenue is of itself strong evidence of its true character.</p>

Imposition of the annoyances and dangers attendant upon construction and operation of the station <em>(Mitchell v. Guaranty Corporation, </em>supra, 366) cannot be justified by asserting a possible previous annoyance. Particularly is <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>this true, where, as here, the neighborhood continued in fact exclusively residential throughout the entire period of the asserted prior annoyance. There is credible testimony to support the chancellor’s finding that real estate values would be decreased immediately as a result of the intrusion of a gasoline station.</p>
    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[211,640,1150,971]]]'>What appellee in effect suggests, and what the court <em>en banc </em>has done, is to declare a neighborhood to be in a transitional stage because not far away there are commercial enterprises, the operation of which would be prevented in an exclusively residential district. To establish that principle as one of law will negative the existence of lines of demarcation dividing commercial, residential and exclusively residential districts. Commercial areas would be moved forward without restraint, except that equitable relief might be afforded if the given business were shown to constitute a nuisance in fact. Fringe areas would advance so that block after block would steadily succumb to inroads of industrial enterprises. The learned chancellor aptly said: “. . . the mere fact that there are gasoline stations and other sources of discomfort outside the district not far from its eastern boundary cannot entitle (appellees) to violate the boundary and add to the discomfort from within.”</p>

Boundaries there must be, which divide commercial from residential and residential from exclusively residential. Exclusively residential districts are not to be denied the benefit of principles of law and equity appertaining thereto because bordered by or proximate to districts termed commercial. The site of the proposed gasoline filling and service station is in an exclusively residential district not in a transitional stage.
