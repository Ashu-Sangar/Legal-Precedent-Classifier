The trust was designed to provide Lillian Seixas (now Lewis) with monthly payments of $225 “for and during the full term of her natural life” out of income from the trust estate. The corpus of the trust, as originally deposited with the trustees upon the execution and delivery of the deed of trust, consisted of 3,000 shares of United Gas Improvement Company common stock. The motive for the creation of the trust was the settlor’s desire to procure for his son, Carl J. Wolters, a complete release by Lillian Seixas from any and all claims and demands on her part against Carl and “more particularly any claim . . . whatsoever arising out of an alleged promise to marry or agreement of contract in the nature thereof between the said Carl A.

The trust agreement reserved to the settlor a power of appointment, after the death of Lillian Seixas, with respect to the residual trust principal and, in default of such appointment, directed the trustees to pay over the corpus of the trust estate to those entitled thereto under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania.</p>

In order to replenish the trust estate <em>pro tanto, </em>Mrs. Lewis, the beneficiary, filed a bill in equity against the settlor who died during the pend-ency of the suit. She thereafter filed a similar claim against the settlor’s estate at the audit by the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County of the account of the exec<a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>utors under Ms will. The claimant sought (1) an award to the trustees of the <em>inter vivos </em>trust in the amount of $5,316.11 for the rehabilitation of trust corpus, (2) an award to the same trustees out of the settlor’s estate of a sum equal to the difference between $108,000 (the amount required to yield annually $2,700 on a two and one-half per cent basis) and the present value of the remaining corpus of the trust estate, and (3) if neither (1) nor (2) above was granted, the earmarking of a fund for the claimant’s future protection or a charge in her favor against a testamentary trust created by the residuary clause of the settlor’s will.</p>

Exceptions filed to the adjudication and decree nisi of the auditing judge were dismissed, after argument, by a majority of the court en banc (two judges dissenting). The adjudication was thereupon confirmed absolutely and a final decree was entered approving the awards, contained in the Schedule of Distribution, of $5,316.11 to the trustees of the <em>inter vivos </em>trust and the residual balance of the decedent’s estate to the testamentary trustees, “subject ... to the contingent liability on the claim of Mrs. Lillian Seixas Lewis . . .”. From that decree, the present appeals were taken, — one by the testamentary trustees of the trust created by the will of Charles A.

The deed of trust expressly provides that “. . . the terms [thereof] shall be strictly adhered to by his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, . . .”. Also, the trust deed must be interpreted in the light of the release for which it was the express consideration. As the learned auditing judge correctly observed, — “The release of Carl J. Wolters and the deed of trust are parts of one transaction, and grave error would result if they were considered independently and not together”. They constitute legally enforceable instruments. Their execution and delivery antedated the effective date of the Act of June 22, 1935, P. L. 450, which abolished, inter alia, accrued causes of action for breach of promise to marry and voided, as contrary to public policy, all contracts and instruments executed within this Commonwealth in payment, satisfaction, settlement or compromise of a claim so abolished or barred by the Act.</p>

Thus, the intention of the creator of a trust is the guide primarily to be followed in interpreting the intended effect of the indenture: <em>Scott’s Trust, </em><a href="/pa/322/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="322 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1167861" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0001-01">322 Pa. 1</a>, 16, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.%20245" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="184 A. 245">184 A. 245</a>. As in the case of all contracts, the deed of trust is properly to be construed with reference to its subject-matter and purpose to which end resort to surrounding facts and circumstances may be had: <em>Hild v. Dunn, </em><a href="/pa/310/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="310 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="1144268" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0289-01">310 Pa. 289</a>, 293, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%20228" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="165 A. 228">165 A. 228</a>.

      <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>With these principles in mind, we reach the same conclusion as did the learned court below. The purpose of the trust was to provide a payment of $225 monthly to Lillian Seixas for the term of her natural life in extinguishment of her then legally cognizable claim against the settlor’s son. The certainty of those payments was undoubtedly a matter of utmost importance to the beneficiary, especially, in view of her release which completely discharged the settlor’s son from any liability to her. It was to guarantee certainty and security of the specified payments against the possibility of insufficiency of income from the trust corpus that paragraph Fourth (f) was inserted. If, upon such a deficiency, the trustees should duly invade corpus, as on certain conditions the indenture authorized them to do, it was to be the settlor’s concomitantly accrued obligation to replenish the trust res <em>pro tanto.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[199,1295,1150,1161]],["BL_549.1",549,[171,430,1154,1624]]]'>The appellants argue that the only right against the settlor in such regard was to “call” upon him merely by way of request or solicitation to make good the deficiency in the income and, failing that, to “call”, with like ineffectual force, upon the settlor “to deposit additional securities with the Trustees ... to the amount of securities sold or appropriated for income purposes . . .”. If the word “call” means no more in the context than that the settlor was to have an election whether to make good the deficiency or let a portion of the trust res be sold, the provision was but an idle form so far as the beneficiary was concerned. But, such was not the evident intent of the parties; and the suggested construction is unwarranted. The word “call” may be used synonomously with “demand” in the sense of a legal obligation, particularly where need for the enforcement of the obligation is contingent or problematical and may never arise. One of the definitions of “call” given by Webster’s International Dictionary, 2nd Ed., Unabridged, is, — “A demand for the payment of money; . . . [e. g., a demand] to pay an installment of sub<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>scription to capital, or a <em>contribution toward certain </em>losses, etc., an <em>assessment” </em>(Emphasis supplied). See, also, <em>Taylor v. Coon, </em><a href="/citations/?q=48%20N.W.%20123" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="48 N.W. 123">48 N. W. 123</a>, 126, <a href="/wis/79/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="79 Wis. 76" data-case-ids="8702476" data-case-paths="/wis/79/0076-01">79 Wis. 76</a>, where the words “called upon to pay” were construed to mean “compelled or required to pay”. In that case the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said that the construction, so given, made the agreement consistent and harmonious in all its parts which would not be so were the clause interpreted to mean “asked or requested or pressed to pay”. The same may be as appropriately said with respect to the interpretation of the word “call” in the present instance. Such is, indeed, the true intent and purpose of the word “call” as the trust indenture otherwise confirms. Thus, paragraph Fourth (f) reckons with the settlor’s “failing” to make up any deficiency in income after having been called upon so to do. Failing imports an idea of an inability or unwillingness to discharge an obligation. If there were no obligation, his refusal to comply could not properly be considered a <em>failure </em>to perform. Moreover, the purpose of the trust, as affirmatively recited in paragraph Fourth (f), was “to provide an income” sufficient to pay the specified monthly sums to the beneficiary for the duration of her life. It is obvious that a trust res which, by 1942, had become insufficient to produce the required income for the specified monthly payments would be so depleted by invasion as to be incapable of producing much, or any, income long before the life expectancy of the beneficiary, who was then forty-three years old, had expired.</p>
