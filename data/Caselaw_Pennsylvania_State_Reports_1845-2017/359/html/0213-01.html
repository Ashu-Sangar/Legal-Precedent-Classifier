More specifically, is a duly licensed osteopath a “qualified physician” within the definition of Sec. 103 of the Mental Health Act of 1923 so as to be entitled (under Sec. 302 of the same Act) to certify persons for commitment as mentally ill and in need of treatment and care in a hospital for mental diseases? The answer is to be found in the proper interpretation and application of the legislative intent of relevant Acts of Assembly, particularly, <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>the Act of March 19, 1909, P.

The present inquiry is simply as to the. manner and extent that the legislature has, to date, empowered, regulated and controlled the practitioners of the above-named schools of dealing with respect to <em>the practice of medicine </em>in this State; for, as we shall see, it is only practitioners, so accredited, who are “qualified physicians” within the meaning and for the purposes of the Mental Health Act of 1923.</p>

That is the basic question. A study of the pertinent legislative enactments and court decisions clearly reveals that lieensures of physicians for the practice of medicine and for the practice of osteopathy as originally established and ordained by the legislature and as continued down to the present day rest upon two separate, distinct and independent systems and are still separately regulated. In <em>Commonwealth v. Dailey, </em><a href="/pa-super/75/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="75 Pa. Super. 510" data-case-ids="647042" data-case-paths="/pa-super/75/0510-01">75 Pa.

    <p id="b239-4" data-blocks='[["BL_239.6",239,[225,1127,1152,754]]]'>The earliest Act passed to regulate the practice of medicine in this State was the Act of April 12, 1875, P.

L. 42, the Act of June 8,1881, P. L. 72, and the Act of May 18,1893, P. L. 94. The latest of the amendatory Acts, just mentioned, established and defined the powers and duties of a Medical Council and three State Boards of Medical Examiners, provided for the examination and licensing of practitioners of medicine and surgery and further regulated the practice bf medicine and surgery. The ensuing decisional law is of historical pertinency.</p>

Pierce, </em>10 Pa. Dist. Rpts. 335, 337. A year earlier (1900) President Judge Criswell, of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Venango County, under , a similar view of the intent and scope of the Act of 1893, had directed a jury’s acquittal of a person, charged with a violation of the Medical Practice Act of 1893, whose “. . . method of treatment [was] simply that of manipulation of the parts [i. e., osteopathy]”: <em>Commonwealth v. Thompson, </em>10 Pa. Dist. Rpts. 634, 635. Plainly enough, therefore, the practice of osteopathy was directly ruled not to be the “practice of medicine”; and there was no court decision in this State to the contrary.</p>
    <p id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[234,1008,1151,1353]],["BL_241.1",241,[205,300,1149,427]]]'>With practice of the healing art according to the school bf osteopathy so excluded from the regulation and benefits of the Medical Practice Act of 1893, it was in 1909 that the statute, prescribing the qualifications and requirements for licensure as an osteopath, was enacted: see Act of March 19, 1909, cit. supra. And, the fundamental provisions of that Act continue in force to this day as the basis of the authority for the licensing and regulation of practitioners of osteopathy. That the legislature did not intend by the Osteopathic Act of 1909 to empower, then or later, persons licensed thereunder to “practice medicine” is evident from the provisions of that Act as originally passed or later amended. By Sec. 11 it is provided that “Every license to practice as an osteopathic physician . . . shall authorize the holder thereof to practice osteopathy in all its branches, ... as the same is herein defined, and taught and practiced in the legally incorporated, reputable colleges of osteopathy; . . . Any use or practice by osteopathic physicians of the agencies or means hereinafter named . . . shall hot be construed the practice of medicine .. .”. Further, the Act provides that “The word ‘osteopathy,’ as used in this act, means a complete and independent scientific system for the preservation of health and the relief and cure of bodily disorders . . And, still fur<a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>tlier, Sec. 13 of the Act concludes with the injunction “That nothing contained in this act shall be construed as affecting the so-called practice !of medicine”. Thus, did the legislature in the Osteopathic Act of 1909 plainly indicate its positive intent that those licensed thereunder as physicians were not authorized to “practice medicine” as that term had been judicially recognized and was then statutorily employed.</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[205,740,1152,1185]]]'>Two years later, the Medical Practice Act of 1911, cit. supra, which, in effect, was a codification of existing statutory law relative to the practice of medicine and has ever since prescribed the qualifications and furnished the basis for the licensure of physicians for the practice of medicine, was enacted. Thenceforth, as that Act expressly declares, it was intended to “furnish a complete and exclusive system in itself so far as relates to the right to practice medicine and surgery in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania”: see <em>Section 14- </em>Section 13 prescribes that “The provisions of this act shall not apply either directly or indirectly, by intent or purpose, to affect the practice of . . . osteopathy”. This was designedly done to preclude any suggestion that the “practice of osteopathy” was the “practice of medicine” just as the “practice of pharmacy” and the “practice of dentistry” had been similarly excluded by the same Section (13) of the Act. Here, again, the legislature affirmatively evidenced its manifest p'olicy and intent that the licensure of osteopaths or osteopathic physicians should not carry with it the right to practice medicine as authorized by the Medical Practice Act of 1911.</p>
    <p id="b241-6" data-blocks='[["BL_241.6",241,[206,1954,1150,429]],["BL_242.1",242,[235,289,1150,1139]]]'>With the statutory law, relative to the practice of medicine and the practice of osteopathy, thus developed in this State, there arose in 1921 the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Dailey, </em>cit. supra. There, an osteopathic physician, duly licensed under the Act of 1909, was convicted on an indictment charging him with “practicing medicine without a certificate issued by the Bureau of Medical Education and Licensure, and without having been reg<a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>istered under tlie [Medical Practice] Act of June 11, 1911, P. L. 639”. In due course judgment of sentence was passed on the verdict of guilt. On the defendant’s appeal to the Superior Court, the question, as presented by the appellant was “whether an osteopathic physician duly licensed by the Osteopathic [State] Board ... is entitled under the law to engage in the general practice of medicine?”. In answering that question in the negative and in affirming the judgment, the Superior Court pertinently quoted with approval from the opinion of the trial judge on the motion for new trial, in part, as follows: “ ‘Osteopaths are empowered to diagnose and treat diseases by employing osteopathy. Their privileges are not affected by the acts relating to the practice of medicine; but the right to practice medicine is not conferred upon those licensed under the Act of 1909, and its supplements, relating to osteopathy; and the fact that materia medica, therapeutics and other branches taught in medical schools are also imparted at the osteopathic college cannot extend the right of osteopaths to practice medicine’ ”.</p>
    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[238,1438,1148,702]]]'>Within two years bf the foregoing clear and unmistakable judicial pronouncement with reference to the relative rights and privileges attending licensure respectively under the Acts of 1909 and 1911, the legislature passed the Mental Health Act of 1923. Therein, as already stated, a “Qualified physician” is specifically defined as “. . . a physician who . . . has been licensed to practice medicine in this State . . .”. What else could the legislature have possibly meant in the Act of 1923 than that an osteopath or osteopathic physician is not qualified to certify a mentally ill person for commitment to a mental hospital? And, that Act has never yet been amended in material regard.</p>

In that Act there is clearly <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>evidenced an intent that an already existing distinction between the practice of medicine and the practice of osteopathy was meant to be continued. Thus, Sec. 101 (the definition clause) declares that an “Ostebpath” is “an individual licensed under the laws of this Commonwealth to practice osteopathy” and that a “Physician” is “an individual licensed under the laws of this Commonwealth to engage in the practice of medicine and surgery in any or all of its branches”.</p>

L. 903 (63 PS § 401), the legislature amended Sec. 1 of the Medical Practice Act bf 1911 by adding thereto two paragraphs <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> whose effect was so to enlarge the field of “medicine and surgery” as to automatically constitute “osteopathy” a branch of the practice of medicine. Prom that, the learned court below concluded that “. . . 'one designated a physician and licensed [under the Act of 1909] to diagnose and treat all types and conditions of diseases, albeit by osteopathic methods, is nevertheless licensed to practice a healing art and thus licensed to practice medicine”. That deduction is not only a <em>non sequitur </em>but also an obvious anachr'onism. The question here is what the legislature meant in <em>1923 </em>by the phrase, “licensed to practice medicine in this State”, as used in the Mental Health Act of that year to designate physicians qualified under that Act to commit mentally ill persons to hospitals for care and treatment. The Act of 1941 is in no sense an amendment of the Mental Health Act bf 1923; nor was it intended to <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>be.

    <p id="b244-4" data-blocks='[["BL_244.5",244,[238,471,1149,748]]]'>For like reason, the distinction between the “practice of medicine” and the “general practice of medicine” which the learned court below drew from the 1941 amendment of the Medical Practice Act is of no present pertinency. Even if it should be held that, under the 1941 amendment, “osteopathy” is now a branch bf “medicine”, the crucial question would remain as to who were “licensed to practice medicine” upon the passage of the Mental Health Act in 1923. And, the inescapable answer is that osteopaths were not so licensed, no more than were dentists or pharmacists whose licensure and regulation, just as in the case of the osteopaths, is by virtue of respective independent statutes and not by the determinative Medical Practice Act.</p>

In ascribed support of their claim that an osteopath is qualified to act as a committing physician under the Mental Health Act, the appellees point to the fact that there is in this State an Osteopathic Hospital for “mental health patients . . . under the supervision of the Department of Welfare” and “licensed” by the Commonwealth. The obvious and appropriate answer is that only a further Act of Assembly, and not a voluntarily established hospital, can be the legally efficient means of bringing osteopaths within the sc'ope of “qualified physicians” as contemplated and defined by the Mental Health Act of 1923. The issuance of a license for the particular hospital is readily understandable when it is borne in mind that the Department of Welfare of the <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>Commonwealth, in reliance upon opinions of the Attorney General, has been treating osteopathic physicians and their institutions as if osteopaths were duly licensed under the Medical Practice Act of 1911 to practice medicine. With those opinions, we manifestly do not accord. Yet, the fact is that it is those very opinions upon which the appellees fundamentally base their present contention. We are unaware, however, of any instance where opinions of executive or administrative officers have been considered binding upon the judiciary when called upon to decide a justiciable controversy.</p>
    <p id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[220,915,1153,920]]]'>Nor is the fact that osteopaths have been permitted by various statutes to perform certain functions which, historically, have attached to the practice of medicine (e. g., the signing of death certificates) of any materiality to the present question. The legislative grant to certain groups of the privilege of performing specific medical services does not carry with it a right to the unrestricted privilege tof practicing medicine as defined by the Medical Practice Act of 1911. Similarly, the ruling in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Cohen, </em><a href="/pa-super/142/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="142 Pa.

On the other hand, the term “Qualified physician”, as used in the Mental Health Act of 1923, has never yet been legislatively altered. To the contrary, at the 1947 session of the General Assembly, a bill was introduced in the Senate (No. 595) to amend Sec. 412 of “The Administrative Code of <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>1929” with a view to bringing the school of osteopathy within the jurisdiction bf the State Board of Medical Education and Licensure by adding to the State Board a member chosen from the Pennsylvania Osteopathic Association. A companion bill (No. 594), introduced in the Senate at the same time, was designed to amend the Medical Practice Act of 1911 so as to put the practice of osteopathy and osteopathic surgery under the Medical Practice Act and thereby include the licensure of osteopathic physicians and surgeons under that Act. Neither bill ever emerged from committee.

Metzger et al., </em>supra, was a suit in equity by chiropractors against members of the State Board of Medical Education whereby the plaintiffs sought to have the Medical Practice Act of 1911 declared to be in derogation of their constitutional rights and void against such practitioners of chiropractic and, further, to enjoin the defendants from enforcing certain regulations. As the opinion states, the bill alleged, inter alia, that “the State Board of Medical Education was about to start criminal proceedings against the plaintiffs”. The lower court dismissed the bill and this Court affirmed the decree, thereby impliedly ruling that the plaintiffs’ threatened conduct would be a violation of the Medical Practice Act of 1911. Speaking for this Court in the <em>Long </em>case, Mr. Justice Schaffer repeated the hereinabove quoted portion from <em>Commonwealth v. Seibert </em>and held that chiropractic is “comprehended in the term ‘practice of medicine’ ”. By no permissible reasoning can that conclusion be taken to have endowed the defeated plaintiffs with a license to practice medicine under the Act of 1911. In fact, Mr. Justice Schaffer quoted with approval from the Superior Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Jobe, </em><a href="/pa-super/91/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="91 Pa.

That observation is not without its pertinency in the present instance.</p>

But, here again, such practice of medicine as a chiropractor performs is not the “practice of medicine” for which licenses are issued under the Act of 1911. The Superior Court affirmed <em>per curiam </em>on the opinion of the learned trial judge and, in so doing, again took occasion to caution that “Persons who desire to practice any branch of the healing art of medicine within this State, even though it does not embrace the administration of drugs, should, by this time, be able to understand that they cannot lawfully enter up'on or engage in such practice until they have complied with the requirements of our statutes on the subject”.</p>
