Maxwell, was born to them in 1917. They lived together in Conshohocken until 1930 when Maxwell left his wife and went to live with Emma Saylor in Norristown, where she conducted a large boarding house. His intimacy with her was such that they came to be known in the neighborhood as husband and wife. In 1942 Emma Saylor, being desirous of reducing the size of her establishment, bought for that purpose a property at 818 Green Street; Maxwell moved with her and remained there until his death in 1945. When the Green Street property was purchased title was taken in the name of Raymond Maxwell and Emma Maxwell, “his wife”, and the grant was to them, “their heirs and assigns, as tenants by the en<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>tireties”. The purchase price was $3250 of which Emma Saylor paid $200 in cash; she and Maxwell gave a note for $800 and signed a bond and mortgage for the remaining $2250, and subsequently Emma Saylor paid the $800 in monthly installments; she has also paid all the interest on the mortgage to date. Maxwell made no contribution whatever to the purchase price. When he died his wife and daughter brought the present bill in equity for partition, on the theory that, as his heirs, they were the owners of an undivided one-half interest in the property.</p>
    <p id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[236,900,1149,739]]]'>We are of opinion that plaintiffs’ claim is not well founded and that the court below was in error in holding to the contrary. It is true, of course, that Maxwell and Emma Saylor, even though she was designated in the deed as Mrs. Maxwell, could not take title as tenants by the entireties, since that type of seisin is limited to grantees who are legally husband and wife. But it was held in <em>Thornton v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/328/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="328 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1179668" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0011-01">328 Pa. 11</a>,<a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.%20897" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="194 A. 897">194 A. 897</a>, that although a deed under such circumstances is ineffective to create a tenancy by the entireties it is not wholly invalid, there being no reason why the grantees, like any other two persons, cannot take title in some form of dual ownership “appropriate under the circumstances”.</p>
    <p id="b118-5" data-blocks='[["BL_118.6",118,[234,1660,1148,698]],["BL_119.1",119,[222,305,1147,198]]]'>The question here is: What is such appropriate form of tenancy? This depends entirely upon the intention of the parties, which is the ultimate guide by which all deeds must be interpreted: <em>Hindman v. Farren, </em><a href="/pa/353/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="353 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="465956" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0033-01">353 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%20241" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="44 A.2d 241">44 A. 2d 241</a>. Their <em>declared </em>intention was to own the property as tenants by the entireties, which is an estate “per tout et non per my”. This was equivalent to stating in so many words that they desired to establish a right of survivorship: <em>Michael v. Lucas, </em><a href="/md/152/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="152 Md. 512" data-case-ids="2281996" data-case-paths="/md/152/0512-01">152 Md. 512</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20287" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="137 A. 287">137 A. 287</a>; <em>Mitchell v.

Therefore joint tenancy with the right of survivorship,-— an estate “per my et per tout” — best effectuates their intention to the extent legally permissible, that being <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>the form of tenancy for unmarried persons most nearly resembling the tenancy by the entireties enjoyed by husband and wife, since in both instances the survivor takes the whole.</p>

Nor are we unmindful of the fact that the right of survivorship as an attribute, or necessary incident, of joint tenancy was abolished by the Act of March 31, 1812, P. L. 259, 5 Sm. L. 395. But that statute does not prevent the creation of the right of survivorship by the express words of a will or deed or by necessary implication, and no particular form of words is required to manifest such an intention.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

A married man and a woman (not his wife) acquired title, <em>as </em>husband and wife, as “tenants by the entireties”. Such seisin was not effective because the parties were not <em>in fact </em>husband and wife. I do not agree that <em>under the guise of construing the deed </em>this Court may decree a <em>supposed </em>intention contrary to that <em>expressed. </em>Such interpretation rests upon the supposed theory that because tenancy by the entireties has an attribute of survivorship, the parties <em>must have intended </em>to create a joint tenancy with survivorship. To support such an <em>implied </em>intent, additional words must appear <em>in the deed </em>which expressly or by necessary implication <em>disclose </em>such intent. I disclaim a legal doctrine which strikes down as inoperative an <em>express </em>seisin but uses the <em>same invalid words </em>to set up an <em>implied </em>seisin of a different quality.</p>

The <em>expressed </em>tenancy — tenancy by the entireties — was based upon this false statement.

With such omission, the words of the deed constitute the parties <em>tenants in common </em>or at least joint tenants <em>without </em>survivorship. This was decreed by the court below, and which I would affirm.</p>

Non constat, if they had been advised that they could not take as husband and wife, they would have chosen to take as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants, or by conveyance to them as tenants in common or joint tenants during their joint lives with remainder to the survivor. When we enter upon the field of conjecture, the point at which we find the parties would have ultimately landed cannot be determined.” The correctness of this statement is demonstrated when we observe, in other litigation, the varying degrees of generosity displayed by a man toward his mistress or by a woman toward her lover. I am unimpressed with the supposed equity that it was the woman’s money which purchased the real estate. This was not proven. Decision on this point was expressly withheld by the court. At the appellant’s election, she could have deeded the property to decedent in fee, or the parties could have taken title as tenants in common or as joint tenants in express terms. They did take title as <em>husband and wife. </em>In fixing the taxability of joint tenancy with survivorship, even the Pennsylvania tax statute does not consider whose money was actually used in acquiring the asset: <em>Cochrane’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/342/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="342 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1207024" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0108-01">342 Pa. 108</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20A.2d%20305" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="20 A.2d 305">20 A. 2d 305</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.
