    <p id="b640-6" data-blocks='[["BL_640.10",640,[234,800,1148,861]]]'>David M. Reynolds, the testator, died March 17,1944. By the 18th item of his will he directed that all bequests be freed from payment of inheritance taxes. The testator bequeathed legacies in the amount of $16,370, upon which an inheritance tax of 10% is conceded to be due. The residue of his estate, appraised as of the date of the death of testator at $80,713.18, was devised and bequeathed to trustees to pay the income therefrom to his widow for life. The trustees were given the discretion to pay the widow any part or the whole of the corpus for her maintenance and support. After the decease of the widow, the <em>unexpended </em>corpus was devised and bequeathed to collateral relatives. The widow died June 6, 1945 — one year, two months and twenty days after her husband — without having consumed any portion of the corpus.</p>
    <p id="b640-7" data-blocks='[["BL_640.11",640,[234,1674,1147,260]]]'>On December 14, 1944, the executor of the testator paid to the register of wills the sum of $3,251.26 <em>“on account” </em>of the transfer inheritance tax. It is stated in the tax receipt that the payment was on an appraisement then <em>“pending.”</em>

The gross value of the assets was appraised at $107,977.00 with allowable deductions of $10,893.82, leaving an estate of the clear value of $97,083.18. The legacies, taxable at 10%, amounted to $16,370. The residue of the estate upon which the widow was given a life estate, with right to consume, was appraised at $80,713.18. Whatever passed to the widow, whether income or principal, was taxable <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>at 2%. That portion of residue which remained unconsumed at the death of the widow passed to collaterals and was taxable at 10%. Until the widow’s death it was impossible to ascertain what portion of the principal she had consumed (taxable at 2%) and what portion of the residue passed to collaterals (taxable at 10%). The register thereupon made the following suspension notation on his appraisement: <em>“Reservation is hereby made to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of the right to appropriately tax any distribution made upon the death of the Life Tenant, Ruth C. </em>Reynolds, <em>to the collateral heirs named in Article 17 of the decedent’s will.”</em>
