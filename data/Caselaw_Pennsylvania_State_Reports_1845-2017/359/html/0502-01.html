The record discloses that a Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas had previously determined that the claim sued upon was invalid. This decision was affirmed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. With the record in this form, a son beneficiary and co-executor of the insolvent decedent, presented his petition to the orphans’ court, reciting the facts, and secured a citation upon the fiduciary to show cause why he should not be removed and his letters vacated.

Helsel and Dr. Pichtner were the principal stockholders and officers of the Art Stone Block Company. The corporation was indebted to various banks. The obligations were in the form of judgment notes. All were endorsed by both Helsel and Pichtner. Among the notes were two given to The United States Savings and Trust Company of Conemaugh. One was for $5,000 and the other for $1,600. To secure payment of these two notes, <em>as well as other indebtedness to the bank, </em>Dr. Fichtner pledged as collateral security a $10,000 policy of insurance upon his life.

This sum was paid to the bank. The two notes — for $5,000 and $1,600, respectively — when so paid, were assigned by the bank without recourse to Mrs. Fichtner, individually, in order that she might hold them as a claim against the Art Stone Block Company.</p>

Stutzman died February 26, 1939, insolvent. His will was probated but letters testamentary were not issued to the executrix. On July 9,1940, Mrs. Fiehtner, a creditor (because of an obligation of decedent to her as part of the purchase price), secured the appointment of her nominee, George Bondy, as administrator c. t. a. of the estate of Jacob A. Stutzman, deceased. <em>The administrator c. t. a. then sued J. W. Helsel on the same two notes which had already been litigated, whereupon this Court decided that Helsel was not Uable. </em>Despite the fact that in the prior suits it was disclosed that Mrs. Fiehtner had assigned the notes to her <em>attorney, </em>Martin J. Hindes, the statement of claim averred that said notes were assigned to the insolvent decedent <em>“without endorsement, for value received". </em>Soon after the suit was commenced the local counsel for plaintiff sought to withdraw as counsel on the ground that the action was “without merit”. The administrator c. t. a. petitioned the court of common pleas to resign. Permission was granted but was later rescinded; judgment was then entered in favor of defendant on demurrer. Plaintiff appealed to this Court. Counsel for the administrator c. t. a. moved this Court to dismiss the appeal because it was taken without the consent of the attorney or of his client. This Court refused the motion. On petition to the orphans’ court, Bondy was removed as administrator c. t. a. and William Adler was appointed administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. in Bondy’s place and stead. Adler proceeded with the litigation in the Supreme Court.

Helsel in the United States District Court. Jurisdiction was presumptively on the ground of diversity of citizenship. This suit is still pending.</p>

On June 16, 1947, the case was called for trial. Neither plaintiff nor his counsel appeared. A compulsory nonsuit was entered against plaintiff. No application was made to remove the nonsuit and no appeal has been taken from that judgment.</p>
    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.8",528,[226,1891,1149,369]]]'>The co-executor and son of the insolvent decedent then presented a petition to the orphans’ court, in which is' recited all of the above facts, praying for a citation upon the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. to show cause why he' should not be removed.

But if litigation instituted on behalf of the estate proves unsuccessful, liability for costs may accrue against the estate. While the estate may be presently insolvent, yet if assets should subsequently be paid into the estate, the estate could become solvent and the petitioner would be directly affected. While this result may be remote, yet we feel the petitioner has sufficient interest to bring the present situation to the attention of the orphans’ court for such action as it deems appropriate.</p>

None of the reasons which he now presents appear <em>in the record. </em>If appellant’s attorney-in-faet, or his local counsel, failed in his duty concerning the proper filing of an answer, this would clearly be a matter resting exclusively between them. But such answer, even had it been filed, would not have altered the legal result. The court of common pleas and this Court have decided that the claim is an invalid one. An answer, even if filed in time, would not have prevented the removal of a fiduciary who persists in pressing an invalid claim.</p>

He further says that on that date <em>this appeal was </em>pending, and that in order to move to open the order the appeal would have had to be discontinued and hence would have foreclosed a future appeal because of lapse of time. An examination of the record disproves such assertion. The decree of removal was signed September 29, 1947 and is attached to the “motion to mahe rule absolute”. In the motion it clearly <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>appears that the reason for entering the decree was <em>because of appellant’s failure to file an answer. </em>It is to be observed that an exception is noted to appellant. An opinion of the President Judge of the Orphans’ Court was thereafter filed, dated December 14, 1947. The certiorari from this Court was dated December 30,1947. There is no merit in the contention that a default judgment was inequitably secured.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[214,732,1151,1323]]]'>Appellant’s principal objection is that his removal as fiduciary by the <em>Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court </em>has the effect of “leaving the suit without a plaintiff” in the United States District Court.
