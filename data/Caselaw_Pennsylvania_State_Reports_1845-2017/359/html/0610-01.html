In the middle of Haverford Avenue there is a double set of street car tracks, having an overall width of sixteen and á half <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>feet; on either side of the tracks, there is a cartway of fifteen feet, for a total width for the avenue of forty-six and a half feet from curb to curb. 42nd Street is thirty-three feet between curbs. The buildings on both streets are set back fourteen feet from the respective curbs. At the time of the matter here involved, Haverford Avenue was a full stop for traffic approaching on 42nd Street and appropriate stop signs, in accordance with The Vehicle Code, were erected, viz., one (facing south on 42nd Street) at the southeast corner of the intersection and another (facing north on 42nd Street) at the diagonally opposite (northwest) corner of the intersecting streets.</p>
    <p id="b634-4" data-blocks='[["BL_634.5",634,[219,1037,1149,1332]]]'>About 11:55 p. m. on the night of July 1, 1944, a passenger automobile, proceeding northwardly on 42nd Street, and a street car, going west on Haverford Avenue, collided in the intersection, the automobile striking the street car on the left-hand side just back of the front. The force of the impact caused the street car to jump the track; and, in so. doing, it pulled down the overhead power line. After jumping the track, the street car ran (without power) diagonally to the right over the cart-way and struck the rear of a coupe automobile parked along the north curb of Haverford Avenue at a point twenty-five feet west of the 42nd Street line. The plaintiff, innocent of what was transpiring, was sitting in the parked automobile on the right-hand side of the seat. The momentum imparted by the street car turned the parked automobile around, hurled it (in reverse direction) across the street and threw the plaintiff to the ground, causing the injuries for which this suit was brought. After striking and displacing the parked automobile, the street car jumped the curb and continued on its course diagonally along the fourteen foot sidewalk until it imbedded its front end in a building on the north side of Haverford Avenue ninety-five feet from the point of collision.</p>

      <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>The plaintiff sued the traction company for damages on the ground that negligence on the part of its motorman was a proximate cause of his injuries. By agreement of the parties, the case was heard by the court without a jury; and, at the conclusion of the evidence for the plaintiff, the court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it later refused to take off. This appeal followed. We may say, in passing, that the practice, in general, of granting nonsuits in actions at law heard by judges without juries is not to be commended. Error, ofttimes due to the trial court’s failure to view the evidence for the plaintiff as favorably as the procedural situation requires, would largely be avoided if, instead, the court proceeded to a full hearing of the evidence for both sides and then found the facts, which findings would forthwith have the weight of a jury’s verdict. The resultant judgment would be reviewable on a more conclusive factual basis.</p>

Mr. Justice Moschziskhr graphically expressed the pertinent rule in <em>Virgilio v.

The same guiding principle has been frequently stated in simpler and more concise form, e. g., a nonsuit can be entered only in a clear case; if there is any doubt as to the inferences to be drawn from the evidence, the case is for the jury; the facts and inferences must lean to the <em>one </em>conclusion of the defend<a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>ant’s freedom from fault.

We are not now concerned with the possible fault of the driver or occupants of the automobile traveling on 42nd Street. For present purposes their negligence may be assumed. Our sole inquiry is whether there is evidence in the case from which a jury might properly find that the motorman failed to exercise the degree of care required of him in the circumstances and, if he did so fail, whether his negligence contributed to the infliction of the plaintiff’s injuries.</p>

In addition to the facts already mentioned, relative to the course and momentum of the street car following the collision, the proffered evidence would support the following further findings. When the street car was still back (some eight feet) from the east building line of 42nd Street, the automobile had reached the curb on the south side of Haverford Avenue. The street car was traveling at a rapid rate of speed. It did not stop at 42nd Street or slacken its speed in any degree upon approaching and entering the intersection. The collision occurred in the middle of the intersection; and both bystanders were aware of its imminence before the street car entered the intersection. The crossing, moreover, was a dan<a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>gerous one. In these circumstances the question of the motorman’s negligence was for the jury. Certainly, the evidence was not such that the court could summarily answer that question as a matter of law: see <em>Cunningham v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, </em><a href="/pa/352/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="352 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="464154" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0571-01">352 Pa. 571</a>, 575, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.2d%20825" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="43 A.2d 825">43 A. 2d 825</a>, and cases there cited.</p>
