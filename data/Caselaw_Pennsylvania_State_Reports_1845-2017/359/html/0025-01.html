The defendants answered responsively and, on the issue joined, the matter was proceeded with to hearing. In January 1944, while testimony was being taken, a competitor of the plaintiff, Yellow Rental, Inc. (which leases, in Philadelphia only, trucks without drivers), petitioned for leave to intervene in the proceedings, as an <em>amicus curiae, </em>in support <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>of the Act and was permitted so to do.

      <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>The learned chancellor found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plaintiff’s long term leases of motor vehicles are for indeterminate periods of a year or more while transient leases are by the hour, day, week or other short periods of time. Under the long term lease arrangements, the plaintiff supplies motor trucks in both small and large groups to <em>selected </em>commercial concerns. In many cases, the trucks are especially designed to fit the lessees’ needs, sometimes with distinctive bodies and painting and lettering according to the specifications of the particular lessee, including the lessee’s trademarks. While the plaintiff’s vehicles are under lease, it has no control over their operation, but it does keep them in repair and good running order and furnishes garage facilities and services, tires, oil and other lubricants. The procedure for leasing a motor vehicle on a transient basis requires that the applicant furnish the plaintiff with identification data on a blank form and make a cash deposit unless he has established a charge account. The proposed lessee must agree that the vehicle will not be used to transport persons or property for hire. If the applicant is turned down for any reason or proves to be an undesirable driver, his application form is marked “N. GL”. Such marks usually indicate that the company has had actual experience in renting a vehicle to such person. In particular, the court below found that “the plaintiff does not hold itself out as supplying trucks or passenger cars for short periods to the <em>general public indiscriminately, </em>and in this phase of its business is not acting either as a common or contract carrier, and <em>does not compete substantially </em>with either common or contract carriers by motor vehicles . . .”. (Emphasis supplied). At times, it leases trucks to common or contract carriers on long term leases and, in all instances, it carries “fire, theft, public liability, and property damage insurance with respect to [its] leased motor vehicles”.</p>

Further, the Act defines the procedure for obtaining a certificate of public convenience, the causes for which and the manner in which such a certificate may be revoked after issuance, and confers a right of appeal to the Superior Court on any person aggrieved by a Commission order “granting, refusing to grant or revoking a certificate of public convenience”; it requires the filing of tariffs by a lessor of motor vehicles without drivers; it makes unlawful anyone’s engaging in the business without a certificate or charging “for the lease of a motor vehicle for less than one year” a rate <em>lower </em>than that shown in the tariffs filed, etc.; it prescribes penalties for violations; and, it puts upon the Public Utility Commission the responsibility of administering and enforcing the Act.</p>

That deficiency has been recurrently recognized in the reported decisions of a number of jurisdictions. But, fundamentally, it still remains essential to constitutional regulation and control of private property that the subject property be affected with a public interest and that a legislative exercise of the police power in such regard be in the <em>public </em>interest. And, while the tests applied are not completely exhaustive in all instances of the existence of such interest, there are certain norms which are helpful in determining whether a business is so “affected”. Apart from an intentional and deliberate dedication of private property to public use, which, in general, may be said to subordinate it automatically to legislative regulation and control, from early times the enjoyment of a franchise or privilege for the performance of a service (whether by virtue of “a prescription time out of mind, or a charter from the king”), of which <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>service the public has a real and continuing need and no ready means of obtaining it otherwise, subjects the business to regulation and control in the public interest. In the light of certain more recent expressions by the Supreme Court of the United States (e.g., see <em>Olsen v. </em>Nebraska, <a href="/us/313/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="313 U.S. 236" data-case-ids="6138846" data-case-paths="/us/313/0236-01">313 U.

Mr. Chief Justice Waite further quoted from Lord Ellenborough in <em>Aldnutt v. Inglis, </em>12 East 527 (1810), to the effect that it is the <em>monopoly </em>conferred (whether by prescriptive right or sovereign grant) which requires, as an equivalent, performance of “the duty attached to it [i.e., the monopoly] on reasonable terms”.</p>

The members of the Court were at no misunderstanding as to what was being decided in that case. In the opinion for the Court it is expressly recognized that the warehouses had become (p. 132) “clothed ‘with a public interest, and cease[d] to be <em>juris privati </em>only'” because of “the facts”, viz. (p. 131), “. . . all the elevating facilities through which these <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>vast [grain] productions ‘of seven or eight great States of the West’ must pass on the way ‘to four or five of the States on the seashore’ may be [i.e., had become] a <em>‘virtual’ monopoly”. </em>(Emphasis supplied). Just two years later, Mr. Justice Bradley, who had been of the majority in the <em>Munn </em>case, interpreted that decision to be that “. . . when an employment or business becomes a matter of such public interest and importance as to create a common charge or burden upon the citizen; in other words, when it becomes a <em>practical monopoly, </em>to which the citizen is compelled to resort, and by means of which a tribute can be exacted from the community, it is subject to regulation by the legislative power”. (Emphasis supplied.) True enough, the statement just quoted from the learned Justice was contained in a dissenting opinion in the <em>Sinking-Fund Cases, </em><a href="/us/99/0700-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="99 U.S. 700" data-case-ids="3373942" data-case-paths="/us/99/0700-01">99 U.

Speaking for the Court in that case, Mr. Justice Blatcheord quoted with obvious approval at p. 537 the above statement from Mr. Justice Bradley’s dissent in the <em>Sinking-Fund Cases. </em>Eight years earlier, in <em>Spring Valley Water Works v.

The instances where a private property’s “affection” with a public interest does not rest upon its capacity for monopolistic use in the performance of a service to the public in general so as to subject the property to legislative regulation and control are relatively few indeed. The fact of the matter is that confusion seems to have been unnecessarily injected into the concept of public regulation of private property by treating all such regulations as constituting similar exertions of power. It is true that the exerted power (i.e., legislative) is the same in all instances, but, obviously, a different basis of justification for its exercise must be found where the impact is visited upon a legitimate, sanitary <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>and decent private business on the one hand and, on the other where the property so regulated constitutes a fire hazard of public concern <em>(Queenside Hills Realty Co., Inc. v.

Indeed, the court below was content to conclude that, as the highways are subject to governmental regulation and as the plaintiff’s leased motor vehicles use the highways, the plaintiff’s business (i.e., its use and enjoyment of its private property) is subject to public regulation and control. By contrast, the learned court below on two former occasions had properly recognized the peculiar quality of the public interest essential to legislative regulation and control of private property in respect of its productive use for the owner’s personal benefit. Thus, in <em>Scudder v. </em>Smith, 45 Dauphin 209, it was held that the gasoline and oil industry (as represented by the large producers and distributors) was not affected with a public interest so as to be liable to ancillary legislative investigation. And, in <em>Heinel Motors, Inc. v. Teefy, </em>46 Dauphin 281, the same court held that the automobile business was not affected with a public interest.

It will be recalled that the chancellor expressly found, and it is an established fact in this case, that, in the business of leasing trucks or passenger cars <em>for short periods of time </em>(the subject business of the Act’s concern), the plaintiff “. . . is not acting either as a common or contract carrier, and <em>does not compete substantially with either </em>

      <em>common or contract carriers by motor vehicles </em>. . .”. (Emphasis supplied.) Yet, the chancellor went on to find that “. . . its [the plaintiff’s] business, as a whole, is a competitive business, and prospective customers are solicited, even though they are utilizing contract or common carriers. This solicitation has resulted, to some extent, in diversion of business from regulated contract or common carriers, . . .” The latter finding was undoubtedly made in support of a similar statement formally promulgated by the Act’s preamble in justification of the ensuing legislative exertion. Just where, it may be ashed, did the regulated common and contract carriers by motor vehicle ever acquire an absolute right to transport all persons and the goods of all persons who wish to travel or ship by motor but do not personally own the automotive equipment necessary for the purpose? It will, of course, be conceded that a property or business <em>affected with a public interest </em>may be regulated and controlled simply as an aid to the effective regulation and control of another property or business also <em>affected </em>with a public interest. But, the secondary business must be <em>affected </em>with a public interest before it can be regulated under the police power even in aid of the regulation of the primary business: see <em>Brink’s Express Company v.

In no true sense, however, is the power ever exercisable for the purpose of conferring upon a private person a special or exclusive right in the use of the highways for private gain. The control or conditioning of the use of the highways by a business is done as a safety measure and not in order to regulate and control indirectly the user’s business as such. For safety purposes, users of the highways may, constitutionally, be classified according to the character and extent of their use, such as lessors of motor vehicles. And, as so classified, they may be subjected to regulation but only in furtherance of highway travel and highway safety in general. In <em>Hodge Drive-It-Yourself Co. v.

It neither prescribes nor authorizes any restrictions or limitations upon the number of motor vehicles that persons engaged in the business may maintain at any one time for leasing; it lays no charge or burden, progressively or otherwise, upon any increase in the number of such vehicles from time to time; and it places no limitation upon the operation of such vehicles on the highway anywhere at any time by the lessees thereof. The highway service which it does provide in a relatively minor way, viz., the requirement of insurance or proof of financial responsibility, is wholly ineffectual to cure or even minimize the manifest unconstitutional features of the Act as hereinabove specified. Primarily and predominantly, the scheme and intent is to subject a purely private business to public regulation. And, the classification by which those, made subject to the Act, are singled out for public regulation in respect of their private businesses is so unreasonable as to impute further donstitutional invalidity. In a very real sense, the statute amounts to a special Act regulating trade in violation of Article III, Section 7, of the Pennsylvania Constitution and it denies, moreover, to those engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.</p>

In any circumstances, an exercise of such power, if it is to be valid constitutionally, must bear a reasonable relation to a lawful end sought to be attained thereby. In short, the police power can never be exerted legally except it be exercised in the public interest. Consequently, unless a given exercise of the power promotes or tends to promote the public safety, health, morals <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>or welfare, it is without constitutional sanction. For a legitimate exertion of the police power there must be “a reasonable and substantial relation between the thing acted on and the end to be attained, one that promotes health, safety or general welfare, necessary to the common good, and a reasonable demand for regulation, not one that is merely an unnecessary ‘experimentation (or interference) with the fundamental rights of the individuar : Truax v. Corrigan, 257 17. S. 312, 338”: <em>White’s Appeal, </em>supra, at p. 264. In presently material regard, <em>Nolan v. Jones, </em>supra, quotes at p. 128 from the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Lawton v. Steele, </em><a href="/us/152/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="152 U.S. 133" data-case-ids="3574181" data-case-paths="/us/152/0133-01">supra,</a> that “ ‘to justify the State in interposing its authority in behalf of the public, it must appear, first, that the interests of the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, require such interference; and, second, that the means (employed) are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose, and not unduly oppressive upon individuals;’ ”. The justification thus assigned as requisite to public regulation and control of private property is presently lacking. The Act here involved will not promote “the interests of the public generally” but, rather, “those of a particular class”; and the means employed will not subserve “the accomplishment of [any public] purpose”.</p>
    <p id="b70-4" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[223,1697,1150,698]],["BL_71.1",71,[233,280,1161,1956]]]'>The chief end of permissible public regulation and control of private property, when affected with a public interest, is that such property shall be made to serve adequately the use to which it is devoted and that the rates charged the public for the service shall at all times be fair and reasonable. In <em>Brink’s Express Company v. Public Service Commission, </em>supra, the Superior Court succinctly stated the matter at p. 276 as follows: “In so far as the public is concerned, the Commission regulation is designed to secure reasonable rates and adequate service.” Here, the Act provides nothing that would require a certificate holder to furnish adequate leasing service at any time or to the public generally. And, the <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>tariffs required by the Act need not be fair or reasonable. Nor do they ever become measurable on such a basis; and neither hearings nor appeals looking to a just determination of fair and reasonable rates are anywhere provided for by the Act. The tariffs so required are to be simply the lessor’s own voluntary schedule of the rates at which he chooses to rent out his various types of motor vehicles. And, without liability to anyone, he may arbitrarily and as often as he sees fit file new tariffs with “the sky as the limit” of his rates and, then, charge the public accordingly. The only restraint or control imposed by the Act in regard to rates is that a lessor shall not charge the public “rates of rental . . . <em>lower </em>[sic] than the rates charged to common carriers and to contract carriers by motor vehicle.” (Emphasis supplied.) Indeed, so far as the Act is concerned, a lessor of motor vehicles may charge the public “as much as the traffic will bear” if only he does not charge the legislatively favored carrier as much or, at least, no more. And so, without in any way violating the Act, a lessor of motor vehicles may charge a member of the public at any time as much more than the rates of his filed tariffs as the prospective customer will agree to pay. It is only a common or contract carrier by motor vehicle which a lessor may not charge <em>more </em>than the posted tariffs required by the Act. Just where the public interest is subserved by any such regulation and control, it is impossible to see. The lack of any helpful concern in the Act for anyone but a common or contract carrier, doing a local or short term haul (e.g., taxicab or bus company), is further apparent. Section 6 of the Act expressly allows for the leasing of motor vehicles, without drivers, under written contracts for periods of <em>a year or more </em>without any regard for the rates of rental prescribed in the lessor’s filed tariffs, — a plain refutation that highway control was the motive for the Act.</p>

In the court below, Yellow Rental, Inc. (exclusively a lessor of trucks in Philadelphia only) sought and was granted leave to appear and be heard as an <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of the Act. Just why a lessbr of motor vehicles should volunteer to have its business put under public regulation and control, which would prevent it from charging a contract or common carrier for a leased motor vehicle any more than it would charge the public, does not appear at first glance. In fact, Yellow Rental, Inc. professedly recognizes that its “views regarding the desirability of partial regulation of this business do not represent the views of the entire industry.” But, at bar, counsel for the company confirmed that it is a corporate affiliate of the Yellow Cab Company, a common carrier of the type, inter alia, for whose material benefit the Act would undoubtedly operate. And, in its brief in this court, Yellow Rental, Inc., after observing that lessors of motor vehicles should “either carry insurance or be financially responsible” (which no one disputes), immediately went on to state that “Accordingly, Yellow Rental caused a bill to be prepared and introduced into the legislature which, after some amendments, was enacted. It was signed by the Governor on June 5, 1943.” And, <em>that is the Act now before us.</em>

Nothing could be further from the law’s contemplation. The stifling of competition through an exercise of the State’s police power is never justifiable except that it be done, and actually be, in the public interest. As the highest attribute of government <em>(Salus populi est suprema lex), </em>the police power must, at all times, be exercised with scrupulous regard for constitutionally guaranteed private rights. It can be prop<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>erly exercised only in the public welfare; and, if exercised otherwise, the exertion will be stricken down as a perversion of the sovereign power.

Accordingly, we declare the Act to be null and void, and, therefore, unenforceable. As the Act has not yet been enforced, it seems unlikely that the injunction prayed for will need issue against the defendant State officials.</p>
