L. 176, 52 PS 281 et seq., as amended). Article XV, section 1, of the Act provides that any violation can be prohibited by a Court or Courts of the County wherein the mine proceeded against is situated but “this section shall be without prejudice to any other remedy, permitted by law for enforcing the provisions of this Act. . . .” (52 PS 501).

Two of the defendants named were served personally while service upon the remaining defendants was made by serving adult members of their family. Defendants entered an appearance de bene esse for the purpose of challenging the jurisdiction of the court and the validity of the extraterritorial service. In their petition raising jurisdictional questions, defendants also averred that the bill alleges only the five named defendants as being employed in the mine while the Act limits the right of the Plaintiff Mine Inspector to apply for an injunction to mines employing ten or more persons.</p>

Berryman, </em><a href="/citations/?q=288%20P.%20605" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="288 P. 605">288 Pac. 605</a>, said: “The remedy of injunction is strictly in personam.

In the recent work entitled The Law of Injunctions by Lewis and Spelling, the authors at page 19 have this to say on the question: ‘Jurisdiction to grant and enforce injunctions does not extend beyond the State in which the application is made. ... If the exercise of such a jurisdiction were attempted and an injunction granted to operate in another state and it should be disobeyed by persons in the other state, the court issuing the injunction would be powerless to enforce the injunction by attachment, and hence the effort to exercise such power would be readily defeated.’ ”</p>

The bill by leave of the York County court was served on officers of the defendant in New York, where the company’s principal office was located, and in Lancaster County, where its mills were situated. The prayers of the bill comprehended relief affecting the entire dam of the defendant, and also relief requiring a decree against the defendant personally. This Court in an opinion by Justice Yon Moschzisker held, reversing the court below, that the service was not within the authority of the Act of 1859, or other statutory authority, and a rule to set it aside should have been made absolute.</p>

The proceeding cannot be sustained as an action in rem. We said in that case, quoting from the opinion of the trial court: “ ‘The Act of 1859 must be construed in harmony with the policy of our jurisprudence not to bring nonresidents within the jurisdiction of our courts unless in very special cases . . . a decree against a defendant personally is not within the purview of that act and . . . where such decree is sought, the court has no authority under that act to direct service upon the defendant . . . the matter here in controversy is plaintiff’s right to conduct the business of manufacturing cereal beverages; the controversy touches his premises only incidentally as the place where <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>lie wishes to enter upon this business. Plaintiff’s title or possession of the premises is in no way questioned by the defendants. It is his acts and not his property that the defendants seek to interfere with. And it is the restraint of defendants from interference with said acts that plaintiff seeks to enjoin. The decree sought is clearly personal and hence not within the Act of 1859.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b455-3" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[193,705,1150,1078]]]'>The following statement appears in <em>Freeman v.

The property itself is in such actions the defendant ... its forfeiture or sale is sought for the wrong, in the commission of which it has been the instrument, or for debts or obligations for which by operation of law it is liable. . . . There is, however, a large class of cases which are not strictly actions in rem, but are frequently spoken of as actions quasi in rem, because though brought against persons, they only seek to subject certain property of those persons to the discharge of the claims asserted. Such are actions in which property of nonresidents is attached and held for the discharge of debts due by them to citizens of the State, and actions for the enforcement of mortgages, and other liens. Indeed, all proceedings having for their sole object the sale or other disposition of the property of the defendant to satisfy the demands of the plaintiff, are in a general way thus designated.”</p>

The command in such a case is directed to individuals and it is in effect: Do not mine that barrier pillar of coal. See “the barrier pillar case”, <em>Commonwealth v.
