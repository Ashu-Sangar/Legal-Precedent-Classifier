The verdict was $14,000 on the count under the Act of July 2, 1937, P.

On the other hand, there was evidence from which the jury might have found that the motorman should have seen him in time to stop the car.

The first is the interest of the deceased in the security of his person and property, an interest which <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>has been invaded by compelling him to endnre pain and suffering and to submit to the loss of earnings.

S/S Amerika, </em>1917 A.C. 38, 50. The rule was superseded in this Commonwealth by three statutory provisions: one providing a right of action for wrongful death, and two providing for survival of rights that would otherwise have been lost under the common law rule. Section 19 of the Act of April 15, 1851, P. L. 669, 12 PS 1601, authorized suit, for the death, for the benefit of certain relatives. Section 18<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> of the Act of April 15, 1851, P. L. 669, provided for the survival of an existing action by substituting for the injured plaintiff who had brought suit and died before trial, his personal representative. The second survival provision is contained in the Act of 1937, supra, providing that if the injured person dies without bringing suit, his personal representative may sue for the benefit of his estate. The purpose of this legislation is to provide compensation, not punishment; there is no ground for holding that the legislature intended a duplication of damages.

In <em>Pezzulli v. D’Ambrosia,, </em><a href="/pa/344/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="344 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="1211044" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0643-01">344 Pa. 643</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20A.2d%20659" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="26 A.2d 659">26 A. 2d 659</a>, also a suit for an infant’s death, the trial judge had charged that “the measure of recovery was the present worth of Charles’ loss of earnings during his life expectancy, after deducting the cost of maintaining himself.” In other words, his net earnings were considered the basic element. The court in banc granted a new trial on the ground that the restriction to net earnings was erroneous, that the proper measure of damages was “the present worth of his probable future accumulations during his life expectancy.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> It will be observed that the jury had been instructed to find what the probable earnings of the child would have been (we assume after 21) and, after deducting the cost of maintaining himself, to allow the difference reduced to its present worth. We reversed the order granting a new trial and directed judgment for the plaintiff on the verdict which had been reached by allowing the present worth of decedent’s net earnings.</p>

      <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>The instruction given to the jury in the <em>Pemlli </em>case, supra, required the application of a different measure of damages from the instruction given to the jury by the learned trial judge in this case. It is true that in the course of our opinion in the <em>Pezzulli </em>case it was said that in a suit by an injured person, continued after his death by his personal representative, the plaintiff may recover the same damages as his intestate would have received if he had survived. We said, “The elements of permissible recovery in such a case are well established —pain and suffering until the time of death, and the economic value of the life as measured by the present worth of likely earnings during the period of life expectancy, the diminution in earning power being total because of the death.” But it is important to remember that that instruction was not given to the jury in that case and that the verdict was based on net earnings and not “likely earnings during the period of life expectancy.”</p>

The jury sees the plaintiff and knows and considers that he must maintain himself during the period of his life expectancy and, in fixing the amount of recovery, has or should have that fact in mind. The cost of maintaining himself comes out of his pocket; it is immaterial whether it is paid out of savings or is ultimately taken out of his verdict (which represents his earnings) because in either case he pays for his own maintenance; all that remains is his net earnings. But if such a plaintiff dies, and his action is brought to trial by his administrator, he does not maintain himself during the period of his life expectancy; his administrator should therefore not receive anything for his maintenance during that period; he should receive only the loss of earning power less cost of maintenance, the remainder to be reduced to present worth. So, too, when the suit is for the benefit of the estate of the <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>person under the Act of 1937, the personal representative should not be permitted to recover all that the deceased might have earned had he lived. He does not maintain himself. If he had lived, his earnings would have been diminished by his living expenses during the period of the expectancy. Certainly it would be giving more than compensation if his administrator noiv recovered a verdict which included living expenses never incurred and Avhich could never have been properly enjoyed by him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> This principle is recognized and applied in suits under the “death” statute allowing recovery by relatives where no suit has been brought in the lifetime of the injured person: <em>Gaydos v.

The Survival Act of 1937 provides that “Executors or administrators shall have power ... to commence and prosecute ... all personal actions <em>which the decedent whom they represent might have commenced and prosecuted......” </em>It is thus crystal clear — and it was so held not only in the <em>Pezzulli </em>case but also in <em>Stegner, Administrator, v.

It is therefore governed, of course, by the same measure of damages;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> indeed this is not challenged in the majority opinion. What the present decision must do, therefore, in order to justify itself, is to reverse the rule as to the measure of damages in cases under section 18 of the Act of 1851, for that is the rule that was followed in the <em>Pezsulli </em>case. Apparently recognizing this, the majority opinion, while it avoids referring to any of the long line of cases which it is in fact overruling, simply states that “In the trial of an action by an injured person, the jury is instructed to find . . . the loss of earning power . . . . But if such a plaintiff dies, and his action is brought to trial by his administrator . . . his administrator should . . . not receive anything for his maintenance during <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>that period [of his life expectancy]; he should receive only the loss of earning power less cost of maintenance . . . .” The trouble with that declaration, however, is that it does not represent, and never has represented, the law of Pennsylvania; on the contrary, from the very first case decided under section 18 of the Act of 1851 down to the latest, every decision of this court has held that, where the victim of an accident brings a suit but dies before trial and his executor or administrator continues the action, the measure of damages is the same as that to which the deceased would have been entitled had he survived, namely, the economic value of his life as measured by the present worth <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> of his likely earnings during the period of his life expectancy: <em>Pennsylvania R.

I venture to state (certainly it is true to the best of my knowledge and belief) tliat no judge in Pennsylvania has ever charged a jury in a case under section 18 of the Act of 1851 that in estimating the damages there should be a deduction equal to the probable expenses of the deceased plaintiff had his life not been destroyed by the accident. The present decision, therefore, not only overrules the <em>Pezzulli </em>and subsequent cases under the Survival Act of 1937, but also all the cases under the survival section (section 18) of the Act of 1851, the measure of damages under both statutes being admittedly identical. If, in order to avoid such a drastic overturning of a century’s decisions, an attempt were now made to establish, in the teeth of the plain wording of the Act of 1937, a smaller measure of recovery under that Act than under section 18 of the Act of 1851, such an escape would be merely from Scylla to Charybdis, for the wholly deplorable consequence would be to restore the practice which prevailed before the Act of 1937 of an unseemly race to the prothonotary’s office to have a writ issued before the victim of the accident passed away so as to reap the fruit of a larger measure of damages.</p>

In the legal field of statutory construction it has frequently been asserted that if, after judicial interpretation has been given to a statute, the legislature does not amend the act, it must be assumed that the construction placed upon it by the court correctly represented the legislative understanding of the intended meaning of the statute and its desired effect. There have been three sessions of the legislature since the opinion in the <em>Pezmlli </em>case was handed down and no amendment has been enacted, so that the rule there established presum<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>ably construed the Act of 1937 in accordance with the intent of the legislature.</p>
    <p id="b103-5" data-blocks='[["BL_103.5",103,[233,412,1150,1524]]]'>5. The majority opinion cites cases from other jurisdictions apparently supporting the rule in regard to the measure of damages which the present decision seeks to introduce under our own Act of 1937. Those cases, however, are of no persuasive value whatever, and the same observation would be equally true of cases that might readily be cited from other jurisdictions which follow the <em>Pezsmlli </em>rule. The reason is that the wording of the death and survival statutes varies greatly in the different jurisdictions and each decision concerning them must be weighed in connection with the phraseology of the statute which it interprets; some States have only a death statute and not a survival statute at all and others construe their survival statutes, by reason of their particular phrasing, as performing the function of death statutes by providing for damages to the relatives of the deceased; in such cases, of course, it is the net earnings of the deceased which alone could be enjoyed by the family. It is properly pointed out in appellee’s brief that this applies especially to the Rhode Island, North Carolina and New Hampshire cases cited in the majority opinion. But our Pennsylvania Survival Act of 1937 is so clear in stating that an action instituted under it is the same action which the deceased might have commenced and prosecuted in his lifetime that there is no room left for the adoption of any rule of damages other than the one which, as already pointed out, has existed in Pennsylvania for close on to one hundred years.</p>
    <p id="b103-6" data-blocks='[["BL_103.6",103,[230,1948,1152,430]],["BL_104.1",104,[184,301,1152,867]]]'>6. The fact that the legislature enacted the Survival Statute of 1937 shows clearly that it did not consider that the Death Act of 1851 (section 19) furnished an adequate remedy in cases where a person was killed by the wilful act of negligence of a tortfeasor since it covered only that part of his earnings which he had been applying to the support of his family and did not provide for the loss which he himself suffered, namely, the <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>part of Ms earnings which he would have been able to spend for his <em>own </em>benefit had his life not been tortiously destroyed. But under the present decision the Survival Act will, in an overwhelming majority of cases, not allow of any such additional recovery at all, since it is only a small number of persons who can accumulate estates or, in other words, who enjoy an income in excess of their living expenses. It is not strange, for example, that in the case in the Federal court (before the decision in the <em>Pezzulli </em>case) in which an obviously intelligent and conscientious jury were instructed to return a verdict measured by the <em>net </em>earnings of the victim, they found against the defendant <em>but awarded no damages to the plaintiff under that test; (Voelkel v. Bennett, </em><a href="/f2d/115/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="115 F.2d 102" data-case-ids="1102229" data-case-paths="/f2d/115/0102-01">115 F. 2d 102</a>). The present decision, to my mind, defeats the very purpose of the Act of 1937.</p>
    <p id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[188,1178,1148,588]]]'>7. The rule laid down in the Pezzulli case has not worked unfairly or unsatisfactorily. Although in the six years since the rule was adopted a multitude of cases must have been tried in Pennsylvania involving its application this Court has had occasion in only a single instance to reduce a verdict rendered in accordance with it; <em>(Vincent, Administrator, v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/348/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="348 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="1220240" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0290-01">348 Pa. 290</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%2065" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="35 A.2d 65">35 A. 2d 65</a>). And even if occasionally such a verdict were excessive, as happens now and then in all kinds of negligence cases, the court always has control over it and could reduce it to a proper amount.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

I believe it is wholly impractical, not to say impossible, for a jury to determine the likely living expenses of a person killed in an accident if the victim happens to be a child or a young man or woman, it being obvious that such expenses would necessarily depend on his habits and tastes as he advanced to maturer age, on the scale of living which he might adopt, on whether or not he would many and have children, on whether <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>lie would have other family obligations, etc. Thus there is now being introduced into the law a factor the application of which must necessarily be unscientific and arbitrary and which will serve only further to confuse the determination of verdicts in such cases.</p>
    <p id="b105-5" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[261,572,1149,801]]]'>9. I think that a rule of law is immoral and therefore indefensible which makes it more financially advantageous for a tortfeasor to kill than merely to injure an innocent victim. Under the rule established by the present decision, killing an ordinary wage-earner, especially if unmarried, would probably cost the tortfeasor an extremely small sum if anything, whereas only injuring such a person would result in a larger award of damages since in that event his living expenses would not, of course, be deductible from the amount of his recovery. Surely such a state of the law would justly merit the reproach that it makes the destruction of human life less costly to the wrongdoer than would have been the case if the victim of the accident had merely been maimed.</p>

It seems to me that the present decision results from a confusion between a rule which is appropriate when damages are claimed for the death of <em>another </em>person and when they are claimed for one’s <em>own </em>death. In the former event, as where parents claim for the death of a child, or a wife for the death of her husband, the rule, of course, should be, and is, that recovery can be had only out of net <em>earnings; </em>the question there is: what is the economic value of the life of the deceased <em>to the claimant? </em>But under the Survival Act of 1937 the recovery is not for the benefit of the deceased’s relatives; since it is the same action which he himself could have brought in his lifetime the recovery is for the damages which he personally has sustained by being deprived of his <em>life; </em>the question then is: what is the economic value of the life of the deceased <em>to himself ? </em>And while it is true that, if he had lived, he would have been obliged to use his earnings for eating, sleeping under shelter, <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>recreation and amusements, such outlays, though in one sense expenses, constitute in and of themselves the very functions of life itself, — the sole purpose, indeed, for which earnings are sought as the recompense of labor. If the argument be valid that living expenses should be deducted because the deceased <em>in fact </em>escapes the necessity of paying them due to his enforced death, then logically no recovery at all ought to be allowed under the Survival Act of 1937 since the deceased would never <em>in fact </em>be able to utilize even the surplus, if any, of his earnings over his expenditures which the present decision would grant to him.</p>

Finally, the present decision seems to me to be undesirable on the basis of social considerations, because it drastically diminishes the amount of the recovery which might inure to the benefit of the family of an ordinary breadwinner and thereby works a much greater hardship on them than the application of the rule would entail in the case of persons fortunate enough to have incomes greatly in excess of their costs of living.</p>

It seems to me obvious that the discount computation should be made in accordance with the actual earning power of money, namely, the current rate of return on sound investment; see Restatement, Torts, §924, comment d.</p>
