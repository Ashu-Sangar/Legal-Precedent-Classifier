Standing Master Eugene B. Strassburger joined in the latter dissent. In his report, Chief Standing Master Martin said: “I think the petitioner has met the issue . . . and clearly established his right to reinstatement. This opinion is founded upon a fair review of the evidence submitted on his behalf. There are opinions of not only distinguished lawyers, and judges, but also that of the eminent Dean Harrison of the University of Pennsylvania Law School but also of men eminent in other professions and walks of life, each and every one of them recommending the reinstatement of the petitioner. ... I am fully convinced that this petitioner is entitled to reinstatement. ...”</p>
