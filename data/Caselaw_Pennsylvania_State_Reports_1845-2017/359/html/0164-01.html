The trial judge, after receiving evidence :on behalf of the Commonwealth and defendant, pursuant to the Act of 1939, P. L. 872, §701, 18 PS §4701, adjudged him guilty of murder in the first degree and imposed sentence of death. Chapman has appealed contending that (1) the Commonwealth has failed to sustain the burden of producing evidence sufficient to establish murder in the first degree, and (2) if that burden has been sustained the court abused its discretion by fixing the penalty of death instead of life imprisonment. The judgment and sentence of the court below must be affirmed.</p>

John Downey, a neighbor, on Sunday evening, August 10, 1947, found Minnie Chapman lying on the floor of the shack with her dog beside her. Both had been killed by bullets from a .22 caliber rifle. Chapman, lying on the ground outside the shack, told Downey, “She will never speak to you again, Johnnie.” About 10:00 P.M. that evening Deputy Sheriff Carl Butler and T. B. Wise, a Pennsylvania State Police investigator, having-been summoned by Downey, found the wife lying on the floor at the fobt of the bed, the body of the dog over her left arm and appellant lying on the floor and across her right arm. Believing appellant to be asleep, they handcuffed him and then aroused him. Wise testified: “we examined Mr. Chapman . . . and found that he was living, apparently AAras asleep and probably intoxicated to the best of our knowledge.” He stated further that appellant “seemed to be in sort of a stupor from intoxicants” and that the odor of intoxicants “was pretty strong.” Dr. B. W. Gage, who accompanied the police officers, examined Mrs. Chapman and pronounced her dead. Death Avas caused by a .22 caliber bullet through the heart. Appellant was forthwith taken into custody and, without hesitation, freely made a complete confession, reciting in detail the facts and circumstances surrounding the killing.</p>

That evening Avine and whiskey was purchased by the Chapmans, some of which was immediately consumed and some ;on Sunday morning. The exact quantity consumed by appellant is unknoAvn. In his signed confession he states that on Sunday morning he borrowed a .22 caliber rifle and shells from Downey, saying that he was going woodchuck hunting. He returned to his cabin and asked <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>Minnie to bring Mm a clock hanging on the wall behind her so that he conld re-wind it. He was standing at the door, the only entrance to the cabin. She was standing at the far side of the room. When she refused to bring the clock to him, he shot the clock off the wall.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> “I told Minnie: Mommie, if you don’t bring the clock you’re going to get it. Then we argued some more. Then I said: ‘Mommie, if you don’t do what Daddy tells you, you’re going to get it.’ Then I shot the other clock, which was hanging on the wall above the bed. Then I pointed the rifle at Minnie. She was still standing in the same place. She said, ‘Daddy, please don’t.’ I said, ‘Honey, will you say pretty please?’ She said, ‘Daddy,’ and that was all. The rifle was aimed at her heart, and I pulled the trigger.” As deceased fell to the floor appellant ordered the dog to get on the bed and then said: “Peggy, take a good look at Mtommie. Then I shot Peggy and set the rifle in the corner near the door. Then I took the dog off the bed and laid her on Minnie’s arm . . .”</p>

Inferences are unnecessary, however, where as here, the perpetrator of the crime has stated his intention to kill in clear and unequivocal language soon after the shooting and has not since repudiated it but instead reaffirmed it at the trial. When his signed confession was being prepared, he was asked: “When you pointed the gun at her did you know it was loaded? A. Yes, sir, I did. Q. Did you intend to pull the trigger? A. Yes. Q. Then you shot the gun knowing it would kill her or wound her? A. Eight. Q. Did you intend to kill her? A. Yes. Q. When she fell to the floor why did you reload the gun and fire the second shot? A. To make sure she was finished.” Having regard to this clear expression of appellant’s specific intent to kill, the trial judge pr.operly found appellant guilty of murder in the first degree. The Commonwealth has sustained the burden of proof in this regard.</p>

Mere intoxication of a defendant will not excuse or palliate the offense. He must have been sufficiently intoxicated as to be incapable of conceiving any intent: <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant has not sustained the burden upon him of establishing by “fairly preponderating evidence” that his intoxication prevented him from forming the requisite intent: <em>Commonwealth v.

Immediately after his arrest, and on two later occasions, he told a lucid, connecting and detailed recitation ;of events surrounding and following the shooting. On all occasions he was able to account for six shots which was the exact number of fired shells found by the officers. Immediately after his arrest he exhibited an acute awareness of the seriousness of his offense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The conclusion is inescapable that appellant knew what he was doing when he shot his wife and that he intended the consequences !of his acts.

That he was fully aware of the consequences of his act is evidenced by the fact that he took careful aim and fired a shot into the heart of the victim and then, to, make certain that he had accomplished his purpose, he callously reloaded and fired a secbnd shot through the prostrate form on the floor before him.

His specific intent to take his wife’s life was clear. He was only 16 feet away from his wife when he pbinted the gun at her and fired not once but twice. His murder-lust not being satiated he then shot his wife’s dog and laid it on her arm. He then calmly ate a piece of cold potato. The <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>officers did not arrive at the cabin until eight hours after the shooting.

He shot her in the right breast. When any person standing 16 feet from another person points a loaded gun at that person’s chest area and pulls the trigger, the reasonable inference is that he intends to take that person’s life. The fact that the defendant testified before the court that he did <em>not </em>intend to take his wife’s life is of little evidentiary value. By the time he so testified, he apparently realized his plight and'considerations of calculated policy were in the ascendant. On the day following the homicide, before defendant had had time to think much about it, he told the police that he intended to kill his wife.

Not every vicious 'or sadistic criminal is legally insane. In fact no plea of insanity was advanced for this defendant. Robert H.

    <p id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.6",195,[232,993,1154,585]]]'>It is elementary that intoxication sufficient to deprive the mind bf power to form a design with deliberation and premeditation and properly to judge the natural, ordinary consequences of an act, will prevent such a conviction. In the present case it seems to me an inescapable conclusion that the defendant was intoxicated to such an extent that he was incapable of deliberation, premeditation or intent. There are facts not stated in the majbrity opinion which seem to me important, others that seem to me to be understressed, and still others from which I think incorrect inferences have been drawn.</p>

The diagnosis by the psychiatrist was “chronic alcoholism”.</p>

Coming more closely to the time of the murder, it appears that defendant and his wife had been out on Saturday, the day <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>before the shooting, with their friends, the Downeys, drinking. On Sunday morning they started in drinking again and kept it up “off and on” until the shooting occurred. In the latter part of the morning defendant borrowed a .22 calibre rifle from Downey, not, as the majority opinion assumes, in order to prepare to kill his wife, but to go woodchuck hunting; indeed when he borrowed the gun he asked Downey if he would take him and his wife later in the day to Portville, thus showing that he had no thought at that time of killing his wife.</p>

Were defendant’s acts, as revealed by him, those of a sane, sober person acting with design and deliberation? Let them speak for themselves, having in mind that he and his wife had been married for only four months, had always got along “good together”, and had never had a quarrel, so that defendant had not the slightest motive of any kind for taking her life. After the drinking by both himself and his wife he started with the rifle to go woodchuck hunting, but, noticing that the clock had stopped, he asked his wife to hand it to him so that he might rewind it. She said “no”. The clock was on the wall and he fired a shot into it. She said “please don’t”. He asked her to say “pretty please”. She wouldn’t say it. He shot into another clock which was standing on a ledge. Then he went out of doors and fired there into a slop-jar. He came back and stood in the doorway; his wife stood at the head of the bed; they were thus as far apart (16 feet) as they could get in that small cabin. He pointed the gun at her and fired twice. They had a dog of which both of them were very fond. He called the dog up on the bed and said to it: “Peggy, take a good look at Mommy”. Then he shot the dog dead, picked it up, and laid it on his wife’s arm; (afterwards he told the sheriff that “Minnie wanted <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>to have the dog die with her”). Putting the gun down he ate a piece of dold potato with mustard on it, took another drink, kissed his dead wife, and then apparently “passed out” completely. Later Downey found him lying in front of the cabin and aroused him, whereupon defendant called “Minnie”, thereby showing that he did not even remember that he had killed her. When the officers of the law came to the cabin some eight hours after the shooting they found him lying on the arm of his wife opposite to the dog, and, as they testified, he appeared to be “in a stupor from intoxicants”, and they could smell the odor of drink throughout the entire cabin. An investigator connected with the Pennsylvania State Police testified that defendant appeared to be “considerably intoxicated”. A two quart wine and a pint whiskey bottle were both found empty. Defendant was in a “dazed or groggy condition” and “the odor of alcohol around there” was “extensive” and “very apparent” upon the defendant. A member of the State Police testified that defendant “appeared to be in a stupor when he got on his feet”. The Owner of the farm on which defendant lived testified that when he saw him, as did Downey, lying near the door of the cabin, he had the appearance of being “just darn good and drunk”. We thus have an abundance of testimony not only as to the amount and kind of liquor defendant had been consuming and the stuporous effect it had upon him, but also as to his actions which, speaking louder than words, show plainly that, so far from deliberating, premeditating or designing the killing of his wife, he had not the faintest comprehension !of what he was doing or what was going on around him.</p>
    <p id="b197-4" data-blocks='[["BL_197.5",197,[242,2090,1148,272]],["BL_198.1",198,[232,298,1148,1188]]]'>The majority opinion relies heavily upon the alleged fact that defendant shot his wife <em>through the heart </em>and applies therefore the well known factual presumption that one who uses a deadly weapon upon the vital part of the b'ody of another must be deemed to have intended <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>the natural consequences of his act. <em>But the evidence does not indicate that defendant aimed the gun at his wife’s heart. On the contrary, </em>the medical testimony is clear to the effect that the bullet entered the <em>right </em>breast and then, by a mere trick of fate, struck a rib which deflected it over toward and into the heart; the second bullet, which caused merely a trivial flesh wound, also entered the right breast and emerged therefrom parallel to the chest. Another fact which I think is unduly stressed in the majority opinion is that, in a statement made the following day to the police, defendant said that he intended to kill his wife; the majority opinion overlooks the fact, however, that defendant testified that he had no such intention. Thus in regard to the three factors upon which the present decision of the court seems principally to be based, two of them, namely, that defendant borrowed the gun for the purpose of killing his wife and that he aimed it at her heart, are directly refuted by the undisputed testimony, and the remaining one, that he confessed that he intended to kill her, must be weighed in the light of his statements and testimony to the contrary.</p>
    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[225,1506,1154,535]]]'>I think the court below gravely erred in finding defendant guilty of murder in the first degree with the penalty of death. Where there is a plea of guilty to an indictment of murder the burden is upon the Commonwealth to raise the grade of the crime from second to first degree; here the Commonwealth, in my opinion, failed to sustain that burden. Therefore, in accordance with the Act of 1870, I would reverse the present judgment, and, in its place, enter a judgment that defendant is guilty of murder in the second degree.</p>
