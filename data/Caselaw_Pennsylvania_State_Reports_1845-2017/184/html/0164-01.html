For a considerable time prior to that date, they were absolutely and irretrievably insolvent, and managed to carry on their business by money fraudulently obtained from banks, among tbem tlie People’s National Bank, one of the plaintiffs, upon false statements as to their financial condition, knowingly made for tbe purpose of deceiving and thereb}r obtaining credit. During this time, Albert Loeffert, one of the defendants, (a son of George and a brother of John) was the superintendent and manager of the mill, and certainly knew the condition of the firm as early as February, 1895, if not before, probably as early as 1892, and actively cooperated with tbe partners (George and John) in placing their property in a condition for a dishonest failure. The evidence shows that Loeffert &amp; Son, in 1896, owned a planing mill in the Seventh ward of Allegheny city, in which Albert resided, and superintended the business done there, when tlie firm concluded to remove and build a new mill in Sharpsburg. At this time Albert owned a bouse and lot in Allegheny. The lot cost him $1,300, and upon this he erected a house costing, according to his evidence, some $1,400 or $1,500, the material for which he got from George Loeffert &amp; Son, and which ho swears he fully paid <em>for; and </em>as there is no sufficient evidence to the contrary, I assume it to be true, altbougb his evidence upon that point is not as clear and satisfactory as it might be. This property Albert traded for some lots in Sbaipsburg, upon which Loeffert <em>&amp; </em>Son, in 1896, built an extensive planing mill, costing some $15,000 ; about $8,000 being for new machinery and $7,000 for tbe building. There was no <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>sale or agreement for sale of this lot to the firm by Albert, but there was a verbal agreement for a lease for one year at $100' per month, and there was no arrangement or agreement by which Loeffert &amp; Son were to have any right or claim to the buildings thereon after the termination of this verbal lease; so that so-far as appears at the end of the year’s lease the title and ownership of the lot and buildings would be in Albert. It also appears that Albert somehow became the owner of other lots in Sharpsburg upon which he had erected dwelling houses. One-on Third street, worth some $8,500, and another on First street, worth some $8,500, a considerable part of the cost of which was-paid or settled directly or indirectly by George Loeffert &amp; Son, and for which there is no sufficient evidence to justify me in concluding -that Albert ever paid, or was held or intended to beheld chargeable therefor. It seems quite clear to me that Albert perfectly understood and participated in the purpose of the firm to put their property as far as practicable beyond the reach of creditors, and the only serious question remaining is: How much of the money or property of Loeffert &amp; Son was, in pursuance-of such design, actually expended upon these lots and buildings of Albert ? The evidence is quite sufficient, in my opinion, to-prove that at least $1,648 in money and material were put into and paid on account of work done on the house on Third street, described in paragraph 2 of plaintiffs’ bill, to wit:</p>

But while it is possible that such fact to a greater or less extent may be true, I cannot find evidence to justify me in coming to such a conclusion, and therefore decline to find such to be the fact. I therefore find as a fact that the said sum of $1,648 was put into the Third street house (the title to which is in Albert Loeffert) by George Loeffert &amp; Son, with the knowledge and consent of Albert Loeffert, for the purpose of secreting the same from the creditors of said firm, and that the further sum of $2,132 was with a like purpose and with the knowledge of Albert Loeffert put into the First street house, the title to which is in Albert Loeffert.

Reifenrath to George Loeffert was assigned to Albert Loeffert in pursuance of a like purpose, and without sufficient consideration, for the purpose of concealing the assets of-George Loeffert &amp; Son from their creditors, but am of opinion that plaintiffs are not in a position to enforce their claim in this proceeding, they never having issued executions on their judgments.

    <p id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.8",191,[200,757,1171,1115]]]'>Briefly stated, the facts upon which the decree is based as found by the court are these: In 1896 two of the defendants, John and George LoeiTert, were in the planing mill business as partners. They were then and had been for several years irretrievably insolvent, and had carried on their business with money fraudulently obtained by false statements as to their financial condition. The third defendant, Albert LoeiTert, was the superintendent of their mill. He knew of their financial condition, and actively co-operated with them in secreting their property preparatory to a dishonest failure. In pursuance of the conspiracy formed, houses were built upon lots before owned by Albert or procured, by him for the purpose with his own money. The lumber and mill work were furnished directly by the firm, and they paid for a part at least of the other materials and for the labor, with the intent thus to secrete their property from their creditors. No debt was created between the parties by the transaction; it was not intended that Albeit should pay for the materials furnished by the firm or repay the money they had expended in the construction of the houses. It was a scheme into which all three entered to put the property of the firm beyond the reach of its creditors. This finding seems to be fully sustained by the testimony.</p>
    <p id="b191-6" data-blocks='[["BL_191.9",191,[200,1881,1167,299]]]'>The plaintiffs are judgment creditors of the firm, and one of the prayers of their bill was for a decree that their judgment be declared a lien on the real estate on which improvements had been made to the extent to which their debtor’s property had become merged in and a part of the realty. This prayer was granted.</p>
    <p id="b191-7" data-blocks='[["BL_191.10",191,[199,2189,1168,196]],["BL_192.1",192,[255,354,1177,1828]]]'>The general jurisdiction of courts of equity to grant relief on the ground of fraud has been freely exercised to defeat the conveyance of property by insolvent debtors in fraud of creditors in cases where the law furnishes no adequate remedy. It has been <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>exercised in numerous cases where a debtor, with intent to defraud his creditors, has conveyed his land directly to another, or has purchased land or paid part of the consideration for land purchased in the name of another, or has made improvements on the land of another, as well as for the removal of fraudulent liens and incumbrances. Where the estate or interest of the debtor has been placed beyond the reach of the ordinary process of execution, he has been held to have an equitable interest which will be made subject' to his debts. Although none of our cases are directly in point, the principle stated has been recognized in Suydam v. Northwestern Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/51/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="51 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="999765" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0394-01">51 Pa. 394</a>, Barto’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/55/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="55 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1470714" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0386-01">55 Pa. 386</a>, and Fowler’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/87/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="87 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="1057894" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0449-01">87 Pa. 449</a>. In Wait on Fraudulent Conveyances and Creditors’ Bills, section 26, it is said : “ An extreme illustration of the disposition of courts to favor creditors is the familiar and salutary rule that improvements placed by the debtor upon the real property of another, acting in concert with Mm, and to defraud creditors, •can be followed, and the realty charged in favor of the creditors of the debtor with the value of such improvements.” And in Bump on Fraudulent Conveyances, page 242: “ If a debtor uses his personal property upon the real estate of another, with the knowledge and consent of the owner, so that it becomes a part of such realty, for the purpose of defrauding his creditors and preventing them from obtaining satisfaction of their demands, they may still follow the property into the hands of the •owner of the premises thus -benefited, and fasten their' claims upon such premises to the extent of the debtor’s property so appropriated. If a debt, however, has been created between the parties, the creditors can only have the debt appropriated to the satisfaction of their demands; but if no debt has been created, the appropriate remedy is to fasten their claims .upon the real estate to the extent of the debtor’s property thus made part of the realty.” Among the many cases which support this proposition are Isham v. Schafer, <a href="/barb/60/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="60 Barb. 317" data-case-ids="2260084" data-case-paths="/barb/60/0317-01">60 Barb. 317</a>; Lynde v. McGregor, <a href="/mass/95/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="13 Allen 182" data-case-ids="2114917" data-case-paths="/mass/95/0182-01">95 Mass. 182</a>; Dietz v.

If they had conveyed the land or taken title in the name of another <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>a reconveyance might have been ordered or the conveyance set aside and their judgment decreed to bo a lien. This would have made a judgment against them a lien on their own property which they had fraudulently concealed. A decree in this case ascertaining the amount of the debtor’s property which had become merged in the real estate, and awarding a lien for the amount, would be more logical and more in harmony with chancery practice than the one made, and it would as effectually secure the rights of the plaintiffs. Such a lien would be by virtue of the decree, and the anomaly of making a judgment against one person a lien on the property of another would be avoided. The same result has been effected by this decree. A sale has been made under it, and the interests of purchasers are now to be considered. While not approving the form of the decree, we are not disposed to modify or set it aside, as it does substantial justice. The plaintiffs might have asked for more; while they are content with what they got, the defendants have no ground for complaint.</p>
    <p id="b193-4" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[224,1287,1166,913]]]'>The objection that the plaintiffs did not allege that they had exhausted their legal rights against the defendants appears to have been first made on the argument in this Court. Whatever force there might have been in the objection if made at the proper time and in a proper manner, it cannot be considered now. The motion at the hearing to dismiss the bill for the reason that there was an adequate remedy at law was not supported on the ground that the bill was defective, and the defects now alleged were not brought to the attention of the court at any time. The court had general jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and it was competent for it to grant the relief sought, and it is now too late to object to defects in the bill of this character. “ . . . . An objection on the ground of jurisdiction must be taken either by demurrer or plea before answer, otherwise the court will entertain the suit, although the defendant may object to it at the hearing, unless it is a case in which no circumstances whatever can give the court jurisdiction:” Daniell’s Chancery Practice and Pleading, p. 631.</p>
