While the defendants maintain that the lease is such a contract as survives the death of Alexander McClure, can be carried out by his executors, and that all the parties interested in the leased premises having joined in the assurance to plaintiff of possession to the full end of the term of said lease, it is bound to perform its covenants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.3",388,[265,349,1182,1986]]]'>
      <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>It will be admitted that technically upon the death of the lessor, that portion of the demised premises which he held for life would revert instantly to the remainder men, owners of the fee. Indeed this seems to have been in the minds of the parties at the time of the execution of the lease, which was for twenty years, and in order to prevent damages accruing to the lessee by reason of its dispossession before the expiration of the term through the death of Alexander McClure, the clause was inserted which has been quoted in the eighth finding of facts above, their intention seeming to be that if the lessor could in any way secure peaceable possession to the lessee of the whole premises, although he owned a portion of them only for life, until the end of the term of twenty years, no claim for damages would arise in favor of the lessee. But while it is true that ordinarily the death of the lessor terminates the lease, “the whole question in each case is one for construction, and must depend upon the intentions of the parties.” Billings’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/106/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="106 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="455674" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0558-01">106 Pa. 558</a>. In the absence of anything showing a different intention, we would be forced to the conclusion that this lease terminated at the death of Alexander McClure. In this lease, however, we have the provision quoted in the foregoing findings of fact. ' And we have also the further provision that “ All covenants herein bind executors, administrators and assigns,” which, while in itself and by itself, is of no special significance, but taken in connection with the other provisions quoted, there is shown plainly an intention of the parties, that if the said lessor, through his executor, administrators and assigns, should in airy way secure the peaceable possession guaranteed, the lease would be binding upon the parties to the full end of the term thereof, and only in case of actual dispossession would the lessee be entitled to compensation for its improvements, and no other damages. The plaintiff claims it was dispossessed by operation of law, but it was not actually dispossessed, on the contrary all the parties interested have assured it peaceable possession for the full term of the lease, not asking any new or additional consideration, but only that it continue to perform the obligations of the lease to the end of the term thereof, as it seems plain, from the instrument itself, was the intention of the parties, provided it shall have the peaceable possession guaranteed -to it.</p>

This is answered by a reference to the clause guaranteeing possession of all of the premises, which guaranty being made good, it is not equitable to recognize any right to rescind the entire contract by reason of the technicality mentioned. In this connection it must not be forgotten that nearly all the coal in which Mr. McClure had a life estate has been mined and removed by plaintiff, only a small portion remaining, and most of that required to be left permanently, and that all the balance of the coal to be operated under the lease was owned by McClure in fee. This furnishes a strong reason in equity for refusing to permit the plaintiff to now have the contract declared void.</p>
