The particular part of this tract in which these three lots are located was purchased by him from Thomas H. Gesney, by deed dated April 1, 1873, duly recorded. Mr. Cochran was a well-known and successful real estate operator. He at once laid out this large tract of land in building lots, with streets and alleys. A plan was made in usual form, showing the location of the lots, etc., including the three lots of ground mentioned in this bill, which, for convenience, we shall hereafter designate as the park lots, the name by which they have been known at Norwood. Prior to this time this tract of land had been used as farm land and was surrounded by farms. These park lots were intended by Mr. Cochran for public use as parks. No deed of dedication was then made, nor has one been made since. As soon as the tract had been properly laid out, public sales were held, at which these lots, other than the park lots, were offered for sale. At these sales printed plans of the tract showing the streets, etc., and these lots were distributed with a lavish hand. There appear to have been at least three plans made of this tract, differing only as to minor de<a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>tails. In all of tbem the park lots appear without change of shape, dimensions or location. There were a number of public sales held, at all of them it was announced by Mr. Cochran that these park lots had been dedicated to the public for use as parks. This announcement was made repeatedly and was generally understood. The first sale was held on May 28, 1873. Many lots were sold at these public sales, and many were sold at private sale. To the purchasers at private sale the same information was given by Mr. Cochran as to the dedication of these park lots. So that it became a matter of public information at Norwood that these park lots were for public use as parks. These sales were extensively advertised in Philadelphia and Delaware county papers and by hand bills.</p>

It does not appear that trees were planted elsewhere. These park lots were used for Fourth of July celebrations, occasionally for fairs and church festivals. This, of course, was only in the summer, and not often in a single season. No public improvements were made on these park lots, no walks were laid, the grass was not kept cut, except by vagrant cattle: in these things they differed little in appearance from the many unimproved lots lying around them. The shrubs were destroyed, the evergreens and maples remained. The public character of the park lots was recognized by the township assessors, who made no assessment of them for purposes of taxation.</p>

Broomall obtained judgment against John Cochran for $2,000, and this judgment, obtained on a judgment note, was marked to the use of George Broomall, a fi. fa. was in due course issued on this judgment; and the park lots, inter alia, condemned. In the condemnation proceedings they are described as follows: “Also, all those three certain irregular lots or pieces of ground, laid out and designated in the aforesaid plan of Norwood as grass plots,” etc. On June 11,1883, these park lots, inter alia, were sold under an execution on said judgment as the property of John Cochran, and were purchased by George Broomall, the <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>plaintiff in the execution, who, with counsel, was present at the sale. Prior to the sheriff’s sale a number of the citizens of Nor-wood, alarmed at the danger of losing the park lots, having learned of the execution, held one meeting, or more, and organized for the purpose of protecting the rights of the public in the park lots. William Calhoun, one of the defendants in this case, took an active part in these meetings, and contributed to the fund raised to employ counsel. Competent counsel was employed, who prepared a notice of the claim of the public to the use of these park lots, which notice was read at the sheriff’s sale by Mr. Galloway, and prior to the sale of the park lots. This notice was not produced at the hearing, nor does it appear what it contained, except it was a notice that John Cochran did not own the lots. Mr. Calhoun had full knowledge of the dedication of these park lots to the public, and had himself, when endeavoring to sell lots, pointed them out to prospective purchasers as for public use. A short time prior to the sheriff’s sale, George Broomall had visited these park lots with his counsel. As stated, Wm. Calhoun had full knowledge of the dedication of the park lots prior to his purchase from George Broomall. A deed for these park lots, inter alia, was delivered by the sheriff to George Broomall on June 11, 1883. In this deed the park lots are described as “ three irregular lots or pieces of ground, laid out and designated on the aforesaid plan (referring to the plan of Norwood), for grass plots,” deed book T, No. 4, page 619. On September 15,1891, George Broomall sold these same three lots to William Calhoun, above mentioned, and on September 15, 1893, the said William Calhoun sold a part of one of them to Charles Lynch, B. Mitchell Newbold and Charles K. Swift, trustees. All of which deeds were duly recorded.</p>

Such legal notice or knowledge as he had, as far as the evidence shows, came from three sources:</p>

Winona avenue lies on both sides, or more correctly on all sides of two of these lots, and Huron avenue on both sides of the other. They seem to be a part of the streets in which they are located. Such lots are common in towns, and are usually used for public purposes.</p>

      <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>A visit to the lots themselves added very little information to the intending purchaser. No one was in possession of whom to make inquiry. While the public uses to which they were put might indicate the public understanding as to their character, there was little about their use to warn an inquirer. For nine months in the year the lots were not used at all for park purposes ; open lots were plenty, these would grow in importance as the open lots were built up ; eventually they might become necessary; trees had been planted on these lots, maples and evergreens and also shrubs, maples only on the sidewalks ; it does not appear that trees had been planted at all except upon these park lots and the sidewalks. After all, therefore, a visit would show little more than an inspection of the plan. No evidence of care, no seats, no fountain, no protection from stray cattle, not even the familiar “ keep off the grass ” sign, simply neglected open lots in the middle of the streets.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b654-5" data-blocks='[["BL_654.4",654,[228,1161,1181,659]]]'>Now was the plan and the fact that the lote were laid out on the ground in conformity thereto sufficient to put a reasonably prudent purchaser upon inquiry or to suggest that they might be intended for public use? While the public use probably tended to establish the fact of am acceptance of the dedication, it was too intermittent to warn any one of the fact; that no taxes had been levied on them might go to show their acceptance by the public authorities, it would be no notice to a purchaser unless brought home to him: there was evidence, too, as to the meaning of the curves and marks on these park lots as indicating a public use; as being marks used by engineers for that purpose, the evidence, however, was not satisfactory; it certainly -was not convincing to the referee.</p>

Such lots very often, if not usually, appear on the plan of large tracts thrown open for improvement, and are usually intended and marked for public use or public enjoyment. The fact that they are located in the middle of the streets would indicate that they might be intended for a use of similar character. In Schuchman v. the Borough of Homestead, <a href="/pa/111/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="111 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="545486" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0048-01">111 Pa. 48</a>, the court says: “ It is reasonably certain that the Homestead Company dedicated the land to the public use and that a number of persons purchased <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>lots expecting to enjoy the resulting advantage. However, nothing in the plan or in the course of title, or on the ground, was a warning of such dedication,” and therefore the purchaser acquired good title.</p>

They would be bounded by different streets, would not bo in the middle of a street, not a part of a street. It is apparent that these park lots are placed designedly that their peculiar shape and position were matters of intention, and that the streets at the points where they are situated were made to conform with them and accommodate them. They are clearly marked for a special purpose, and their location in the middle of a street, as a part of the street itself, clearly intended for public travel, might well indicate a public purpose for the lots as well.</p>
