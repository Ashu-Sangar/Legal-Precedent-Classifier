I have given these reasons to you, because men of sense like to know the reason of what they do. This rule is the reason why I have limited the evidence in this case to the difference in the value of the property before and after the destruction of that easement. That alley way was closed and that easement has been destroyed, as far as we know (and I instruct you so here), lawfully.

And we come to the simple rule, what was the difference in the market value of the property as affected by the destruction of this easement ? In other words, to make that plainer, how much more was the property worth with the alleys into Division street than it was worth without it ? [4]</p>
