This information was given by Mr. Lenny to Mr. Provost, who after consultation with the attorney for the fire company, gave a bond of indemnity against such liens. This bond was given o'n March 11, 1893, and upon the faith of it, the mortgagee’s agent at once parted with $2,000 of the balance of the mortgage moneys then on hand, which went to the contractor, Provost. In this bond Mr. Provost solemnly covenanted under his hand and seal, after reciting therein, “ it is desired to indemnify against” all mechanics’ liens, that he would “ at all times hereafter well and sufficiently save, defend, keep harmless and indemnify the said Moyainensing Hook &amp; Ladder Co., etc., its successors and assigns and the premises .... of and from all .... charges, liability, or expense on account of any claims or liens for work and labor done, or material furnished for and about the construction and erection of said building.” While this bond was given in terms to the owner of the building, according to the common practice, it enured to the benefit of the mortgagee of the owner, whose mortgage is already a matter of record. The fact is that the bond was given instead of a <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>release of liens, such as is usually given to the owner, where it is desired to secure a first mortgage loan on a property subject to mechanics’ liens, and the time for filing them has not expired. Had this paper been in the form of a release of liens and signed by Mr. Provost, as contractor, there can be no question but that it would have been good in favor of a mortgagee advancing money on the faith of it: Brown v.

Taking the contractor’s testimony alone, and excluding all else, his position amounts to this : That upon being informed that it was necessary for the fire company to have a release of mechanics’ liens before the mortgagee would advance any more money, he, the contractor, while declining to give a release of liens, agrees to give, and does give, in lieu thereof, his bond of indemnity, in which he covenants to protect the premises against such liens; that after signing such a bond he either advises or at least permits the agent for the mortgagee to be advised that the proper bond has been given; that upon this information the mortgagee hands over to the fire company $2,000 of the remaining mortgage monej'S, which upon the same day is turned over to the contractor; that at some time after the execution of this bond (when, the contractor does not state) it is taken to the Delaware County Trust Company, and there deposited, with <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>this memorandum indorsed upon it, at the direction of the contractor : “ To be held by Trust Company until Mr. Provost, the obligor, receives the balance due him, and so informs the company ; ” that with this bond in possession of the trust company, and still performing its function of drawing the mortgage moneys, he receives full settlement of the balance of the mortgage fund, such other moneys as the company can raise, and takes the fire company’s note for the balance due him; that at a still later date (when, he does not say) the contractor calls on the trust company and directs the following indorsement to be made on the bond: “ To be held until a certain note of $2,836.40 is paid, and this company is so informed by Mr. Provost; ” that he never communicated in any way to Mr. I. Engle Cochran, Jr., acting for the mortgagee, that his, bond had not been delivered and was not to be delivered until certain conditions had been performed; that, after getting all the mortgagee’s money, he appears at the trust company, demands the surrender of his bond and finally files a lien, in direct breach of his covenant, under which he now claims priority of lien over mortgagee, whose moneys were thus secured for his benefit.</p>

The owner of the property gained no security against liens from it. Mr. Provost did not offer any surety further than his own obligation. As far as the <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>owners were concerned, they were as well protected without this bond as with it. Upon being paid the contract prices the contractor would have been bound without any bond to this effect, to save the property from mechanics’ liens, and he so agreed in his contract. He was personally responsible, in the first instance, for every item of work and materials furnished under this contract, and the building cduld only be held liable in case he failed to pay the subcontractors and material men, and these claims could not be collected from him. His bond, therefore, as far as the fire company was concerned, was simply so much waste paper, and would never have been asked for or given unless it was to have been used for some other purpose than the protection of the company against liens. What the other purpose was is clearly shown by Mr. Provost’s testimony, namely, to enable the fire company to carry out its agreement with the mortgagee for a first mortgage loan and thus secure for the benefit of the company, and the contractor also, the remainder of the mortgage moneys.</p>

If the evidence shows he gave this bond and delivered it to the fire company without condition, and that the matter of any condition attached to the delivery Avas an afterthought, then surely under the authorities already cited, the contractor’s right to lien was extinguished absolutely by the mere fact of the giving and delivery of the bond.</p>

The only evidence of any condition, in regard to the delivery of the bond, is the memoranda indorsed thereon in lead pencil. This was done at Mr. Provost’s request. Upon what date these indorsements were made is not shown. But it is shown that neither mortgagee nor her agent had any knowledge of them, and hence as to her1 they can have no effect. There was not a word said to the title officer of the Trust Company, either by Mr. Provost or anybody else, so far as appears, about the bond being deposited with the trust company as a stakeholder. It was accepted by him in place of a release of liens. Upon the faith of it be paid over to the fire company for Mr. Provost, April 6, 1893, tbe balance of $1,284 of tbe mortgagee’s money which had been deposited for this purpose and delivered a title policy to the mortgagee, insuring her mortgage as a first lien. According to the testimony of Mr. Hinkson, the title officer in the Trust Company, it would seem that the bond was not delivered to him on March 11,1893, because he says it was accompanied by Mr. I. E. Cochran’s check for $1,284 for the balance of the mortgage loan which is dated March 23,1893. As there is ’no evidence that the check was postdated, and no reason appears why it should have been, then if Mr. Hinkson’s recollection is correct the bond was not delivered to tbe trust company until March 23, 1893, or later, Mr. Hinkson says it was about April 6. In tbe meantime where was it? Had there been no delivery of it? In tbe absence of any answer to these questions from tbe parol evidence, and in view of tbe fact that the question is, to say tbe least, enveloped in great uncertainty, we are bound to conclude that the asseveration in the instrument itself that it -was sealed and delivered on March 11, 1893, is verity. This being so, Mr. Provost’s right to lien was at that time irrevocably lost, and lie has no standing as a claimant before tbe auditor. Especially bas be none against tbe mortgagor wbo parted with the moneys for bis benefit upon tbe faith of the giving of this bond.</p>
