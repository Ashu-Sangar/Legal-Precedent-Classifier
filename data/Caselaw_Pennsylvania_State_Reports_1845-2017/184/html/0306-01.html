It provides that “ in any and every case where the father and mother of illegitimate child or children shall enter into the bonds of matrimony and cohabit, such child or children, shall thereby become legitimate and enjoy all the rights and privileges, as if they had been born during the wedlock of their parents.” The effect of the act was to add such persons to the class entitled to take under the intestate law; and the facts bring the present case clearly within its provision.</p>

In its terms, the act is general and makes no distinction between resident and nonresident parties. The undisputed facts of this case bring it clearly within the plain provisions of the act, and hence there was no error in holding that the appellee, whose deceased mother, through whom he claims, was born out of wedlock, but her parents afterwards married and died domiciled in England—may inherit a share in lands of which his uncle, ex parte materna, domiciled in this country, died seized and intestate, as fully as if his said mother had been born during the wedlock of her parents. There is nothing in the case that requires further discussion. The decree is affirmed on the opinion of the learned president of the orphans’ court, and the appeal is dismissed at appellant’s costs.</p>
