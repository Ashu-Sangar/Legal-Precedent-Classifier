    <p class="summary" id="b416-7" data-blocks='[["BL_416.13",416,[287,868,1179,1311]]]'>This action has been brought for a balance due on a bill for the sale of spirits of turpentine, the balance claimed being about $1,000. The sale and delivery of the turpentine, and the amount claimed, are conceded to be correct. [The defense -to-the payment, however, is, that the turpentine was purchased under a guarantee made by the plaintiffs to the buyers, the defendants, that it was pure. It is stated that it was bought by the defendants for the purpose of being used in the manufacture of varnish, and that when they did so use it in the manufacture of varnish they found that it was not pure turpentine, but that it was adulterated] [2] with petroleum or coal oil to such an extent as to vitiate the varnish which the defendants were making with the turpentine and. other ingredients. The defendants allege that they had the turpentine tested and analyzed by a chemist, and ascertained that it had in it petroleum or coal oil, to quite a large extent, and they have introduced testimony to show that the effect of such a substance as coal oil in turpentine, when used in the manufacture of varnish, was deleterious and injurious, and destructive of the varnish. The defendants claim that a large quantity of the varnish which they made with this turpentine was impaired in quality and made less in value than it would have been had the turpentine been good, and they say that they lost altogether on varnish manufactured with that turpentine, about $4,000, which you will perceive, is more than the amount claimed by the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b416-8" data-blocks='[["BL_416.14",416,[286,2198,1168,197]],["BL_417.1",417,[198,350,1168,198]]]'>[To that claim of the defendants the plaintiffs object, first, that they did not guarantee absolutely pure turpentine; that they took the order for, and sold, what they called spirits of turpentine as it is commercially known, or known among the <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>trade, without any guarantee or warranty of quality; that it was such as they were in the habit of selling to manufacturers of varnish generally, and that it was such turpentine as is known to the trade as spirits of turpentine.] [2]</p>

This testimony is introduced for the purpose of testing the bona fides or good faith of the defendants in making this defense, because it will be for you to determine, upon the testimony, whether parties who had turpentine which they claim was guaranteed to be pure, and which was not pure, and who offered to pay for it at a discount, and refused to exchange it for other turpentine which would be satisfactory, ought to be heard in making a defense when claim is made against them. It is, however, a question for you to determine. I express no opinion whatever upon it, but simply outline to you tbe main features of tbe ease:] [1] first, tbe claim for tbe turpentine, admitted to be just, so far as the amount is concerned; next, the defense that the turpentine furnished was of such impure quality as to be absolutely worthless to these defendants and injurious to their property, causing them a money loss of about $4,000, the reply on the part of the plaintiffs that they did not guarantee to sell absolutely pure turpentine, but sucb turpentine as was sold generally to parties engaged in tbe manufacture of varnish; <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>also, that when they made demand for the payment of their bill, they were tendered the money, provided they submitted to a discount of twenty per cent, that they refused to stand that discount, and that they then offered to take back the turpentine and furnish other and satisfactory turpentine in place of it.</p>

That the learned judge erred in not instructing the jury that if they found as a fact that the plaintiffs knew or were informed by defendants at the time of the making of the contract, that said spirits of turpentine was to be used by defendants in the manufacture of varnish, and that if the jury further believed that said spirits of turpentine as actually delivered to defendants by plaintiffs under said contract, was in consequence of its adulteration with petroleum oil, or other foreign substances wholly unsuitable or totally unfit for the manufacturing of varnish, and that the defendants in ignorance of the true nature of said admixture innocently and in good faith attempted to use same in the making of said varnish and thereby lost the value of said spirits of turpentine as raw material, and that all the defective varnish manufactured therefrom was worthless, unsalable and thrown upon defendants’ hands as a dead loss ; that then their verdict should be for the defendants, together with an award of a certificate for all damages believed by the jury to have been sustained by the defendants in the loss of large quantities of linseed oil, kauri or shellac gum, litharge, red lead, etc., innocently mixed and compounded by defendants <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>in their attempt to manufacture varnish from said adulterated spirits of turpentine.</p>
