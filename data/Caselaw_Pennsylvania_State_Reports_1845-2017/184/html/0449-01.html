Said Rohl acting for said firm of J. M.

Two months’ hire of the steamship was paid in advance, and from time to time thereafter the monthly hire for eight additional months was paid by the Mexican Company after adjustment and allowance of small claims by both parties. The hire for the month beginning January 19, 1893, and for the month beginning February 19,1893, was not paid. The failure to make said last two mentioned payments was due to the fact that said Mexican Company had become insolvent, and was no longer able to continue its business. The insolvency of said Mexican Company was admitted at the hearing before the referee. After the insolvency of said Mexican Company the defendants in this case and their cosurety, Benjamin F. Taylor, took possession of the vessel, and did succeed in obtaining some employment for her and in collecting certain money for her hire; but, failing to find steady employment for her, counsel for the said Mexican Company and said defendants and said Taylor notified the plaintiff that no further hire would <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>be paid, and said Mexican Company and defendants endeavored through their counsel <em>to </em>compromise with the plaintiff the liability incurred under the charter and upon the agreement sued upon in this action.
