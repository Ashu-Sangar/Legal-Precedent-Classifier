The case is au old acquaintance. The bill was filed May 8, 1891, and soon thereafter it was beard in court on, application for preliminary injunction and appointment of receiver. [We refused to appoint a receiver—not for lack of evidence justifying it, but as an exercise of discretion, believing that these parties, highly competent and respectable business men, would in the end Letter manage their affairs, and hoping that they would equitably settle their differences, and also on the defendants, Park Bros., who had absolute control of tbe gas supply, agreeing that Frank Wilcox should arrange the distribution of tlie gas supply so that the plaintiffs should have thereof, and Park Bro. &amp; Co., Limited, thereof. Afterwards it being shown to the court that the defendants had interfered and prevented this equitable division by turning off a part of plaintiffs’ supply, and tbe court having announced that unless-control of the division of the gas should be with some disinterested party a receiver would be appointed, the parties agreed on Frank Wilcox as such party, and the court having confidence in Mr. Wilcox’s competency and integrity, he was on June 9, 1891, appointed and put in charge of this distribution. On' February 12, 1892, tbe defendants, without consulting Mr.<a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>Wilcox, shut off the gas from plaintiffs’ mill, for the reason that plaintiffs were in arrears for some two months’ supply of gas. The court understood that Park Bros, had been regularly and monthly paid in cash in full their bill for gas. (My recollection is that an affidavit or affidavits to that effect was read at some stage of the case.) It now appears clearly that this was, to put it mildly, a mistake of the court, as the Parks had not paid for the gas received for several months before, but were credited for alleged damages by shortage of gas, which, settling with themselves as officers of the company, had been bringing the company regularly in debt to a large amount. Had the same harshness been exhibited towards Park Bros, that they (as officers of the gas company) meted to Clark &amp; Son, the gas would have been shut off from the former months before it was shut off from the latter. The court, at the time, was at least under a misapprehension of the facts, and again, in 1892, refused to appoint a receiver. A master was appointed. We had lost sight of the case. In September, 1896, it was argued on exceptions to the master’s report.] [12]</p>

The directors and officers arranged to supply themselves at a price far below market value, (a third or fourth of the market value). [When gas became short, they cut off the outsiders for their' own benefit, and worked harmoniously until the supply became short for themselves—this, about December, 1890, and then they began to quarrel, and instead of voluntarily selecting .some competent and disinterested person to make an equitable distribution, they each tried to get the advantage of the other. 'The Parks, through their employees, and all the officers and .all but one of the directors, being members of Park Bros. &amp; Co., Limited, had the decided advantage in this unseemly ■contest, and the Clarks failed to get their full share of the gas.] [13] In June, 1891, Mr. Clark was dropped from the board of directors, and the entire board and the officers were ■either members or employees of Park Bros.

There was no resolution passed by the board; there was no contract signed, and perhaps no distinct agreement, certainly no formal contract, as to terms ever made, further than the understanding that the gas was to be divided in accordance with the interest which each firm had in the stock of the gas company, that was to Parks, and ) | to Clarks. This was understood to be the then relative capacity of the mills, and provision was made for gas for additions to bo made to each mill, and the gas used in such additions was to be charged (by product) at forty per cent of the rates established by the associations of gas companies. Parks <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>were to pay for general supply $98,000 per year, and Claries. $21,000 per year; and charges were made and paid on this basis, until a shortage of gas raised raised a contention.</p>

Mr. Wilcox testifies that when he took charge of the distribution of supply, in June, 1891, the-cost of gas furnished Park Brothers, at this arranged price, was at the rate of 3j2^q. cents per thousand feet. Clarks’ would beat the same rate. At this time it is conceded that the supply had greatly fallen off. The gas obtained from the Commonwealth Company—at no time sufficient to furnish the for Clarks’ mill—had decreased until it was scarcely an appreciable-quantity. Taking the whole evidence, we are certain that taking the three years, from July 1,1889, to July 1,1892, the period of the contracts, the price paid under these contracts was not one half the market value of the gas actually supplied.</p>

Clarks declined to keep an account of this, claiming that it was not the agreement. Clarks’ contention was that they were not getting a fair division of the gas supply, and for that reason they were damaged by Park Brothers. W. G. Park, being president of Park Brothers, Limited, and president of the gas company, had credited to his firm on the books of the gas company these charges, including labor and a large amount of incidental expenses; in the eighteen months, January 1, 1891, to July 1, 1892, $321,376.45 ; and including similar charges, $3,004.01 for December, 1890, a total charge of $324,380.46 in nineteen months. In the month of June, 1891, when they were getting-a large but not full amount of gas at 3-j2^- cents per thousand feet, the counter charge is $13,839.34; and in January and February, 1892, the charges are $27,438 and $25,304.19 respectively. The entry of these charges on the books of the gas company was all the payment that has been made for gas by the Parks, for several months, since the year 1891, when they shut the gas off Clarks’ mill for nonpayment of the monthly bill—although the loss to Clarks was relatively greater than to Parles, and this <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>the Parks, officers of the company, knew. This was grossly unjust and a wrong. While each party was getting gas in proper proportion it made but little difference to them that it was at a nominal price below market value.</p>

But the present plaintiffs do not stand in the position of an innocent outside party. They are in the position of parties to the illegal arrangements, who have been overreached by their confederates.</p>

After reading it all, I am satisfied that Clarks had the worst of it. Parks had charge of the suppty—and except for a short time in the early part of 1891, when the Commonwealth Company’s supply was turned in—the gas had to pass Parks before it reached Clarks, and a valve above Parks’ mill was used to turn down the supply at Clarks’, and when Mr. Wilcox first examined, Parks had more than their share, and after he put in the necessary gaskets to distribute the gas, Clarks admittedly had more, and Parks less, gas than before, and the same thing was found when he was put in charge in the latter part of June, 1891. But it is impossible to now determine the amount of this difference. And up to IAbruary 12,1892, when the gas was turned off Clarks’ mill, it is fair to the parties to assume that, under the agreement to pay $98,000 and $21,000 per annum respectively, the parties were in equilibrio as to advantage.] [10]</p>

But assuming that the paper had been signed and stipulated in express terms for this liability, it would, under the circumstances, be void. At the time these alleged contracts were made it was notorious that gas wells were failing, and were liable to fail. The price of gas had been raised. It was usual in the contracts of gas companies to stipulate in time contracts against this liability. These <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>same parties, in dealing with others, uniformly put such a stipulation in their contracts. In making the contracts (if made) the officers and directors were making contracts for their individual benefit, and at prices merely nominal for the.gas to be furnished. A reasonable foresight would have anticipated the result of a liability for shortage—such as the testimony shows. If the claim of Park Brothers of $824,000 is allowed, the company was bankrupted thereby at or before the termination of the contract. A proportionate sum of $66,000 should be added for Clarks’ damages—-making $384,000 for nineteen months— thus eating up former profits and value of the property, and putting the company in such a condition that it could neither pay taxes to the commonwealth, nor perform the duties for which it obtained its franchise.] [11] The master was right in rejecting this entire charge of $324,380.</p>

They had Claries’ -i-| in addition to their' own share. If they had been paying for it by meter or paying by product at the then market price, it would have been as much and probably more than this amount.] [9] At July 1,1892, there was no pretense of any existing contract for supply of gas. Clark had been excluded from the directory and from all share in management of the gas company in June, 1891, and the Clarks had been deprived of their share of the gas in February, 1892. The Park Brothers were the sole directors, and the controlling officers of the corporation. They made no attempt to sell the gas product to any one. They did not permit Clarks to compete for it. They contracted with themselves for the entire supply at a price fixed by themselves. They permitted no voice but their own to be heard in the selection of the parties who would undertake to estimate the amount and value of the gas, but themselves fixed the price at $2,000 per month, and in the same way they reduced that price in November, 1893, to $1,200 per month. In the meantime, they, at the expense of the gas company, drilled nine new Avells—-most, if not all of which, were fair producers. No addition to the rental was made therefor; they also, at the company’s expense erected and operated a pump house and <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>pumps to increase the pressure; these together amounting in cost to nearly the whole amount with which they charge their firm with gas for the three years and eleven months from July 1, 1892, to June 1, 1896. The operating expenses were considerably increased thereby. The rentals received from use of pipes and the proceeds of sale of old material were also taken, and the company brought out in debt.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b215-5" data-blocks='[["BL_215.5",215,[190,1022,1172,1118]]]'>[There were two ways in common use as to fixing the amount of gas consumed. One, an easy way, and most accurate, was a meter (so arranged that the consumer could not manipulate it); another, a price on the product of the iron by the ton. One or the other of these methods was used by the independent companies furnishing gas to Park Bros, during this period. Having ignored all these reasonable methods of doing justice to others interested, they should not complain of a liberal allowance against them. On their side, is the estimate of their own selected experts, and the persuasive testimony of their witnesses as to the value of the coal it would take to run the entire plant. A sufficient answer to the testimony of the last witness is the amount of the bills for fuel claimed on shortage of gas from January, 1891, to July, 1892. The court coincides with the master in his estimate of the relative technical knowledge and experience and reliability of Mr. Wilcox as an expert—and with the estimate of his competency and fairness by all the partners, when in June, 1891, he was agreed on to make distribution of the gas between the parties. On the whole evidence we are satisfied that the amount of gas received by Park Bros, during this period was very much greater than the amount with which they have charged themselves.</p>

Then for a part of this period it is notorious that the iron and steel business was dull, and it is not probable that they ran constantly at night. Taking the whole testimony we are of the opinion and so find, that the charges made by the master for this period should be reduced by one third—and that with this reduction the defendants will have no good reason to complain of the remaining charge. It is as low as the evidence justifies. We do not mnderstand that either party objects to the master’s calculation of interest. The correction can therefore be made by deducting one third of the amount without a recalculation of interest.] [8]</p>

If it was improperly allowed the decree must be set aside. The averments of the original bill are : tlrat the Pittsburg Natural Gas Co. was incorporated mainly for the purpose of supplying natural gas to tlie works of the plaintiffs, William Clark’s Son &amp; Co. and those of Park, Bro. &amp; Co., one of tlie defendants; tbat each of the said parties contracted with the company for a supply of gas at its works for three years ; that since the gas company had become unable to furnish a full supply to both, Park &amp; Co. had, by the use of their power as owners of |-9 of the stock, obtained more than their proportionate-share of gas; that they were mismanaging tlie company and making fictitious charges against it, and intended by fraudulent contrivances to obtain a judgment against it, sell its property and become the sole owners thereof. Tlie prayers were for the appointment of a receiver to manage the affairs of the company, to defend the threatened suit, to secure a proper apportionment of the gas to the parties, for an injunction, etc. After an answer and replication had been filed, and but seven pages of the twelve hundred of testimony had been taken, an amendment was allowed by the court in which, it is alleged that the accounts between the Gas Co. and Park &amp; Co. were incorrect and fraudulent; that Park &amp; Co. had been using the entire supply of gas without making compensation therefor, and that a large sum <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>was due by them to the gas company. The additional prayers were for the appointment of a receiver to sell the property, and for an account.</p>
    <p id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[269,528,1173,1066]]]'>The subject-matter of the amendment was germane to and in <em>enlargement </em>of the substantial purpose of the bill, and there was no abuse of discretion in its allowance. It was based mainly on knowledge acquired after the filing of the bill, and it was asked for in accordance with the rules of court. The prayer for an accounting might have been added to those of the original bill. The Act of May 4, 1864, sec. 2, P. L. 775, permits amendments in proceedings in equity, at the discretion of the court, which affect the merits of the matter in controversy and expedite justice, in the same manner as obtains in common law cases and practice. Referring to this act, Sucajrswood, J., in the opinion in Wilhelm’s Ap'p., <a href="/pa/79/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="79 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="438454" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0120-01">79 Pa. 120</a> said: “We are thus by legislative mandate for rules as to amendments in equity proceedings, referred to those which prevail in ‘ common-law cases and practice,’ intending no doubt to incorporate all of the provisions of the acts of assembly, and to make one uniform system for both classes of suits,” and that while the limit of the power of amendment is that no new cause of action can be introduced, “ the true criterion is, as all the authorities show, did the plaintiff so state his cause of action originally as to show that he had a legal right to recover what he subsequently claims.”</p>
    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[266,1602,1172,806]],["BL_221.1",221,[227,363,1172,1735]]]'>The most important subject of controversy before the master was the charge of $324,380.46 made by Park <em>&amp; Go. </em>for fuel purchased by them to supply their works after the supply of gas received from the gas company became insufficient. This extraordinary charge was made at a time when Park &amp; Co., by reason of their ownership of seventy eighty-fifths of the stock, were in absolute control of the management of the gas company. A part of the time they were receiving the entire product of gas, and at no time were they charged with more than one fourth or one third of the market value of the gas. In the first year of their absolute control, during five months of which they received all of the gas the company was able to furnish, they credited it with $111,294.05 for gas used, and charged it with $262,467.80 as damages for a failure to furnish a full supply. If this charge rested on a lawful agreement, clear and distinct in its terms, it would have to be sustained, ruinous as it would be to the com<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>pany. The plaintiffs are not in a position to contest the legality of such an agreement, if made. They are not innocent stockholders of a corporation whose officers have made improvident and unlawful contracts with themselves. They were parties to whatever agreement was made with Park &amp; Co. and secured a like agreement for themselves; and in a proceeding to secure their individual rights only, in which no question of public rights or duties is involved, they are estopped. They claim however that no such agreement was made, and this claim is sustained by the testimony. No formal contract was made, no resolution was passed by the board of directors, and the minutes and books show no such agreement. It is extremely doubtful whether there was any understanding except for a division of the gas between the parties in proportion to the interest which they had as stockholders. The company was not organized or conducted with the intention that it should perform any public duty. Its franchises were obtained and used solely to serve the private interests of the stockholders. They agreed upon a division of the gas proportionate to their holdings of stock, and in all contracts with other parties they carefully provided against claims for damages by reserving the right to cancel the contracts. When the supply had been cut off from others, and became insufficient to supply their works they for a time lield out to eaob other the promise of a fair division. That this method of adjustment was considered by them is some indication of their understanding of their rights at the time, and that the unsigned memoranda now set up as evidence of an agreement to furnish a full supply were intended only to provide for a division of the supply. In fact, the only force these memoranda have as evidence of any understanding is that the parties apparently acted under them in making a division. After July, 1892, there is no pretense of a contract except such as was made by the officers of tbe company with themselves as members of a copartnership.</p>
    <p id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[232,2105,1171,291]],["BL_222.1",222,[249,373,1174,441]]]'>With what amount Park, Bro. &amp; Co. should be charged for gas used by them after July 1, 1892, is a question by no means free of difficulty. The difficulty results in part from their failure to use means to ascertain the amount tliey consumed when they were dealing with the property of the gas company as if it were their own. We find no reason however which <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>would justify us in setting aside the finding of the court upon the subject, and it is unnecessary to enter upon a discussion of it. By a motion to amend the decree attention has been called to an error in calculation made by the learned judge. In reducing the sum of $285,609.28 charged by the master for the use of gas from July 1,1892, to June 1,1896, one third, the amount of the charge is fixed at $170,406.19 instead of $190,406.19. This is clearly an error of calculation, and has been carried into the decree.</p>
