Dr. Hart stated that she used six hundred grains in a little over three days, and another witness stated it was one and a half ounces a week. The effect of the indulgence in these articles is presented in the testimony. Now, the drinking of whisky and the taking of opium did not necessarily incapacitate her from transacting business, but the fact of her indulgence, and the conduct on the part of Mrs. Heath, and her condition at the time of the execution of the \H11, and at times prior and subsequent thereto, are shown by the testimony, which, it is contended by the de* <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>fendant, indicate an enfeebled and shattered intellect, and that it destroyed her capacity to know and appreciate what she was doing. Most of the witnesses of the defendant confined her want of capacity to do business to a time some years prior to the making of the will. Some of the witnesses, and I think I may say all, have given certain acts and conduct and indulgence in liquor and opium by the testatrix, upon which they have based their opinion that Mrs. Heath, at the time of the making of her will, was not competent to do business, and as a consequence, not capable of making a will. The acts spoken of are of various kinds, such as foolish remarks, broken and disconnected conversation, appearing in her nightgown on two or three or perhaps more occasions, flighty at times and stupid at times, reckless in the care and disposition of her money, in bed a great deal of her time, never free from the influence of liquor and opium, and some witnesses say she had a defective memory of her doings from day to day; she requested different ones to prepare her will for her; that some time after her will had been made, she said she had been told she had made a will, and that it was through Samuel Heath; but that it was not her will; different money transactions are detailed, as tending to show want of capacity to do business. These things, and perhaps many others, which perhaps I have not recalled, but which counsel have directed your attention to, have been submitted to you as facts and circumstances upon which you are to pass, in connection with the entire evidence in the case. You will observe that I have not gone into the details of the evidence, but have merely intended to suggest to you what I consider to be an outline of the contention of the contestant of the will, and the general character of the evidence presented.

Testamentary capacity is the power or fitness of a person to make a will or a disposition of his property to take effect after death. It is the possession of a sound mind and disposing memory. In Wilson v. Mitchell, a case which the Supreme Court passed upon in <a href="/pa/101/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="101 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="500898" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0495-01">101 Pa. 495</a>, and reaffirmed subsequently in other cases, it is said: “ A man of sound mind and disposing memory is one who has a full and intelligent knowledge of the act he is engaged in, and a full knowledge of the property he possesses, and an intelligent perception and understanding of the disposition he desires to make <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>of it, and of the persons and objects he desires shall be the recipients of his bounty. It is not necessary that he collects all these in one review. If he understands in detail all that he is about, and chooses with understanding and reason between one disposition and another, it is sufficient for the making of a will.” And the authorities of the Court sustained that decision: Daniel v. Daniel, <a href="/pa/39/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="39 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="996279" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0191-01">39 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/39/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="39 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="996279" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0191-01">191</a>; </em>Tawney v. Long, <a href="/pa/76/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="76 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1038902" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0106-01">76 Pa. 106</a>. “ If from any cause he is so enfeebled in mind as to be incapable of knowing the property he possesses, of appreciating the effect of any disposition made by him of it, and of understanding to whom he intends to bequeath it, he is without the requisite testamentary capacity : Leech v. Leech, <a href="/pa/21/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="21 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="411507" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0067-01">21 Pa. 67</a>.” It is also a settled rule that on a question of testamentary capacity the opinions of witnesses are competent evidence when they state facts as the ground for their opinion, and their opinions are entitled to the consideration of the jury. What is mental competency to make a will or to give truthful testimony is a question which must depend very greatly upon the opinion of those who have had the opportunity of observing the conduct of the party and the power of the intellectual faculties. Facts and circumstances are to be sworn to as the groundwork of the opinions offered, and as affording tests of the soundness of their opinion: but the jury must primarily rely upon these facts and circumstances as affording a test of the soundness of the opinions given; in other words, do the facts and circumstances, in the judgment of the jury, warrant the expression of a sound opinion ? ■ If they do not, the opinion, in my judgment, can give no weight to the facts and circumstances. It may give weight to the facts and circumstances if you consider them sufficient, because there' are other things that may be involved in the opinions expressed— other things than those stated. If he does not state anything that warrants the opinion, then the opinion is not a sound one, and could not add anything to the weight of the facts. That is my judgment about opinions. As the law I give it to you. It has been held by our highest authority that neither age nor sickness, nor extreme distress, nor debility of body will affect the capacity to make a will, if sufficient intelligence remains. The failure of memory is not sufficient to create the incapacity, unless it be total, or extend to his immediate family or property. If it is sufficient to do that, that is all that is required. The <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>want of the recollection of names is one of the early symptoms of the decay of memory, but this failure may extend to a very great degree and yet the power of understanding remain. Wills are to be regarded as sacred things, and not lightly or inconsiderately to be annulled. Assaults made upon such instruments, therefore, demand careful consideration and satisfactory proof before they are permitted to prevail; and therefore a solemn writing of that kind, executed in due form and according to the requirements of law, and the will duly executed by testatrix of lawful age, is presumed to be the unbiased as well as the intelligent expression of the will of such testatrix, and on those who aver either testamentary incapacity or undue influence rests the burden of proof, and that would be upon the defendants in this case. [The making and executing of the paper not having been denied, testamentary capacity and the absence of undue influence are to be presumed, and such presumption stands until overcome by the weight of testimony;] [5] and in determining these issues, the variety of opinions expressed, their soundness and the veracity of the witnesses are matters practically in the province of the jury, and with which the court has nothing to do, so I am not stating anything with regard to the facts, but only giving the law which you are to apply to the facts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b69-5" data-blocks='[["BL_69.4",69,[189,1524,1164,858]],["BL_70.1",70,[259,345,1172,1627]]]'>When a will is drawn in favor of those occupying a confidential relation, who either write or procure it to be written, or whose advice is sought and taken in the making of the will, the burden rests on such beneficiaries to disprove undue influence, and they have accepted that burden by offering testimony to, show that no undue influence was used. [There is no evidence that the beneficiary solicited the bequest or wrote the will or procured it to be written, or that his advice was sought or taken. In such a case, intimate, friendly relations between the testator and the beneficiary, such as living with him and nursing him and managing his business, do not import undue influence, or shift the burden of proof from those who allege it.] [6] . . . . Extreme old age and the ordinary infirmities, physical and mental, incident to the intemperate use of opium, do not constitute in themselves testamentary incapacity, or undue influence. [The evidence, however, which tends to show mental incapacity, if joined with acts that tend to show that the testatrix was <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>under the will and control of others to the exclusion of all individuality, all thought and action on her part, then the evidence points to both testamentary incapacity and undue influence, with as 'much probability to one as the other;] [7] in other words, if the evidence does not establish testamentary incapacity, it may tend to- show undue influence, and, in like manner, if insufficient to establish undue influence, the evidence may tend to show testamentary incapacity. Although there is evidence on the part of the contestants, that Sirs. Heath indulged in the excessive use of whisky and opium, and was thereby rendered incapable of exercising testamentary capacity, and was unduly influenced in its execution by those around her, this alleged want of capacity must, from such indulgence, be shown to exist at the time of the execution of the will, and the incapacity produced thereby must go to the extent of disqualifying the testatrix from knowing and appreciating the nature, effect and consequences of the act she engaged in, in order to invalidate the will. If she managed and controlled her property and transacted her own business affairs, made her own contracts and purchases and payments, and the public and relatives and acquaintances dealt with her as capable in these respects up to the time of the making of the will and to the time of her death, it would indicate very strongly her capacity to make a will, notwithstanding the fact that at times, and it may be frequently, she was shown, by acts and conduct, by her conversation and her indulgence in the use of whisky and opium, that she was not in a fit condition for the transaction of business, because they do not necessarily import want of capacity in these tilings that have been suggested, unless thej'- have gone to that degree that at the time the will was made she had not the knowledge necessary to distinguish what she was doing, or that she was not a free agent from the control of other people.</p>

To constitute undue influence, in the language of Judge Woodward, there must be a present, constant operating on the mind of the testator in the very act <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>of making the instrument, and there must be some evidence tending legitimately to show that some fraud had been practiced at the time of the making of the will, or that some misrepresentation had been made, or that some physical or moral constraint has been exercised, so as to destroy his free agency. No moral or physical constraint is to be inferred from mental weakness alone. That undue influence which suffices to destroy an alleged will is distinct from weakness, and has no necessary connection with it. A man may be very weak and yet very competent to make a will; in other words, undue influence does not mean legally that influence which is acquired over a testator by acts of kindness or other acts of that character, calculated to inspire affection and confidence; neither does it mean honest advice or suggestions. If, in this view of the law, as I have stated the law on undue influence, you can see anything in the evidence that can fairly and reasonably be regarded in that light as undue influence, you will give it proper weight and consideration in your deliberations. Honest advice and kind acts and treatment do not import undue influence in the disposition made by the will.</p>

If the jury find that the testatrix has a daughter who was her sole natural heir, and who received no benefit under her will, and that the principal' part of the estate was given to strangers, these facts throw a strong suspicion on the validity of the will, and under these circumstances'strong proof of capacity and volition are required to sustain it, and slight proof of undue influence or fraud to set it aside. <em>Answer: </em>I am not willing to affirm this point as stated. I am not willing to say what degree of suspicion is thrown on the validity of the will by the facts stated, nor to say that the will is to be set aside by slight proof of undue influence or fraud. You have all the facts before you by which you are to determine the validity of the will and that by the weight of the testimony submitted to you. I do not think that the dispositions of the will are made to strangers in the sense that they are made to persons for whom the testatrix had no interest or personal connection. The Heaths were not strangers to a woman who was the Avidow of a Heath, and Amanda Messner who lived with her for a year and a half before her death, and Avho lived with her and her husband for several years on the farm, ought not to be regarded as a stranger to the testatrix.
