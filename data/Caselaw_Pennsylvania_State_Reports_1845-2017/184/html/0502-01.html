They shall nominate to the court such person as shall be a satisfactory colleague and be approved by the court for capability and good character.” He named as the executors of his will his son Charles H. Lafferty, his daughter Rose E. Lafferty (she being blind at the time of her appointment), the Right Rev. William O’Hara and Daniel Glackin. Upon the probate of the will Bishop O’Hara declined to act, and letters were granted to Charles H. Lafferty, Rose E. Lafferty and Daniel Glackin. Daniel Glackin subsequently died, and Rose Lafferty, widow of decedent, was appointed to succeed Mm. She died June 10, 1888, and on October 18, 1888, upon the petition of Charles H.

      <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>It is no slight task to consider the many questions arising upon the settlement of this account. On November 3, 1892, the seventh account of the executors and trustees was filed. It is entitled the account of the three executors, but is signed by but one of the number, viz: Patrick J. Corcoran. It should be entitled the account of the trustees, or executors and trustees, for the reason that all duties connected with the administration of the estate long since ended. And the real and personal estate were held and managed by the accountants as trustees. The trust estate consists of both realty and personalty, the former comprising a large number of dwelling houses and ground rents, and the latter both railroad, railway stocks, and bonds and mortgages upon real estate. The control and management of the estate, exclusive of any permanent investment made from time to time -by the trustees, seems to have been committed and intrusted by them to said Patrick J. Corcoran. Upon him devolved the duty of the collection of rents, interest and dividends, repair of the real estate, payment of taxes, etc., and the disbursement of the income in the payment of annuities and distributive shares, in such manner and at such times as he deemed proper and convenient. The office for the transaction of the business of the trust was in one of the dwelling houses of the estate, also the home of Rose E. Lafferty, a daughter of testator, and one of the trustees. At this office said Corcoran, with said Rose E. Lafferty, was in daily attendance." He was the bookkeeper for the trustees, and the few books required, such as rent book, cash book and check book were under his sole control, and the receipts and other vouchers were in his exclusive possession. As subsequently appeared, the books were kept in a negligent and inartificial manner. The trustees adopted the very proper and commendable custom of annually filing an account. When the time approached for the preparation of their seventh account it was prepared by counsel for the trustees; but was not satisfactory to Charles H. Lafferty, one of the trustees, for the reason that he had not examined it, nor compared therewith the vouchers, in the custody of his cotrustee Corcoran. The trustees had not for several years maintained, in their intercourse with each other, those relations of fraternal affection and friendly trust and confidence it was their duty to cultivate. <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>They had become unfriendly and estranged. And when the account prepared as stated was filed, without the concurrence and examination which Charles H. Lafferty desired, his dissatisfaction resulted in the employment by him of separate counsel. To add to his unwillingness to accept the correctness of the account and great dissatisfaction with the course adopted by his two cotrustees, Rose E. Lafferty and P. J. Corcoran, the account they filed as a joint account, by some misunderstanding or misinformation by counsel, was audited and confirmed nisi, unknown to said Charles TL Lafferty. The confirmation, however, was promptly vacated by the auditing judge upon the application of counsel for said Charles H. Lafferty. The account referred to as already stated was signed by said P. J. Corcoran alone, although it is to be presumed it was concurred in by said Rose E. Lafferty. It comprised the period beginning October 11, 1891, a,nd ending October 10, 1892, and embraced both principal and income of the estate. After the vacation of the confirmation of the account, it seems that the counsel for Charles H. Lafferty, after many and tedious delays, succeeded in obtaining the books and vouchers in the possession of his cotrustee Corcoran, and employed a professional and expert accountant, who entered upon a prolonged examination of the same. Notwithstanding the suggestion of the auditing judge as to the proper practice to be observed, and instead of proceeding with the audit of the account filed by Corcoran and correcting it by surcharge, or disallowance of credits, and treating it either as a separate account of Corcoran, or his joint account with Rose E. Lafferty, the said Charles H. Lafferty, refusing to be bound by it, and claiming his well settled light to file a separate account, the account already filed was disregarded by the common consent of counsel, and the expert accountant employed proceeded to laboriously prepare another account, beginning October 11, 1891, and continuing to December 81, 1894, more than two years beyond the period embraced in the account already filed.</p>

Lafferty. It was filed with the register on May 2, 1895, and finally reached before the auditing judge on June 10, 1895. This long delay of <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>more than two years, with its attendant great expense, could have been avoided if counsel had followed the usual and regular practice of the audit and examination of accounts filed by one executor or other fiduciary without the knowledge or approval of his coexecutors, trustees, etc., or alleged by legatees, creditors, etc., to be false or otherwise incorrect. The result is we have before us an account filed by one executor and trustee, but entitled the account of the three executors, and as to which his cotrustees are but constructively parties. Moreover, it is not confined to the period embraced in the account filed by Corcoran as before mentioned. But however irregular this mode of procedure, no objection was made either by said Corcoran or Rose E. Lafferty, and the audit of the account proceeded as if both were actually parties thereto. Both appeared by counsel and in person, either before the auditing judge or at the argument of the exceptions. All the trustees participated in the several matters in contest, two filed exceptions and all, by their counsel, took part in the argument. So that they must be held to have joined in the account, and therefore individually and collectively liable to the cestuis que trust, for the balance of principal and income which, by the account, they admit to be due the trust estate.</p>

As the accountants have no joint duty of distribution, the account filed therefore admits the joint receipt and custody of both the investments and moneys forming the corpus and income of the trust estate. But two of the trustees, however, notwithstanding they are parties to the joint account, seek to avoid this responsibility to their cestuis que trust by alleging that certain moneys of both principal and income were never received by them, but solely by their cotrusteo Corcoran, and misappropriated by him. However this may be, so far as respects the joint liability of the trustees, it can be of no avail. And it seems well settled by authority that tbe trustees, having filed a joint account and charged themselves with the whole amount of the estate as if collected and received by them, cannot thus evade liability assumed, and compel the cestuis que trust to look to one of the trustees for the amount it is alleged he misappropriated. Nor can they claim a severance in the account. They elected to treat it as a joint account, and are concluded by it. The proper course has been already pointed out, and if they did not elect to be bound by the account, in order to escape a personal liability, they should have refused to be made parties to the account filed by Corcoran alone, and proceeded to its audit and settlement and ascertained the balance due from him to the estate; then compelled him to file a further account of all moneys collected by him from the close of his account, to the date he was restrained by injunction from interfering with or <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>taking any part in the management of the estate. Thus the balance due by him individually of moneys his cotrustees allege were collected alone by bim would be ascertained, distribution made by directing tbe investments forming part of tbe principal of tbe estate to be delivered to bis cotrustee, if tbe same was not already in tbeir possession, and tbe balance of income to be paid to tbe cestuis que trust and annuitants in accordance with tbe will. This is tbe separate distribution, contemplated by tbe individual accounting of executors, etc: Heyer’s App. and Evangelical Asso.’s App., supra.</p>

Lafferty to file other than a principal account if tbe securities, etc., were in tbeir possession or under tbeir control, for it is conceded and shown by tbe testimony, that prior to tbe injunction against said Corcoran, neither of them collected or received any part of tbe bicorne of tbe estate. And any account filed by them of tbe income would include simply tbe money received since tbe date of tbe injunction. So, in like manner, by joining in tbe account filed by Charles H. Lafferty as a joint account, Rose E. Lafferty and P. J. Corcoran have made themselves parties to and are concluded by it, and it is now too late to escape Rabbity by endeavoring to maintain that it should be considered first, as a separate account of P. J. Corcoran, in order to ascertain tbe amount due individually by him; second, as a separate joint account of Rose E. Lafferty and Charles H. Lafferty to ascertain tbe amount to which they are <em>liable; </em>or, third, as the separate account of Charles H. Lafferty in order to determine bis individual liability.

With this conclusion, however, tbe majority of the court do not concur, and, as they <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>are of the opinion that the form in which the account is stated is immaterial, and its disposition by the auditing judge is proper, the exception to his refusal to hold the trustees jointly liable must accordingly be dismissed.</p>

The first obstacle, however, to the allowance of this claim is a question of law. The claimant alleges he was employed by two of the three trustees. In Hill on Trustees (1857), *305, the familiar principle is stated that trustees have all equal power, interest and authority with respect to the trust estate, As a general rule, therefore, they cannot act separately, but they must all join in any sale, lease or other disposition of the trust property, and also in a receipt for money payable to them in respect of their office. And in this they may differ materially from executors, who have a joint and entire authority, and any one of whom may effectually bind or dispose of the assets by his own individual act. And the principle of law, as applied to the eases of trustees, as well as other persons holding as joint tenants, is, that every act done by one of them for the benefit of the whole, shall bind the others, but not those acts which might tend to their prejudice. And where the act is for the benefit of the estate, the act of one will be binding on the others. Here, the employment of the claimant by two of the trustees, which imposed a charge upon the trust estate <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>without the knowledge or concurrence of the third trustee, cannot be held to confer a benefit upon the whole number of trustees, nor in the absence of the proof of valuable and meritorious services, of benefit to the trust estate. Again, in 1 Lewin on Trusts, 374, it is stated to be a well settled principle that if there be more than one trustee all must act together. In Vandever’s App., <a href="/watts-serg/8/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 405" data-case-ids="483398" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0405-01">8 W. &amp; S. 405</a>, it is held that in matters involving the exercise of discretion, cotrustees must join; one of them cannot bind the trust fund without the assent of the other.

For this reason alone the claim should be rejected. But, as a question of fact, two of the trustees, Rose Lafferty and Charles H. Lafferty, unequivocally deny any employment of the claimant by them, and the remaining trustee was not examined as a witness either in support of or in opposition to the claim. The only evidence approaching the dignity of proof of employment of claimant is that the trustee last referred to <em>“ </em>presented a bill in the claimant’s name to counsel for this service and said it was correct.” And so remote were the alleged services of claimant from being beneficial to the estate, the evidence shows that he was a meddlesome disturber of the builder and contractors. He was not the architect, and yet, wholly unauthorized, he interfered with and assumed to change the plans of one of the contractors, to such an extent that his sister and brother, two of the trustees, peremptorily directed the contractor to proceed with the work unmindful of him; and another of the builders testified that he impeded the work by useless directions. These facts clearly disprove any employment of claimant by the trustees and far outweigh the slight attempts to substantiate his claim. It should be disallowed, and the exceptions to the award to him are sustained.</p>

They did not bestow any clerical services in the collection of the income, nor any personal attention thereto whatever.

That the sum of $6,000, alleged to be paid to Patrick Lafferty by the trustee Corcoran, was never paid or advanced to him, and also that the sum of $5,592.85, alleged to be paid Charles T.

Lafferty, in the distribution of her share of the income, should be charged with the moneys of the estate, which it was alleged and shown that her cotrustee, P. J. Corcoran, had used for the benefit of the firm of P. Lafferty &amp; Go. and not repaid by him or said firm, upon the ground that she was a copartner with that firm, and therefore personally liable for the amount due to the estate. . It was denied by Rose E. Lafferty that she was ever a copartner with said firm. After a careful examination of the testimony, and all the facts and circumstances developed, the conclusion of the auditing judge is that she was not a member of the firm of P. Lafferty &amp; Co. To this finding exceptions are also filed. Thus a question of fact is again presented, and, as already adverted to, the conclusion of the auditing judge should not be set aside, unless clear error be made to appear from the evidence. No articles of copartnership were produced, but it is <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>beyond dispute that Patrick Lafferty and P. J. Corcoran were trading together under the firm of P. Lafferty &amp; Co. The evidence in support of the allegation that Rose E. Lafferty was also a member of the firm consists of the positive testimony of her brother, P. Lafferty, that she was a copartner with himself and Corcoran; the testimony of a well known and highly reputable member of the bar, who always “ understood” he represented the firm of Patrick Lafferty &amp; Co., and that the firm was composed of the three persons named, yet he had no personal knowledge that Rose E. Lafferty was a copartner; and .although two leases were prepared by him or under his supervision wherein it is recited that she was a member of the firm, yet he did not witness the execution by her of either lease, nor was her signature by “ her mark ” proved by any witness whatever. The result is that neither lease was admissible in evidence as against said Rose E. Lafferty. A single admission by Rose E. Lafferty that she was a member of the firm was alleged by the expert accountant employed by one óf the trustees to have been made by her to him on March 15,1894, while he was employed in the examination of books and vouchers of the trustees and preparing their account. And finally a promissory note signed individually by P. J. Corcoran, Patrick Lafferty and Rose E. Lafferty for moneys loaned by her sister to said Corcoran for the purposes of the firm. These comprise the material facts shown by the affirmative proof. But on the other hand, repeated declarations of Patrick Lafferty that he and Corcoran composed the firm, and that no one but himself was interested in the business, were proved.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b535-4" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[197,1802,1170,605]],["BL_536.1",536,[257,362,1173,1578]]]'>It was also proved that Corcoran admitted to the counsel for Rose E. Lafferty that he had no knowledge that she was a partner. And when urged to furnish the books of the firm for examination, he declared “ that Rose has got nothing at all to do with the business; never had anything to do with it; she is not interested in it; she has no right to look at the books; I will not lot them go out of my possession.” And when subsequently the books were obtained by the receiver of the firm, they contained no entries showing any transactions with Rose E. Lafferty. Nor until the books were in the custody of the receiver, Corcoran surreptitiously and without the knowledge of Rose E. Lafferty or the receiver, made entries therein whereby <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>she is credited with moneys paid or advanced to the firm. Again it was shown by the bookkeeper that he knew no other copartner than P. Lafferty and Corcoran. That the latter directed him to have cards printed, a copy of which was produced in evidence, which displayed alone the names of P. Lafferty and P. J. Corcoran as members of the firm, and that the same card was also published as an advertisement in several papers by direction of Corcoran. And finally Rose E. Lafferty, in the most direct and unqualified language denied that she was ever a copartner with Patrick Lafferty and P. J. Corcoran. And while she knew they carried on the business of brickmaking, yet she had no interest therein. That she never authorized Corcoran to use either her moneys or moneys of the estate in said business. That she never signed either of the leases mentioned, and never had any knowledge that moneys of the estate had been used by Corcoran for his own purposes until so informed by him. That she never had the conversation with the expert accountant related by him; nor admitted to him that she was a member of the firm of Patrick Lafferty &amp; Co. And as to the promissory note she signed, she became a party to it solely to induce them to give her sister some evidence or security for money loaned the firm. The facts thus shown, and in some instances by contradictory testimony, may be said to fairly raise a question of fact not wholly free from doubt. But the auditing judge had the witnesses before him, and was influenced in his conclusion as well by their manner as by their testimony. It was for him to decide as to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to what was said by them, and as the clear error, to justify setting aside the finding of the auditing judge, has not been made to appear, the exceptions to Ms conclusion must be dismissed.</p>

As to some of the former—especially the question, whether Rose E. Lafferty was a member of the firm of P. Lafferty &amp; Co.—the testimony was conflicting and contradictory, but we cannot say that the finding, as to either, was not in accordance with the weight of the evidence as it correctly appeared to the learned judge who had the witnesses before him, and thus possessed opportunities of forming a correct judgment that an appellate court cannot have. All the findings of fact, respectively, rest on sufficient evidence, and we must assume that they are severally correct until the contrary clearly appears.</p>
