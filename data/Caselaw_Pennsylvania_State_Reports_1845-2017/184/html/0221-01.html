The court restated the final account, disallowing credits for certain judgments and accounts not collected, and also reducing his claim for counsel fees and compensation, and charging him $3,000 with profits made out of decedent’s business. The court below filed no opinion setting forth facts and conclusions of law, but merely a decree restating the account.</p>

Indeed, it would not be surprising if the court below, in endeavoring to bring order out of the confusion, should have been mistaken as to some items, to the prejudice of the accountant; but a careful examination of the record as pre<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>sen ted has not convinced us that there is any such error. The appellees, doubtless weary of protracted and vexatious delays, are content to abide by the conclusion reached by the orphans’ court; and there is no reason why the appellant should not be required to submit thereto. In view of the evidence of carelessness and, to say the least, mismanagement in the execution of the trust, the court appears to have dealt leniently with this appellant.</p>
