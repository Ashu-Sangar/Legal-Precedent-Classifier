    <p class="summary" id="b648-4" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[234,403,1177,1365]]]'>Is this sufficient to take the matter out of the hands of the auditor, and send it before a jury to determine the question of title? In Welch’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20Pa.%20302" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="126 Pa. 302">126 Pa. 302</a>, the court says: “ The orphans’ court is essentially a court of equity, and its proceedings regulated according to the principles of equity. May not the court then look into this testimony upon this alleged claim of Daniel Welch sufficiently far to determine whether or not it has any foundation in fact ? For why should the court suspend proceeding in partition and compel the parties to go-into a court of common law with their action of ejectment to. determine question of alleged title, which upon a mere inspection of the testimony as it appears, is not sufficient to justifjr submitting to the jury.” In the case in hand we have a record title to four fifths of the real estate in question vested in Harry B. De Haven, with one fifth in Hannah Marshall. As against, this we have the naked allegation of Hannah Marshall in her petition that the shares of Mary Shields and Jane S. Young are still vested in their heirs. With the testimony as it appears before your auditor of the regularly executed releases, the execution of which indeed nowhere appears to be denied, no court would permit a verdict against De Haven to stand. The auditor does not understand the rule to be that a mere allegation of dispute in title ties the auditor’s hands and compels the court to award an issue in the common pleas. So far as this branch of the case is concerned the auditor is clearly of the opinion that the inquest awarded upon the petition of Harry B. De Haven should stand.</p>

    <p id="b649-4" data-blocks='[["BL_649.8",649,[216,540,1175,1009]]]'>The pleadings do not develop a case of disputed title. DeI laven’s petition presented a case of an apparent title to an undivided four-fifths of the real estate in question, supported by his muniments of title. The petition of Hannah A. Marshall contained nothing but a mere allegation of title, unsupported by conveyances or proof of any kind. The matter having been referred to an auditor he reported that no testimony was offered in support of the Marshall claim, while the petition of Do Haven, was sustained by actual proof of the title claimed, .and that this proof was not impeached in any way. Upon this state of the testimony the auditor was right in sustaining the proceeding upon the DeHaven petition. The orphans’ court so thought and sustained the report, and in so doing there was no error. At the bar of this Court a verbal suggestion was made that the deed of release made in 1840 by Mary Shields and Jane S. Young and their husbands was not separately acknowledged by the wives. As no question upon that subject was raised before the auditor or the court below, nor by any assignment of error in this Court, we make no decision in reference to it.</p>
