    <p class="summary" id="b441-5" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[219,404,1170,1270]]]'>The testimony taken shows that about April, 1895, the plaintiff applied to the law firm of Thomas J. Martin &amp; Bro. (composed of Thomas J. Martin, Jr., Esq., and Frank P. Martin, Esq.), to secure a loan on his interest in his mother’s and grandfather’s estate; that the firm made efforts to secure the loan but for a time without any success. In July, 1895, tlie defendant did pay to the plaintiff 8800. What this payment was for is a disputed question. The plaintiff says that it was a loan. The defendant says it was paid for the purchase of tbe interest. Mr. Frank P. Martin says that early in July, 1895, be informed the plaintiff that he could not secure the loan and that subsequently the plaintiff and defendant concluded tbeir negotiations (having met in tbe firm’s office) and that tbe defendant acted in the matter upon information as to the quantity and value of tbe plaintiff’s interest in the estate referred to—■ given to Mm by tbe firm. The papers that were finally executed show that whatever the parties called tbe transaction it was in effect a pledge of the plaintiff’s interest in his grandfather’s, his grandmother’s and his mother’s estate, for while he by one paper assigned this interest to the defendant, the latter agreed to reassign at any time within a year upon payment to him of 8530, which is the consideration named in the assignment, and with one year’s legal interest added. The plaintiff received but 8300. Tbe defendant, however, paid 8173.30 to Thomas J. Martin &amp; Bro. for attorney fees and expenses.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b441-6" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[221,1684,1166,707]],["BL_442.1",442,[249,350,1173,343]]]'>The plaintiff admits that he agreed, when seeking the loan, to pay a bonus of $200, and both Frank P. Martin and tbe defendant testify that tlie plaintiff agreed to pay all the legal expenses, and was told that they would be 8200. Just what these services were worth was not shown, but it appeared that to ascertain what estate tlie plaintiff bad and its value, involved the study of three wills, tbe examination of the title <em>to </em>three or four properties and an ascertainment of tbeir value, besides inquiry as to tbe value of liis personal estate in tbe trustee’s hands. The plaintiff has requested the trial judge to find as matter of fact that 850.00 would be a proper sum to charge for legal fees, expenses and costs. No testimony has been produced to show that sucb would bo a proper charge. Tbe trial judge, upon the testimony before him, is unable to find that the sum <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>paid by the defendant to Thomas J. Martin &amp; Bro., that is, $173.20, is an unreasonable or excessive charge. Besides, the plaintiff seemed willing to pay $200 to secure the loan. While he terms it a “ bonus ” it seems fair to conclude that he expected t.o have to pay $200, and it would seem to be corroboration of the defendant’s statement that the plaintiff knew the expenses would be $200.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b442-9" data-blocks='[["BL_442.8",442,[238,1424,1174,299]]]'>The defendant contends that he is the absolute owner of the plaintiff’s interest in the three estates referred to and denies that the paper executed by him, agreeing to reconvey within one year upon payment of $530, has any validity or binding effect. As authority he cites the act of June 8, 1881, which provided:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b442-10" data-blocks='[["BL_442.9",442,[235,1733,1174,503]]]'>“ No defeasance to any deed for real estate, regular and absolute upon its face, made after the passage of this act, shall have the effect of reducing it to a mortgage, unless the said defeasance is made at the time the deed is made and is in writing, signed, sealed, acknowledged and delivered by the grantee in the deed to the grantor, and is recorded in the office for the recording of deeds and mortgages in the county wherein the lands are situated within sixty days from the execution thereof and such defeasance shall be recorded and indexed as mortgage by the recorder.”</p>

The answer was filed September , 1896. There was then no idea in the mind of client or counsel that the agreement to reassign was not valid and binding. In Brown v. Beecher, <a href="/pa/120/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="120 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="559714" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0590-01">120 Pa. 590</a>, the Supreme Court held that the act applies to deeds for real estate only. The paper executed by the plaintiff is in form an assignment. It is so called in the acknowledgment. It assigns all the plaintiff’s “right, title and interest of whatsoever kind or nature, either at law or in equity of, in and to the estate of ” the plaintiff’s mother, grandmother and grandfather, “and to all and every part of each and every of said estates and the proceeds thereof.” It likewise constitutes the defendant the plaintiff’s attorney to recover and receive the said “ right, title, interest, legacies, gifts, and estates.” Whether there is a power of sale in the grandfather’s will with directions to convert the real estate into money; whether there is any of the mother’s estate in real estate now ; whether the interest conveyed by the assignment is an interest in real estate even in part, the defendants have not shown, and the trial judge feels justified in holding, therefore, that the assignment was not “ deed for real estate,” and that therefore the act of 1881 does not apply.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b443-5" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[199,1534,1169,863]]]'>This conclusion is strengthened by the acts of the parties. If the interest conveyed was real estate, the Messrs. Martin would have prepared a deed describing the real estate ; they would have left out much that was put in the assignment, and (this seems conclusive on the subject) they would have seen to it that the agreement to reassign was drawn and executed, acknowledged and recorded in strict compliance with the act of 1881. Not to have done so would have been an act of chicanery on their part so utterly at variance with their duty to the plaintiff, by whom they were being well paid for their professional services that it would be a serious reflection upon them as members of the bar to sustain the defendant’s present contention. The plaintiff should therefore have a reassignment upon payment by him of the sum borrowed and the expenses incurred by the defendant, and as he did not tender the defendant the full amount which he should have tendered, he should pay the costs.</p>
