Bishop of Durham, 9 Yes. 399, where the bequest was for such objects of benevolence and liberality as the trustee in his discretion should most approve, and other English cases that, as the bequest here <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>is for benevolent as well as charitable uses, it is void for uncertainty. In Witman v. Lex, 17 S. &amp; R. 88, Gibson, C. J., in commenting upon Morico v. Bishop of Durham, said that such a gift would probably be uphold in <em>Pennsylvania; </em>but there have been no cases cited of our Supreme Court directly in point; there are, however, from other states. In Sal tons tall v. Sanders, <a href="/mass/93/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 Allen 4" data-case-ids="313683" data-case-paths="/mass/93/0004-01">11 Allen, 4</a>,46, Mr. Justice Gray sustained a trust “for the furtherance and promotion of good morals, and in aiding objects and purposes of benevolence and charity.” On page 468 he said, “The decisions of the English courts since our revolution are of no binding authority on this Court, and upon such a question as the interpretation of the word ‘ benevolence,’ as connected with ‘ charity,’ of no particular weight when opposed to the well settled meaning of the words in our own law.” And on page 470, “Whatever therefore may be the meaning in the law of Massachusetts of the word ‘ benevolence ’ by itself there can be no doubt that when used in connection with ‘ charity ’ it is synonymous with it.” A still stronger case is Rotcli v. Emerson, <a href="/mass/105/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="105 Mass. 431" data-case-ids="713045" data-case-paths="/mass/105/0431-01">105 Mass. 431</a>, where a gift to trustees “to be by them applied for the promotion of agricultural or horticultural improvements or other philosophical or philanthropical purposes at their discretion” was sustained as a charitable bequest. In Goodale v. Mooney, 60 57. H. 528, the following bequest was sustained: “ I place the remainder of my property in the hands of my executors to be distributed by them after my decease, among my relatives and for benevolent objects.” On page 534 the Court said: “ In many cases the word ‘ benevolent ’ has been coupled with ‘ charitable ’ or some equivalent word, or has been mentioned in connection with such public institutions as to show an intent to make it synonymous with charity.” They are also synonymous in their ordinary meaning. See Webster’s Dictionary.</p>

But it is contended that Wm. Robinson, as the sole surviving executor, had. not the flower to designate the beneficiaries under the residuary clause. If the power were incident to the persons of the executors and not to the office, this position would, perhaps, be well taken. The testator provided that the seleo<a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>tion of the beneficiaries should be made “ by my executors or their successors.” The distribution of the residuary estate was not to be made until after tbe death of his wife; and it is not probable he anticipated that the beneficiaries would be designated until then, and his wife, as executrix, would not therefore take part. The word “successors ” appears to indicate that he intended the power of selection should be exercised by the persons filling the office after his wife’s decease; and the power seems to be annexed to the office, and not to the person. ■ In Perry on Trusts, sec. 499, it is said, “The question is whether the donor reposed a personal trust and confidence in the trustees appointed, or whether he reposed the power in whomsoever might in fact fill the office of trustee.” And in Hill on Trustees, 489, “ Where the power is annexed to the office of trustees aiid one or more of the trustees refuse to accept the trust, it is settled that those who accept may exercise the power.” We think the surviving executor had power to designate the beneficiaries, and as they are all charitable to some extent, his designation is valid and distribution must be made accordingly.</p>

The words are merely precatory, created no trust, and did not in any way qualify the absolute gift to her. The legacy lapsed by reason of her death before the testator, and as the will contains a general residuary clause, and it is evident it was the intention of the testator to dispose of his whole estate, the lapsed legacy falls into the residue, and must be distributed as part of it to the beneficiaries designated by the executor: Gray’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/147/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="147 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="829776" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0067-01">147 Pa. 67</a>; Powell’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/138/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="138 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="11251797" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0322-01">138 Pa. 322</a>; Reimer’s Estate, <a href="/pa/159/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="159 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="850207" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0212-01">159 Pa. 212</a>.</p>
