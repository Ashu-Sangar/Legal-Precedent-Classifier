Stanton, two of the above named defendants, demised to Danzinger &amp; Company the premises situated at Nos. 42 to 50 Sixth street, and also upon Penn avenue, near Sixth street, in the city of Pittsburg, for the term of five years from April 1, 1893, at the annual rental of §24,000, payable in quarterly instalments of §6,000 each, in advance, on the first days of April, July, October and January of every year during the term. The premises thus let consisted of the first stories and cellars of Nos. 42, 44, 46, 48 and 50 Sixth street, the first and second stories and cellar of the Penn avenue building, two rooms over the back part of stores Nos. 46 and 48 Sixth street and one over No. 50 Sixth street. From April 1,1893, to the time of the sheriff’s sale hereinafter mentioned, Danzinger &amp; Company occupied and used those storerooms and the premises described in said lease as one establishment, where they carried on an extensive retail trade as <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>merchants, having a large and varied stock of dry goods, notions, millinery, men’s and women’s furnishing goods, women’s coats, cloaks and wraps, light household furnishings, pictures, bric-a-brac, china and glassware. This stock was estimated to be worth at the date qf the sheriff’s sale from $70,000 to $75,000, and almost the entire stock was purchased by the plaintiff at the sheriff’s sale referred to. On December 24,1895, this stock was in position upon the shelves and counters of the various storerooms referred to, the china and glassware and similar goods being in the basement. Danzinger &amp; Company, at different times during the quarter beginning October 1, and ending December 31, 1895, paid the rental of $6,000 for that quarter, so that on December 24, 1895, no rentals under the lease were due. On or shortly before December 24, 1895, Danzinger &amp; Company confessed judgments to twelve creditors, aggregating between $50,000 and $60,000, and on December 24, 1895, executions upon all of those judgments were issued and placed in the hands of the sheriff, who, on December 25, 1895, seized all the goods of Danzinger &amp; Company in the said stores, closed the establishment and advertised the stock for sale. In pursuance of such advertisement, the sheriff, on the 2d, 3d and 4th of January, 1896, proceeded to sell the entire stock contained in those stores at public sale, closing his sale on the morning of January 4,1896. On January 4,1896, D. L. Stern, the plaintiff, having by an arrangement previously made with the execution creditors referred to, bought almost the entire stock of the several stores as trustee for those creditors, received possession of the goods thus sold him by the sheriff and began an inventory and arranged his purchases to put the stock in order, returning to the shelves such goods as had been taken from them for the purposes of sale, and which had not been sold to others. On January 9,'1896, the goods being then upon the demised premises, and rent for the quarter ending March 31, 1896, having fallen due January 1, 1896, and then remaining unpaid, the landlords, William and Ellen I. Stanton, issued their landlord’s warrant addressed to Joseph Weber, constable, as bailiff, and he by virtue of such warrant, on the morning of that day, levied upon the stock so purchased by Mr. Stern and remaining upon the demised premises as hable to distraint for said rental. Plaintiff immediately sued out his writ of replevin, <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>gave bond to the sheriff, and the goods distrained were delivered to him by the sheriff and the cause proceeded to trial under the pleadings.</p>

It is clear, however, that neither the person who wrote it nor the person who dictated it could testify to its contents without proof of its loss, or at least of an effort and an inability to produce it. It is sufficient to say of the rejection of the offer to prove the contents of the letter that the grounds for the introduction of such evidence if relevant and competent were not laid.</p>

An extraordinary case, like a hurried removal of goods from a building on fire, furnishes no measure of the reasonable time required for the removal of the goods in this case.</p>

The 9th and 10th assignments complain of instructions to the effect that the plaintiff was entitled to a reasonable time in which to remove the goods, and the 11th and 12th assignments complain of the refusal of the court to hold that the alleged inaction of the plaintiff during a part of that time authorized the defendants to distrain the goods before tbe expiration of it. The court, however, in the general charge and the answer to the plaintiff’s second point, virtually instructed the jury that if they found from the evidence that the plaintiff, on the day before the goods were distrained, informed the defendants or their agents that he did not intend to remove the goods, and that it was his purpose to keep them where they were until he could sell them, he could not recover. It seems to us that this instruction was as favorable to the defendants as they could reasonably expect. The goods were turned over by the sheriff to the plaintiff Saturday evening, January 4, and they were dis-trained by the defendants Thursday morning, January 9. As the reasonable time allowed for their removal did not include the nighttime or Sunday it must be held to date from the 6th of January. The plaintiff testified that on the 6th they were busy in picking out and delivering the goods bought by other parties, and that he spent all of the next day in looking for a place to put the goods purchased by him. On the 8th of January there was an interview between the parties in which the defendants were represented by Watterson, Black and Gloninger, and the creditors for whom the goods were purchased were represented by the plaintiff, Cohen and Israel. The plaintiff testified distinctly and positively that at this interview it was agreed that he should occupy the premises, prior to April 1, <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>for such time as he might need them for the disposal of the goods, and that for the time he actually occupied them for that purpose he should be chargeable with and pay rent at the rate of $2,000 per month. The testimony of Cohen and Israel was equally distinct and positive in support of the agreement as stated by him, while their testimony and his was flatly contradicted by the testimony of Watterson, Black and Gloninger. Of course if the jury found the agreement as claimed by the plaintiff that of itself entitled him to recover. On the question whether he had a reasonable time in which to remove the goods before they were distrained there was not much conflict in the evidence. The plaintiff testified that he had an experience of fourteen years in removing goods, and that it would take from two to three weeks to remove the goods in question if proper care was exercised to prevent damage to them. Rothschild, who superintended the removal of the goods to Kaufman’s testified that it took from ten to twelve days to remove them with from five to ten wagons and from twenty to thirty men, and that a larger force could not “ have been practically put upon the work.” Purvis, who was employed at Kaufman’s was charged with the duty of receiving and caring for the goods as they were brought there, and he testified substantially as Rothschild did as to the time taken and the force employed in removing them. Hoeveler, a witness called by the defendants, had a storage house and vans and wagons for moving goods. He had been in the business seven years, and he testified that it would take five days to move the goods to his warehouse and put them into store so they could be removed again, and that in removing them he “ would use four vans, four wagons and the necessary horses, men and clerks.” His estimate of the time within which he could remove them did not include the time required to suitably pack and arrange them for removal. The foregoing summary of the evidence relating to the defendants’ claim that the plaintiff informed them on the 8th of January that he did not intend to remove the goods; to the claim of the plaintiff of an agreement under which he was to occupy the premises until he disposed of them; and to the reasonable time required for the removal of them, sufficiently discloses the issues of fact between the parties.</p>

It is practically conceded by the defendants that the plaintiff did not have sufficient time in which to pack and remove the goods before the 9th of January, but they contend that as he did not pack and remove any of them before that time he lost or forfeited his right to the reasonable time the law allowed for their removal. Is their contention sound? We are clearly of the opinion that it is not. If it is, it logically follows that the defendants could have distrained the goods on tbe 7th of January, although the reasonable time required for their removal was ten days. They claim that there is authority for this contention in Gilbert v. Moody, 17 Wendell, 354. In that case the goods sold and subsequently distrained were in a dwelling house, and consisted of household furniture which could readily have been removed, and no reason or excuse for delay was offered on the part of the plaintiff. The sale was made by the sheriff in the afternoon of Saturday, the 14th of July, and the goods remained on the leased premises until Tuesday morning, the 17th of July, when they were taken by the defendants under a distress warrant for rent. “ The goods might have been conveniently removed on Saturday afternoon, at a trifling expense.” Nelson, C. J., in delivering the opinion of the Court, said : “ Goods levied upon by execution are considered in custodia legis until the proper time for the sale and a reasonable time after the sale for the purchaser to remove them: 2 Brod. &amp; Bing, 362; 1 Maulé &amp; Sel. 711; Brad by on Dist. 84. What is a reasonable time is a question of law when there is no dispute about the facts. It is apparent from the evidence that the removal of the goods could have been effected in a few hours; the whole of Monday was clearly a sufficient time for that purpose.” It will be noted that in the case cited the goods were distrained after the reasonable time for their removal had expired, and no reason or excuse was assigned for the delay. It bears no resemblance in its facts to this case, and it furnishes no support for the contention based on the defendants’ second and fifth points.</p>
