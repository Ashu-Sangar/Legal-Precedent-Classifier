On March 13,1897, the sheriff acknowledged a deed for the same property to H. F. Doris. After the expiration of three months these proceedings were instituted by McAllister. They were admittedly regular up to the appearance of Downs, who made affidavit that he did not hold all the premises, but only a certain part which he designated, and that he held that part under H. F. Doris and not under Boyle. A summons was then duly issued to Doris as required by the act. He appeared and made affidavit that he did not claim the same by, from or under the defendant, as whose property the same were sold, but by a different title, “to wit: by a deed from Harvey A. Lowry, Esq., sheriff,” setting out the place of record, etc., and showing its date to be March 13,1897. It does not appear from the affidavit that the land was conveyed to him by a sheriff’s deed founded on a judgment against Boyle, nor whose interest was conveyed to him by the deed. The alderman, however, allowed the deed to be put in evidence before him by the petitioner, and it thereupon appeared to be a deed for the interest of Boyle in the land. If Doris had confined himself to the terms of the act without specifying his title there would be no question that it was error in the justice to proceed: Hawk v. Stouch, 5 S. &amp; R. 159. There is nothing in the affidavit itself which contradicts the general allegation that he does not hold under the defendant, and it was held in Hawk v. Stouch, supra, that after affidavits taken in the terms of the act the justice could not go further into the inquiry, either by the cross-examination of witnesses or on the testimony. But we are not satisfied that one who purchases land from the sheriff can bo properly said to claim the same by, from or under the defendant in the sense of the act, and where there are two or more sheriff’s sales of the same <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>property, it may well be that the second sale conveys the better title by reason of the priority of the lien on which it was founded or for other reasons. It certainly was never intended that such questions should be tried by justices of the peace.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[241,551,1170,453]]]'>We are of opinion that the affidavit of Doris was sufficient to stay the proceedings because it conformed to the terms of the act and nothing to the contrary appeared on its face, and further, because even if the magistrate had a right to inquire further and to discover that Doris claimed by a subsequent sheriff’s sale of the defendant’s land, that would not destroy the effect of his affidavit. The first assignment of error must be sustained. The others, except so far as they cover the same ground as the first, are dismissed.</p>
