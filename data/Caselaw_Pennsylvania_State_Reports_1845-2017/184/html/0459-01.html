The mere fact that the driver had his hand back adjusting his chair at the time of the accident is not enough to convict the defendant of negligence.</p>

The first point to be established is whether the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant. It is not enough to show that a very painful accident has happened, and, therefore, the person who caused the accident has to be punished. You must be satisfied it whs caused by the negligence of the defendant in the case. Now, it is contended by Mr. Strohlein, a witness on behalf of the plaintiff, as to the nature of this accident, that he saw the accident as you have heard, and that this car was going at an unusual and improper rate of speed: running, he calls it, and I <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>suppose by that he means very fast, but exactly the gait he cannot clearly state, but that the car was running at a great rate of speed, and at sixty or sixty-five feet from this crossing, with nothing to obstruct the view of the driver, the driver negligently ran the child down. That is his testimony. Of course, that would make, as I have had occasion to state, the other side not having been presented, a case of apparent negligence proper for you to decide. The defense is that this was an unavoidable accident. The question you have to decide is, first, is the defendant guilty of negligence, and in the second place, is the person who has complained of the injury guilty of negligence? Has he contributed to the injury he has sustained ? If he has, the law don’t undertake to show which is the most to blame, but if the plaintiff is to blame, he has no right to recover. Of course, that rule of law does not apply to children of the age of this one. The law does not allow that they can be guilty of contributory negligence; but you are obliged to consider the case as to the negligence alone of the defendant. There is, however, this apparent exception, although not a real exception to the rule. [If you were driving along the street with your horse and wagon, and a child runs under the feet of the horses, and the child is billed, you are not <em>responsible; </em>not because the child is guilty of contributory negligence, but because you are not guilty of negligence. If it is an unavoidable accident, you are not responsible, and so in this case consider the testimony of the three ladies who have testified here. If you should consider that this child “popped up suddenly out of the ground,” as one of the witnesses says, before the driver, and it was so sudden and unexpected that he was unable to pull in his horses sufficiently to prevent the accident, you would have no right to attribute negligence to him.] [1]</p>

The driver told you distinctly what he was doing, and I don’t agree with the counsel for the plaintiff in this case that if the driver put his hand back to adjust his chair that that constituted such carelessness or negligence as would justify a verdict against the defendant. You might as well say a man has no right to blow his nose, because he cannot be looking ahead while he is doing it. The law^says that as long as a man is attending to the business of-his road he is <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>not guilty of negligence, and for such an act as that you would not be justified, in my opinion, to say that the mere fact of a man adjusting his chair to consider him guilty of negligence.] [2]</p>

To prove the correctness of this, however, it is necessary to ascertain what are the duties of a driver of a car on approaching street crossings. They are, we submit, certain duties which he must at all times fulfil. It is his duty to keep his eyes fixed upon the street in front of him, to slow up his horses at the crossings, and to have them under control when approaching crossings, where he must always expect that children of tender years and aged and infirm persons may be liable to cross. This duty is fixed by law, and a failure to perform it is negligence: Mulhair v. Railway Co., <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.N.C.%20508" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 W.N.C. 508">6 W. N.
