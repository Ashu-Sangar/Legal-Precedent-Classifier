    <p class="summary" id="b662-6" data-blocks='[["BL_662.6",662,[265,592,1176,1324]]]'>The petition avers neither new matter nor after-discovered proof. Indeed it was conceded on the argument that the demurrer must be sustained unless errors in law appear, as specified in the petition, upon the face of the accounts ; upon the body of the decree: Russell’s Admr’s App., <a href="/pa/84/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="84 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="1053594" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0258-01">84 Pa. 258</a>. We are satisfied that the petitioner’s specifications fail to point out any such errors. It may be that the accounts suggest that business was conducted; that expenses were incurred, and that payments were made of a somewhat irregular and questionable character, such as upon exceptions having been interposed at the proper time and proof having been made of loss incurred by the estate and disadvantage suffered by the exceptor, might have deprived the accountants of some of the credits claimed. It is probable that if exceptions had been taken to the credits claimed for payments in- full to creditors of the estate, and it had been made to appear that there were other creditors, and that there was reason to doubt whether the estate would pay in full, the accounts might have been modified. However this may be, we are satisfied that none of the matters specified in the petition constitutes error in law apparent on the face of the record. They are matters, not void but voidable, at most, only on proof of extrinsic facts. It may further be noted that the petition fails to aver that the accountants have not paid out the items since the confirmation under the adjudicated accounts. This in itself would seem to be fatal under the authority of Russell’s Admr’s Appeal, supra.</p>
