Defendant demurred to the statement. <em>Held, </em>(1) that plaintiffs were guilty of contributory negligence in allowing the stopcock to remain ■covered up for a year and a hall'; (2) that the covering of the stopcock was entirely too remote and speculative to form the basis of a cause of action ; (3) that the mere emission of gas from the broken pipe without the intervention of another agency would not have caused the fire; (4) that judgment for defendant on the demurrer was properly entered.</p>

D. 1893, and for several years prior thereto, plaintiffs were the owners of a mill property at the southeast corner of Tenth and Columbia avenue, and extending east to Hutchinson street, in the city of Philadelphia. In this mill property plaintiffs had a large quantity of stock, goods, machinery, boiler, engine, shafting and fixtures and they were engaged in the manufacture of yarns. In operating said mill plaintiffs made use of tlm gas furnished by the city of <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>Philadelphia, supplied by pipes leading from the gas main in Columbia avenue into said mill. In front of said mill property on Columbia avenue, there was provided and existed a mode of access to said gas pipe leading from the main into said mill, whereby the flow of gas into said mill could be turned on or off by means of a key inserted into the stop-off of the gas pipe, and this key was used from the surface of the street and reached the gas pipe through a wooden pipe leading from the surface of the street down to the gas pipe. The defendant, the Philadelphia and Reading Terminal Railroad Company, desired to make said Columbia avenue cross its railroad between Ninth and Tenth streets, over a bridge instead of at the surface grade, and in furtherance of that object the city of Philadelphia passed an ordinance dated the 26th day of December, A.D. 1890, to change the grade of said Columbia avenue (ordinance of 1890, page 428), a copy of which is as follows:</p>

This change of grade was made by the servants and employees of the defendant, filling up the bed of said Columbia avenue with dirt, soil and refuse, gradually elevating it, from Tenth street eastward until at said Hutchinson street it was elevated about twelve and a half feet above its prior grade. The said servants and employees of the defendant in doing said work, during the months of March and April, 1892, so improperly, carelessly and negligently filled in the said bed of Columbia avenue that they utterly failed and neglected to keep said access to said gas pipe in the street free, open and unobstructed, but, on the contrary, recklessly and carelessly filled up, obstructed, closed and covered up the same with the said dirt, soil and refuse to the depth of several feet, so that no access to said gas pipe could be had, nor the location of said stop-off be discovered. The said work of changing the grade of Columbia avenue, in front of the plaintiffs’ property, and the filling in of the bed of said street by the defendant, was carried on continuously during the greater part of the months of March and April, 1892.</p>

M., a fire broke out in the cellar of the plaintiffs’ mill, which cellar was then occupied by a tenant.- In a few minutes the heat from the fire melted the gas pipe off at the meter in the cellar, which permitted the gas to flow from the main - pipe in the street into the building, and which flow of gas fed the flames. An effort was. then almost immediately made- by the plaintiffs to stop the flow of gas by turning it off at the stopcock in the sidewalk, but the plaintiffs then for the first time discovered that it had been covered up by the defendant while doing the work of filling in the bed of Columbia avenue. In consequence of said covering up it was impossible to discover where the said stop-cock had been originally located.</p>

In consequence whereof, and by reason whereof, the said mill property of plaintiffs, with the stock and machinery therein, were entirely and totally destroyed.

As the plaintiffs’ statement contains this averment it is taken to be true, and defeats their action. It is also true that the covering of the stopcock had nothing to do with the cause of the fire, on the facts set forth in the statement, and in any other aspect of that fact it was entirely too remote and speculative as the basis of a cause of action. It could only be a matter of conjecture whether the building would not have been destroyed by the fire in any event, whether the gas was escaping or not, and the jury could not be permitted to guess upon such a subject. The proximate cause of the loss of the building was <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>"the fire, and the question whether the fire could have been put ■ out if the gas had not escaped could not possibly be determined. The mere emission of gas from a broken pipe wotdd not have ■ produced fire, and it required the intervention of another agency, to wit: fire, to cause the destruction of the building. There . are other reasons equally fatal to the cause of action apparent in the statement, but it is not necessary to consider them. The .assignments of error are not sustained.</p>
