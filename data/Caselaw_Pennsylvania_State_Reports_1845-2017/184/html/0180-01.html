The contract under which the money was advanced provided that the debt was to be liquidated by tolls at a certain specified rate. The <em>contract was to </em>expire at the end of forty years, and if at that time the amount advanced had not been paid by tolls, the unpaid portion should be canceled. After the bridge had been reconstructed, and at- a time when-both parties were willing to carry out the contract, the city within whose limits it was situated commenced proceedings in the court of common pleas to condemn it, under the Act of Assembly of May 26,1893, P. <em>L. </em>154, authorizing cities .... to purchase, maintain, use and condemn bridges,, etc., but afterwards determined to acquire the control of the bridge by the purchase of the entire capital stock of the bridge company, which it did, and held it in its own name, with the exception of thirteen shares placed in the names of certain city officials. Subsequently the street railway company brought an action against the bridge company to recover the portion of the money advanced which had not been repaid by tolls under the agreement. <em>Held, </em>that, whether the case should be treated as one <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>against the legally constituted bridge company, of which the city was the stockholder, or as substantially a suit against the city as the purchaser of the mere physical structure of the bridge, plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>

Prior to the year 1889, the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Passenger Railway Company, a corporation under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania, was the owner of and operated a horse passenger railway which ran along Smithfield street and over the bridge of the defendant corporation. In the year 1889, the passenger railway company desired to change its motive power from horses to cable, and the bridge as then constructed being such that cable power could not be used in crossing it, the railway company requested the bridge company to make such changes in the bridge as would fit it for the use of cable cars, the changes necessary to be made were agreed upon, and a contract entered into between the Pittsburg and Birmingham Traction Company, which stood in the place of the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Passenger Railway Company, and the Monongahela Bridge Company, which authorized tlie use of electricity as a motive power in addition to the cable.</p>
