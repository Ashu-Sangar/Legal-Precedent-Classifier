At the special meeting on November 30, 1895, when the bid of Johnston was accepted, he being the only bidder, the names of those voting in the affirmative and negative are not entered on the minutes, in face of the fact that Telford refused to vote, and that shortly after the vote was taken, Mr. Gilmore insisted that he had voted “No,” and demanded that the secretary enter upon the minutes the name of each member and how he voted.

The agreement the school board did make with Mr. Johnston was entirely different—it was to take down the schoolhouse and open a 40 ft. street so as to connect Larimer avenue, laid out in the Mellon plan, with Larimer avenue in the borough of Turtle creek, and to pay a price for the rest of the ground on a different basis than that advertised, with three annual payments and a ninety days sci. fa. clause. We are of opinion that the board of directors had no power to make such a contract, differing so entirely from the public advertisement. It was substantially a private contract.

There was only one bidder and one bid, and that was Johnston and his bid. Nobody was injured. The advertisement had done its work. Johnston was the only man who wanted the property. The details of the agreement were certainly within control of the board. A modification of the time of payment, bearing interest for the extended time, meant no loss to the board.</p>

    <p id="b293-6" data-blocks='[["BL_293.7",293,[225,706,1173,1071]]]'>The vote of the members of the board of directors on the question of the sale of the school property is found by the court not to have been a unanimous vote, and there is no record of the vote as it was cast. The provision of the fourth section of the Act of April 11, 1862, P. L. 471, that in the levying of taxes, the purchase and sale of real estate, the location or change of location of schoolhouses, and the appointment and dismissal of teachers, “ the names of the members voting both in the affirmative and negative shall he so entered on the minutes of the board by the secretary,” has been held to be more than merely directory. The necessity of recording the vote in the manner prescribed by the act was recognized in Tobin v. Morgan, <a href="/pa/70/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="70 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="1028197" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0229-01">70 Pa. 229</a>, in the levying of a tax, and in School Dist. v.

In School Dist. v. Mercer, <a href="/pa/115/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="115 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="551631" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0559-01">supra,</a> it was said by the present Chief Justice: “ They are wise and wholesome provisions, intended to correct gross abuses which had gradually crept into the administration of our school sj'-stem, and hence it is not too much to insist upon a substantial compliance with the spirit, if not the very letter, of the act.”</p>

These departures, both as to the amount of the land sold and as to the terms of payment, were material, and the board was without power to make them. The approval of such action would open the door to gross abuse of power.</p>
    <p id="b293-8" data-blocks='[["BL_293.9",293,[224,2093,1177,300]],["BL_294.1",294,[256,348,1174,299]]]'>The court found that there was no fraud or collusion, and that all of the school directors acted in good faith. They overlooked the requirements of the statute and exceeded their power in departing from the terms of the advertisement. There was no improper conduct on the part of the purchaser, James W. Johnston, and there is no reason why he should be charged with <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>any part of the costs. He is of course entitled to recover back the flOO which he paid on account of the purchase money, but we can make no order to that effect. We think that all of the defendants should be released from the payment of the record costs, and that they should be placed on the school district of the township of Wilkins, and it is so ordered.</p>
