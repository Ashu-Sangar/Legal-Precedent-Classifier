We then held that the character of the defendants\u2019 possession, and whether it was held under the alleged renewal \u2022 of a former lease made by the borough councils or as tenants from year to year, was a question of fact to be decided by the jury. The case went back for a new trial upon that question. The new trial has been had and lias resulted in a finding that the extension of the old lease authorized by a borough ordinance, which changed the notice to quit so as to require one year\u2019s notice to be given tbe defendants, was in force when the-notice to quit was given in this ease. Even if the effect of the lease so renewed was only that of a lease from year to year, we-do not see why the time agreed upon as that which the defendants should have before being required to surrender possession, was not binding upon the parties. Upon \u201cthis finding by the-jury, the result reached is correct. The defendants had the-benefit of the one year\u2019s notice. They did not surrender possession when the year closed. The proceedings begun after the-year expired were justified; therefore, they were regularly conducted, and have resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.\nUpon this verdict the judgment was rightly entered, and is-now affirmed.",

Walters et al., trading as the Wheatley Cadets, Appellant.\nLandlord and tenant\u2014Expiration of terms\u2014Notice to quit.\nA landlord extended a ten years\u2019 lease for a further period of five years with a proviso that the lessee should quit and surrender up possession at any time upon one year\u2019s notice so to do. On proceedings to obtain possession under the act of December 14, 1863, the jury found affirmatively that the extension of the old lease was in force when a one year\u2019s notice to quit was given to the lessee. Held, that, even if the effect of the extended lease was only that of a lease from year to year, the one year\u2019s notice provided for in the agreement to extend was binding upon the lessee, and after the expiration of the year, he was no longer entitled to possession.\nArgued Feb. 7, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 90, Jan. T., 1897, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Chester Co., Oct. T., 1888, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Stebbett, C. J., Gbeen, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from judgment of justice of the peace in proceedings to obtain possession under the landlord and tenant act of December 14, 1863. Before Hemphill, P. J.\nThe case was previously reported in 147 Pa. 501, where the facte appear.\nDefendants\u2019 points and the answers thereto among others were as follows:\n2. To establish a renewal of the lease, the jury must find that the proposition of the town council, as set forth in their resolution of June 2, 1885, was submitted to the defendants; that the terms and conditions of said proposition were understood and accepted by them, and that they remained in possession of the premises in pursuance of that agreement. The resolution, itself, without more, is not evidence of such an agreement, and is not binding upon the defendants, and they were entitled to three months\u2019 notice to leave prior to the end of the current year, viz: May 5, 1888, or hold possession on until May 5, 1889. Answer: That point is affirmed, with this qualification or interlineation, \u201cthat it was submitted to the defendants (or their agent, if they had one) \u201d and \u201c that the terms and conditions of said proposition were understood and accepted by them (or their agent).\u201d In other words, by the introduction of the word \u201c agent \u201d in the alternative, they or their agent, because what a man can do by himself, he can do by an agent. [8]\n3. The resolution of town council of June 2, 1885, may be regarded as an offer or agreement upon the part of the town council to make a lease upon the terms and conditions therein set forth, but in order to hold the defendants to its terms and conditions the jury must be satisfied from the evidence that the said offer was submitted to them and accepted by them, and they remained in possession of the premises in pursuance of such resolution and the acceptance thereof. Answer: That point is affirmed, with the same qualification I made in the second point, \u201c or their agent,\u201d it must be \u201csubmitted to them (or their agent),\u201d and \u201caccepted by them (or their agent).\u201d So qualified it is affirmed. [4]\n7. If the jury find that an agreement for the renewal of the old lease for five years was entered into between the borough of Phoenixville and Lewis R. Walters et al., as set forth in the resolution of council of June 2,1885, then, as a matter of law, such a parol lease, being for more than three years, created a tenancy at will, which by the subsequent payment of rent became h tenancy from year to year, and required three months\u2019 notice prior to the end of the term, viz : May 5,1888, to entitle the plaintiff to the remedy given by the act of 1863. Answer: That point as stated I must disaffirm. [1]\n8. Under the statute of frauds the attempted renewal of the lease on or about June 2,1885, was void, and the defendants became tenants from year to year, and no notice having been served upon them requiring them to quit on May 5,1888, they were entitled to hold possession for another year from that date. Answer: That point is also disaffirmed. [2]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendants appealed.\nJErrors assigned among others were (1-4) above instructions, quoting them.\nV.
