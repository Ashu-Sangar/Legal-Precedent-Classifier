Indeed, it would not be surprising if the court below, in endeavoring to bring order out of the confusion, should have been mistaken as to some items, to the prejudice of the accountant; but a careful examination of the record as presen ted has not convinced us that there is any such error. The appellees, doubtless weary of protracted and vexatious delays, are content to abide by the conclusion reached by the orphans\u2019 court; and there is no reason why the appellant should not be required to submit thereto. In view of the evidence of carelessness and, to say the least, mismanagement in the execution of the trust, the court appears to have dealt leniently with this appellant.\nWithout referring in detail to the specifications of error, it is sufficient to say that there is nothing in the record to justify us in sustaining any of them; and neither of them requires discussion.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs.",

T., 1897, by W. H. Martin, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., May T., 1896, No. 27, restating final account of said executor.\nBefore Sterbett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that the accountant filed five different accounts, all showing great confusion. The court restated the final account, disallowing credits for certain judgments and accounts not collected, and also reducing his claim for counsel fees and compensation, and charging him $3,000 with profits made out of decedent\u2019s business. The court below filed no opinion setting forth facts and conclusions of law, but merely a decree restating the account.\nErrors assigned were as to various refusals of allowances, and as to surcharges.\nH. L. Castle, with him James M. Nevin, for appellant.\nJ. J. Miller, for appellees.\nJanuary 3, 1898 :"
