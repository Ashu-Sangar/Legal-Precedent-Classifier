The questions raised in both cases are substantially the same and a separate discussion of them in each case is wholly unnecessary; for the reasons given in the opinion in the appeal of the Crescent Oil Company, ante p. 245 the judgment lias been reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.\nThe appeal in this case is dismissed.",
