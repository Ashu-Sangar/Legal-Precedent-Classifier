The defendant was an innocent pledgee of the certificate, and was perfectly at liberty to advance money upon it, and take it as collateral, divested of all claims on the part of the owner. Under all the authorities a transfer executed in such circumstances confers a good title upon the person buying it or advancing money upon it.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Clara A. Gilbert, Formerly Clara A. Lukens, Appellant, v. The Erie Building Association.\nStock\u2014Transfer of stock\u2014Pledge\u2014Corporation.\nWhere an owner of stock executes a power of attorney on the back of' the certificate in the usual terms of such instruments, without any restrictions, qualifications or conditions, an innocent pledgee of the certifioatefrom one who is in lawful possession of it holds it divested of all elaimson the part of the owner.\nArgued Jan. 20, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 346, Jan. T., 1897, by-plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., March T., 1894, No. 1078, on verdict for defendant.\nBefore Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nInterpleader to determine the ownership of fifty shares of theCatawissa Railroad Company.\nAt the trial the evidence showed that about July 23, 1891, Joseph McDonald borrowed from Laughlin & McManus, stock brokers of Philadelphia, $700, for which he gave them his promissory note, and in order to provide collateral security therefor he obtained from his daughter, Clara A. Gilbert, who was. the owner thereof, the certificate of stock in suit, with a blank power of attorney attached thereto, said power being executed by Mrs. Gilbert and witnessed by her husband, E. D. Gilbert,which certificate and power of attorney McDonald delivered to Laughlin & McManus as security for his note. On September 22, 1892, while the loan to McDonald was still in continuance and unsettled, Laughlin & McManus borrowed Cor their own use from the Erie Building Association the sum of |5,000, and as security therefor delivered to the association the said certificate of stock and power of attorney, first adding to said-power of attorney under the signature of Mrs. Gilbert, the words-\u201csignature guaranteed, Laughlin & McManus\u201d together with twenty shares of stock of the Tradesmen\u2019s National Bank. The stock in question was never transferred from Mrs. Gilbert on the books of the Gatawissa Railroad Company, and the representatives of the Building Association made no inquiry as to its ownership.\nThe following is a copy of said power of attorney:\n\u201cKnow all men by these presents, That I, Clara A. Lukens,. for value received, have bargained, sold, assigned and transferred, and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell, assign and transfer unto Fifty (50) shares of the Capital Stock of The Catawissa R. R. Co. standing in my name on the books of the Company and do hereby constitute and appoint my true and lawful attorney, irrevocable Cor me and in my name and stead but to use to sell, transfer and set over all or any part of the said Stock,, and for that purpose to make and execute all necessary acts of assignment and transfer, and one or more persons to substitute with like full power, hereby ratifying and confirming all that said attorney or substitute or substitutes shall lawfully do by virtue hereof.\n\u201c In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal the 23rd day of July, 1891.\u201d\n\u201c Claba A. Lukens. [Seal]!\n\u201cNow Clara A. Gilbert.\n\u201c Signature guaranteed,\n\u201c Laughlin & McManus,\u201d'\n\u201cSealed and delivered in the presence of \u201cE. D. Gilbert.\u201d\nOn April 17, 1893, Mrs. Gilbert notified the Catawissa Railroad Company of her claim to the said stock, and on February 4, 1895, and February 6,1895, the Erie Building Association notified the Railroad Company of its claim thereto, whereupon the Railroad Company filed a bill in equity, out of which the feigned issue arose.\nThe court gave binding instructions for defendant.\nVerdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was in giving binding instructions for defendant. \u25a0\nElias P. Smithers, with him Samuel S. Craig, for appellant.\nIt is submitted that in the present case the fact that the power \u2022of attorney was to sell and not to pledge was sufficient to have \u2022caused the defendant to have inquired as to the ownership of \u2022the stock: Wood\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 379; Ryman v. Gerlach, 153 Pa. 205; Leiper\u2019s App., 108 Pa. 377.\nIt is well settled in this state that a power to sell does not include a power to pledge; that letters of attorney are to be .strictly interpreted, and the authority is never to be extended beyond that which is given in terms. A person who deals with .an agent acting under a power of attorney deals at his peril if the authority is exceeded: Strohecker v. Farmers\u2019 Bank, 6 Watts, 99; Heffernan v. Addams, 7 Watts, 120; Devinney v. Reynolds, 1 W. & S. 333; Baring v. Peirce, 5 W. & S. 551; Campbell v. Foster Home Assn., 163 Pa. 632.\nAnother circumstance that should have put the officer of the building association upon inquiry is that Laughlin & McManus put upon the power of attorney under Mrs. Gilbert\u2019s name the words \u201c signature guaranteed, Laughlin & McManus.\u201d\nAgain, Laughlin & McManus, who were brokers, in borrowing from defendants, a building association, were acting out of the usual course of their business: Burton\u2019s App., 93 Pa. 214.\nE. Hunn Hanson, with him C. T. Quin, for appellee.\nA certificate of stock accompanied by a power of attorney to transfer is in the hands of the holder presumptive evidence of ownership-\u2014an ownership in nowise differing from the real and actual one, and therefore justifying, not only a sale, but any lesser disposition, by one who is a bona fide h older for value, and without notice of an interfering equity: Holbrook v. N. J. Zinc Co., 57 N. Y. 616; Prall v. Tilt, 28 N. J. Eq. 479; Wood\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 379.\nFebruary 7, 1898:"
