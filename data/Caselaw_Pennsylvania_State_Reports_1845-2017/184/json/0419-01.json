D. 1895.\n\u201c (Signed) John Regn. [seax.] \u201d\nBeitlee, J., found, the facts to be as follows:\nThe testimony taken shows that about April, 1895, the plaintiff applied to the law firm of Thomas J. Martin & Bro. (composed of Thomas J. Martin, Jr., Esq., and Frank P. Martin, Esq.), to secure a loan on his interest in his mother\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s estate; that the firm made efforts to secure the loan but for a time without any success. In July, 1895, tlie defendant did pay to the plaintiff 8800. What this payment was for is a disputed question. The plaintiff says that it was a loan. The defendant says it was paid for the purchase of tbe interest. Mr. Frank P. Martin says that early in July, 1895, be informed the plaintiff that he could not secure the loan and that subsequently the plaintiff and defendant concluded tbeir negotiations (having met in tbe firm\u2019s office) and that tbe defendant acted in the matter upon information as to the quantity and value of tbe plaintiff\u2019s interest in the estate referred to\u2014\u25a0 given to Mm by tbe firm. The papers that were finally executed show that whatever the parties called tbe transaction it was in effect a pledge of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in his grandfather\u2019s, his grandmother\u2019s and his mother\u2019s estate, for while he by one paper assigned this interest to the defendant, the latter agreed to reassign at any time within a year upon payment to him of 8530, which is the consideration named in the assignment, and with one year\u2019s legal interest added. The plaintiff received but 8300. Tbe defendant, however, paid 8173.30 to Thomas J. Martin & Bro. for attorney fees and expenses.\nThe plaintiff admits that he agreed, when seeking the loan, to pay a bonus of $200, and both Frank P. Martin and tbe defendant testify that tlie plaintiff agreed to pay all the legal expenses, and was told that they would be 8200. Just what these services were worth was not shown, but it appeared that to ascertain what estate tlie plaintiff bad and its value, involved the study of three wills, tbe examination of the title to three or four properties and an ascertainment of tbeir value, besides inquiry as to tbe value of liis personal estate in tbe trustee\u2019s hands. The plaintiff has requested the trial judge to find as matter of fact that 850.00 would be a proper sum to charge for legal fees, expenses and costs. No testimony has been produced to show that sucb would bo a proper charge. Tbe trial judge, upon the testimony before him, is unable to find that the sum paid by the defendant to Thomas J. Martin & Bro., that is, $173.20, is an unreasonable or excessive charge. Besides, the plaintiff seemed willing to pay $200 to secure the loan. While he terms it a \u201c bonus \u201d it seems fair to conclude that he expected t.o have to pay $200, and it would seem to be corroboration of the defendant\u2019s statement that the plaintiff knew the expenses would be $200.\nThe conclusions reached on the testimony are:\n1. That the assignment by James P. P. Huston to John Regn, bearing date the 29th day of July, A. D. 1895, for a consideration of $500, and agreement by John Regn to reassign to James P. P. Pluston for a consideration of $530, bearing date the 30th day of July, A. D. 1895, within one year from that date, both delivered contemporaneously on receipt of check for $300, together constitute a mortgage of the interests of James P. P. Huston in the said estates of Sarah Huston, deceased, William S. Perot, deceased, and Mary W. Perot, deceased.\n2. That the plaintiff owes the defendant $300, and $173.30 with interest on the $473.30 since July 29, 1895.\nCONCLUSIONS OK LA\u00a5.\nThe defendant contends that he is the absolute owner of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the three estates referred to and denies that the paper executed by him, agreeing to reconvey within one year upon payment of $530, has any validity or binding effect. As authority he cites the act of June 8, 1881, which provided:\n\u201c No defeasance to any deed for real estate, regular and absolute upon its face, made after the passage of this act, shall have the effect of reducing it to a mortgage, unless the said defeasance is made at the time the deed is made and is in writing, signed, sealed, acknowledged and delivered by the grantee in the deed to the grantor, and is recorded in the office for the recording of deeds and mortgages in the county wherein the lands are situated within sixty days from the execution thereof and such defeasance shall be recorded and indexed as mortgage by the recorder.\u201d\nThis, however, seems to have been a thought suggested by the learned counsel representing the defendant, and even with him would appear to be of recent birth, for in the answer filed/ the defendant admits the execution of the agreement to reassign, and adds that he has always been read}'' and willing to comply with the terms of the agreement. The answer was filed September , 1896. There was then no idea in the mind of client or counsel that the agreement to reassign was not valid and binding. In Brown v. Beecher, 120 Pa. 590, the Supreme Court held that the act applies to deeds for real estate only. The paper executed by the plaintiff is in form an assignment. It is so called in the acknowledgment. It assigns all the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cright, title and interest of whatsoever kind or nature, either at law or in equity of, in and to the estate of \u201d the plaintiff\u2019s mother, grandmother and grandfather, \u201cand to all and every part of each and every of said estates and the proceeds thereof.\u201d It likewise constitutes the defendant the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to recover and receive the said \u201c right, title, interest, legacies, gifts, and estates.\u201d Whether there is a power of sale in the grandfather\u2019s will with directions to convert the real estate into money; whether there is any of the mother\u2019s estate in real estate now ; whether the interest conveyed by the assignment is an interest in real estate even in part, the defendants have not shown, and the trial judge feels justified in holding, therefore, that the assignment was not \u201c deed for real estate,\u201d and that therefore the act of 1881 does not apply.\nThis conclusion is strengthened by the acts of the parties. If the interest conveyed was real estate, the Messrs. Martin would have prepared a deed describing the real estate ; they would have left out much that was put in the assignment, and (this seems conclusive on the subject) they would have seen to it that the agreement to reassign was drawn and executed, acknowledged and recorded in strict compliance with the act of 1881. Not to have done so would have been an act of chicanery on their part so utterly at variance with their duty to the plaintiff, by whom they were being well paid for their professional services that it would be a serious reflection upon them as members of the bar to sustain the defendant\u2019s present contention. The plaintiff should therefore have a reassignment upon payment by him of the sum borrowed and the expenses incurred by the defendant, and as he did not tender the defendant the full amount which he should have tendered, he should pay the costs.\nIt is therefore ordered and decreed that, upon payment by the plaintiff to the defendant of the sum of $473.80, with interest thereon since July 29, 1895, and the costs of this suit, that the defendant execute and deliver to the plaintiff a full and ample assignment of the interests and estates assigned to him by the assignment of July 29, 1895.\nOn exception the court entered the following modified decree :\nIt is therefore ordered and decreed that upon payment by the plaintiff to the defendant of the sum of $473.30, with interest thereon since July 29, 1895, and the costs of suit within thirty days from this date that the defendant execute and deliver to the plaintiff a full and ample reassignment of the interests assigned to the defendant by the assignment of July 29, 1895. If the plaintiff shall not within thirty days from this date pay the said sum and interest and costs then the bill to be dismissed.\nError assigned among others was the decree of the court.\n.John A. Biekel, with him Thomas J. Martin, Jr., for appellant.\nSince the act of June 8,1881, a written defeasance, signed by the grantee, not acknowledged and unrecorded, though contemporaneous with the execution and delivery of a deed absolute on its face, will not be admitted to convert such deed into a mortgage: Sankey v. Hawley, 118 Pa. 30.\nJoseph T. Bunting, for appellee.\nIn Brown v. Beecher, 120 Pa. 590, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held, at page 608, that this act of June 8, 1881, relating to and defining defeasances, etc., applies to deeds for real estate only.\nJanuary 17, 1898:"
