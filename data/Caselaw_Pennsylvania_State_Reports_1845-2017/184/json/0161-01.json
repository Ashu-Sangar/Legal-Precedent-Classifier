        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Chief Justice Sterbett,\nThe subjects of complaint in this appeal are certain surcharges against the appellant, Armand C. Hess, receiver of the defendant company, made by the learned auditor and approved by the court below.\nIt is proper to' say, in limine, that appellant was not surcharged for any loss arising from mere error of judgment. Exceptions to his account embracing errors of judgment only were dismissed by the auditor, as appears by his report. Other \u2022exceptions of a graver character were sustained by both auditor and court; and a careful examination of the record clearly shows that the appellant has not been treated by them with undue severity. The uncontradicted evidence as to his sale to the Pittsburg Cycle Co. proves the existence of facts and circumstances which justly imposed on him the burden of proving that the transaction was one of fair dealing, and that the price was not inadequate. Mr. Pepper, a member of the purchasing firm, testified that, \u201c at the time of the purchase from Mr. Hess (the appellant) in November, 1898, it was understood that he (Hess) was to become a member of the Pittsburg Cycle Co. after he was released from the receivership. He afterwards became a member, and is so now.\u201d Appellant him self testified: \u201c As to the firm of Pepper & McGowan, (trad ing as the Pittsburg Cycle Co.) it was formed in the latter part of November, 1898. It consisted of Pepper and McGowan, with the understanding that they were to emploj^ me at a sal .ary of $1,200 a year, and later,\u2014as soon as the Vehicle & Harness Co. was wound up,\u2014to admit me as a partner.\u201d The rule prohibiting trustees from purchasing at their own sale, without previous permission, applies with much force to a transaction such as this. The learned auditor according]y surcharged appellant with the difference between the appraised value of the goods and the amount for which they were sold, as aforesaid, to the Pittsburg Cycle Co. soon after the appraisement was made. In the absence of any sufficient explanatory evidence on behalf of appellant, he has no just reason to complain of this.\nAs to the allowance claimed by appellant for bicycles included in the inventory, but which ho alleged were left for repairs only and did not belong to the assignor company, the auditor rightly held that the claim for allowance was not substantiated. The clerks by whom the inventory and appraisement were made were not called to testify, although they were in the city at the time of the hearing. In view of all the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, the credit claimed was properly disallowed.\nThe credit claimed for payment on the Williams lease was also properly disallowed. The order of court authorizing the sale of the leasehold required the purchaser \u201cto assume the ground rent on tbe premises from tbe date of sale.\u201d The purpose of the subsequent proceedings on this lease was not to authorize a second sale, but to substitute another, in lieu of the first purchaser, on the same terms, as appears from the fact that the first purchaser joined in the petition expressly requesting such substitution. Further discussion of the questions involved in this .appeal is unnecessary. They are all destitute of merit, and none of the specifications is sustained.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs.",

T., 1897, by Armand C. Hess, from order of C. P. No. 8, Allegheny Co., Noy. T., 1893, No. 513, overruling exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to report of auditor, E. E. Kiernan, Esq.\nFrom the report of the auditor it appeared that on October 9, 1893, A. C. Hess was appointed receiver of the Pittsburg Vehicle & Harness Company. Among the property that passed into his hands was a lease known as the Williams lease, which the receiver sold to Murphy & Hamilton under an agreement by which the purchasers were to assume the rent from the date of sale. The receiver, however, continued to pay the rent to the day of delivery of the leasehold premises. \u2022 The auditor surcharged him with the amount paid from the date of sale to the date of delivery.\nThe auditor further found that the stock of goods of the Pitts-burg Vehicle & Harness Company was appraised at $5,115.25, and that on November 25, 1898, the receiver presented his petition to the court stating that the goods were of such character that the}' could not be carried from one season to another without great depreciation in value; that during the winter there was no sale for such goods and that McGowan and Pepper had offered $2,006.42 for said stock, good-will and leasehold, and asked for an order to sell the same to said McGowan and Pepper at that price. The court granted the order and the sale was made accordingly. The auditor surcharged the receiver with the sum of $2,909.15, the difference between the appraised value of the goods and the amount received for them. This surcharge was made for the reason that at the time of the making of said sale to McGowan and Pepper the receiver had his arrangements made to become a partner in said firm, and that he afterwards did become a partner in that firm.\nOther facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nErrors assigned were in overruling exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nSamuel Me Clay, with him J. II. Baldwin and James W. Collins, for appellant.\nThe conduct required of a trustee is that of an ordinary man; that of one having common skill, prudence and caution: Neff\u2019s App., 57 Pa. 96; Fahnestock\u2019s App., 104 Pa. 46.\nA trustee will never be surcharged for a loss arising from mere error of judgment and from no wilful default: Pleasanton\u2019s App., 99 Pa. 862.\nA. B. Reid, with him A. V. D. Waiter son, for appellee.\nJan. 3, 1898:"
