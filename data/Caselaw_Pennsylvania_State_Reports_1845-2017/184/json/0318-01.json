        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Chief Justice Sterrktt,\nThe genera] subject of contention presented by the amended bill, etc., in this case, is whether the defendant, William Loeffler, is entitled to retain twenty-five thousand ($25,000) dollars on account of the two hundred and fifty shares of Standard Plate Glass Company stock loaned by him to William E. Schmertz and not returned. The court below held that he was, and accordingly dismissed the bill at plaintiff\u2019s costs.\nThe decree might well be affirmed on the learned trial judge\u2019s concise and accurate findings of the controlling facts, in connection with the conclusions briefly but correctly drawn by him therefrom; but, it may not be amiss to notice some of the questions involved.\nThe sum above stated is in defendant Loeffler\u2019s hands, retained by him out of the proceeds of life insurance policies assigned to him by W. E. Schmertz (since deceased), as collateral security against sundry liabilities for and on account of said assignor, including the Plate Glass stock in controversy. The residue of the insurance money was paid over by Loeffler to the use plaintiff, for the benefit of the creditors. It follows therefore that if Loeffler is entitled to the $25,000, the bill was rightly dismissed.\nIn its printed argument, the use plaintiff states that \u201cthe testimony on the part of the plaintiff is that a tender of the stock in question (same amount and kind) was made by ... . the original assignee of Schmertz, .... and that Loeffler refused to accept it.\u201d The testimony of Mr. McCook, one of the assignees referred to, further shows that the stock, at the time he offered to return it, had depreciated in value so that it was not worth more than fifty cents on the dollar. It is true, the same witness also testified that defendant Loeffler, \u201c had not to my knowledge and according to my information ever demanded a return of that stock from Mr. Schmertz until after the failure, and that the stock immediately on his failure fell to as low a point as it was then.\u201d But Loeffler testified that he had made a demand for the return of the stock before Schmertz\u2019s failure, and that it was refused. The court specially finds this fact. While tins finding of fact is embraced in the second assignment, the conclusions of law alone are specified as errors. But even if treated as covered by this assignment, the finding of the court could not be reversed, because in that respect Loeffler\u2019s testimony was not contradicted by that of McCook.\nUnless there is something else in the case, the decree under the authorities was right. In Huntingdon, etc., Railroad v. English, 86 Pa. 253, it was said: \u201c The rights of the parties were definitively fixed when the breach occurred.\u201d In Musgrave v. Beckendorff, 53 Pa. 310, it was held that the measure of damages for the breach of a contract to replace borrowed stock is the highest price it had reached between the breach and the trial. In the present case the highest price was the ruling price at the time of the demand and refusal.\nIt is contended, however, by the beneficial plaintiff that there are other facts in the case which will preclude Loeffler from paying himself out of this fund. Briefly stated, these facts are, that defendant held Schmertz\u2019s bond for $100,000, as security for the same debts that are covered by the assignment of life insurance policies. The judgment on this bond was a first lien on Schmertz\u2019s real estate. Subsequent to that were two other judgments upon which executions were issued and the land sold. Before the auditor charged with distribution of the fund thus raised, no claim was made by Loeffler, and no part of the fund was awarded to his judgment; and it is contended that he thereby forfeited his right to payment out of the insurance fund. On that question the learned trial judge rightly refused to sustain the use plaintiff\u2019s contention, and his ruling is not specifically assigned as error. But if it were, it is sufficiently vindicated in the opinion of the court below. In addition to the authority there cited may be added Ayres v. Wattson, 57 Pa. 360, to the effect that a creditor may hold an unlimited number of collaterals and avail himself of any of them as long as the debt remains unpaid. \u201cA person may if he chooses relinquish a collateral security altogether\u2019, without the consent of other creditors of his debtor. It is a matter resting entirely between him and his debtor with which others have nothing to do: \u201d Dyott\u2019s Est., 2 W. & S. 490.\nIt was further contended that as Loeffler had a prior hold on two funds he should have resorted to the other, leaving this one intact for the payment of general creditors. But the junior lien creditors might with propriety have urged the same considerations in relation to the realty fund. If the defendant had participated in that fund the junior lien creditors might have asked to be subrogated to his rights in the present fund : Ramsey\u2019s App., 2 Watts, 228; Mason\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 402; Tubbs\u2019s Est., 161 Pa. 252; Addams v. Heffernan, 9 Watts, 512.\nInasmuch as defendant\u2019s debt is not yet paid in full, it is not necessary to consider the allowance on account of the amount-claimed to have been appropriated from the proceeds of the sale of personal property to the claim here in controversy. By the decree of court in those proceedings, it was ordered to be paid over on account of \u201c defendant\u2019s judgment,\u201d and it has been here properly treated as so paid.\nIn any view that can be reasonably taken of the case, the result in the court below was substantially correct, and the decree should be sustained.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs.",

Nov. 8, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 180, Oct. T., 1897, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co., Sept. T., 1893, No. 415, dismissing billin equity.\nBefore Sterrett, O. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for an account.\nCollier, P. J., found the facts to be as follows :\nOn August 1, 1891, William Loeffler, the defendant, entered of record in the prothonotary\u2019s office of this county, at No. 84, October term, 1891, D. S. B., a judgment note against William E. Schmertz, for the sum of $100,000. On August 7, 1891, execution was issued on this judgment, and a large amount of the personal property of Schmertz was levied upon and sold, the amount realized therefrom being something over $65,000. At the time Schmertz gave the judgment to Loeffler, he, Schmertz, was insolvent, and on August 7, 1891, the day upon which the execution Avas issued on Loeffler\u2019s judgment, other judgments were entered up against Schmertz, and subsequently executions issued upon them. Schmerbz\u2019s life was insured for a large amount, and at the time of the delivery of the judgment note to Loeffler, Schmertz assigned tp Loeffler, as security for his indebtedness, two policies for the sum of $25,000 each, in the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. Schmertz lived until July 13, 1893, and from the date of the assignment of these policies until Sehmertz\u2019s death, Loeffler kept them alive and paid in premiums therefor out of his own funds the sum of $7,347.80.\nSchmertz\u2019s indebtedness to Loeffler on August 1, 1891, amounting to $179,900, was composed of the following items:\n(1) Loeffler had indorsed for Schmertz and discounted for him to the total amount of $53,650 ; (2) Loeffler had loaned to Schmertz 250 shares of the capital stock of Standard Plate Glass Company, which at the time of the loan was worth $100 to $105 per share, or $25,000; (3) Schmertz had been appointed guardian of the minor children of 11. E. Schmertz, and Loeffler was surety upon several bonds for said Schmertz as guardian, amounting altogether to the sum of $101,250. After the failure of Schmertz, the Safe Deposit and Trust Company was appointed guardian of these minor children, and the liability of the sureties upon Schmertz\u2019s bonds was liquidated and fixed at $22,000, of which Loeffler\u2019s proportion was $10,243.09, which sum was paid by Loeffler to the Safe Deposit and Trust Company, the guardian. So the total indebtedness of Schmertz was as follows:\nIndorsements ...... $53,650 00\n250 Shares Plate Glass Stock . . . 25,000 00\nLiability paid on Schmertz\u2019s bonds as guardian ....... 10,243 09\nPremiums paid on Insurance Policies held as collateral...... 7,374 80\nInterest on various accounts . . . 3,609 50\n$99,877 89\nWhen Schmertz died in July, 1893, the original bill in this case was filed, and before the proceeds of the two policies of insurance upon Schmertz\u2019s life were paid to Loeffler, two agreements were executed, which provide that the proceeds of the two policies, amounting to $81,189.52 should be paid to Loeffler, and that Loeffler should retain in his hands the sum of $7,347.80, which sum he had expended in keeping the policies alive, and the further sum of $25,000 which he claimed was due him on account of 250 shares of the stock of the Standard Plate Glass Company, which said Schmertz borrowed from said Loeffler, and lost the same by sale thereof under said pledge, which claim of said Loeffler as to its validity or amount is disputed by the assignee of W. E. Schmertz. And it is the sum of $25,000 now in the hands of the defendant Loeffler, that is the matter of dispute.\nLoeffler, after retaining the amounts agreed upon, paid over the balance, $32,374.80 to the assignee.\nPrior to the failure of Schmertz, Loeffler loaned him 250 shares of the Standard Plate Glass Company, worth from $100 to $105 per share, and afterwards\u2014also prior to his (Schmertz\u2019s) failure\u2014Loeffler demanded a return of his stock, which was refused; nor was Loeffler ever tendered the stock.\nAfter Loeffler\u2019s judgment was entered and execution issued upon it, and levy made on personal property, Schmertz\u2019s real estate was levied upon by the judgment creditors immediately behind Loeffler, and, at the distribution before the auditor, Loeffler made no claim on the lien of his judgment, and did not share in the distribution.\nLoeffler\u2019s judgment was $100,000, and the indebtedness on said note was as follows:\nIndorsements ...... $53,650 00\n250 shares Standard Plate Glass stock . . 25,000 00\nPaid Guardian on Schmertz bond . . 10,243 09\nPremiums paid on policies held as collateral . 7,374 80\nInterest on these various amounts . . 3,609 50\nNet indebtedness .... $99,877 39\nOn account of this indebtedness Loeffler has received the following sums:\nDecember 19, 1891, on his execution on personal property, in court No. 2 . . $53,650 00\nFebruary 18, 1893, on his execution in same case, by decree of court, \u201c That the said balance remaining in registry of the court, realized upon the execution aforesaid, be Amount carried forward, $53,650 00\nAmount brought forward, $53,650 00\nforthwith paid over to plaintiff, on account of the judgment held by him and upon which said execution was issued,\u201d and which we find the plaintiff had the right to apply to his judgment . 12,276 49\nProceeds of policies now in his hands, on account of loan of 250 shares of Standard Plate Glass Company, which we find he is entitled to ..... 25,000 00\nReturn of premiums paid to keep the policies alive....... 7,374 80\nTotal amount received $98,30129\nBalance still due on Loeffler\u2019s judgment: $1,576.10.\nCONCLUSIONS OP LAW.\nIt is contended by the learned counsel for plaintiff that Loeffler was bound to present his claim to the auditor for distribution out of the funds realized on the sale of the real estate of Schmertz, he having the first lien, and having neglected to do this he cannot now retain the $25,000 in his hands.\nWe do not agree with him in this. We think Loeffler had a right to rely on the collateral that he held, and was not bound to present his claim before the auditor. The recovery of judgment upon the principal debt does not affect the pledgee\u2019s right to hold and enforce the pledge taken to secure that debt. It is the very nature of collateral security that it may be resorted to for a satisfaction of the principal debt, if its payment shall not otherwise be obtained: Jones on Pledges, sec. 591.\nAgain it is contended that the offer of Mr. McCook, for the assignee of Mr. Schmertz, to return the stock, at a time that it had depreciated to less than one half its value, which was refused by Mr. Loeffler, was equivalent to a tender. Mr. Loeffler had, before the failure of Mr. Schmertz, demanded a return of his stock, and had been refused, and we think he was not bound to accept an offer to get the stock, and to accept it at its depreciation. It was in no sense a legal tender.\nHaving found that the defendant is entitled to retain the $25,000 in dispute, and that after giving all credits of money received on his judgment it is not yet paid in full, the bill is dismissed at costs of the plaintiff.\nError assigned was decree dismissing bill.\nAlbert York Smith, with him Joseph A. Langfitt, for appellant.\nLoeffler stood idly by and, while he held the first lien on the real estate, allowed Mrs. Schmertz, the wife of Wm. E. Schmertz, and E. M. Quiby, the son-in-law, to proceed upon the real estate and come in for a large part of their claims, although they were subsequent to his judgment, and he, Leoffler, made no attempt to participate in this fund. There was amply sufficient in the real estate to have paid Loeffler in full.\nM. W Aeheson, Jr., with him George 0. Wilson and Wm. I>. Evans, for appellee.\nInterest is allowed in trover on the value of the chattels at the time when converted, from that time, or from demand, when a demand is necessary: 1 Sedgwick on Damages, sec. 316; Perley on Interest, 135; Neiler v.

Callahan, 56 Ga. 331.\nThe stock having been converted by reason of a demand and refusal, Mr. Loeffler was not bound subsequently to accept it at its depreciation: Musgrave v. Beckendorff, 53 Pa. 310; Bank of Montgomery v. Reese, 26 Pa. 143.\nA mere offer to pay money is not a legal tender: Sheredine v.
