L. 447, 20 PS \u00a7843. The account was filed March 6, 1936, was audited and confirmed absolutely June 13, 1936. After answer, the proceeding was referred to a master, who, after hearing, filed a report recommending the dismissal on the ground of laches. In his report, he said, \u201cand inasmuch as the petitioners had unusual advantage by reason of the preliminary discussions before the account was filed, having had copies of the account which ordinarily are not sent to parties in interest, and having been notified of the day of the audit, the Master holds as a matter of law, they are guilty of laches.\u201d Exceptions to his report were filed and heard by the court in banc and were disposed of in an opinion from which we quote, \u201cThe questions which are now raised by the Petitioners could have been presented at the audit of the trustee\u2019s account in May, 1936. All relevant facts were then known or available to the parties. They had copies of the account and notice of the audit, and by their signatures approved the schedule of distribution and executed satisfactions of award. As was said in Scott\u2019s Appeal, 112 Pa. 427, \u2018something is due to the finality of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d In addition, we refer, for construction of section 48, to Bailey\u2019s Estate, 291 Pa. 421, 424, 140 A. 145; Osterling\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 225, 227 et seq., 10 A.
