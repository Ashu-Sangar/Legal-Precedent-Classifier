        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Schaffer,\nAppellant attacks the constitutionality of the Act of May 27, 1937, P. L. 917, 43 PS Sec. 331a, providing for the establishing of minimum fair wages for women and minors on the single ground that it is an improper delegation of legislative power and authority.\nAppellant and others, who were permitted by the court below to intervene, are engaged in the laundry business. The authority designated by the act to fix the minimum wages of women and minors in that industry established a rate of 27 cents per hour.\nThe act recites, among other things, that women and minors are employed in some occupations in trade and industry in the Commonwealth at wages unreasonably low and not fairly commensurate with the value of the services rendered and that it is imperative that the police power shall be exercised for the protection of industry, of the women and children employed therein and the public interest of the community with regard to their health and well being. To carry out the purposes of the act the Secretary of Labor and Industry is given power to set up wage boards to report to him minimum fair wages for such women or minors as may be engaged in the occupations covered by the statute. The ultimate power to fix the wages is given to the Secretary, with a right of review by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County except upon questions of fact.\nAs the basis of appellant\u2019s argument before us, attention is called to Article 2, Section 1,'of our Constitution: \u201cThe legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives\u201d and it is said that this provision is violated because in certain of its important aspects the Wage Board provided for by the act, and the Secretary, have conferred upon them legislative power in that no standards are fixed by the statute to serve as guides to their determination. In this connection, we are referred to what was said in Holgate Bros. Co. v. Bashore, 331 Pa. 255, 262, 200 A. 672, \u201c Tn creating such an administrative agency the legislature, to prevent its being a pure delegation of legislative power, must enjoin upon it a certain course of procedure and certain rules of decision in the performance of its function.\u2019 ... If the legislature fails, however, to prescribe with reasonable clarity the limits of the power delegated or if those limits are too bro\u00e1'd its attempt to delegate is a nullity.\u201d\nWe cannot accept the argument that no standards are set up in tlie statute to guide determination of what is a fair wage. Subsection 7 of section 2 provides, 43 PS Sec. 331b: \u201cA \u2018fair wage\u2019 shall mean a wage fairly and reasonably commensurate with the value of the service or class of service rendered.\u201d This has been one of the principles upon which wage claims have been adjudicated by the courts, where there has been no fixed sum named for the services: 71 C. J. 161, 162.\nSection 5, 43 PS Sec. 331e, with the heading \u201cBasis of Fair Wage\u201d directs: \u201cIn establishing a minimum fair wage for any sendee or class of service under this act, the secretary and the wage board, without being bound by any technical rules of evidence, or procedure, may\u2014\n\u201c(1) Take into account the cost of living, and all other relevant circumstances affecting the value of the service or class of service rendered.\n\u201c (2) Be guided by like consideration as would guide a court in a suit for the reasonable value of services rendered where services are rendered at the request of an employer without contract as to the amount of the wage to be paid.\n\u201c(3) Consider the wages paid in the Commonwealth for work of like or comparable character by employers who voluntarily maintain minimum fair wage standards.\u201d\nAs the purpose to be achieved by this statute is a public one and by it power is given to public officers which affects the rights of third persons the word \u201cmay\u201d is to be read \u201cshall\u201d: Montgomery v. Poorman, 6 Watts 384, 387; Commonwealth v. Select and Common Councils of Pittsburgh, 34 Pa. 496; Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, Sec. 412; Commonwealth ex rel. v. Woodring, 289 Pa. 437, 137 A. 635; Suermann v. Hadley, 327 Pa. 190, 193 A. 645. Moreover, to reach a conclusion as to constitutionality the word \u201cmay\u201d in a statute is to be read \u201cshall\u201d if such reading leads to constitutionality:' 59 C. J. 1082, and cases cited. So construing the provisions of section 5 providing what the Secretary and Wage Board must do as mandatory, and taking them in connection Avith section 2(7), it cannot be successfully argued that ample standards are not fixed for the action of the public authorities charged with the duty to fix a minimum fair Avage and, therefore, there is no improper delegation of legislative poAver or authority.\nWe think the fact that the Secretary of Labor and Industry has the ultimate decision as to the amount of the wage does not impair the statute. In reaching decision he is as much bound by the standards fixed as is the Board.\nThe order of the court below is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.",
