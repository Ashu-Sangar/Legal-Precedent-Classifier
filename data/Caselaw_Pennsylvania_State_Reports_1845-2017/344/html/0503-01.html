Thorne the 2010 shares which it owned of the stock of the Darling Yalve and Manufacturing Company for $94,000. Ralph W. Thorne then borrowed $100,000 from this Company and placed with the Company as collateral for the loan 1990 of the shares. Ten shares were sold by Ralph W. Thorne to Marshall L.

Thorne, would borrow $100,-000 from the Darling Valve and Manufacturing Company and deposit therewith as collateral 1,990 shares of Darling Valve and Manufacturing Company stock. It <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>was further insisted by Seth T. McCormick, Jr., that even this method of raising the money would not be complied with unless said Ralph W. Thorne would transfer to Marshall L. Hough 10 shares of said stock for a consideration of $1250.00 (which amount was admittedly less than the true value of the stock), thus equalizing control of the corporation between the Thorne and Hough interests. It was also insisted by Seth T. McCormick, Jr., that after said transactions would take place that Ralph W. Thorne and Marshall L. Hough would each place ten shares of Darling Valve and Manufacturing-Company stock in trust with his Honor, Judge D. M. Larrabee, of the Courts of Lycoming County, who was to vote said twenty shares of stock at his discretion in order to destroy the effect of neutral control.”</p>

Thorne. The Bank refused to accept payment of this note unless Thorne would at the same time pay an additional $10,-000 to apply on a mortgage of his real estate then also held by the Bank. Prior to March 27, 1939, “Seth T. McCormick, Jr., had promised and assured Ralph W. Thorne that the said West. Branch Bank &amp; Trust Company would in no event sell the 200 shares of stock without first giving him a reasonable opportunity to pay off the said loan and thereby regain possession of the stock.” The Trust Company “acting in concert with Seth T. McCormick, Jr., and Marshall L. Hough without notice to Ralph W. Thorne, on the morning of March 27,1939, proceeded to sell the said note to Marshall L. Hough for the face value thereof and turn over to him the said collateral pledged therewith, to wit, 200 shares of the stock of the Darling Valve and Manufacturing Company.” It is further charged that though “ordinarily the annual stockholders’ meeting was held on the last Monday of March in the afternoon, the meeting in 1939 was held at 10 A. M. for the first time in the history of the Company and although both the bank officials and Marshall L.. Hough knew that Ralph W. Thorne was prepared to procure the money to cover his [$25,000] note on Tuésday morning, March 28, they waited until about noon on Monday and then informed him that if he did not pay it off by 2 o’clock that day, the [200 shares of] stock . . . held as collateral [for the payment of that note] would be sold, well knowing that it would be impossible-for him to comply with their demands.” He adds that when he could not pay off the note “within the limited time specified, Marshall L. Hough sold the said collateral to himself and thereby received complete control of the . . . Company which was one of the purposes of the con<a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>spiracy and fraudulent scheme hereinbefore set forth.” Shortly thereafter Thorne was demoted from President to Vice-President “with a reduction in salary from $12,-666.00 to $2500.00 annually, and Marshall L. Plough became President at the annual salary of $12,666.00, which was the same salary he had been receiving as Vice-President of the Company.” After these events Thorne “became suspicious of the good faith of the parties concerned and made an effort to secure disinterested counsel to advise him as to his rights.”</p>

He thereby became an actor in the transaction and that fact now discredits his claim that he was for a half dozen years disarmed from taking action by the appellees’ concealment of the fraudulent transaction in which he was a participant. A person who is sui juris and not acting under duress and who acquiesces in a proposal which he believes to be wrongful and disadvantageous deprives himself of the plea of fraud when later he finds that he has been hurt. “If the representee knew the truth it is obvious that he was neither deceived nor defrauded and that any loss he may sustain is not traceable to the representation but is in effect self-inflicted.”: 26 C.

The rule is no medium for finding out the intention of the testator; on the contrary the rule supposes the intention already discovered. . . . When it is once settled that the donor or testator has used words of inheritance according to their legal import, has applied them intentionally to comprise the whole line of heirs, of the tenant for life, and has really made them the terminus or ancestor, by reference to whom the succession is to be regulated, then comes the proper time to inspect the rule in Shelley’s case . . . When the testator devises the remainder on a failure to appoint, to the heirs of the life-tenant, or by words which mean the same thing, the inheritance will pass to the life-tenant ... If the body of persons thus described constitute in fact the heirs of the life-tenant and represent only a line of descent, and not specially designated persons, the devise for life becomes the source or stock of the descent, and by analogy to the rule in Shelley’s case, or perhaps it is better to say, from necessity, he takes the inheritance ... I have used the expression, by analogy to the rule in Shelley’s case, to avoid misapprehension.” “The rule in Shelley’s case itself shows that it has reference only to estates in real property, but it repeatedly has been held to apply to personalty, and hence to leaseholds.
