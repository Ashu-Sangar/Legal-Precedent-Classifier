    <p id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.8",200,[199,715,1152,688]]]'>Section 305 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915, P. L. 736, as re-enacted and amended by the Act of June 21, 1939, P. L. 520, provides that an employer desiring to be exempt from insuring his liability for compensation shall make application to the Department of Labor and Industry, showing his financial ability to pay compensation, whereupon the Department, if satisfied of the applicant’s financial ability, shall issue a permit authorizing such exemption; from a refusal of the Department an appeal shall lie to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, in which appeal the only question shall be whether the Department abused its discretion.</p>
    <p id="b200-7" data-blocks='[["BL_200.9",200,[198,1424,1152,588]]]'>United Fruit Company, for each of the twenty years preceding 1941, made application and was granted the privilege of being a self-insurer, but its similar application for the year 1941 was refused. Since the Department admits that the Company’s financial ability to pay compensation is beyond question, and as such ability is the only qualification specified in the act, the Department’s refusal to grant the permit would seem, on the face of it, to constitute an abuse of discretion, and the Dauphin County Court, on an appeal by the Company, so held. The Department now appeals to this court.</p>

The Department concedes, however, as of course it must, that the Company is not <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>obliged to register in Pennsylvania. It is a corporation engaged exclusively in foreign commerce, with its principal office in Boston, and it requires no authority from this state to carry on its business. Not only is this an elementary principle of constitutional law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> but it is recognized by our Business Corporation Law of 1933, P. L. 364, section 1001, which provides that a foreign business corporation need not procure a certificate of authority to do business in this Commonwealth if its entire business operations in the state are within the protection of the commerce clause of the federal constitution. While the United Fruit Company employs some three hundred persons in Pennsylvania, — stevedores, wharf laborers and a clerical office force, — some of whom work only on the land, others on both land and water, they are all engaged in activities connected with foreign commerce; the Supreme Court of the United States has held that longshoremen who load and discharge cargoes bear the same relation as the crew of the vessel to the commerce that they serve: <em>Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v.

    <p id="b201-4" data-blocks='[["BL_201.4",201,[244,1422,1152,476]]]'>The Commonwealth seeks to impale the Company upon the horns of a dialectic dilemma — either that our Workmen’s Compensation Act is not applicable to its employes and therefore there is no need for the Company to apply for the privilege of self-insurance; or, if they do come within the act, the Company is not entitled to any privileges or benefits thereunder unless it first registers to do business within the state. Neither of these propositions can be sustained.</p>

But many land operations of the employes of the United Fruit Company are conceivable which would not come within the scope of admiralty jurisdiction or the legislation of Congress concerning maritime law. While, in matters of contract, admiralty jurisdiction depends upon the nature of the transaction, in tort matters and in cases of accident without fault it depends upon the place where the tort is committed or the accident happens. Where the locale of the occurrence is the high seas or other navigable waters, admiralty jurisdiction and maritime law govern, but not if the tort or accident happens on land or <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>on a wharf or pier which is merely an extension of the land; in snch instances the Workmen’s Compensation Act of the state applies: <em>Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v.

Moreover, even if maritime law would otherwise govern, there are cases where this might not eliminate the applicability of the state act, because, if the employment, although maritime in character, pertains to local matters having only an incidental relation to navigation and commerce, the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties, as between themselves, may be regulated by state acts which do not work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law or interfere with its uniformity in its international or interstate relations and which are not inconsistent with federal legislation: <em>Western Fuel Co. v.
