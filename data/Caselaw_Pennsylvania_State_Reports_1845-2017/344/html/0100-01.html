This company paid a high rate of dividend; for reasons appearing later, it was sold between December, 1935, and September, 1936, at a profit of $73,540 over the inventoried value. Appellants contend it should have been sold to the United Gas Improvement Company in 1931 at a higher price, and that failure then to sell it was such breach of duty as requires surcharge; that, in the words of one of appellants’ briefs, accountant “was guilty of such supine negligence that it even failed to make any attempt to exercise its judgment when an opportunity to make a most advantageous sale was presented.” We agree that the learned court below rightly held that the evidence in the record does not support appellants’ contention. This gas company stock was closely held, the United Gas Improvement Company of Philadelphia owning a majority. There was neither local nor general market for the stock. Testator had been a shareholder for many years. In the administration of this investment accountant had the unusual advantage resulting from the presence, on its Board of Directors and on its Committee supervising the trust administration, of a resident of Reading, a business friend of testator, familiar with local conditions as they might affect the business of the gas company, and constantly participat<a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>ing in the administration of the trust. It was only after it was discovered that natural gas interests would probably come in competition with the manufactured gas, in 1935, that sale Avas recommended by accountant’s committee having the matter in charge; the stock had been appraised at $20.61 per share and was sold for $30.55 a share; the trust had 7,398 shares. Appellants contend that the trustee should have sold between May 15, 1930, and September 1, 1931, when the United Gas Improvement Company paid $50 a share for stock then purchased. One of the exceptants testified that he advised accountant’s trust officer (who died some years prior to the hearing) that he had sold his OAvn stock to that company and that the trust officer replied, inter alia: “If it is good enough for the U. G. I., it is good enough for us.” In their brief, appellants say: “The stock of the Consumers Gas Company was never sold except privately and, prior to May 15, 1930, there Avas admittedly no market at all for this stock. On May 15, 1930, however, the United Gas Improvement Company began buying the stock in large quantities and continued buying until September, 1931.” We cannot accept that as an accurate statement of Avhat the record shows. Letters from the Treasurer of the United Gas Improvement Company were placed in evidence showing that the last purchase of stock by that company Avas on July 1,1931, though on August 16th it purchased subscription rights for 28 shares and on September 1st exercised subscription rights at par. In passing, it may be noted that it also appeared in the same latters that the United Gas Improvement Company, “made no general offer to stockholders of Consumers Gas Company to purchase their stock or rights during the above period.”</p>

With respect to that contention, it may be noted that while there is some confusion in <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>parts of his testimony, Mr. Ferguson, the witness in question, twice testified that Ms conversation with accountant’s trust officer took place after the witness sold Ms stock to the United Gas Improvement Company; one of Ms statements was: “And I said I had sold my stock and my sister had sold her stock, and I thought the trustee ought to sell their stock. Q. What did he say? A. He just reiterated Ms former position that it had been a profitable investment and he didn’t see any necessity of selling at the present time and possibly later on they would consider the question of a sale of at least part of it.” If there were nothing else in the case, we should not conclude that the trust officer’s refusal then to sell constituted supine negligence, but, there is other evidence which justified a finding that appellants’ contention has no foundation. Mr. Bigg, referred to above as the Beading resident familiar with the affairs of the Consumers Gas Company and a member of accountant’s board of directors and of its trust committee, testified that “from time to time subsequent to Colonel Jones’s death” he advised accountant’s committee of the affairs of the Consumers Gas Company. Asked, with respect to the period from 1921 to the time of the last sale in December, 1935, he said: “I continuously advised against the sale of the property until it began to appear that the natural gas situation was beginning to press into the eastern section of Pennsylvania . . .” He also said: “. . . and until that threat became a real menace to this territory, I continuously advised to hold, because of past earnings and the fact that it was a well-managed company, and I think the subsequent earnings of the company justified the change in the position in 1935.” An exhibit in the record is composed of extracts from minutes of accountant’s trust investment committee. One of the extracts relates to a committee meeting on May 8, 1931, attended by, among others, the trust officer to whom Mr. Ferguson stated that he had sold his stock. The minutes show that the investment in this <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>stock was the subject of consideration; that the earnings for the past three years were considered and it was decided that if rights to subscribe to common were issued, as had apparently been talked about, “the Committee were of the opinion that the rights should be sold because of the fact that a considerable quantity of the stock of this Company was already held in our Trust Estates.” The exhibit contains subsequent minutes in which the investment was considered. Even when the stock was sold there was no general market for it; the record shows that it was sold through two syndicates formed for the purpose of marketing it. Instead of showing, as appellants contend, that there was no consideration of the investment, the record shows the contrary. The learned judge concluded his disposition of appellants’ objection in these words: “We have here an asset, sound and seasoned since 1892, with an unusually fine dividend record maintained through 1935, on two prior occasions adjudicated as satisfactory to all parties in interest, held, as a result of study and constant supervision, and not supinely, through the most distressing and unsettled years in the economic life of the nation; and eventually sold at a great profit to the estate, subject to the single complaint that through supine negligence a greater profit was not realized. The same complaint was urged in <em>Stewart’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/110/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="110 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="543705" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0410-01">110 Pa. 410</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.%20321" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 A. 321">6 A. 321</a>.

A single one of the life tenants suggested sale, in 1931, when there was no general market. . . . Satisfied with dividend returns and increasing principal, no one complained, from 1924 to the filing of this account. (See <em>Detre’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/273/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="273 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1070806" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0341-01">273 Pa. 341</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.%2054" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="117 A. 54">117 A. 54</a>; <em>O’Brien’s Estate, </em>supra, and <em>Maser’s Estate, </em>supra.)

In proceedings, begun before testator’s death, a decree of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania made June 28, 1923, required the separation of the railway and the coal properties covered by the mortgage securing the bonds. Accordingly, they were exchanged by the executor in April, 1924, for $66,600 Reading Company General and Refunding Mortgage 4%%, etc. (plus scrip) and $33,000 Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Refunding, etc., bonds (plus scrip) and this exchange appeared in the executor’s account audited in June, 1924. The adjudication awarded these bonds to the trustee at the audit of the executor’s account; they were also in the accounts adjudicated in 1927 and in 1928. The Reading Company bonds were sold at a profit in 1929 while the Coal Company bonds were retained and sold at a loss in 1936.

A part of this investment was sold at a large profit in 1927 over the inventoried value. Appellants contend there should he a surcharge for failing to sell the rest.

The company survived the 1933 ‘moratorium’ as well as the crash of 1929. It was then and now is rated a strong financial institution.

A trust company was named as both executor and trustee. The testator directed that the <em>executor </em>should not sell any part of the residuary estate, but should turn over to itself as trustee “all bonds, stock and other securities.” The reason for this provision appears in a letter written by the <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>testator to tlie trust company some time prior to the execution of the will for the purpose of fixing the fees to be charged by the company, and in that connection he explains that as executor it would have no duties to perform other than to receive the property of the estate in kind and transfer it to the trust; his proposition was accepted by the company, and this agreement is referred to in the will. The right thus given or the duty thus inferentially imposed upon the trustee to receive the nonlegal securities among the other assets of the estate did not impliedly, much less expressly, carry with it the right to retain them. As appellants properly contend: “If it were true that the right of the trustee to receive non-legals implied a right to retain them there would obviously be no rule requiring the trustee to convert. In practically all cases the trustee has the right to receive the non-legals and does actually receive them.” The casual use of the word “dividends” in the provision that the trustee is to “receive and collect all the rents, issues, profits, benefits, accretions, increase, interest, dividends and income” cannot be construed as granting “with the utmost clearness” <em>(Barker’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/159/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="159 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="850166" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0518-01">159 Pa. 518</a>, 528, 529, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20A.%20365" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="28 A. 365">28 A. 365</a>, 367; <em>Taylor’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/277/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="277 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="1079491" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0518-01">277 Pa. 518</a>, 524, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20A.%20310" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="121 A. 310">121 A. 310</a>, 311), the authority to retain non-legal investments since, in any event, there were bound to be stocks in the trust estate for at least the reasonable time allowed by the law for their conversion. In the direction to convert the real estate, upon the death of testator’s wife and grandchildren, into “money or personal securities” the word “non-legal” cannot be inserted by the court in front of the word “securities”, the presumption being that only legal securities are intended unless there be authorization, either express or by necessary inference, to the contrary.</p>
