The contract between the defendant and the Hotel Company was executed on June 1, 1938, and was for one year from June 15, 1938, and from year to year thereafter unless either party gave written notice of termination.

This principle has been applied not only to express trustees, but to partners, joint adventurers, corporate officers, agents and other fiduciaries.”: Scott on Trusts, Yol. 3, section 500, p. 2420. “Where one employed to act as agent of another in the purchase of property takes title in himself, he will be considered in equity as holding the property in trust for his principal, even though he makes the purchase with his OAvn money, in such case being entitled in connection with the enforcement of the trust, to reimbursement of his proper expenditures.”: 65 C. J. sec. 227, p. 481. “The rule is well settled that an agent instructed to purchase property for his principal will not be permitted, Avithout his principal’s knoAvledge and consent, to become the purchaser of the same property for himself; and if he makes such purchase he will, although he purchased with his oavu money, be considered as holding the property in trust for his principal; and the latter, upon repaying or tendering him the amount of the purchase price and his reasonable compensation, may, by proper proceeding in equity, compel a conveyance to himself.”: <em>Johnson v. </em>Hayward, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20N.W.%201058" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="103 N.W. 1058">103 N.

The plaintiff in seeking equity “must do equity”. “This maxim principally applies to the party who is seeking relief in the character of a plaintiff in the court. Thus for instance if a borrower of money upon usurious interest seeks to have the aid of a Court of Equity in cancelling or procuring the instrument to be delivered up, the court will not interfere in his favor unless upon the terms that he will pay the lender what is really and bona fide due to him. ... So Avhere a party seeks the benefit of a purchase made for him in the name of a trustee who has paid the purchase-money, but to Avhom he is indebted for other advances, he shall not be relieved but upon payment of all the money due to the trustee..... It [this maxim] says, in effect, that the court will give the plaintiff the relief to which he is entitled only upon condition that he has given, or consents to give, the defendant such corresponding rights as he also may be entitled to in respect of the subject-matter of the suit.”: Story’s Equity Jurisprudence, 14th Ed., Vol. 1, section 69 and 72.</p>
