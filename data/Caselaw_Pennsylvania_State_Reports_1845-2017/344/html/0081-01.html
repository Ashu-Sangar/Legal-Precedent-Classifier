    <p id="b108-4" data-blocks='[["BL_108.6",108,[210,354,1149,697]]]'>The question is whether testator, James Noble, exercised a general power of appointment by his will which contains no express reference to the power in its two paragraphs. In the first, he directed the payment of debts and funeral expenses and appointed an executor. The second has fifteen clauses lettered from <em>a </em>to o; all but clause <em>m </em>give money legacies; the last or residuary clause, which raised the dispute, provides: “o. I give full power to my Executor Lawrence E. Probst to sell all of my assets, Real or Personal and the proceeds to go to him after all of the above bequests have been settled as I have explicit faith that he will and has always done the right thing by me ever since my old working days.”</p>

In Mrs. Noble’s will she had provided, “and in case my said husband shall fail to dispose of said trust estate by Last Will and Testament, said remaining principal and undistributed income <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> shall be distributed by my said trustee among my legal heirs according to the Intestate Laws of Pennsylvania, and this trust shall thereupon terminate.” Her cousins, the appellant and Edith Lentz, claim as her legal heirs under that provision. They submit that clause <em>o, </em>quoted above, is not a residuary clause and that testator has not thereby exercised the power in favor of Probst. They seem to concede, however, that there may have been a partial exercise of the power because, unless the appointive property can be drawn on, there will not be enough money by half to pay the pecuniary legacies; in that view, their contention is that they take under Mrs. Noble’s will the balance not required to pay pecuniary legacies given by her husband.</p>

Under section 11, a gift of the residue without mention of the power carries the appointive property unless the testator has expressed an intention to the contrary: <em>Huddy’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/236/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="236 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="986708" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0276-01">236 Pa. 276</a>, 282, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20909" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="84 A. 909">84 A. 909</a>;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">

    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[218,670,1151,1022]]]'>Appellant’s contention seems based largely on the facts that in clause o the legatee is described as “executor” and that the word “assets,” a word of technical meaning, is used. But, in clause <em>h, </em>he gave $1,000 to Lawrence F. Probst, describing him as executor; in clause <em>m </em>he gave his Clark Printing and Manufacturing Company stock “to my Executor and good Friend Lawrence F. Probst.” When, for the third time, he used the word “executor” with respect to Mr. Probst, in clause <em>o, </em>we think he used it in the same sense as in the two preceding clauses, merely as a term of description and not as a limitation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> While the word “assets” in a technical sense means, as appellant says, property available for the payment of debts, the meaning must be taken to be that which the context shows to have been intended; that he added a power to sell the assets is not inconsistent with this view because he may have thought such a power would facilitate payment of the legacies.
