This Company was the trustee of a certain Trust Mortgage Pool consisting of 153 mortgages. The Company was also Trustee, Guardian, etc., of 829 separate and distinct estates, and in administering 529 of them it had invested their funds in participating certificates in the Trust Mortgage Pool, each estate receiving a particular certificate in the amount of the funds so invested. For some time prior to September 30,1933, the Company as Trustee for the Mortgage Pool had made payments to certain certificate holders in anticipation of the receipt of interest on various mortgages of the Pool, which interest was in default at the time the payments to certificate holders were made, and on the date stated the Company as Trustee had advanced the sum of $25,002.98 in excess of the interest actually received on the mortgages. The interest so advanced was taken from the general trust fund accounts which it carried in the First National Bank of Media and the Real Estate Trust Company and with itself. In these deposit accounts the Company deposited funds coming into its hands in its fiduciary capacity, including not only principal and income' from the Trust Mortgage Pool but also principal and income from all other investments made or carried by the Company as Trustee or Guardian or received by it in its capacity as fiduciary. On the date of the Company’s closing the Receiver received $25,002.98 to make up the shortage in the Trust Fund Account.</p>

On October 15, 1934, pursuant to the order of the court, the Receiver turned over to the Chester-Cambridge Bank and Trust Co., Substituted Trustee for the Pool, all of the mortgages and income constituting this Pool except the sum of $25,002.98 and in his account the Receiver asked credit for this sum of $25,002.98 for the reason above indicated.

A rule to show cause why this compromise agreement should not be carried out was granted and a copy of this rule was served upon Y. Gilpin Robinson, Esq., who represented a certain percentage of the total interest in the mortgage pool. The Receiver demanded that the sum stated be paid to him as there was then pending an unrelated claim against the Receiver involving the Gordon-Rhodes Agreement which, if it had been successful, would have required the Receiver to retain the sum of $9,214.23 as indemnity under the Gordon-Rhodes Agreement. After a hearing on the return day of the rule the Court entered two decrees, one authorizing the Chester - Cambridge Bank and Trust Company to pay the above “compromise sum” to the Receiver and the other authorizing the Receiver to accept it in full compromise of the- claims of the Receiver and the Executors to the sum of $25,002.98. Y. Gilpin Robinson filed exceptions to these decrees in behalf of the holders of the certificates of the Mortgage Pool. These exceptions were dismissed. No appeal was taken.

It is averred that said agreement of compromise, as well as the subsequent actions of the Court thereon, were and are totally null and void, by reason of Respondent’s objections thereto, by lack of power of the Receiver so to do, under the law, and by lack of jurisdiction of the Court to order or to approve such a compromise over Respondent’s objections. Further, that no final order or decree has yet been made by any Court, with respect to said alleged compromise.” It is also “denied that under the Gordon-Rhodes Agreement the said sum of $9,-214.23 should be paid to the Executors of the Estate of Frank B. Rhodes, deceased. On the contrary it is averred that said sum should forthwith be returned to Chester-Cambridge Bank and Trust Company, Substituted Trustee of the Trust Mortgage Pool, for distribution among the holders of participating certificates according to law (<a href="/pa/329/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="329 Pa. 587" data-case-ids="1181368" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0587-01">329 Pa. 587</a>). It is further averred that the Gordon-Rhodes Agreement shows in itself that said Rhodes was and is a volunteer within the meaning of the Pennsylvania decisions, and hence cannot recover anything. It is further averred that since the gravaman of Rhodes’ claim is the use of his funds to pay the $25,-002.98 surcharge to the Substituted Trustee, and since such payment is outside the scope of the Gordon-Rhodes Agreement, Rhodes’ remedy is not against the fund now in Court, but is to surcharge the Receiver for misapplication of the funds put up by him for a specific purpose.”</p>

The opinion stated, inter alia: “The decrees of May 4th and 5th approving the compromise, while excepted to, stand today unreversed as no appeal was taken within three months of the dismissal of the exception.” He also declared that Mr. <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>Rhodes was <em>not </em>a volunteer. On that phase of the case he said: “Mr. Rhodes only advanced that sum on certain conditions and promises for reimbursement and those conditions and promises are set forth in the Gordon-Rhodes Agreement. At that time the affairs of the Trust Company were in the hands of the court through its right arm, the Receiver. A person is not a volunteer under such conditions when the court could use its process to compel the agreement herein. Look at the consequences to him if he had not! The agreement is, however, valid and binding and not against public policy but, on the contrary, Mr. Rhodes did a very laudable act in putting up these funds to facilitate the settling up of the various estates for which the bank was trustee. In all equity and. good conscience the executors are entitled to be paid the sum of $9,214.23 by the. receiver under the Gordon-Rhodes agreement. . . . The issue raised by the petition and answer, therefore, is whether or not the money should go to the executors or back to the substituted trustee. It would be reducing legal procedure to absurdity to suggest that, after hundreds of pages of testimony, days of the court’s time, a solemn agreement of compromise and the approval thereof by the court, the whole proceedings should be nullified by returning the sum involved to the very party who originally paid it.”</p>

The lower court said: “The pronouncement of the Supreme Court ... is that no claim for recoupment of delinquent interest under the circumstances before us may be allowed and awarded until the Substituted Trustee has filed its final account. Since that has not here been done the orders here excepted to directing such recoupment were prematurely, and therefore improperly entered at the time or times they were made and the credit for said payment appearing in the Special Supplemental Account filed by the Substituted Trustee should not have been allowed. The exceptions to said orders and to that item in the account must be sustained. It follows that the rule to show cause why the fund of $9,214.23 should not be repaid by the Receiver to the Substituted Trustee was not properly dismissed in the order of August 27, 1940, but that said repayment should have been directed —as now it must be. This is so, in our opinion, because we believe that the fund of $25,002.98, except as depleted by counsel fees paid thereoutof, should be kept intact in the hands of the Substituted Trustee to be accounted for in its final account on the audit of which it is properly distributable to those entitled thereto, under the authority of <em>Klein v. </em>Dunn, supra. The agreement of compromise above referred to works no different result. Under the decisions of the Supreme Court . . . the claim for recoupment here could not properly be asserted on the filing of this partial account. Consequently those <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>interested in the assets of the trust mortgage pool, even though they had notice of the audit of the account, had no reason to believe that this claim would be then presented and cannot be bound by a compromise agreement in regard thereto, made at said audit, to which they are not actual parties. They were within their rights in awaiting the Audit of the final account before objecting to such recoupment if they then wish to do so. The agreement in question does not preclude them in that respect.”</p>

Dunn, </em>supra, where we said: “A trustee who has made unauthorized and voluntary advancements of interest, without disclosing that fact to the cestuis que trustent, cannot assert a right of general recoupment against either the beneficiaries or the trust estate. As we said in <em>Media-69th Street Tr. Co's Tr. Mtge. Pool Case, </em><a href="/pa/329/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="329 Pa. 587" data-case-ids="1181368" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0587-01">329 Pa. 587</a>, 591: <em>‘. . . </em>his right of reimbursement is limited to the income thereafter earned upon the identical investments on which the advancement was made. If the particular interest advanced is subsequently collected, the trustee may obtain reimbursement therefrom, and the transaction is closed. If the particular interest advanced cannot be collected, the transaction remains open, and any loss arising therefrom must be borne by the trustee who volunteered the payment.’ See also: <em>Klein’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/326/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="326 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="1174490" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0393-01">326 Pa. 393</a>; <em>Nauman’s Est., </em><a href="/pa-super/110/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="110 Pa. Super. 55" data-case-ids="969748" data-case-paths="/pa-super/110/0055-01">110 Pa. Superior Ct. 55</a>. In the case of the Media-69th Street Trust Company, the trustee had already collected approximately $7,300, which admittedly represented The particular interest advanced,’ and as to that amount we indicated that there was a right of recoupment. Nevertheless, we held that the claim was prematurely made, inasmuch as the final account of the substituted trustee had not yet been filed. It does not follow from the fact that advancements for delinquent interest have been made to bondholders under the circumstances here present that such advances must be reimbursed from the first moneys paid upon the mortgage, or that the pay<a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>ments so received shall he treated arbitrarily as repayment of the ‘particular interest advanced.’ It must be remembered that these advancements were made without any indication to the bondholders that the mortgagor had defaulted, and that they were kept in ignorance of the impairment of their investment for a period of two years thereafter. Had they known the true situation, they could have immediately instituted foreclosure proceedings, or taken other appropriate action to protect their rights. Instead they were lulled into a false sense of security by acts of the trustee Bank amounting to a representation that there had been no default. In view of these circumstances, it would be inequitable to permit the trustee Bank to assert that the interest payments for which the advances were made were not in fact paid by the mortgagor, if the assertion would work prejudice to the bondholders: <em>Paine v. Bank, </em><a href="/pa/194/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="194 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="912423" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0403-01">194 Pa. 403</a>. See also <em>Fedas v. Ins.

In volunteering these advancements without disclosure of the default, the Beading Bank violated its duty as a fiduciary to inform the cestuis fully of all matters affecting their interest, and accordingly it must be held to have assumed the risk that the particular installments of interest advanced might never be repaid. In <em>Commonwealth Trust Co.

This claim can be asserted only after the bondholders have been paid in full.’ ”</p>

It was an agreement between only three parties though there were several hundred holders of participating certificates who would be affected by it if it was recognized as binding upon them. The decrees made <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>on May 4th and 5th, 1939, based on this “compromise” were expressly made “without prejudice.” This indicates that there were rights not affected by it and which could be asserted in further proceedings. The phrase “without prejudice” ordinarily imports the contemplation of further proceedings and when it appears in an order or decree it shows that the judicial act done is not intended to be res judicata of the merits of the controversy. “The words ‘without prejudice’ import into any transaction that the parties have agreed that as between themselves the receipt of money by one and its payment by the other shall not of themselves have any legal effect on the rights of the parties, but they shall be open to settlement by legal controversy as if the money had not been paid. <em>Hinton v.

There is nothing in the Gordon-Rhodes Agreement to the contrary. It expressly provides that “payments due under said trusts” have the first claim on any collections made “against the respective estates or funds to which overdrafts have been made” and that “any ultimate deficiency arising, upon determining that it is impossible to make further collections, shall fall upon the funds so deposited”.
