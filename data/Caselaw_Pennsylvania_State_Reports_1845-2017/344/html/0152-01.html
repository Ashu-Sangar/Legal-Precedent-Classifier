For present purposes, the facts are not in dispute; the only evidence received on the trial was that of the plaintiff.</p>

On February 19, 1940, at 8:50 A. M., the floor of the lobby of defendant’s building was covered with water and slush which had been carried in on the feet of those who entered the building. At that time the plaintiff, in walking through the lobby of the defendant’s building, slipped, fell, and sustained injuries. There had been snow followed by rain with the result that the sidewalks were covered with slush. Plaintiff knew of the weather conditions for she had traversed a number of blocks before entering the building. The floor of the lobby from the door to the elevator was covered by a corrugated rubber strip on which plaintiff was walking when she fell. An examination of the record will sustain the sum<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>mary of the appellee that the evidence amounted to no more than a showing that the lobby presented a usual condition found when such weather .conditions prevailed and that defendant had taken the customary precautions.</p>

The mere happening of an accident does not show that one party or the other was at fault: <em>McAvoy v.

Plaintiff’s proofs were also deficient in that she failed to show that the condition of Avhich she complained had existed for an unreasonable length of time so. that defendant was put on notice: <em>MacDonald v.

Technically the action of the trial judge was . proper, for the offer was not full enough to bring it within the rule stated in <em>Ringelheim v.
