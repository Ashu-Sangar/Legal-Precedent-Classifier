The jury rendered a verdict, “$1,000 for maintenance, and $3,000 for pain, injury and wages.” Defendants moved for judgment n. o. v. and their motion was granted on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that plaintiff’s release was invalid.

The voyage began January 10,1937, and ended March 5,1937. He claimed for various injuries but particularly for serious injury to his back, a fracture of the lower transverse spinal processes, which he alleged resulted from the fall on him of a defectively fastened ventilator cover. We accept his statement, because corroborated by one of respondent’s witnesses, that the accident occurred the day before the vessel reached its first port, Gothenburg, and that he received first aid and went to bed. During the six-hour period the vessel remained in that port, plaintiff remained on board. The next port, Copenhagen, was reached a day or so later and there plaintiff went ashore <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>and, at the captain’s request, was examined by respondent’s doctor, who gave plaintiff a written report, identified by him and in evidence, stating that he had contusions of the first and second fingers of the left hand, no fracture; “The contusion of the right foot is not much. It will be best in treating the fingers that the man don’t work for three days with the hand.” He remained on shore some time. He testified that he went to a place where he had “some drinks” and that he returned to the ship with a note from the proprietress of a restaurant asking that the captain put him in funds to pay her bill of 30 kroners. The captain testified that, before landing at Copenhagen, he had noticed that plaintiff’s hand was painted with iodine and that he instructed him to go to the company’s doctor and report back. The captain also testified that on the evening of plaintiff’s return to the ship when he brought to him the note requesting the payment of money for the restaurant keeper, plaintiff “was bleeding from the mouth, and his jaw was swollen.” These were injuries the captain had not observed in the morning and the doctor had not found on his examination; obviously they were inflicted on shore. The captain said he declined to give plaintiff the amount because it was more than was owing to him. The ship sailed from Copenhagen the next morning, January 29th, and arrived at Gdynia, Poland, on the morning of the 30th, when plaintiff informed the captain that he thought his jaw was broken; the captain then directed that he be taken to a hospital. At the hospital he was X-rayed and put to bed. He testified that plaster casts were applied to his head and leg and he was put “on fracture boards” for his back. The plaster casts which he says were applied to his head were, we assume, required by the condition of his jaw described by the captain. The ship returned without plaintiff. Subsequently, respondents arranged for his discharge from the hospital and his return on another of their vessels. When the vessel on which he returned arrived at Jersey City, March 18,1937, he went <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>to the company’s office and reported to respondents’ agent at the latter’s request. Plaintiff testified he said to the agent, “I would like to get what money I have coming to me and go to a hospital. I’m very sick.” The agent sent him to the Marine Hospital where N-rays were again taken. At that time the agent paid him $15 because he said he had no money; the next day he received $10, and the day after, $3; for each payment he signed a simple receipt. He testified that he thought he had three months’ wages due him though he must have been mistaken about that because, by an itemized voucher in the record, he had acknowledged the receipt at Gdynia of his wages in full to February 8th. The voyage for which he engaged ended March 5th. During the trial he denied that he had made any claim to the agent for injury, asldng only for wages. Respondents’ evidence is that he also claimed for injury and was told that the only injury that they believed he had sustained on board was the trivial injury to the fingers reported by the Copenhagen doctor.</p>

Respondents had offered to settle all claims for $100, less the $28 which they had'advanced to him, as has been stated, on and after March 18th. He testified that the company’s agent said to him, “If you don’t sign here and take your money and go to Chicago, I’m going to have you put in jail.” He said he had been drinking and had been taking “vernal [veronal?] pills.” Asked at the trial how he was “feeling at that time,” he replied, “I was sick. I said, ‘Give me the money’ and he wrote it out and said, ‘You take this over to 5 Broadway.’ ” The agent who took his release did not pay him but gave him the release and directed him to take it to the company’s office in New York where the cashier would make payment. He went there and “handed this paper to a man <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>in the office and he tore it open and he handed me back a piece of paper and I signed it, and gave it back to him and he gave me $72.” He returned “to Hudson and Jay [Marine Hospital] to get [his] discharge” and then came to Philadelphia.</p>

For some of these injuries he received compensation and executed releases and Avas therefore not unfamiliar with such instruments. For one claim- “around April 2nd, 1932,” he said he received $4,500. At the time this suit was tried, he had pending an action against the Southern Steamship Company to recover for injuries received in August, 1935. He denied that he claimed in the present suit for the same injuries for which he was claiming in the suit against the Southern Company, but, when confronted with it, admitted his signature to the statement of claim which contained an averment, inter alia, for injury to back and spine. In the present suit he also claimed for injury to the back and spine. The court in banc said: “The testimony produced by the plaintiff is entirely unreliable. He was aware of the attitude taken by the defendant toward his alleged claim. On three different occasions, he accepted money from the agent of the defendant and when he asked for what he claimed was due him, an offer was made him by the agent for the defendant. Showing some reluctance about accepting it, he Avas told to go home, think it over and come back the next day. This he did. It seems hard to believe that when he knew he was returning for the purpose of adjusting his claim Avith the agent of the defendant, he Avould fortify himself with drink and sedatives. We must consider the other statement that he was forced to sign the release under threat of arrest, and we furthermore must not forget that on at least three prior occasions, he had signed releases and was aAvare therefore of their import. Furthermore, in considering his credibility, we must not forget that when questioned whether in 1935 <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>(two years before) he had made a claim against the Southern Steamship Company for an injury to his back, his answer was No. The statement of claim presented in that case was put in evidence and a reading of Paragraph 8 thereof shows his statement: ‘He was violently wounded, jarred and generally shaken about the head, body, spine, arms, legs and feet, and particularly his face and jaw were swollen and discolored, several teeth knocked out and several ribs broken.’</p>

The verdict not having been directed, as requested by defendants, it was the duty of the court in banc, in considering defendants’ motion for judgment non obstante veredicto, to decide whether the evidence should have been submitted to the jury (Act of April 22, 1905, P.

Goodrich, Conflict of Laws (2d ed.), pp. 197, 198: “It has already been stated that matters of procedure are in general determined by the internal law of the forum. It would naturally follow that the rules of evidence should so be classified. These relate to the way in which a case is to be proved, how facts are to be established. If the lex fori requires proof of a certain kind, it would not seem to matter whether the cause of action arose within or without the jurisdiction. . . . The same would be true in deciding the question whether a plaintiff had established, on the facts, a case sufficient to go to the jury.” Beale, Conflict of Laws (1935), vol. 3, p. 1611: “The close connection between the ordinary presumption and problems of burden of proof is readily apparent. Hence it is not surprising that courts have held that burden of proof is procedural and governed by the law of the forum.”</p>

The tribunal might be a judge, or a jury, or both, so far as regards apportioning the risk of non-persuasion. Nothing has been said, or need be, about a distinction between <em>judge </em>and <em>jury. </em>But we come now to a peculiar set of rules which have their source in the bipartite constitution of the common-law tribunal. Apart from the distinction of functions between judge and jury, these rules need have had no existence. They owe their existence chiefly to the historic and unquestioned control of the judge over the jury, and to the partial and dependent position of the jury as a member of the tribunal whose functions come into play only within certain limits.</p>

In short, in order to get to the jury on the issue, and bring into play the other burden of proof (in the sense of the risk of non-persuasion of the jury), both parties alike <em>must first satisfy the judge that they have a quantity of evidence fit to he considered </em>by the jury, and to form a reasonable basis for the verdict. This duty of satisfying the judge is peculiar in its operation, because if it is not fulfilled, the party in default loses, by order of the judge, and the jury is not given an opportunity to debate and form conclusions as if the issue were open ro them.”</p>
