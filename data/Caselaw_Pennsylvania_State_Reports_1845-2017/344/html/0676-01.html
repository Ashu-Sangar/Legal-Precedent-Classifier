MacGregor, </em><a href="/pa/314/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="314 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="1154727" data-case-paths="/pa/314/0454-01">314 Pa. 454</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.%20598" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="171 A. 598">171 A. 598</a>.

Our reading of the evidence convinces us that no other conclusion could have been sustained.</p>
