The latter filed a petition asMng the court to determine the respective rights of herself and her husband under an antenuptial agreement which both had executed. This the court declined to do on the ground that remedy by declaratory judgment was not invocable. From this ruling the wife appeals.</p>
    <p id="b351-12" data-blocks='[["BL_351.19",351,[246,1703,1153,305]]]'>Both of the parties had been married before. Each was possessed of property, real and personal.

The addendum reads as follows: “It is further agreed that the First Party [the husband] shall receive and accept from the estate of the Second <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>Party [the wife] the sain of $10,000.00 dollars in place and instead of all rights, which as surviving husband the First Party might otherwise have either as courtesy in the real property of the Second Party under any statutes now or hereafter in force and effect. The second party agrees that the sum of $10,000.00 dollars shall be fully paid to the first party if he shall survive her as soon after her decease as practicable.”</p>
    <p id="b352-4" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[216,735,1152,535]]]'>The husband claims that as written, the addendum not only gives him $10,000.00 out of his wife’s real estate, if he survives, but gives him such share, as he would take under the intestate law, of her personal property. This means that it wipes out and cancels the release of any such claim in the main agreement which he had simultaneously executed; that the mutual release is thereby nullified as to him, but stands so far as the wife is concerned. If she survives him, she can take none of his property, either real or personal.</p>

The word “either” is not connected with any alternative, as it necessarily must be, if it is to have any effect.

We think this may be true under certain of our rulings, not necessary now to be reviewed, because the 1935 amendment to the Act widens its scope, and we should give effect to this latest legislative declaration of the public policy on the matter. That amendment (Act of April 25, 1935, P. L. 72, Sec. 1, 12 PS Sec. 836) provides: “Relief by declaratory judgment or decree may be granted in all civil cases where an actual controversy exists between contending parties, ... or where in any such case the court is satisfied that a party asserts a legal relation, status, right, or privilege in which he has a concrete interest and that there is a challenge or denial of such asserted relation, status, right, or privilege by an adversary party who also has or asserts a concrete interest therein, and the court is satisfied also that a declaratory judgment or decree will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding. Where, however, a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy must be followed; but the mere fact that an actual or threatened controversy is susceptible of relief through a general common law remedy, or an equitable remedy, or an extraordinary legal remedy, whether such remedy is recognized or regulated by statute or not, shall not debar a party from the privilege of obtaining a declaratory judgment or decree in any case where the other <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>essentials to such relief are present, bnt the case is not ripe for relief by way of such common law remedy, or extraordinary legal remedy, or where the party asserting the claim, relation, status, right, or privilege and who might bring action thereon, refrains from pursuing any of the last mentioned remedies. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[219,627,1151,1404]]]'>There can be no question that “an actual controversy exists between contending parties.” The husband claims the right to share in the wife’s personal estate if she predeceases him; she denies such right. She is in the position of not being able by will to dispose of her personalty with certainty, because of her husband’s claim to a large part of it. We are “satisfied” that he “asserts a relation, status, right or privilege in which he has a concrete interest” which is challenged and denied by his wife, who “asserts a concrete interest therein” and Ave are “satisfied” also “that a declaratory judgment or decree will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.” No statute provides a “special” form of remedy for this “specific type of case.” The fact that the controversy is susceptible of relief through some other remedy, does not debar declaratory judgment relief where, as here, the case is not ripe for relief by way of such other remedy, as it will not be until the Avife dies.

If, for example, a husband made a will containing certain provisions for his wife and he and she differed in their lifetime in their interpretation of those provisions, that difference of opinion would not be an “actual controversy” in. any legal sense. Should they go into court and ask an “advisory opinion” in the form of a “declaratory judgment” to settle their difference of opinion, the court would under all the decisions promptly inform them that the Declaratory Judgment Act was not intended to be used for any such purpose. A “controversy” in a legal sense is a conflict or clashing of <em>immediate </em>legal interests. It does not mean simply differences of opinion between two persons as to the provisions of certain contracts they have entered into.

Its function in cases arising from differences in the interpretation of contracts is to enable a party to avert penalties and forfeitures. When A is about to do an act that B challenges his right to do and A does not test the validity of the challenge, A runs the risk of breaking a contract, to his immediate detriment. When for A to act on his challenged interpretation of his contract is to invite an action for damages or some other penalty, the prudent thing for him to do is to ask for a declaratory judgment on the legal question presented by the conflicting interpretations. For example in <em>Girard Trust Co., Agent, v. Tremblay M.

An act passed after the date of the lease prohibited the erection of wow-fireproof buildings of a. height greater than two stories to be used as was, in this instance, the building destroyed. The tenant demanded that the landlord erect a three-story fireproof building or a two-story building with abatement of rent. The landlord offered to erect either a two-story fireproof building or a three-story wow-fireproof building at the same rental. The tenant knew he could not use a three-story wow-fireproof building for the same purpose he had used the building destroyed because the act above referred to forbade its use for that purpose (i. e., for automobile sales and a <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>service station). This situation presented a controversy calling for the immediate interpretation of the lease contract between the parties. The court said (p. 524): “In a case like the present, by proceeding according to the Declaratory Judgments Act, the parties avoid the necessity of first actually erecting a building in order to be in a position to obtain a judicial construction of their respective rights and liabilities.”</p>

Plaintiffs contended that there was no valid assignment to the defendants, that L was not the defendants’ agent, and that there was no novation. As the original contract had over a year to run and as plaintiffs did not wish to break it and so subject themselves to an action for damages, they asked the court for a declaration that the contract was no longer binding on them.

True it is that it may be very <em>convenient </em>for her to know in advance whether under that contract her husband <em>if he survives her </em>can claim any interest in her personal estate; so it would be equally convenient for any person who is about to make a will disposing of his estate to knoAV in advance whether after his death his estate Avill be depleted or not by reason of certain contracts he has entered into and whose meaning has become doubtful to him, but the Declaratory Judgment Act Avas never intended to drive the courts into these limitless fields of <em>advisory judgments. </em>The later Act of April 25, 1935, P. L. 72, was clearly not intended to force courts into that field, Avhich they refused to enter under the Act of June 18, 1923, P. L. 840. The Act of 1923 uses language which, like that in the Act of 1935, <em>might </em>be construed by some as warranting what plaintiff asks for, but the decisions and opinions of this court make it plain that Ave cannot constitutionally enter the field of advisory opinion no matter how broad the language of the statutory invitation may superficially seem to be. The Act of 1923, sec. 2, says: “Any person interested under a deed, will, written contract ... or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute . . . contract, or franchises may have determined any question of construction or validity under the instrument . . . and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations (-.hereunder.” Plaintiff can plausibly argue that <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>she is a “person interested under a contract” and that her “rights or status are affected by that contract” and that therefore she is entitled under the Act of 1923 to have from this court “a declaration as to her rights or status under that contract” but the answer to that argument is found in <em>Eariher’s Petition, </em>supra, and numerous other decisions of this court. The argument that plaintiff is entitled to a judicial declaration as to her rights <em>imder the Act of 19S5 </em>also readily admits of an answer. First of all, there is no <em>“actual controversy” </em>existing between this plaintiff and the respondent, when we give to the word “controversy” its legal and proper meaning. There is existing between these parties a <em>difference of opinion </em>as to the import of their contract but this difference does not rise to the dignity of a legal <em>controversy </em>any more than do thousands of other similar differences of opinion as to the import of contracts. There is no certainty that the “difference of opinion” here existing will ever ripen into a legal controversy. Second, there are here present no “antagonistic claims” between the parties “which indicate <em>imminent and inevitable </em>litigation”. There is no chance whatever for litigation between these parties over this contract while <em>both </em>are alive, and if the husband dies before the wife or if the wife dies before the husband and leaves no personal estate, there can be no litigation of any kind over this contract. There is therefore no warrant whatever for the claim that litigation over this contract is <em>“imminent </em>and inevitable”.</p>

If this construction is correct, the first two alternatives are entirely meaningless. Admittedly the third is obscure, but it does include the first two because the word “where” is followed by the words “in any such case”, which definitely refers to the first two situations. The analysis of the majority in no way attempts to explain this contradiction of its position. There was a reason for the passage of the Amendment, and it was not to destroy the original Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, but to correct errors in judicial interpretation and bring the Act back to its original meaning. Professor Edwin M. Borchard, an authority on the subject, who was a co-draftsman of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act and of the Federal Act, in an article entitled “Recent Developments in Declaratory Relief” (10 Temple L. Q. 233, 1936) (and in his treatise on Declaratory Judgments, 1941, p. 318 et seq.) states that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act was originally intended to provide an alternative remedy to be available even though there was already an existing common law or equitable remedy, though not if there were an existing statutory remedy, and that the rule to this effect laid down in <em>Kariher’s </em>Petition, supra, was subsequently departed <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>from in <em>Leaf green v.

Q. at p. 233). With respect to the justiciability of the controversy he says in his treatise (p. 37) that the plaintiff’s interest “must be present, and not contingent, though it may be presently affected or jeopardized by a future event certain to occur.” And concerning ripeness of the issue he states (pp. 56-7, 60) : “When are the facts sufficiently developed to admit of a conclusive adjudication, and when are they so contingent and uncertain as to justify a refusal to decide? Again, no <em>a priori </em>answer is possible. The only safe guide is an analysis of the precedents in which declaratory judgments have been granted and declined. In general, it may be said that the facts on which a legal decision is demanded must have accrued, for the principle of a declaratory judgment is that it declares the existing law on an existing state of facts. The danger or dilemma of the plaintiff must be present, not contingent on the happening of hypothetical future events — although it may involve future benefits or disadvantages — and the prejudice to his position must be actual and genuine and not merely possible or remote. When the complaint on these tests is considered premature, the dismissal may be explained by any one of a series of labels, <em>e. g., </em>that there is as yet no ‘controversy’, that the issue is hypothetical, that the result would be only an advisory opinion, etc. Where the plaintiff is merely in doubt as to his rights under a written instrument, such'as a will, and there is either no one who dis<a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>putes the claim or else some event must happen before the plaintiffs right fully accrues, the action is naturally considered as prematurely brought. . . . The imminence and practical certainty of the act or event in issue, or the intent, capacity, and power [of a debtor-plaintiff] to perform, create justiciability as clearly as the completed act or event, and is generally easily distinguishable from remote, contingent, and uncertain events that may never happen and upon which it would be improper to pass as operative facts. Again, where it appears that acts within the plaintiff’s own control may make the decision academic, the court in its discretion may decline a declaration” (citing <em>Lyell v. Cormack, </em>40 B. D. 345). And on page 81, n. 18: “Actions for declarations are occasionally brought upon an assumed state of facts or before all the facts upon which rights depend have yet accrued; the facts posited may never arise and are therefore contingent or uncertain. Under such circumstances, courts are justified in refusing to render declaratory judgments on the ground that they are not ripe for such judgment, the effect of which would be essentially that of an advisory opinion.” These quotations from Professor Borchard fit the instant case exactly. See also, Borchard, Declaratory Judgments in Pennsylvania, 82 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 317, 330-31. Although he has, for at least twenty-five years, advocated the extension of the scope of the declaratory judgment remedy (see his first articles in 28 Tale L. J. 1-32,105-150), he nowhere suggests that it be applied to contingent claims or moot cases, and cites no decisions so doing.</p>

Therefore, the requirements of an actual controversy and imminent and inevitable litigation, which the court followed before the 1935 Amendment, should continue to be applied unless the Amendment proceeds to enlarge the scope of the words or remove former restrictions on them.

It is easy to see that in some circumstances such a question cannot arise, and that in others in which it may arise, the facts on which it may then be presented cannot be anticipated. The contingent character of the circumstances presented by petitioners takes the case out of the class in which the court will enter declaratory judgments. The court is not vested with jurisdiction to give advice merely: <em>Cryan’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/301/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="301 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1126421" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0386-01">301 Pa. 386</a>, 391, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%20675" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="152 A. 675">152 A. 675</a>.” After quoting the Amendment in question, we continued (p. 494) : “. . .

The parties may differ on what the will means, but that is not enough to support the declaration made.” In <em>Quigley’s Estate, </em>supra, we said in reference to this and. another amendment passed in the same year (Act of May 22, 1935, P. L. 228), (p. 294) : “These acts, however, still leave to the court the discretion to render declaratory judgments or decrees only where it is convinced ‘that such a judgment or decree is appropriate and proper to be entered,’ and is satisfied that antagonistic claims are present ‘which indicate <em>imminent </em>and inevitable litigation.’ ” In <em>Capital Ble. and Tr. Company’s Petition, </em>supra, in which a trustee sought a declaration of its authority to make a lease of mortgaged premises and to subordinate the lien of the mortgage to the proposed lease, we said in reversing a decree granting the relief prayed for (p. Ill) : “As we have stated before, the vital factor in the assumption of jurisdiction is the presence of antagonistic claims indicating imminent and inevitable litigation, coupled with a clear manifestation that the declaration sought will be a practical help in ending the controversy: <em>Reese v.

If and when the differences of opinion between counsel and their clients become something more than that, the court may act . . . there is no actual controversy, at this juncture, between the parties, and the court is, therefore, without authority to affect their rights under the terms of the deed.
