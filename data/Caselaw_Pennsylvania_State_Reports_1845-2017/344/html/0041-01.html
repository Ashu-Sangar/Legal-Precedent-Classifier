The petition sets forth that Charles McGlinn was tried on November 20, 1931, before Judge Harry S. McDevitt and a jury on two charges, to wit (as described) : <em>(a) </em>“being armed to rob”, and (5) “robbery, and a verdict of ‘guilty’ was rendered”. Thereupon the petitioner was sentenced to serve a minimum of' 10 years and a maximum of 20 years in the Eastern Penitentiary. He is now in the penitentiary serving this sentence. He claims that he is “unlawfully restrained and deprived of his liberty” because he at his trial “did not have coun<a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>sel; was not represented by counsel, was not informed of Ms right to have counsel; did not have counsel appointed by the court; and did nothing that would waive his constitutional right to be represented by counsel”.

McMonegle had a gun. They immediately told the operator to “stick ’em up”. They robbed him of $18 and 45 tokens. There was a passenger in the car, Anthony Hildebrand, who identified the defendants as being the ones who held up the operator. They were arrested two or three blocks from the holdup. A loaded 32 calibre revolver was found on McMonegle who had part of the money, $12.20, and the balance of the money, $5.60, was found upon McGlinn, a total of $17.80, and some of the tokens.

The decision in none of these cases requires us to grant the petitioner a hearing or to release him from imprisonment. In the first case named the scope of the decision was clearly defined by Justice Sutherland as follows: “All that it is necessary now to decide, as we do decide, is that in a capital case, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel, and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance, feeble-mindedness, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign counsel for him as a necessary requisite of due process of law; and that duty is not discharged by an assignment at such a time or under such circumstances as to preclude the giving of effective aid in the preparation and trial of the case.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In the second case the petitioner was a <em>federal </em>prisoner who claimed that the right guaranteed him by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution had been denied him, to wit: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.” This Amendment applies only to prosecutions under federal laws. <em>(Hurtado v. </em>California, <a href="/us/110/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="110 U.S. 516" data-case-ids="3503887" data-case-paths="/us/110/0516-01">110 U.

In Mr. Justice Black’s opinion in <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em><a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">supra,</a> he said: “Since the Sixth Amendment constitutionally entitles one charged with crime to the assistance of counsel, compliance with this constitutional mandate is an essential jurisdictional prerequisite to a federal court’s authority to deprive an accused of his life or liberty. When this right is properly waived, the <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>assistance of counsel is no longer a necessary element of the court’s jurisdiction to proceed to conviction and sentence. If the accused, however, is not represented by counsel and has not competently and intelligently waived his constitutional right, the Sixth Amendment stands as a jurisdictional bar to a valid conviction and sentence depriving him of his life or his liberty.” In the third case the petitioner, a <em>federal </em>prisoner, claimed that “he was deprived of the assistance of counsel for his defence in violation of the Sixth Amendment”. He stated that when he told the District Attorney “he intended to plead not guilty”, that official “sought to persuade him that he would be proved guilty . . .” that petitioner’s request for time to “communicate with his relatives and try to obtain money to enable him to hire an attorney for his defense” was denied by the District Attorney as “not possible” and that official “told him to plead guilty, warning him that he would be sentenced to twice as great a term if he did not so plead”. He did so plead, though in his petition he claimed to be innocent. The Court held: “On this record it is his right to be heard.” In the fourth case the facts as described by Mr. Justice Black are these: “After three days in ... jail and ‘without ever having had a copy of the charge’, petitioner was . . . summarily arraigned, and upon his prearranged plea of guilty, sentenced ... to a term of twenty years imprisonment. . . . Petitioner, an uneducated layman, had no knowledge of law or legal procedure, and had never before been arrested or been in a court room. . . . His petition presents a picture of a defendant, without counsel, bewildered by court processes strange and unfamiliar to him, and inveigled by false statements of state law enforcement officers into entering a plea of guilty. The petitioner charged ‘that he had been denied any real notice of the nature of the charge against him, the first and most universally recognized requirement of due process; that because of deception by the state’s representatives he had pleaded guilty to a <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>charge punishable by twenty years to life imprisonment; that his request for the benefit and advice of counsel had been denied by the court, and that he had been rushed to the penitentiary where his ignorance, confinement and poverty had precluded the possibility of his securing counsel in order to challenge the procedure by regular processes of appeal’.” The petition now before us makes out no such showing of a denial of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

It is in the nature of a writ of error, to examine the legality of the commitment. . . . The petitioner is detained in prison by virtue of the judgment of a court, which court possesses general and final jurisdiction in criminal cases. Can this judgment be reexamined upon a writ of habeas corpus? This writ is, as has been said, in the nature of a writ of error, which brings up the body of the prisoner with the cause of commitment. The Court can undoubtedly inquire into the sufficiency of that cause; but if it be the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, especially a judgment withdrawn by law from the revision of this court, is not that judgment in itself sufficient cause? Can the court, upon this writ, look beyond the judgment, and reexamine the charges on which it was rendered. A judgment, in its nature, concludes the subject on which it is rendered, and pronounces the law of the case. The judgment of a court of record whose jurisdiction is final, is as conclusive on all the world as the judgment of this court would be. It is as conclusive on this court as it is on other courts. It puts an end to inquiry concerning the fact, by deciding it. . . . It would be strange if, under colour of a writ to liberate an individual from unlawful imprisonment, we could substantially reverse a judgment which the law has placed beyond our control. An imprisonment under a judgment cannot be unlawful, unless that judgment be an absolute nullity; and it is not a nullity if the court has general jurisdiction of the subject, although it should be erroneous.”</p>

The lowest must act upon it, subject to the higher social law that is involved in official subordination. Often the question may be erroneously decided. Often such decisions may result in great injury to the citizen, but it is the lot of government to err, because it is human, and a man of Avell-trained mind will think it no great hardship to submit to authority even in error. In the name of order, the country demands, and has the right to demand it. It is usual to say, even of foreign judgments, that, if pronounced by a competent tribunal, and carried into effect Avithout our assistance, they are conclusive of the question decided. . . . Not that the United States is a foreign country, but that its courts belong to a different system from the state courts, and thus these respective authorities are, as authorities, foreign to each other. Each must respond to its oivn superiors; neither can call the other officially to account. . . . Manufacture and repair constitutions and bills of right as we may; multiply checks and restrictions upon official functions as we may, we cannot shut out human error and its consequences, which are sometimes distressing — while we may carry our suspicions of government so far as to take away its real efficiency as a means of preserving social order; . . .
