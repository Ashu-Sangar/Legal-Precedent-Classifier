    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[197,512,1151,1234]]]'>About three A. M. standard time on July 23, 1933, plaintiff drove an automobile south on Twelfth Street, Philadelphia, at the rate of eighteen to twenty miles an hour. Twelfth Street is approximately twenty-six feet between curbs with a single car track in the center, and the automobile was running almost within the track. As plaintiff approached Durfor Street, which is a small street about fourteen feet between curbs, he looked east and west but saw nothing. There was no street light on any of the corners and shade trees lined the easterly side of Twelfth Street at that point. A horse, dark in color, drawing a wagon without a light, came suddenly from his left; to the excited plaintiff it seemed that it “shot out like a bullet.” The horse did not get in front of the automobile; his head was about a foot to the left of the radiator cap and three feet in front of the windshield when plaintiff, to avoid a collision, swerved sharply to the right and into a telegraph pole at the southwest corner; apparently, however, there was some contact between the vehicles for the right shaft of the wagon was broken. The driver was not on the wagon at the time of the accident but was on foot delivering milk to houses on both sides of Durfor Street.</p>
