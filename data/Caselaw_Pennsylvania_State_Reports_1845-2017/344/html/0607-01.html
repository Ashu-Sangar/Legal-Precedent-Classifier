August 5, 1940, the hoard of directors of the company submitted a plan to its common and preferred stockholders, one of the avowed objects of which was “to take care of accumulated dividends on the 7% preferred stock.” The plan called for a merger of the company with its principal subsidiary, the Pittsburgh Crucible Steel Company. Each common share of the old company of $100 par value was to be exchanged for a common share of the continuing corporation with no par value but a stated value of $25. Each preferred share of the old company was to be exchanged for 1.4 shares of 5% preferred stock of the continuing corporation with dividends cumulative from July 1, 1940, par value of $100 a share, redeemable at $110 per share at the option of the corporation, and entitled to a preference on involuntary dissolution of $100 per share and on voluntary dissolution of $110 per share plus accumulated dividends in either event.</p>

      <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>The Crucible Steel Company of America for several years, during the depression, operated at a loss so that it found itself in a position where it was in arrears in dividends on the preferred stock for almost six years. In 1940 the company was beginning to operate at a profit and its capital was not impaired. Nevertheless, it could not for some time discharge the arrearages in dividends on the preferred stock and no dividends could be paid on the common stock until the dividends on the preferred were brought up to date. Under the plan devised one of the main objectives was to “equitably satisfy” the accumulated dividends. To meet that situation each preferred stockholder was given the same number of preferred shares in the continuing corporation which he formerly had and an additional forty per cent of stock which calculated at par would give to each share $40, a sum within 75 cents of the arrearages in dividends. When we take into account that the preferred stockholder would not in the natural course of events have received dividends in full to date for several years, while under the merger they were received at once, the small difference disappears.</p>
    <p id="b637-5" data-blocks='[["BL_637.4",637,[255,1495,1153,316]]]'>The trustee here received 97 shares in the continuing corporation in lieu of an equal amount of stock in the old corporation, of the same par value with equal priorities.

So considering the matter, the common stockholders procured available values by rearrangement of the capital structure of the corporation, all by proceedings legally conducted. This was a matter of corporation law. They then transferred those values to the preferred stockholders in discharge of rights which such stockholders had to receive dividends. In fact, in that <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>manner the payment of dividends to such preferred stockholders was merely anticipated. As between life tenant and remaindermen the additional stock was in fact given in discharge of dividends and must be so treated.</p>
    <p id="b638-5" data-blocks='[["BL_638.4",638,[215,549,1155,1127]]]'>Appellee argues that since the 40% additional preferred stock was not based on earnings it was not distributable to life tenants, citing <em>Opperman’s Est. (No. 1), </em>supra. We there said (p. 462) : “There is, however, a distinction between earned surplus and contributed capital. Contributed capital is neither earnings nor increment, nor may it be included in ‘income’ when that term is used in a will and, if paid by way of dividends, current or otherwise, it belongs to corpus.” The cases are not parallel for there we were dealing with a contribution by the common stockholders to common stock and, of course, contributed capital constituted capital and not earnings. Here a sum was paid into the capital account representing preferred stock not by the preferred stockholders but by the common stockholders so that payment of the preferred dividends might be anticipated. The fund provided came neither from earnings nor from contributions by preferred stockholders. The life tenant gave up his right to receive dividends which were in arrears on the old stock and he is entitled to some reimbursement.</p>

But the summary there given did not define precisely all circumstances warranting an apportionment: <em>Daily’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/323/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="323 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1169592" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0042-01">323 Pa. 42</a>, 46, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.%20754" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="186 A. 754">186 A. 754</a>. In addition the cases are clearly distinguishable on their facts. In that case common stock alone was involved and after the merger the relative rights of life tenant and remainderman were not changed and the increment was due to a change in the intrinsic value of the assets. Here the values which <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>form the basis for issuing 40% additional preferred stock were furnished by the common stockholders and were supplied for the purpose of discharging the arrearages in preferred dividends. In apportionment cases we determine the relative rights of life tenants and remainder-men and in doing so we examine the corporate acts only for the purpose of ascertaining how those rights have been affected and especially to see that the intact value of the trust estate is maintained. The additional values assigned to the preferred stock issue did not come from the corpus of the estate or affect it but were supplied by another class of stockholders for the purpose of paying the arrearages in dividends.</p>

It remains to inquire how it should be made. More than half of the arrearages accumulated prior to Mrs. Fisher’s death and parts during the lives of the first and the present life tenants. However, the distribution of the stock which we have held to be the equivalent of a dividend was authorized and completed within the lifetime of the present life tenant. Under the Pennsylvania rule when an apportionment is made between life tenants and remaindermen in a trust estate consideration is given not only to the primary intent of the donor or testator to provide an income for the life tenants, but also to the preservation of the corpus <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>for the benefit of both life tenants and remaindermen.

We were there considering common stock, but cumulative preferred stock of the kind with which we are here dealing is not entitled to receive any larger dividend than is prescribed by the charter or by-laws and is not entitled to any dividend until there are sufficient earnings to pay the same. Preferred stock in the case of liquidation is also limited as to the amount to be assigned to it.</p>
    <p id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.5",640,[230,1249,1152,967]]]'>In the case of common stock the book value is ordinarily found by adding to par value the “plus value” of surplus, while in the case of cumulative preferred stock a different situation is presented and the answer is not so clear. When preferred dividends are regularly paid it is most evident that they are ordinary dividends and are to be allocated to income except insofar as §22 of the Fiduciaries Act is pertinent, a matter which we will consider later. When dividends have been passed prior to the creation of the trust or during a prior life estate and are then declared during a subsequent life estate a more serious question arises. Since the cumulative preferred stockholder has a right prior to that of the common stockholder to receive dividends when earned, it might be argued that when the dividends are in arrears, such arrearages represent a “plus value” which should be taken into account in determining the intact value of such shares. See 2 Scott on Trusts §236.8.</p>

Under this view the fact that dividends have accumulated prior to the creation of the trust adds nothing to the intact value of the corpus. The intact value is the book value which, in turn, is ordinarily par. It is reasonable to assume that testator or settlor intended that any accumulated dividends when paid during the life tenancy would inure to the life tenant, the primary object of his bounty. Such rule also promotes uniformity, for it has been repeatedly held that ordinary dividends “must go in their entirety to the person entitled to them at the date of their declaration”: <em>Nirdlinger’s Estate (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/327/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="327 Pa. 160" data-case-ids="1176743" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0160-01">327 Pa. 160</a>, 165, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.%2033" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="193 A. 33">193 A. 33</a>.

Neither is it applicable under the circumstances here as between the successive life tenants. “Where dividends are <em>regularly declared at uniform intervals and have been paid for years on that basis, </em>there is more reason <em>to </em>imply in law that the earnings accrue daily as interest on money lent and this furnishes a basis to sustain what might otherwise be considered as a legislative assertion of a fact not in existence.
