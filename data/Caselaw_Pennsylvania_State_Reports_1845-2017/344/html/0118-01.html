It is quite true that upon the death of the life tenant there was a bequest of The said sum of $5,000’. But this language cannot be read alone. It must be considered in connection with all of the trust provisions. Clearly what is meant is a gift of said fund, invested as directed by the will. There is not the slightest indication of testamentary intent that the remainderman was to receive cash and nothing else; or that the trustee was to become an insurer of the fund. The statement that testator promised the beneficiary a legacy in payment of a debt is no indication that a <em>cash </em>bequest was contemplated. The latest case upon this subject, and which appears exactly in point, is <em>Lacy’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/342/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="342 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1206906" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0223-01">342 Pa. 223</a>, filed April 1, 1941. In addition to this, where petitioner lias received written notice of an audit, takes no action with respect thereto for over four years, . . . and there is no allegation of fraud, accident or mistake, or error of law apparent on the face of the adjudication, a review must be denied, whether demanded as of right or of grace. Citation of authorities would seem unnecessary.”</blockquote>
