The accounts were filed in consequence of the death in 1938 of testator’s widow, one of the three trustees. Five appeals are by a guardian and trustee ad litem and two by a beneficiary. Appellants contend that the Girard Trust Company, the corporate co-trustee, was negligent in investing trust funds in participations in a certain mortgage and that there was error in refusing to surcharge. As we all agree that the evidence would not support a surcharge, it is unnecessary to deal with other points.</p>

The property had been appraised by W. A. Brandt, an appraiser employed by the Girard Trust Company for the purpose of the loan at $5,000,000. This was ground value, without placing any material value on the buildings. It was known to the appraiser and the officers at the time the loan was made, that the property did not produce enough to pay mortgage interest after taxes. The net income for 1928, after payment of taxes, was $185,220.25, not quite sufficient to pay $150,000 interest at 5 % on the loan. For 1929 (the year during which the loan was taken) the net income, after payment of taxes, was $121,774.59. In 1930, the net income, after paying taxes, was $76,336.80. This was the last full year before the investment in question was made. In 1931, the net income, after paying taxes, was $31,609.39.</p>

Appellants’ statement continues: “All the investments of October, 1931, were purchased from the agency account of a man named Calkins for whom Girard Trust Company acted as agent in making investments and collection of interest on the same.

The legislature subsequently dealt with a phase of re-appraisement in section 1, subsection (7) of the Act of June 24,1939, P. L. 718, providing that in the case of investment in mortgage-pools maintained by trust depart<a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>ments of banks and. trust companies, “no neiv appraisement of the assets contained in such fund shall be required at the date of such investment, provided such assets are appraised at least once every three years.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Without applying that provision retrospectively, the fact that a three-year interval between appraisements has received legislative approval, is significant in any consideration of the prudence of accountant’s conduct in making the investment without first having the security re-appraised.

The next inquiry is: What change occurred in the security between November, 1929, and October, 1981, or March, 1932, making what would have been a lawful investment for trust funds in 1929 unlawful at the subsequent dates? There is no proof that the fair value of the security was less in 1931 or 1932 than it was in 1929.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The fact that the income was not sufficient to pay interest and carrying charges did not make these investments imprudent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Nor may negligence be inferred from the fact that the Trust Company took into account Mrs. Penfield’s bond accompanying the mortgage; considering the fair value fixed by the appraiser, the bond was an additional security.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> The record shows that this property had and retained peculiar and unusual elements of value. The adjudication contains a long statement of fact on the subject, part of which may be quoted: “This mortgage ivas the largest held by Girard Trust Company. It was familiar to all the officers, and particularly to those charged with mortgage investments. The property was just around the corner from the Girard Trust Company’s offices, and it was the largest piece of real estate under one ownership in the heart of the city of Philadelphia, on the best part of the best shopping street.</p>

It provided: “Within the meaning of this clause, the ‘fair value’ of real estate shall be the value placed thereon, in writing, by a reputable person, who shall be especially familiar with real estate values, shall have actually inspected the real estate before making his valuation, and shall certify that his valuation was made after inspection of the premises.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Both parties and the learned judges who heard the case below agree that the mortgage, made in November, 1929, was within the terms of the Act. It is a fact in the case that the “fair value of the real estate” mortgaged was $5,-000,000; presumably, as there is no evidence to support a contrary finding, the fair value remained the same in 1931 and 1932. It is therefore immaterial, on the negligence issue, that no re-appraisement was made before the investments. At the argument, counsel proposed a comparison of markets for real estate with markets for personal property sold on exchanges, or over the counter. <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>Both the constitution, Article III, section 22, and section 41 of the Fiduciaries’ Act, as amended, 20 PS §801, differentiate, for trust fund investments, between real securities' and personal securities. When the legislature authorized investment in real securities, it was cognizant of the difference between the two classes; we must therefore assume that when it specified a fractional part of the “fair value of real estate” as a test for trust investments, it intended to recognize that conversion of mortgaged real estate into cash differed in many respects from the forced sale of personal property, and that an essential difference between the two lay in the difficulty, during periods of extraordinary depression, of obtaining an immediate buyer for real estate as compared with the sale of freely marketable personal securities. As the record shows the trustees complied with the statute, they cannot be surcharged merely because, in 1931 and 1932, they misjudged, if they did misjudge, what the future effect of the financial depression would be on their ability quickly to sell the mortgaged land for a price which a prudent man in like circumstances should consider reasonable. If, when default occurred, there was in such sense no immediate market for this land, that contingency must be regarded as having been in legislative contemplation as one that might possibly occur; but for that very reason, the fact that it occurred, cannot be considered evidence of negligence in this case. We need not attempt, once for all, to define the phrase “fair value of real estate,” as used in the statute. It would not aid, in the decision of the case, now to consider separately the definitions of the word “value” as affected by different adjectives suggested in the argument; value is a word used in many senses as different contexts<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> show; a discussion of the distinctions may be laid aside because it is sufficient, for present purposes, to say that fair value, as <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>used in the statute, means the price which buyers of the class who would be interested in buying such property would be justified in paying for it; we need not attempt to specify the elements to be considered in arriving at the “fair value” because the parties agree that $5,000,000 was the fair value; presumably it remained so when the investments were made.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>
