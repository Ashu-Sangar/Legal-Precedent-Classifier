        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Mitchell,\nThis case involves the same general view of the constitutionality of those portions of the Act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 254, which relate to school districts, that has been discussed in Com. ex rel. v. Gilligan, ante, p. 504.\nThe city controller is an officer whose office is created and its duties provided by the act in question. Having accepted the office it comes with very bad grace from him to refuse performance of part of the prescribed duties on the ground that they are not constitutionally imposed upon him. But this view of the act has been settled to be erroneous in Com. ex rel. v. Gilligan, supra, and for the reasons there given the judgment must be reversed. It was agreed at the argument that the case should be disposed of without question as to the form of the issue, and as if upon demurrer to the answer to an alternative mandamus. The judgment is therefore reversed with costs, and a peremptory mandamus directed to be awarded.",

The defendant, the city controller, refused to countersign the warrant on the ground that the act of May 23, 1874, was unconstitutional.\nThe 43d section of the act requires the city controller to countersign warrants drawn by the school controllers.\nThe court discharged the rule for mandamus.\nError assigned was the order of the court.\nDavid J.
