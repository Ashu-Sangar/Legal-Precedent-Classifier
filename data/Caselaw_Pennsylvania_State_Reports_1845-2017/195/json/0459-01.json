We have frequently called the attention of counsel to the very loose practice which prevails in the preparation of the paper-books and to the necessity of a more rigid conformity to the rules being observed, but our admonitions have had but little effect. In the hope that a better practice may prevail in the future we now announce that hereafter all paper-books which are not prepared in conformity vyith the rules will be suppressed and the appeals in such cases will be nonsuited.",
