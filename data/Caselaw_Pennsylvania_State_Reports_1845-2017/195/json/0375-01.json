    "head_matter": "Wall v. Lit.\nNegligence\u2014Inevitable accident\u2014Nonsuit.\nIn au action by a customer against the proprietors of a department store, to recover damages for personal injuries, where it appears that the injury was caused by an employee carrying a heavy roll of oilcloth, stumbling over a roll of matting in a passageway in the store and striking the plaintiff, the injury is the result of an inevitable accident against which human foresight cannot provide ; there is no culpable negligence and a nonsuit is properly entered.\nArgued March 19, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 444, Jan. T., 1899, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., March T., 1899, No. 155, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Gbeen, C. J., Dean, Feel, Bbown and Mesteezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before McMichael, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on January 26, 1899, the plaintiff went to a large department store owned by tire defendants to make a purchase. He went into the basement by the direction of a floorwalker, and after he had made his purchase was struck by a roll of oilcloth which one of defendants\u2019 employees had been carrying. Plaintiff described the accident as follows:\n\u201c A. I was standing in the passageway, and the saleslady was in front of me. She made out a check, and while I stood I was knocked down with a terrible blow, and I went down on the floor, and I just raised my head, and I didn\u2019t know what it could be, and I saw a man on me and an oilcloth. I said, \u2018 Don\u2019t kill me.\u2019 \u2018Oh, Lord I? he said. \u2018I nearly got killed myself. And it is not my fault,\u2019 he says. \u2018 You see that roll of matting, it was in my way, and I stumbled over that.\u2019 Q. Where was that roll of matting ? A. It was in the passageway from me, maybe three or four yards. And he went up, and I laid myself across the washtubs to take a little breath. And the man who fell on me\u2014he started to pick up that roll of matting again to put it on his shoulder, and started one or .two steps, and he said, \u2018I can\u2019t work any more to-day. I am hurt awful.\u2019 Q. Did you see the roll of matting over which you say the man tripped that was carrying the oilcloth? A. Yes, sir; the man pointed it out to me. He said, \u2018It ain\u2019t my fault. You see this roll of matting was in my way, and that is the fault I struck you and knocked you down. It ain\u2019t my fault,\u2019 he said.\u201d\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was in refusing to take off nonsuit.\nR. Loper Baird, of Baird HopJcinson, for appellant.\nThe defendants were not bound satisfactorily to explain the cause of the accident but they were bound to rebut the presumption of negligence arising from the attendant circumstances : Huey v. Gahlenbeck, 121 Pa. 238; Ryan v. Ardis, 190 Pa. 66 ; Stewart v. Alcorn, 2 W. N. C. 401; Kaples v. Orth, 61 Wis. 531 ; Lyons v. Rosenthal, 11 Hun, 46; Dixon v. Pluns, 98 Cal. 384; Howser v. Cumberland, etc., R. R. Co., 80 Md. 146.\nThe two causes of the injury, the obstruction in the passageway, and the employee stumbling over it with the roll of oilcloth on his shoulder, were concurrently proximate causes of the accident for both of which the defendants are liable : Burrell Township v. Uncapher, 117 Pa. 353;, Township of Plymouth v. Graver, 125 Pa. 24; Kitchen v. Union Township, 171 Pa. 145.\nMorton Z. Paul and Crawford f Loughlin, for appellees,\nwere not heard, but cited in their printed brief: Mulvana v. Anchoria, 77 Fed. Repr. 994; Saunders v. Coleridge, 72 Fed. Repr. 676; Huey v. Gahlenbeck, 121 Pa. 238; Stearns v. Ontario Spinning Co., 184 Pa. 519; Scott v. Allegheny, etc., Ry. Co., 172 Pa. 646 ; Mars v. Del. & Hudson Canal Co., 61 N. Y. Supreme Ct. 625.\nApril 16, 1900:"
