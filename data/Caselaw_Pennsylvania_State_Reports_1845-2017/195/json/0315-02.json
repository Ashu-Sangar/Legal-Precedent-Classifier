I\nIt is the settled rule that while inadequacy of price is not by itself suifij cient to justify the court in setting aside a sheriff\u2019s sale, yet where there| is great inadequacy the court may seize upon other circumstances in ordei| to give relief. What other circumstances are sufficient for this purposi is largely in the discretion of the court below, and the Supreme Court wilinot review the exercise of this discretion, except in extreme oases.\nThe Supreme Court will not reverse an order of the court below setting aside a sheriff\u2019s sale of a church where it appears that in addition to gross inadequacy of price, the notice of the sale was deficient in omitting to state that there was a well of water on the premises, and that a portion of the building was fitted up as a residence.\nArgued Feb. 14, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 390, Jan. T., 1900, by Nathaniel B. Light, from order of C. P. Lebanon Co., June T., 1897, No. 304, setting aside sheriff\u2019s sale to him in case of Jacob L. Light, Assignee, et al. v. D. W. Zeller et al.\nBefore Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Bbown and Mestbezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nRule to set aside sheriff\u2019s sale.\nThe grounds upon which the sale was set aside were stated by Erhgood, P. J., as follows:\nIt is not denied that the property in question was sold for a grossly inadequate price. Its value is estimated by a number of witnesses to be from $2,500 to $8,000. It was sold by the sheriff for $960. It is only necessary in connection with inadequacy of price to consider the absence of notice in the advertisement of a well of water on the prernises and of a dwelling portion or apartment, in the basement of the church for the janitor and his family, tb come to the conclusion that this sale must be set aside.\nIt is unusual to have a portion of a church building set apart and used as a residence, and as this is the fact in the present case, notice should have been given of the same, as also of the well, the necessity for which is apparent when the janitor has his residence in the church.\nSale set aside.\njError assigned was the order of the court.\nJ. M. Funclc, for appellant.\nA sheriff\u2019s sale will not be set aside for mere inadequacy of price: Hollister v. Vanderlin, 165 Pa. 252; Cake v. Cake, 156 Pa. 47; Young\u2019s App., 2 Penrose & Watts, 382; Ritter v. Getz, 161 Pa. 648.\nThomas H. Qapp with him F. W. Miller, for appellees.\n\u2014There being nothing to show that, in setting aside this sheriff\u2019s sale, there was an abuse of that discretion with which the court below is invested, this court will not interfere: Ritter v. Getz, 161 Pa. 648; Germer v. Ensign, 155 Pa. 466; Stroup v. Raymond, 183 Pa. 279; Media Title & Trust Co. v. Kelly, 185 Pa. 133; McGonigle v. Johnson, 8 Pa. C. C. Repr. 653.\nApril 9, 1900:"
