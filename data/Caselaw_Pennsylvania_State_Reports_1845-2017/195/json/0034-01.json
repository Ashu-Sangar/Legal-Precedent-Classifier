        "text": "Opinion bt\nMb. Justice Mestbezat,\nThe referee in this case filed his report on July 11, 1898. He found that the prayer of the plaintiff\u2019s bill should be granted and recommended a form of a decree. This decree was silent as to costs. On application of the plaintiff, the court, on February 25, 1899, entered the decree recommended by the referee with the addition \u201c that each party to bear its own record cost, and that the defendant should pay the referee\u2019s fee of 11,500.\u201d This is the first and only decree entered by the court upoxi the referee\u2019s x-eport.\nThe appellant assigxxs for error the action of the court in entering this decree, and in not entering the decree recommended by the referee.\nThe appellant contends that the court had no authority to enter axxy other decree than the one recommexxded by the referee. If that be true, the court was without power to dispose of the costs, and they must remaixr unpaid, for the only difference between the decree recommended and the one that was entered is that the latter directs the payment of the costs. But can it be seriously contended that the court had not the power to dispose of the costs and to make such order as it thought equitable and just in the matter ? We think not. \u201c A court of equity has the power, not only to fix the master\u2019s fee, as well as other costs, in an equity case, but to make any necessary and proper order for their payment: \u201d Woodward v. Brace, 139 Pa. 316. There might have been two decrees entered by the court, the one recommended by the referee and the other for costs. But this was wholly unnecessary. Having the power to determine who should pay the costs, and no decree upon the report of the referee having been entered, the court was justified in including the order for their payment in the decree recommended by the referee.\nIn his argument the learned counsel for the appellant says : \u201c The present question is whether, when no exceptions have been filed and a decree has been reported and filed by the referee, and has been fully paid by the defendant, the court can or will, many months thereafter, enter a new decree imposing an additional liability on the defendant.\u201d This language may be misleading. There had been no decree reported and filed by the referee when the appellant paid the appellee the amount found due by the referee\u2019s report. The payment was made July 1, 1898, but the report, with the decree therein recommended, was not filed until July 11,1898. The payment, therefore, could not have been made to satisfy a decree reported by the referee or entered by the court. Nor was the decree of February 25,1899, a new one, as contended by appellant\u2019s counsel. Prior to this decree, the court had taken no action on the report of the referee, and entered no decree. After an argument and a reargument on the referee\u2019s report, the court entered the decree of February 25,1899.\nThe appellant contends that, even if the court had the power to enter a decree for the payment of the costs, it should not have been exercised in this case. An argument to support this contention was, no doubt, addressed to the court below, but it was without effect. As we have frequently said, costs in equity are always within the discretion of the chancellor, and it is only where there is clear abuse of this discretion that we will interfere. We see nothing in this case to take it out of the general rule, and to warrant us in interfering with the disposition of the costs made by the court below.\nThe assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment is affirmed.",

On July 1, 1898, the defendant settled with the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of the decree recommended by the referee. On July 11, 1898, neither party having filed exceptions, the referee filed his report in which he recommended the following decree:\nThis cause came on to be heard at this term, and was argued by counsel, and thereupon, upon a consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that a new certificate for seventy shares of the capital stock of the defendant be issued by the defendant and delivered to the plaintiff, the said certificate to be in the name of the plaintiff as administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of the estate of Charles II. Baker, deceased, or as trustee under the will of the said Charles II. Baker, and to pay the amount of the dividends declared thereon since the last payment of dividends to the last predecessor in title, or in the alternative, that the defendant pay to the plaintiff the value of the said seventy shares of stock at the time of the transfer, namely, $246.00 per share, with interest from January 10, 1891, being the date of the demand upon the said defendant.\nNo action was taken by the court until February 25, 1899, when the decree recommended by the master was entered with these words added: \u201c that each bear its own record costs, and that the defendant pay the referee\u2019s fee of fifteen hundred dollars.\u201d\nError assigned was the decree of February 25, 1899.\nA.
