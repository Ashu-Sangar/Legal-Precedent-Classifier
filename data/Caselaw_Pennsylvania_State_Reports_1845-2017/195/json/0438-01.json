The' very point was ruled by the prerogative court of New Jersey in Rorback v. Van Blarcom, 5 C. E. Green (N. J.), 461, under a provision of the constitution of that state which contains similar language to our own law of 1874. This conclusion is strongly fortified by the consideration- that the proceedings in lunacy are not conclusive upon strangers, and the fact of lunacy is no defense in an action for the recovery of compensatory damages for a tort in which wrongful or malicious intent is not an essential element: Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Showalter, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 452. The exhaustive opinion of Rice, P.

L. 122.\nThe right to traverse an inquisition of lunacy which is confined to \u201c persons aggrieved \u201d by the terms of the Act of May 8, 1874, P. L. 122, Purd. D. 1272, pi. 16, includes only persons related to the lunatic by blood or marriage, and persons having an interest in his estate. A person having a right of action against the lunatic for a tort, has no right to traverse the inquisition.\nProceedings in lunacy are not conclusive upon strangers, and the fact of lunacy is no defense in an action for the recovery of compensatory damages for a tort in which wrongful or malicious intent is not an essential element. .\nArgued April 10, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 423, Jan. T., 1899, by Mary Brink, from order of C. P. Luzerne Co., Oct. T., 1898, No. 1163, striking off traverse to inquisition in the matter of Solomon Wolf, an alleged lunatic.\nBefore Green, C. J., Mc-Collum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTraverse of inquisition in lunacy.\nFrom the record it appeared that on September 21, 1898, a petition in lunacy was filed against Solomon Wolf. On October 10, an inquisition was filed finding that Wolf was then, and had been for twenty years, a lunatic without lucid intervals.\nOn November 21, Mary Brink had brought a civil action against Wolf, per quod servitium amisit, for the seduction of her minor daughter.\nOn January 4, 1899, Mary Brink filed a traverse to the inquisition. Subsequently, the court in an opinion by Woodward, P. J., made absolute a rule to strike off the traverse.\nError assigned was the order of the court.\nEdmund G-. Butler, with him James S. Biery, for appellant.\u2014\nA mere relative or a person with a present or prospective interest in an alleged lunatic\u2019s property is a person aggrieved : In re Heft, 8 Pa. Dist. Repr. 99: Com. v. Schneider, 59 Pa. 328.\nThe sole purpose of the inquisition proceedings is to hinder, delay, obstruct, interfere with and prevent Mrs. Brink in enforcing her rights of action against Solomon Wolf. She is a creditor, has a right of action, has a prospective interest in his property, which arose long preceding the lunacy proceedings. If these proceedings are sustained and are pleadable in Mrs. Brink\u2019s suit, then they are prima facie evidence of lunacy at the time that the cause of her action arose.\nGreorge H. Troutman and John T. Lenahan, for appellee,\nwere not heard, but cited in their printed brief: Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 594; Dickinson\u2019s Case, 1 W. N. C. 96; Jones\u2019s Case, 1 W. N.
