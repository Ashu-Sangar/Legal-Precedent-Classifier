When personal property is in the possession of a person under a contract of bailment, or hiring for use, the sheriff may not seize the thing itself, because under the contract of bailment •different parties are interested, the one party having the right of property and the other the right of possession and use. In such cases the sheriff could only sell the interest of the debtor in the property. If he should seize the property itself he would be a trespasser, and such levy being illegal, it would subject him to an action by the bailee for damages for disturbing his possession and interfering with the performance of his contract of bailment. <em>Answer: </em>Denied.
