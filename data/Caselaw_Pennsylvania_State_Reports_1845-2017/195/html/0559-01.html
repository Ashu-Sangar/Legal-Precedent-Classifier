    <p class="summary" id="b586-7" data-blocks='[["BL_586.5",586,[293,607,1186,1542]]]'>The Court: As to the first objection to the offer of the mortgage in question, it may be sufficient to say that that is a matter within the discretion of the court as to the order in which the proof is offered. And as to the opening up of the defendants’ case, the circumstances under which the defendants’ case was opened up are about as follows: After the defendants had closed their testimony, the plaintiff made an offer of evidence which is on record, and the defendants made an objection to said offer of the plaintiff, wherein it was set out that the second mortgagees of R. A. Hamilton were entitled to the benefit of the recording act as to such second mortgagees. Counsel for the plaintiff, at the time, denied the existence of such a second mortgage ; and I myself suggested that it was not in evidence yet, and it might be erroneous for the court to rule on the effect of the second mortgage, as it was not in evidence <em>; </em>and upon the counsel for the defendant, stating that theré was such a second mortgage, I allowed the defendants to open up their testimony and let it in, so that the court could rule squarely on the legal question presented. And in allowing this second mortgage to be admitted in evidence, I said to the attorneys for the plaintiff that they could amend their offer, if they desired to offer proof that the Teutonia Building and Loan Association, before they took the second mortgage, had notice of the alleged illegal acknowledgment of Mrs. Elder’s deed ; but the counsel for the plaintiff said they had no proof that the Teutonia Building and Loan Association had any notice of the illegal acknowledgment, before giving tins order. So much for my ruling on the admission of this second mortgage of R. A. Hamilton to the Teutonia Building and Loan Association, out of order.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b586-8" data-blocks='[["BL_586.6",586,[290,2157,1181,252]],["BL_587.1",587,[176,352,1194,2064]],["BL_588.1",588,[280,361,1193,458]]]'>Then we come to consider the plaintiff’s offer of proof. Assuming that the plaintiff can prove what the offer contains —and in this ruling we are bound to assume that they can prove it—and the case would stand this way; Mrs. Elder executed a deed to the Presbyterian board which, as to her, was <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>void because of the illegal acknowledgment, and was void as regards all persons who had notice of the defective or illegal acknowledgment. Now we must assume, in accordance with the terms of the offer, that R A. Hamilton, the grantee of the Presbyterian board, had notice. We must likewise assume that H. H. Stone, the first mortgagee, had notice. And as to Hamilton and Stone, Mrs. Elder could object to her own deed, but after Stone had placed his mortgage on record, to wit: after February 2, 1895, the Teutonia Building and Loan Association put the second mortgage on record. If they had no notice of any irregularity or illegality by Mrs. Elder, as to them, her deed to the Presbyterian board is a good deed, because they have put their mortgage on record, and there is a chain of paper title on record on which they have relied. Then an execution is issued on the Stone first mortgage, and the Teutonia Building and Loan Association, the second mortgagee to protect their second mortgage, buy in the property for the sum of $2,600, as shown by the execution No. 65, March term, 1897, offered in evidence. The sheriff appropriates this amount to pay off the Stone mortgage in full and only appropriates the balance of $51.74 to the Teutonia Building and Loan Association. Now if we assume as we must in the ruling that the Teutonia Building and Loan Association had no notice prior to their purchase at the sheriff’s sale, of the illegality or irregularity in the acknowledgment of the deed by Mrs. Elder to the Presbyterian board, it seems to me that being the second mortgagee, they are protected by the recording act. I am inclined to think—although I am by no means positive on that point and subsequent reflection may cause me to change my mind—but I am inclined to think that under such circumstances the Teutonia Building and Loan- Association, having loaned their money on the faith of a recorded paper title without notice when they loaned their money and put their mortgage on record, are protected by the recording act to a certain extent; that the law would not compel them to lose the money which they paid on the Stone mortgage. Even if they had notice prior to such payment that there was some illegality in the Stone mortgage, or even if they had notice that the Stone mortgage was void, I am inclined to think, although I am by no means positive about it and may change my mind on that point, <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>but I am pretty well satisfied that the law would not allow the second mortgagees now in possession to be put out of possession on ejectment by Mrs. Elder, under the circumstances as the offer shows them to exist. The mortgagee has a rig'ht to the possession of the mortgaged premises, and the mortgagee being in the possession of the mortgaged premises was entitled to pos-' session of the same till the mortgagor paid off the debt and then he would have to surrender them, and the same rule would apply to the predecessor in title of the mortgagor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[279,826,1182,612]]]'>Now, assuming everything to be proven that is offered to be proven in the offer of testimony made by the plaintiff’s counsel here, we have the case of a mortgagee, to wit: the Teutonia Building and Loan Association, in possession and the predecessor in title of the mortgagor bringing a suit in ejectment against the Teutonia Building and Loan Association. What would equity dictate under the circumstances ? Would it not dictate that before Mrs. Elder could put the Teutonia Building and Loan Association out of possession, she must tender to the Teutonia Building and Loan Association the amount of money which, in good faith, the defendants, without any notice or any complaint on her part, invested in this mortgage ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b588-6" data-blocks='[["BL_588.5",588,[267,1446,1192,613]]]'>Now, there is no allegation that she has made any such tender, and, until she does make such a tender, I am inclined to think, or to put it stronger, I do think, that the defendants can remain in possession as mortgagees in possession. If we carry out the argument of the plaintiff’s counsel to its legitimate effect, the second mortgage of the Teutonia Building and Loan Association was not divested by that sale, because, to carry out the argument of the plaintiff’s counsel to its logical effect, 'that was a void sale, conveying no title. And if it was a void sale, it could not divest the second mortgage,' and the only effect it would have, if the first mortgage was void, would be to make the second mortgage a first mortgage.</p>
