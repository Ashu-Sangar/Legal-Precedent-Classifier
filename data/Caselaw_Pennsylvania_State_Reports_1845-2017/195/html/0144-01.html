      <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>The son had been manager or foreman of the business for many years before the death of the decedent, receiving a salary of @20.00 per week. He was, of course, familiar with the manner in which it was conducted. Owing, perhaps, to increased competition, it had ceased to be as profitable as it once was, and Mrs. Powell and her husband were apprehensive that its continuance might result in disaster. This was also the opinion of Arthur M. Burton, Esq., acting as their counsel, though in a friendly rather than on a professional basis, and it was suggested that it would be better to create a joint stock company, with an allotment of stock to the parties according to their respective interests. Mrs. Powell’s interest, however, was but two ninths, and the others, viz : her mother, sisters and brother, thought they had no right to disregard the wishes of the testator. It was, therefore, continued without interruption, the son acting as manager, and the mother, from time to time, advancing such moneys as were required to pay debts, replenish stock, etc., and for the year succeeding the death of the testator interest at the rate of six per cent was paid upon the appraised value of the business, in accordance with the direction of the will, and duly distributed, Mrs. Powell asking for and receiving her share. But it became evident as time passed that the business was not earning profits, that it was falling behindhand, but it was hoped that the trouble would be but temporary and that if it could be outlived there might be a return of prosperity. Business creditors, however, were becoming clamorous, and finally, after obtaining extensions from time to time, it became necessary, in order to save from the wreck some of the moneys she had advanced for the purposes of the estate, to issue executions on the judgments held by Mrs. Whitman, and what was left of the stock and fixtures was sold by the sheriff at public sale conducted byM. Thomas &amp; Sons, realizing but a small fraction of the debt, and leaving unpaid altogether debts contracted in the course of carrying on the business after the decedent’s death to the amount of several thousand dollars.</p>

As against them, therefore, his executors would be liable for loss arising from carrying on his business, except for the purpose of winding it up, no matter how explicitly this should be directed by the will. But as against legatees a very different principle applies. They are mere volunteers, having such rights only as the testator chooses to give them. He is dealing with his own and may do with it as he pleases. Those who accept the benefits of his will cannot repudiate any of its provisions. It is true that executors carrying on a business under the directions of a will become personally bound for debts thus incurred, but they have tbe right to resort to the estate for indemnity, and the estate itself may become liable, as a trust fund, to creditors with whom it has dealt in the course of the business. Of course where the executor undertakes to carry on or continue the business of the testator, he must be able to show positive and distinct authority conferred by the will, and creditors with whom he deals have no claim beyond that part of the estate which the will has authorized to be so used (Ex parte Garland, 10 Vesey, 110; Bur-well v. Mandeville, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Howard%20560" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Howard 560">2 Howard, 560</a>; Jones v. Walker, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20U.S.%20444" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="108 U.S. 444">108 U. S. 444</a>) ; but here the direction is most explicit, and the question is not complicated by any question of partnership and separate property. The business was that of the testator individually, and except his liability for the rent ($480 per annum) of the house in which he resided his only debts were those which had arisen in carrying it on. They amounted at the time of his death to about $5,000, and the rent of the building where it was conducted was $6,500 per annum, under a lease not terminating until nearly a year after his death. His residuary estate, <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>which was the only part in which Mrs. Powell had an interest under the will, consisted only of the business and the property employed in it and the vacant lots in West Philadelphia. The direction to sell the lots was no less explicit than the direction to continue the business—the purpose of the sale being “ for the payment of my debts ” (there being practically none but those of the business) “ and the distribution of my estate ”— the proceeds of sale being directed to “ be used and applied according to the uses, ends and purposes set forth and declared in this my will,” one of the purposes set forth in the will being “ that the stock, capital and property of my said business shall be maintained by my executors during the said period of two years in the same relative condition as to value as the same shall be at the time of my decease.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b173-3" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[202,1089,1181,657]]]'>The direction to carry on the business for two years implies the authority to do whatever may be required for that purpose. Quando aliquid mandatur, mandatur et omne per quod ad illud pervenitur. Hence, if the exigencies of the business demanded that money should be borrowed, the executors had the right to borrow and give the requisite security to the lender. The testator himself had been in the habit of borrowing for this purpose, and he knew that the business, in the condition in which it was, could not be carried on without it. In Mathews v. Stephenson, <a href="/pa/6/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="954568" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0496-01">6 Pa. 496</a>, it was said that “a power to contract debts upon the credit of the fund or property .... would seem to be necessarily implied in a general power to carry on a store.”</p>

She had an individual interest in the estate to the extent of one third, and if no security had been given to her she would at least have become entitled to be subrogated to the position of the creditors whose debts were discharged by the use of her money: Williamson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/94/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="94 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="486220" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0231-01">94 Pa. 231</a>; Wilkins’s Estate, <a href="/watts/9/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="9 Watts 132" data-case-ids="1850054" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0132-01">9 Watts, 132</a>&lt;; Kelchnor v.

It is true that Mrs. Powell did not want her mother to lend her money; but this was not because she questioned the right of the executors to borrow, or because she thought the money was not needed, but because of the risk which she feared her mother was running, and when told that “ she would be amply secured and would get every <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>cent back for anything put into the business,” there was no further objection. The method of securing, as will presently be seen, was by giving judgment notes for the amount of the respective loans. Even, therefore, if the will did not give, as it did, ample authority for what was done, Mrs. Powell would have no right to complain. Where an executor deals with the assets in a way not usual or strictly legal, the persons by whose request or assent it was done will not be permitted to charge him with maladministration: Poole v. Munday, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20Mass.%20176" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="103 Mass. 176">103 Mass. 176</a>. And not only did Mrs. Powell make no objection to borrowing for the purposes of the business, but she asked for and received her share of what was distributed of the six per cent bn the valuation of the appraisers in accordance with the provisions of the will.</p>

In ordinary cases executors know that creditors cannot compel payment until the expiration of a year; but if payment had been thus delayed by these executors the debts, as already stated, the debts of the business, credit would have been destroyed, and the carrying out of the provisions of the will made impossible. The debts amounted to about $5,000, and there was, in addition, a monthly rent, accruing under a lease to the testator of $541.67 ($6,500 per annum), which of course had to be met with absolute punctuality; and to meet all this, irrespective of wages of persons employed in the business, expenses of keeping up stock, etc., the cash on hand, January 1, 1893, was but $2,615.21.</p>

This made it necessary that another place should be secured, and a contract was entered into for leasing property on Second street at $100 per month, beginning June 1, 1893. The factory was removed to this place in June, but in July, before the removal of the store, the order widening Chestnut street was postponed or extended for another year, and the lessors of 812 Chestnut street offered to lower the rent to 1483.34 per month if the executors would remain until May, 1894; and as it was believed that a larger and more successful business could be done, in view of the approaching holiday season, there than on Second street, the offer was accepted.

A meeting of creditors was held in May, 1894, at which an exact statement of the condition of affairs was made on behalf of the estate—the fact that Mrs. Whitman held judgment notes for the amount of her loans being, according to the testimony, distinctly mentioned. The extension asked for was agreed to, and in June, 1894, two of the lots in West Philadelphia were sold under the direction contained in the will for $1,500, and the amount used in the effort to keep up the business. The condition of affairs was fully understood by the family. On February 12, 1894, Mrs. Powell wrote to her brother, Edward G. Whitman, Jr.: “ I did not write Saturday evening because I had neither stamp nor postal card on hand. The statement is satisfactory as it is, so send it as soon as you can. Let me know as soon as you know yourself about getting the money, and upon no consideration show any signs of weakening to these people to whom you owe money.

There was another meeting of creditors in the early part of 1895, and it being manifest that there would be no further indulgence, Mrs. Whitman’s judgments were entered up and under executions issued upon them, such property as remained (some having been sold to Ruby &amp; Adamson at private sale) was sold by the sheriff, as already stated, for an amount far less than the debt to her. Most of the property sold was purchased by Mrs. Whitman, by whom an attempt was made to continue the business on her own account; but it did not yield enough to pay rent, and, in the end, which came very soon, everything was swept away by a constable’s sale under a distraint.</p>

He gave his entire time and attention to the management of the business, going to the store early every morning and remaining until the close of the day, often late in the evening, practically without compensation, though while the testator lived he had received a salary of 120.00 per week. Mrs. Whitman, who has lost not only her share (one third) of the. residuaiy estate, but also the greater part of the money advanced in the effort to continue the business, makes no complaint, nor does her daughter, Miss Whitman, whose interest is precisely the same as that of Mrs. Powell. .They both knew that the loss was one which, without disregarding altogether the directions of the testator, could not have been avoided, and that the mistake, as expressed by Mr. Burton in his testimony before the auditing judge, “ was when the testator directed the business to be carried on.”</p>

Weed, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20Pa.%20807" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="154 Pa. 807">154 Pa. 807</a>, and Young v.

In these cases it was held that judgments confessed by atrustee under a trust for carrying on business, after the estate had become insolvent, in favor of a general creditor, was void as against other general creditors, while here the giving of the judgment was part of the contract under which the loans wore made and took place not only before insolvency but before the debt to the claimant was contracted. But the question is not now an open one so far as this claimant is concerned, having been decided adversely by the court of common pleas No. 1, of December term, 1895, No. 1149, under a bill in equity <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>filed by tbe claimant to restrain the sale by the sheriff under the judgment given to Mrs. Whitman. The claim is dismissed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[258,458,1184,661]]]'>It need only be added that the levy under Mrs. Whitman’s execution included the West Philadelphia lot not sold by the executors, which was bought by her for $50.00 and subsequently sold for $800. Her rights as between herself and creditors of the business have, as already stated, been determined by the court of common pleas, while so far as Mrs. Powell is concerned the case is governed by the principle declared in Williamson’s Appeal, supra, and Poole v. Munday, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20Mass.%20176" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="103 Mass. 176">supra.</a> And even if it should be held that she is accountable to the estate for what she received upon her sale of the lot, $800, she would be entitled as creditor to retain it, there being still due her, as shown'by the statement presented by Mr. Lex and hereto annexed, $6,855.50.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b178-5" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[257,1130,1186,666]]]'>Moreover the account contains no credit for commissions to the accountants or for counsel fees, and the only reason for not allowing both is the fact that the balance, even if increased by the amount of gain on resale of the lot, is wholly insufficient for payment, while there is no other fund that can be resorted to. That the estate has been swept away in the effort to carry out the provisions of the will does not affect the question, the executors, in the opinion of the auditing judge, not being responsible for the result. They acted in good faith and incurred great personal responsibility, one of them giving his entire time and services for a period of over two years. An allowance of five per cent on the receipts, with counsel fees to Mr. Wake-ling, $500, would be proper and reasonable.</p>

    <p id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.7",179,[197,619,1178,407]]]'>The assignments of error are to the refusal of the court to surcharge the accountants with the amount of losses incurred in carrying on the business of the testator under the direction of his will. There is no question of partnership and separate property or of the rights of creditors to be considered. The business was the individual business of the testator, and the appellant is a daughter who shares in the residuary estate only.</p>
    <p id="b179-6" data-blocks='[["BL_179.8",179,[198,1032,1181,821]]]'>The business in which the testator was engaged had been conducted by him for about twenty years, and he desired to preserve it for his family. His will contained mandatory directions to his executors to carry on the business for two years and he directed that the stock, capital and property should be maintained in the same condition as to value as that in which it was at the time of his death. His entire estate, except his household furniture and three vacant lots of land, consisted of the stock, machinery, fixtures and book accounts of his business. His debts, excepting that for the rent of the house in which he lived were all debts of his business. He directed that the lots should be sold and the proceeds used for the purposes mentioned in his will. For years he had borrowed money in order to carry on his business, and at his death owed borrowed money, and he must have known that his executors would be obliged to borrow in order to carry out his directions.</p>

The business was not prosperous when it came into their hands. They were at the beginning of a period of great business depression and distrust. They encountered unexpected difficulties because of the necessity of removing the factory, a matter over which they had no control and which could not have been foreseen by them. All that they did in the conduct of the business was fully known to all the parties in interest, and 'it’was done without objection from any of them. Much of which’ complaint is now made by the appellant, she at the time insisted should be done. She had drawn <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>her share of the profits as long as profits were made, and in the early part of 1894, knowing the danger which threatened the business, she wrote to one of the accountants urging him to raise money in order to save it. Under these circumstances, if her rights were as high as those of a creditor of the estate, she would have little room for complaint; as it is she has none whatever.</p>
