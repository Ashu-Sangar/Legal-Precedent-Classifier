I was standing in the passageway, and the saleslady was in front of me. She made out a check, and while I stood I was knocked down with a terrible blow, and I went down on the floor, and I just raised my head, and I didn’t know what it could be, and I saw a man on me and an oilcloth. I said, ‘ Don’t kill me.’ ‘Oh, Lord I? he said. ‘I nearly got killed myself. <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>And it is not my fault,’ he says. ‘ You see that roll of matting, it was in my way, and I stumbled over that.’ Q. Where was that roll of matting ? A. It was in the passageway from me, maybe three or four yards. And he went up, and I laid myself across the washtubs to take a little breath. And the man who fell on me—he started to pick up that roll of matting again to put it on his shoulder, and started one or .two steps, and he said, ‘I can’t work any more to-day. I am hurt awful.’ Q. Did you see the roll of matting over which you say the man tripped that was carrying the oilcloth? A. Yes, sir; the man pointed it out to me. He said, ‘It ain’t my fault. You see this roll of matting was in my way, and that is the fault I struck you and knocked you down. It ain’t my fault,’ he said.”</p>
