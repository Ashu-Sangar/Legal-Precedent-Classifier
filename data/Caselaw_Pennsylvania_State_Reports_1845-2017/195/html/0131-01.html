    <p class="summary" id="b155-9" data-blocks='[["BL_155.14",155,[176,1369,1183,558]]]'>From the record it appeared that on August 14, 1900, the court continued a preliminary injunction against the construction of a street railway by the defendant in the borough of Old Forge, on the ground that at the time the ordinance of the borough was passed consenting to the use of the streets by the street railway company, the couucilmen who had voted in favor of the'ordinance had been given free passes, and had been paid certain expenses by the street railway company. Subsequently another ordinance was passed granting to the defendant the right to lay tracks on the streets, and a motion was made to vacate the previous order of tlio court.</p>

The defendants now allege that since that time another ordinance has been passed by the borough authorities which is not open to such a charge, and they ask that the injunction he modified so as to enable them to construct their road in accordance with this last ordinance. <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>It appears that at a regular meeting of the borough council of the borough of Old Forge, held on August 14, 1899, an ordinance entitled “An ordinance authorizing the construction and operation of a street railway in the borough of Old Forge by the Pittston and Scranton Street Railway Company,” was introduced and passed first and second reading, and at the regular meeting of the council held on August 21, 1899, the ordinance was passed on third reading, four of the five members present voting “ yea ” and one voting “ nay ” thereon. The ordinance was then presented to the burgess, who returned the same without his approval to the council at its next regular meeting, which was held on August 28, 1899, all the members being present. The message of the burgess was read. After various preliminary motions it was regularly moved and seconded that the ordinance be enacted into a law and passed, notwithstanding the veto of the burgess ; and on this question, the roll being called, five members voted “ yea ” and two members voted “ nay,” and the names of the members voting' having been duly recorded, the president of the council declared the ordinance to have been properly and legally passed, and the same to be advertised and published according to law, which was done. In accordance with the terms of the ordinance, the defendant company filed with the borough clerk a written acceptance of the pro: visions of the ordinance, and gave to the borough an indemnifying bond in the sum of $10,000, approved by the borough solicitor, to secure the borough against any claims of property owners by reason of change of grade in front of their property, and to secure the borough for any expense for litigation arising from the construction of the road.</p>

Aside from the evidence which was adduced at the hearing of the rule to continue the preliminary injunction, there is no evidence of any improper influence being brought to bear in favor of any ordinance authorizing the company to construct and operate the road.</p>
