These cars were pushed against two other empty cars standing on the track and the train continued on toward the place where the defendant was at work. The train was stopped at a safe distance from plaintiff, but the two detached cars continued along the tracks, struck the ear on which plaintiff was working and injured him. <em>Held, </em>that a nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

It appeared that Couvert was a locomotive engineer, and Bauer was one of a crew engaged in shifting cars in a yard where plaintiff was engaged as a carpenter in repairing a car. The averments of the statement were in effect that the accident was caused by the negligence of Couvert and Bauer and other employees of the railroad company.</p>

The issue, after this dismissal, was between Peterson and the Railroad Company. On the trial of the case and at the close of the plaintiff’s testimony the defendant’s counsel moved for a compulsory nonsuit which after argument was awarded. Before the nonsuit was entered the plaintiff moved the court to amend his statement, which motion was denied, on the ground that the proposed amendment would introduce a new cause of action. While we are all of the opinion that the refusal of the amendment was proper, we may add that an allowance of it could have been unavailing because the testimony on the part of the plaintiff was not sufficient to establish a case against the defendant. The refusal to take off the nonsuit is therefore sustained and all the specifications are dismissed.</p>
