Within these limits she could, if of sound and disposing mind and understanding, make any disposition of her property she saw fit: Bainbridge’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/97/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="97 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="444775" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0482-01">97 Pa. 482</a>.

This much having been done, the burden was shifted upon the contestant, and the measure of the burden she was bound to assume was, to show by evidence which, in probative force, would warrant a jury in rendering a verdict against the will, either (1) because testatrix when she executed the will was, 'in consequence of mental weakness, incapable of full and intelligent knowledge of the act she was engaged in, and an intelligent understanding of the disposition she desired to make of her property; or, (2) that influence had been exerted by another which destroyed the free agency of testatrix, and substituted another’s will for hers. The fact that John Logan, the preferred legatee and proponent, had at one time assisted testatrix in making sale of her house, and at this very time was <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>her attorney in fact to collect for her a large inheritance in Missouri, in no wise changed or shifted the burden of proof. Nor did the further fact that he procured the scrivener who wrote the will, and gave him the data from which it was prepared have any such effect. None of these things bore in any way on the question of mental soundness, and from neither nor all combined could arise any presumption of unfairness. Such business relations as he is shown to have had with testatrix gave him no superior knowledge with respect to the matters that entered into the will as placed them upon unequal terms, nor do they show such dependence and trust as to render an overmastering influence or unfair advantage probable, in this particular business. Were John Logan, the proponent, a stranger to the blood of testatrix, his burthen would not only have been greater in the first instance, since then he would have been compelled to show not only the execution of the will, but that testatrix was acquainted with its contents, and had an intelligent consciousness of the proportion of the estate to be taken by him, (Blume v. Hartman,-<a href="/citations/?q=115%20Pa.%2037" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="115 Pa. 37">115 Pa. 37</a>,) but with evidence on the part of contestant of some degree of mental weakness, showing that testatrix was in a condition to be imposed upon, yet short of testamentary incapacity if left uninfluenced, the whole burden would have shifted back upon proponent, and it would have rested with him to show affirmatively the essential requirements of a valid will: Caldwell v. Anderson, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20Pa.%20204" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="104 Pa. 204">104 Pa. 204</a>. But instead of being a stranger to the blood he was a son of testatrix, and his participation in the making of the will, to the extent heretofore indicated, gives rise to no unfavorable presumption against him, it appearing that the will, after having been prepared by the scrivener and before its execution, was read over to testatrix.</p>

Nor does this evidence show any such mental change or decline as would make the subject abnormally impressionable, whether through fear, affection or <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>otherwise. It fails to show anything in her condition that would any the more readily expose her to the artifice of designing persons, beyond the decline in her physical strength; and. there is not a single fact or circumstance adduced to indicate that she had yielded anything of her natural and accustomed strength of will. That her mental vigor had abated somewhat through age and disease may be conceded, while there is but little in the evidence to show it. She was eighty-five years old, and had already been ill some two weeks when the will was written, and just at that point of time, enfeebled by her previous disorder, was falling victim to the pneumonia that ended her life. The evidence relates chiefly, almost exclusively, to this period of illness, and to conversations with visitors and members of the family. The person who had the largest opportunity of observing the testatrix, is the person who has the largest stake to this controversy, the contestant, and it is in her testimony we may naturally expect to find the facts of largest significance. By far the greatest part of her testimony relates to the altercation between John and herself after the execution of the will, and her own and John’s conduct towards their mother and each other, both before and after the date of the will; but we are concerned now with only so much of it as tends to show a condition of mind in the testatrix that made it presumable or probable that John, taking advantage of the situation, dominated her will, and in the testamentary act se scripsit heredem. For in the absence of all evidence of physical constraint, fraud, imposition, circumvention, falsehood, nothing short of a mental weakness that left her will subject to John’s, and made her willing to adopt his for her own, can avail the contestant. And this would be but a first step, for, granting an enfeebled condition of mind, but short of testamentary incapacity, since no adverse presumption arises in the case of a son from such circumstances as we have here, as we have already seen, the contestant would be obliged to go further, and offer evidence warranting a finding that testatrix’s mind had been in point of fact dominated and imprisoned by John. Now for the evidence. Mrs. Crawford, the contestant, on the stand:</p>

In her cross-examination no new facts or incidents were developed. Mrs. Hovis was called to testify to the conversations referred to by Mrs. Crawford, and it is unnecessary to say more with respect to her testimony than that while it agrees in the main with Mrs. Crawford’s, the details she gives takes away from the testatrix’s conduct every appearance of irrationality or weakness, unless in the sense of hearing. The other witnesses who speak to this point are the two sons of contestant, and they refer to the same matters that their mother testified to, introducing nothing additional except the incident in connection with the rabbits.</p>

We confess an utter inability to see in this evidence anything that indicates a decline in Mrs. Logan’s mental faculties beyond what is always incident to old age, and least of all that particular faculty which has to do with the will. Indeed, we think it rarely happens that a charge of mental weakness, earnestly pressed, is so feebly supported by facts. The old lady would forget that she had repeated her dose of medicine at the last stated interval; she made a mistake in the Christian name of Mrs. Hovis’s father whom she had once known when a little girl, and .repeated it several times after she had been corrected. She asked her visitor a half dozen times during a visit of three quarters of an hour in length, if she was well and her health continued good. She told her daughter that she would give her a certain vegetable seed, and some days after when asked for the seed expressed surprise and said, she had never raised such vegetable. She asked the little boy several times in the same conversation whether his rabbit ate apples. If any of these things shows more than slight mistakes that could easily result from a misunderstanding, or momentary forgetfulness as likely to result from inattention or indifference to the matter spoken about, we fail to see it. Certainly, they would not warrant, in the absence of all support, an inference that one committing such lapses, and who, all her life had been mentally vigorous and self-assertive, had fallen into a state of mental feebleness or dependence. It is not too much to say that in this particular effort, the contestant has failed utterly to show want of testamentary capacity, and has failed equally to show any mental impairment as would make Mrs. Logan a weak and easy subject in the hands of a designing person. This failure is emphasized when we contrast the evidence with that adduced in support of the will. Either the witnesses present at the execution of the will, the three physicians who attended during the last illness, those of her kindred and neighbors who testified on the side of proponent, and who had equal opportunities of observing failed to observe the indications upon which the opposing witnesses based their opinions, or were not at all impressed by them, for they all agree that testatrix was men<a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>tally sound, and betrayed no sign of weakness.

On this branch of the case contestant derives no aid from the effort made to show incapacity or mental weakness. Had such weakness been shown, the fact could properly be considered in connection with the present inquiry, and it would have materially lessened the burden on the contestant, by opening a wider door for the admission of evidence. In such case the rule that requires direct evidence would not apply. Where, however, the charge is that undue influence was exerted upon a mind healthy, strong and free, nothing short of direct proof will avail, and it must be clear and convincing: Cuthbertson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/97/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="97 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="444781" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0163-01">97 Pa. 163</a>; Tawney v.

It certainly was not fraud in John Logan to arrange for the execution of the will without the knowledge of his sister, conceding that he attempted so to do, and apart from this one circumstance it does not appear that he attempted concealment of anything. There is not a suggestion of misrepresentation or threat from him, unless we are to derive it from the feeble and insignificant circumstance that he was seen conversing with his invalid mother in whispers the day on which the will was executed. We find an insinuation of physical coercion in the testimony of the daughter and her son, when they both speak of an unusual and unaccounted for drowsiness of the testatrix, about the time of the signing of the will, and which continued until the next morning, but which was observed only by themselves. So slight a basis does it afford for the serious charge that it insinuates, that it does not deserve consideration, but allowing <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>it to be as stated the fact remains, that with entire freedom to act for herself during, the succeeding three weeks of her life, and conscious of the fact that she at least had executed a <em>will—for </em>it is not pretended that her drowsiness overcame her consciousness—and with abundant opportunity to express her dissatisfaction, if she had any, with what had been done, she allowed things to remain as they were, and there is absolutely nothing from which any discontent can be inferred. Certainly so far as this evidence discloses the situation, John-Logan stands clear of any attempted fraud or circumvention in the making of this will, and no verdict finding to the contrary could be sustained. His conduct subsequent to the making of the will—and much of the testimony relates to that—-would be an important consideration had any fraudulent attempt on his part been shown, but in the absence of such proof it is irrelevant. In what occurred afterwards his conduct towards his sister exposes him to just and severe censure, and while hers is somewhat short of being commendable, that fact in no way excuses him. But all this is aside from the legitimate inquiry.</p>
