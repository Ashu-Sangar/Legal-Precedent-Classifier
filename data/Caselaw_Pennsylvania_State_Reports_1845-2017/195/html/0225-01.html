We find in the appraisement of the goods taken by the widow, as we said before, the item of “ 082.50 cash.” And it is no doubt the law that the widow has no right to elect to take money or cash unless there is money actually to be taken. Or in other words she cannot elect to take some of the proceeds of the sale of property. And the presumption would be that when this item of 082.50 was put in as cash that there was that much cash on hand. And -were this all there was of the case we should hold that there must have been that amount of money on hand to be set apart to the widow. But the items placed upon the inventory of goods set apart to the widow were not placed upon the general inventory, as required to be, showing that the parties who attended to this business did not understand their duties. And there is no cash item upon the general inventory. It would certainly be quite remarkable that the money left by the decedent was just of the exact amount necessary to make exactly 0300 with the other three articles taken by her.</p>

This account has been confirmed now for over three years, and no person interested in the estate has questioned that charge. Then, to, our acquaintance with the executor, with his character and reputation, convinces us beyond question that he would never have charged the estate with any such item had he not paid out the same as claimed.</p>

Such expenses are not debts of the decedent, and the law limiting the lien of his debts does not apply to them, and a sale for their payment may be decreed after the expiration of the lien of the debts of a decedent: Cobaugh’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/24/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="24 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="9503555" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0143-01">24 Pa. 143</a>; Dommy’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/43/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="43 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="483150" data-case-paths="/pa/43/0155-01">43 Pa. 155</a>. The decree of the court was conclusive of the fact that there was a balance due the executor. Indeed, this is not controverted, but it is claimed that among the items of credit in the final account of the executor was one that should have been disallowed, and the disallowance of which would have left a balance in his hands after deducting his expenses and commissions. The account was confirmed nisi before the order of sale was made, and absolutely seven days after the date of the order.

It was for the payment to the widow of a part of her exempttion in money, when it does not appear from the inventory that any money came into the executor’s hands. Whether under the notice of claim given by the widow she was strictly entitled to receive this payment depends upon facts which are not disclosed by the record and which cannot be ascertained from it. If her claim was made after the personal property had been converted into money, she was entitled to the amount paid to her: Finney’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/113/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="113 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="457641" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0011-01">113 Pa. 11</a>.
