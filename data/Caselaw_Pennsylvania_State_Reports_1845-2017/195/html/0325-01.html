In January, 1894, the plaintiff was indebtecL-to the People’s National Bank of Lebanon upon two notes, one of $800 and the other of $7,800, upon which the defendant and her aunt, Pauline Grove, were sureties. On October 7, 1895, the notes had been reduced to $450 and $6,500, respectively, and upon this date the plaintiff also owed his sister about $8,500, growing out of the partition of their father’s estate. He further owed her about $5,600 on account of the settlement of their uncle Jacob’s estate ; and for these two last méntioned sums he had confessed judgments. At this time he was financially embarrassed, and probably insolvent.</p>

In the year 1898, after the paymeqt of the notes and the satisfaction of the judgment, the plaintiff demanded a reconveyance, alleging that the only purpose of the deed was, that his sister might be enabled to receive and apply the royalties to the payment of the notes in the Peoples’ Bank, and of the balance <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>due her in the settlement of her father’s estate; and averring that she had made an express parol agreement before the deed was signed, that she would reconvey as soon as the notes and the sum due her out of her father’s estate were paid from the royalties. The defendant refused the demand, and shortly afterward the present proceeding was begun, asking for an account and for a decree compelling a reconveyance.</p>

The legal question, therefore, is, whether upon such an agreement the plaintiff can successfully rest his prayer for a decree. There are two aspects in which the transaction may be regarded. First, the deed may be really a mortgage, the defeasance being in parol. This is the natural conclusion ; indeed, it is difficult to avoid the decision that the transaction could be of no other character. The plaintiff owed the defendant $3,500, and was bound as principal for $7,000 more, for which she had assumed the obligation of a surety. In order to pay her the sum he already owed, and to protect her against being obliged to pay out of her own funds the sum for which she was contingently bound, he made a conveyance of real estate, absolute upon its face, but qualified by a parol agreement that after the profits of the land had repaid her the sum he owed, and had paid the debt upon which she was a surety, so as to relieve her from further liability, the land should be reconveyed. In our opinion this was a pledge of real estate to secure the payment of money and the discharge of a pecuniary obligation, and was so clearly a mortgage that discussion is likely to obscure the conclusion. If it was a mortgage, the Act of 1881, P. L. 84, lies squarely in the plaintiff’s road to relief. It is unnecessary to dwell upon that statute. It provides expressly “ that no defeasance to any deed for real estate regular and absolute upon its face, made after the passage of this act, shall have the effect of reducing it to a mortgage, unless the said defeasance is made at the time the deed is made, and is in writing, signed, sealed, acknowledged and delivered by the grantoe in <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>the deed to the grantor, and is recorded .... within sixty-days from the execution thereof ....:” Sankey v.

    <p class="summary" id="b352-5" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[270,486,1186,964]]]'>The other aspect in which the agreement may be regarded is urged by the plaintiff as the true aspect. He insists that the parol contract to reconvey imposed a trust ex maleficio upon the transaction, which should now be enforced by a decree of account and reconveyance. Unfortunately for this position, it has been expressly decided hr numerous cases that the breach of a parol"contract to reconvey is not of itself sufficient to warrant a court in fastening a trust ex maleficio upon the original conveyance. There must be proof of fraud at the time the deed was executed—of fraud inducing or influencing the grantor to part with his title — otherwise such a trust cannot arise: Salterv . Bird, <a href="/pa/103/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="103 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="449141" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0436-01">103 Pa. 436</a> ; Barry v.

In the present controversy no such proof was made, and accordingly we find as an additional fact :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[270,1468,1182,302]]]'>6. That the defendant was not guilty of fraud in obtaining the deed; that she made no false representation, concealed no important fact, and made no promise or agreement (other than the agreement to reconvey, which we are still assuming to have been-made), in order to induce the plaintiff to execute the deed in question.</p>

The discussion might end, therefore, at this point; but it is only just to the defendant to add, that the alleged parol agreement was not proved by evidence of the necessary quality. The rule upon this subject is well settled. Before a deed absolute upon its face can be impressed with a parol trust ex maleficio, the evidence must be clear, precise and indubitable, and must proceed from at least two witnesses or from one witness corroborated by circumstances: Wallace v Smith, <a href="/pa/155/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="155 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="983264" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0078-01">155 Pa. 78</a>; Burr <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>v.

In our opinion the evidence laid before us does not come up to this standard. The plaintiff’s testimony is precise and positive; but it is met by the equally positive and precise denial of the defendant, and the corroborating circumstances relied upon by the plaintiff are so ambiguous that they may support either side with nearly equal strength. It is unnecessary to consider them save in the briefest way. The judgment confessed by Mrs. Pauline Grove to Mr. Ease is consistent with the plaintiff’s theory, that the deed was not an absolute sale in consideration of the defendant’s agreement to pay the notes in bank and to satisfy the debt of &lt;13,500; for the fact that the judgment was sought by the defendant may show an intention to insist on Mrs. Grove’s joint liability as Jacob’s surety. But the judgment is also consistent with the defendant’s theory, that the sale was absolute : for it may be, that the judgment was given to protect Mrs. Ease’s husband, who had assumed an individual liability for the notes in question after the deed was made to his wife. The alleged declarations of the defendant, to which Mrs. Pauline Grove testifies, are plainly ambiguous and express little more than a willingness, or perhaps an intention, of the defendant to reconvey after her debt was paid. Even less weight can be put upon the declarations to which Eate Miller testifies. These do not even express a present intention to reconvey, and are altogether silent about a contract of reconveyance preceding the deed. Having regard, therefore, to the rule concerning the quality of evidence required to establish such a parol agreement as is alleged in the plaintiff’s bill, it is impossible to hold that the plaintiff has successfully met the requirement of the law. We therefore find as a further fact in the case :</p>

Trusts of this kind were discussed in our late case of Barry v. Hill, <a href="/pa/166/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="166 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="864168" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0344-01">166 Pa. 344</a>, and the general rule is that the fraud necessary to establish them must be in the transaction from the beginning, though it may be shown by such subsequent conduct as will sustain an inference of fraudulent intent running back to the inception, but not developed until later occasion or opportunity is presented for accomplishment. But the learned judge below found that there was no fraud at all on the part of the defendant, and that the alleged parol agreement to treat the conveyance as security only, was not proved. It was explicitly denied by the defendant in the answer and the force of this denial was not overcome by the requisite, clear, precise and indubitable evidence.</p>
