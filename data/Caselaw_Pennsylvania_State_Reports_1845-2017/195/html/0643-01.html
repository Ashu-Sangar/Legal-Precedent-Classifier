    <p class="summary" id="b667-11" data-blocks='[["BL_667.16",667,[159,1963,1180,146]]]'>1. That plaintiff is a telegraph and telephone company duly incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania, and lawfully doing business therein.</p>

That the road commissioners of said township have charge and control of said highway, and that on August 1, 1890, the plaintiff asked and obtained from said road commissioners a <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>permit to erect a line of poles in said highway known as the Buffalo road, and that plaintiff during the same month erected said line of poles in said highway from the city of Erie to the said Fagan road. That the permit does not state the place in said highway where said poles were to be constructed, but they were, in fact, erected along the south side of said highway at a distance of about five feet from the property line where they have since remained, which location appears to have been given by one of the then road commissioners, and it was at that time satisfactory to the road commissioners of said township.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b668-5" data-blocks='[["BL_668.4",668,[285,872,1184,408]]]'>4. That by act of assembly approved Aprill4,1863, P. L. 405, the road commissioners of Millcréek township are authorized to lay out sidewalks along the public roads in said township. Pursuant to which said road commissioners appear to have laid out a sidewalk along the south side of said Buffalo road, from Erie city easterly to and beyond said Fagan road, of the width of five feet, which said space so allotted as a sidewalk is now used by pedestrians passing along said road.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b668-6" data-blocks='[["BL_668.5",668,[286,1286,1183,301]]]'>5. That said Buffalo road is of the width of fifty feet, and is the main thoroughfare leading eastwardly from Erie city, and is largely used by the public in all the ordinary ways of a modern suburban highway. The travel thereon has been greatly increased since 1890, and since said date many residences have been built on both sides of said highway.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b668-7" data-blocks='[["BL_668.6",668,[287,1596,1184,563]]]'>6. That the mode of working upon and improving public highways has greatly changed since 1890, and at present such work is done largely by road machines. And a majority of plaintiff’s said poles now stand as originally intended, about five feet from the property line, but some of said poles stand distances from the property line varying from three and one half feet to six and one half feet. And all of said poles interfere more or less with the present method of working said highway, and also are an injury to said highway in some places by standing in and obstructing the free flow of water in the gutter.</p>

That said poles as so located are a serious inconvenience and damage to said township in working said road, and a slight inconvenience to the public traveling thereon; and that if set along the property line on the south side of said highway they would not interfere at all with the working of said road, ana. <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>would be away from the gutter and would not interfere with public travel.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b669-5" data-blocks='[["BL_669.4",669,[170,457,1177,249]]]'>8. That said road commissioners have recently granted a street railway company the right to build and operate a line of electric railway in said highway, which, if built, would greatly facilitate public travel on said highway, and which would be obstructed by said poles as now located.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b669-6" data-blocks='[["BL_669.5",669,[170,716,1178,248]]]'>9. That the road commissioners of said township, as they believe, for the best interests of the public have ordered above plaintiff to move its poles from the present location to the property line on the south side of said highway. And plaintiff has been duly notified to that effect.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b669-7" data-blocks='[["BL_669.6",669,[170,973,1178,302]]]'>10. That plaintiff has some fifty-five poles affected by said order and it will probably cost several hundred dollars to make the change, especially as some longer poles will be needed to carry the wires over shade trees along the line. Yet plaintiff paid nothing for its present location in the street, and the place offered is a reasonable substitute thereof.</p>
