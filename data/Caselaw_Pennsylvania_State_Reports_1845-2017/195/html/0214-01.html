He upon the witness stand, as I recall the testimony, said that he had no knowledge of the statute being a bar, or of there being such a statute;] [2] and when be called upon tbe district attorney, which it was right and proper for him to do, because evidence of that character tends to satisfy the jury that a man is not acting from malicious motive when he goes to the proper authority and asks for advice, it shows that he is cautious and prudent, if it be believed and if that advice be followed after a full and truthful statement of all the facts if laid before the advising party; lie says that he went before the district attorney and laid all these facts before him; that tbe district attorney did ask him something about tbe time when the offense was committed but not in such a way as to give bim to <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>understand, or to cause him to be informed that it was with a view of ascertaining whether the statute of limitations had acted as a bar; and that after being advised by the district attorney that he had a good cause of action and that it was one in his judgment that should be prosecuted, that, acting on that advice, he went and made the complaint before the squire, had the warrant issued and instituted these proceedings. If he had probable cause,—if you believe the statement that these misrepresentations were made, this was clearly within the statute •—two years had not elapsed, because this affidavit, this warrant, was sworn out some time -in May, 1897,1 think, and the statute of limitations would not be a bar until some time in January, 1898—early part of January, 1897; so that there was no improper or illegal action on the part of Mr. Phillips in this transaction, unless you find that his story was not a truthful one— unless you find that he had not probable cause—that these false representations were not made; or, on the other hand, you credit the statements made by Mr. Wenger that this was a trade of cigars for flour. Now, I say, so far there was nothing illegal or improper, unless there was that want of probable cause to which I have called your attention before. After the arrest- and the hearing, and at the hearing, Mr. Phillips’s statement is that Wenger said he did not want to go to jail and asked him whether something could not be done—whether it could not be fixed up—that not being conversant Avith the law Mr. Phillips gave the matter to the squire and he told him that it came in the category of those cases which parties were permitted to settle, and if they could make any settlement or agreement between themselves, they had the power to do so.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[279,1822,1185,507]]]'>After a conference between the two—I think Squire Mc-Clintock says that they retired outside of his office, or into another room—after a conference, between the two Mr. Phillips returned and said that he had agreed to allow Wenger to go without sending him to jail provided he would give him a note which he would sign himself and get good security upon for the payment of 150.00—not the whole amount but a compromise amount—-within two years. Mr. Phillips does not, as I recall it, add interest, but the note as produced here shows that it was to bear interest and that Wenger was to pay the costs.</p>

You will say which is the more probable to be true, that which is testified to you here as being a fact by Mr. Phillips and by the squire, or Mr. Wenger; and you will bear iu mind that Mr. Wenger was the party that was to go to jail; and say whether it was more likely that ho would be anxious to effect a settlement of this matter to gain his freedom, or whether it was more likely to come from Mr. Phillips for the purpose of securing his money. This is the argument presented here on the plaintiff’s side as being the motive, the inducement, for the proposition coming from Mr. Phillips. After he was released at that time, as I have already said, nothing was done until Mr. Phillips learned of his being cleaned out by the sheriff; and after his conference with the district attorney he then told the justice, as I recall the testimony, Mr. Phillips said he did not recollect making any request of the justice to reissue this warrant; but in that respect the justice disagrees with him, because, as I recall the justice’s testimony, it was that Mr. Phillips said to him he wanted him to get that man or bring that man; and I think, perhaps, on more than one occasion; and Mr. Phillips’s recollection was that the Justice had done it of his own volition, or at least he had no recollection of requesting it. What reason the justice could have for issuing the process a second time unless requested by the prosecutor, it is somewhat difficult to see, unless it might have been to recover his costs, because Mr. Wenger, it was that agreed, according to the statement of the arrangement made there, to pay the costs.</p>

The district attorney told him yes, that it was the same offense and that another complaint <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>was not necessary; that he could place the warrant in the hands of the constable again and have him arrested.
