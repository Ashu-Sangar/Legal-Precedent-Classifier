L. 1851, page 320, entitled “ An act regulating boroughs,” and generally known as the general borough act. Up to, and prior to 1869, or 1870, said borough had taken no steps to supply itself and its citizens with water. About January 1, 1870, the plaintiff water company did introduce water into said borough by laying pipes through the street. Formal consent so to do was not asked from, or given by, said borough, but said borough proceeded to avail itself of the water so introduced for fire protection, and caused fire plugs to be attached to said water pipes, the said water company providing “ tees ” for same at such points as the borough authorities indicated. The borough seems to have paid the water company the yearly rate of $2.00 •for each of said plugs from the start. Just how such rate was fixed at the outset, does not appear, but the minutes of a meeting of the borough councils, held July 25, 1875, show the following : Motion of Mr. Conrad that $2.00 per annum for each fire plug to be paid the gas and water company for use of water was agreed to.</p>

The minutes of the borough council show that such extensions were requested in several instances, and on one occasion (May 6, 1889), when the water company had refused to extend after “repeated efforts,” the light and water committee was instructed to confer with the solicitor to learn what could be done in the matter. Councils seemed to have been moved to so act because “ the people in that section of the town ” claimed that they did “ not have proper fire protection,” and threatened to “ refuse to pay light and water tax if this protection is not given.” As said borough increased in population and territory, said water company likewise placed additional “ tees ” in their water pipes, for additional fire plugs, at points indicated by the borough authorities.</p>

Iú 1896 the capital -stock of the water company was increased from $20,000 to $100,000, and the indebtedness was increased from $25,000 to $60,000. It is probable, although there is no-affirmative evidence, that a part of such increase was necessitated by the expensive improvements mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</p>

The borough councils deemed the advanced rate to be exorbitant. <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>This controversy about such rate resulted in the water company turning the water off of some six fire plugs in the business portion of Tyrone.' The borough councils turned on the water in said plugs and placed a policeman over them to prevent the water company from interfering with them. I attach but little importance to this controversy as affecting the legal question now for decision. If it be urged on the part of defendants that such action indicated a purpose on the part of the water company to sever any contract relation which existed with the borough, it can be likewise urged, with equal force, on behalf of plaintiffs, that the occurrence demonstrated the fact that the water company had been giving the borough fire protection, and that the borough was dependent on the water company for such fire protection. If the rate, proposed to be charged, was exorbitant, the borough could have invoked the aid of this court to determine what was a reasonable rate, under the provisions of clause 7, section 34 of the Act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 1874, page 93, which provides “ that the charges shall be decreased as to the court may seem just and equitable,” in cases of disputes as to “ charges ” by water companies for “ water so furnished.” Shortly after said dispute had thus culminated in the water company attempting to turn off water from fire plugs, and the borough keeping it on by the display of force, the borough councils, by the passage of the ordinances referred to in plaintiffs’ bill, undertook to supply itself and its citizens with water from a new plant to be erected and owned by the municipality. Plaintiffs then brought this action to restrain the municipality from so doing. These are all the facts deemed necessary to be found in order to arrive at a just decision of the legal questions involved. Some of these facts are likewise found, perhaps in some instances more specfically and in detail, in the answers to plaintiffs’ and defendants’ requests for findings of facts, which said requests and our findings, are herewith filed and made a part of this opinion.</p>

That fact suggested clause 7 of the corporation act; the municipality will not be forever poor; the time will come when it will be of financial ability to own and operate its own works; the very fact of having a supply of water on an investment of private capital has tended to stimulate its growth, and to largely appreciate the value of taxable property.”</p>

It thus created a new agency and conferred upon it privileges which were in terms exclusive of all other agencies. The water company accepted the grant of power which the borough had failed to execute, together with its privileges, and made expenditures and completed its works. The exclusive privilege was the inducement for the expenditure of money in the construction and operation of the works. The purpose was to protect the company and to secure it the exclusive enjoyment of its franchises, not for all time and against all parties, for the borough could at any time ele'ct, under legislation, to which the charter was expressly made subject, to purchase the works. . . . The grant of an exclusive privilege to the water company is expressed in words that are clear and unequivocal. If we look beyond the words of the act, it is manifest that the object in making the privilege exclusive was to induce the expenditure of capital for the needed work by securing the company from the ruinous effect of competition. It could not have been expected to do this by excluding private competition, which there is little reason to anticipate, and leaving it exposed to the only competition which it had reason to fear, that of the borough.”</p>

When, in 1893, the Tyrone Water Company accepted the provisions of the constitution and the said legislation, it was put on the same footing as if it had been chartered in 1893, and lost its exclusive franchises. Luzerne Water Company v. Toby Creek Water Company, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20Pa.%20569" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="148 Pa. 569">148 Pa. 569</a>, is cited in support of this legal proposition. In this case, the opinion of Judge Rice (then president judge of Luzerne county) was affirmed by the Supreme Court in a per curiam opinion. With all due deference to Judge Rice, I respectfully submit that his said opinion lacks the convincing force with which he usually clinches his judicial reasoning. The title to said act of June 2, 1887, to my mind is misleading. But waiving this question, and, assuming that said case is authority on the precise question it does decide, it must be remembered that Mr. Justice Dean, in White v. The City of Meadville, <a href="/pa/177/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="177 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="883741" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0643-01">supra,</a> intimates that the doctrine of said case of Luzerne Water Company v. Toby Creek Water Company, is to be confined to private corporations, not municipalities. Moreover, there was no question of equities in said case; both corporations were chartered after the passage of the act of 1887 (opinion of Judge Rice, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20Pa.%20570" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="148 Pa. 570">148 Pa. 570</a>) ; neither had any superior <em>equity; </em>the corporators of each knew when they invested their money, or ought to have known, that such investment was not' made on the faith of an exclusive privilege.</p>

Iuforentially, at least, there was to be a surrender of old privileges, as a consideration for the obtaining of the new. The reasoning of Judge Reeder in Wallace v. Lehigh Water Co., 1 Northampton County Reports, 117, on this point, seems to be satisfactory. One object of said act doubtless was to obtain uniformity, as respects corporations of the same class; all old corporations were to be as if chartered immediately after the passage of said act of April 29, 1874; this would put all corporations in existence at that time, on an equal footing. But, to go a step further, as counsel for defendants seek to do, and hold that after the passage of the amendment of June 2, 1887, corporations chartered prior to April 29,1874, could only accept the new constitution at the expense of the surrender of their exclusive privileges in to to, would tend not to uniformity, but to diversity in two ways; first, such old corporations would not, knowing this fact, accept the constitution; second, if they did there would be an incongruity in the rights of corporations which existed prior to the passage of said amendment of June 2, 1887; and the older corporations would be at a disadvantage, as compared with those chartered between April 29, 1874, and June 2,1887. The water companies chartered between said two dates had an exclusive franchise (Act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 1874, sec. 34, p. 93 ; Purd. Dig. p. 955, sec. 4) subject to the right of the municipality to purchase (Purd. Dig. p. 955, sec. 8) ; said corporations certainly were under the protection of the proviso in section 10, article 16, of the constitution, requiring that “ no injustice shall be done to the corporation ” by legislation altering, or annulling charters. But to adopt the contention of defendant’s counsel is to deny to the Tyrone Water Company, chartered in 1867, and going into business in 1870, a privilege, namely, said constitutional protection, which a water company chartered on April 30, 1874, enjoys. This would not be uniformity, but diversity, and the junior company would have the advantage of the senior.</p>

Woodward, 4 Wheaton, 712; second, because all of said old companies are within the protection of the Pennsylvania constitutional provision requiring that “ no injustice shall be done to the corporators.” But I prefer to put my ruling on the (to my mind) safer, surer, and more conservative ground that the legislative intent, in the passage of said acceptance section of the act of April 29, 1874, was to put all old corporations accepting the constitution on a par with corporations chartered immediately after its passage, say on April 30, 1874. This construction tends to carry out the legislative purpose—namely, uniformity as to the rights, privileges, and obligations of.corporations of the same class—as of the same date of charter, and protects the rights of the corporation, while it renders it amenable to the corporation act of April 29, 1874.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[177,977,1181,757]]]'>When the Tyrone Water Company, plaintiff, on September 1, 1893, accepted the provision of the constitution and of the act of April 29, 1874, and its supplement, it put itself on a par with like water companies chartered immediately subsequent to the passage of said act. It lost its exclusive franchise granted it by its charter, but it gained, in lieu thereof, the exclusive privilege given to water companies by clause 3, section 34, of said Act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 1874, p. 94. But, at the same time it rendered itself amenable to clause 7, of the same section of the same act, which provides a method whereby municipalities can purchase the plants of water companies. Said acceptance of the constitution, moreover, brought said Tyrone Water Company within both the scope and the protection of section 10, article 16 of the constitution which is as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b601-7" data-blocks='[["BL_601.6",601,[174,1753,1181,301]]]'>“ The general assembly shall have the power to alter, revoke, or annul any charter, of incorporation now existing, and revocable at the adoption of this constitution, or any that may hereafter be created, whenever in their opinion, it may be injurious to the citizens of this commonwealth, in such manner, however, that no injustice shall be done to the corporators.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="ATG" data-blocks='[["BL_601.8",601,[176,2269,1176,150]],["BL_602.1",602,[269,352,1183,142]]]'>“The legislature shall have the power to alter, revoke or annul any charter, of incorporation hereafter conferred by, or under any special, or general law, whenever in their opinion it <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>may be injurious to the citizens of the commonwealth; in such manner, however, that no injustice shall be done the corpora-tors.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[269,509,1182,1026]]]'>The water company then ought not to be heard to complain of the legislation of 1874 (hereinbefore referred to), allowing the borough to purchase, since, from its very inception, it was subject to such legislation. On the other hand, the borough has no true ground for fault finding, since, by the fundamental law of the land, the constitution itself, the confiscation of franchises without compensation to the corporators, is prohibited. And the remarks of Judge Dean, in White v. City of Meadville, <a href="/pa/177/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="177 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="883741" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0643-01">177 Pa. 643</a>, and Judge Fell in Downingtown Gas &amp; Water Company v.

The borough of Tyrone, therefore, has no right to construct a municipal water plant; if said borough desires to own its own waterworks, it must buy out the water company, in accordance with the provisions of said hereinbefore recited clause 7, section 34, act of April 29,1874, P.

True, there was no express contract as in the case of White v. Meadville, <a href="/pa/177/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="177 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="883741" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0643-01">supra,</a> but there was an implied contract, and the Downingtown water case, supra, is persuasive, at least, that an implied contract is as binding as an express one. The Tyrone Water Company supplied fire protection to the borough, when the credit of that municipality was so low that it could only market its bonds at ninety cents on the dollar to provide the wherewithal to purchase fire plugs. Then as the borough increased in population and territory, the water company likewise increased its plant to supply the increased needs, and extended its pipes to give additional fire protection. True, plaintiffs can only show two or three specific requests by the borough authorities for such increase of plant, or extension of pipes. But, the action of the borough in levying a water tax under the provisions of the Act of April 16,1875, P. L. 1875, p. 55, is persuasive, at least of such contract, and also that the borough had adopted the method of supplying itself with water through the medium of a water company. And did not the acceptance of such facilities, extended and made possible, by the water company, amount to an implied contract? Would it not be inequitable to allow the borough, in its comparative strength, to repudiate the implied contract? Would it not now be especially and peculiarly inequitable to allow the borough now to so repudiate the water company since said company, as late as 1896, with the knowledge of the borough and without any protest or warning from the municipal authorities, expended large sums of money in enlarging its plant, so as to meet the wants of the growing town of Tyrone ? And the borough is not prejudiced by making it pay a reasonable price for the water company’s plant. It would have to expend large sums of money to duplicate said works, and then the result would be that, by building a municipal plant, the value of the private plant would be destroyed; it would be useless destruction of property with<a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>out adequate compensation from any standpoint you view the transaction. It is no answer to aver that the water company asks an unreasonable price for its plant. Under the legislation hereinbefore cited, the matter of a reasonable price is within the control of the court, and such court would endeavor to see that no injustice was done to the borough in case of a purchase, just as an effort is now made to prevent the borough disregarding the just rights of the water company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b604-4" data-blocks='[["BL_604.4",604,[284,787,1187,824]]]'>There is no allegation, much less proof, that the water company failed to provide a reasonable adequate supply of water, both for fire protection and to supply the citizens. The only allegation is that, when the water company and the borough authorities disagreed as to the yearly rate for fire protection, the water company turned off the water from some six fire plugs. Grant that this was a wrongful act on the part of the water company, the borough authorities, under the proviso to clause 8 section 34, Act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 1874, 94, had ample means of redress through the courts. The water company had no desire to cease furnishing the borough with water; it was only an effort on its part to show that it “ meant business,” to use a slang term. The boi’ough authorities, in turn, by their actions indicated a purpose on their part neither to pay the advanced rate, nor to dispense with the much needed water supply.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b604-5" data-blocks='[["BL_604.5",604,[290,1614,1185,615]]]'>And the very fact that the borough authorities forcibly turned on the water again and kept it on by show of force, to my mind, demonstrates, beyond question, that the borough was dependent on the water company for fire protection, and had been so for years. When the water company undertook to use the plant, as if it were private property, the borough authorities said, in effect, “No, you cannot do that; the public needs fire protection, and such fire protection it must have from your plant; your works are public property, and we will not permit you to do with them as you please.” Does not this indicate, at least, an implied contract on the part of the borough of Tyrone to accept its water supply from the plaintiff water company ?</p>
