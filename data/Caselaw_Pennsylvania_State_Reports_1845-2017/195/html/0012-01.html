By agreement the three cases were tried together. It was the understanding of the parties and their counsel that the evidence presented on the trial would be applicable to all the cases, and that the title to the real estate <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>in controversy in each case was vested in fee simple in Savilla Kenney, who died May 8,1893. Upon the evidence submitted the jury rendered verdicts for the defendants, on which judgments were entered. Catharine E. Kennedy, the decedent’s daughter, married Byron M. Fell on February 17,1897, and on June 1, following, they entered into articles of agreement with James E. Graff for the sale to him of the real estate Catharine claimed to have title to under the will of her mother. The sum or amount agreed to be paid for the land was $7,000, and on June 3, 1897, the sellers tendered to the buyer a deed of the property and demanded payment of the purchase money. The latter, admitting that the deed was sufficient in form, refused to accept it, or to pay the purchase money, on the ground that under the will of Savilla Kenney the estate of Catharine was a life estate, and not a fee simple, “and that she and her husband could not make a legal conveyance in fee simple of the said premises.” Thereupon the parties agreed to submit their dispute to the court below to determine whether Catharine took, under the will, a life estate or an estate in fee simple, each party reserving the right of appeal from its deqision to the Supreme Court. The court in an elaborate opinion decided that Catharine had, under the will of her mother, an estate in fee simple, and directed judgment to be entered accordingly.</p>

In Kuntzleman’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="136 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="819999" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0142-01">136 Pa. 142</a>, so much of the trust as was for coverture only was inoperative, while that part of it which charged the trustees with the investment of the personalty and the control of the realty was held to constitute an active and continuing trust to pay to the testator’s daughter the rents and profits accruing on one tenth part of his residuary estafe during her life, and to protect the corpus of the estate for the parties entitled in remainder. In Hemphill’s Estate, <a href="/pa/180/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="180 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="888348" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0095-01">180 Pa. 95</a>, it was held that a <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>trust to pay the net income of realty to the cestui que trust involves the exercise of discretion by the trustee and constituted an active and continuing trust. Judge Ashman, in delivering the opinion of the orphans’ court, said, “ that this testator intended to create a trust in his real estate is clear, because he said that much when he devised it ‘ in trust.’ That he intended the trust to be an active trust is equally clear because he directed the trustee to pay over the ‘ net income.’ But the net income of real estate is only that portion which remains after the payment of taxes, repairs and commissions, and a large measure of discretion is incident to the payment of at least one of these charges. If the trustee should pay over the gross income to the cestui que trust he would be liable for mismanagement. The trust is a continuing trust for another reason. The estate in the children was an equitable estate for life, and the estate in remainder to their heirs was a legal estate. The two estates being of different qualities could not coalesce, and the rule in Shelley’s case did not therefore apply; and the trust was essential in order to protect the remainder-men: Little v. Wilcox, <a href="/pa/119/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="119 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="558084" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0439-01">119 Pa. 439</a>.” The decision of the court below was affirmed on appeal to this court.
