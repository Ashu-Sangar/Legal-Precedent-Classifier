Everitt. But as the son died intestate, and without issue soon after the death of the decedent, clause “C ” of the will comes into effect, and comes up for construction. It reads as follows, to wit: “ At the death of my said son all my estate shall go to <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>and immediately become vested in his lawful children, then living, and the issue of any who may be dead, such issue to take their parents’ share by representation, and in case he shall die leaving no children or issue as aforesaid, then all my estate shall go to and immediately become vested in my next of kin, then living, share and share alike, including issue born to my brother, George B. Everitt, and his second wife, Rosanna.” As we read that clause, it appears that decedent did not intend to die intestate as to any portion of his estate, because he says “ At the death of my said son all of my estate shall go and immediately become vested in his lawful children, etc., and in case he shall die leaving no children, etc., then all my estate shall go to and immediately become vested in my next of kin, etc., including the issue of my brother George B., and his second wife Rosanna,” who are said not to be his heirs under the intestate laws.</p>

Everitt, yet that fact did not bring distribution under the intestate laws; that decedent has set up a class among whom his estate is to be distributed. That his next of kin living at the death of his son George B. Everitt, here means all his nephews and nieces then living, “ including issue born to my brother George B. and his second wife Bosanna.” It must be remembered that the children of this brother were the <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>same degree by blood as other nephews and nieces, and we hold the will to mean that such issue was to be legitimatized, and after that had been done, such as came within the description of next of kin at the death of George B.

Young, 2 Milne &amp; Keene, 780; Wright et al. v. Trustees M. E. Church of New York, 1 Hoffman’s Chancery Reports, 202; Locke v. Locke, 45 N. J. Equity, 97; Swasey v.

But his words do not mean nearest of kin without restriction in this will, because he cuts out his sister, as he has aright to do. Lord Coke defined the “ next of kin ” to be the next of blood who are not attainted of treason, felony, or have any other lawful disability.” Testator in so many words rendered his sister unable to take, and leaving her out, the estate falls to those who were able at the death of the son without issue. The next of blood might be one or more, but must be of equal degree. In Wimbles v. Pitcher, 12 Vesey, Jr. 433, it was held, that under the devise to “ the next of kin,' of equal degree share and share alike,” brothers take, excluding nephews and nieces. And the testator still further modifies his meaning. He says, “including issue born to my brother George B. and his second wife Rosanna.” “ The word ‘ issue ’ in a will means prima facie the same thing as ‘ heirs of the body ’ and is generally a word of limitation, but this construction will give way, if there be on <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>the face of the instrument sufficient to show that the word was intended to have a less extended meaning and to be applied only to children, or to descendants of a particular class, or at a particular time: ” Taylor v.

    <p class="summary" id="b479-5" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[206,535,1176,874]]]'>Let us see what that law leads us to. It is evident that when the will was drawn decedent could not have known what relation his next of kin living at the death of his son would be to him the testator, or to each other. His son was a young unmarried man and would probably live many years. There was a question as to the legitimacy of the children of his brother George B. and his second wife Rosanna. He certainly wished to make the issue of this brother the objects of his bounty, and on equal footing with his other brothers and sisters. If he did not, why did he refer to them ? In order to bring them in he must use the word “ issue.” If he said children, grandchildren or descendants, such might not be his next of kin when the estate vested. He says “ including.” Including in what? Why surely including the next of kin, those of the issue of his said brother who answered that description at the death of his son. We believe that is what he meant, and that it is the legal meaning of what he said. The exceptions are dismissed.</p>

We are equally clear that the testator only intended his next of kin who <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>should be living at the death of his son George to be the residuary-legatees of his estate, and that intent excludes all of the children of nephews and nieces -who were dead before the death of the testator’s son George.
