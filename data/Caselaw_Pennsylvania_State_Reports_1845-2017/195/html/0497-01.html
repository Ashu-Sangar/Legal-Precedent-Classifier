Cummings, John Heilman and Ella R. Cummings. Subsequently the pleadings were so amended that Charles J. Cummings was made sole defendant. In pursuance of the agreement by which this amendment was made, the bonds referred to in the opinion of the Supreme Court were given. The suit was then prosecuted against Cummings alone and resulted in a judgment against him. After the Supreme Court had affirmed this judgment against Cummings, plaintiff entered judgment on the bond which had been given to him. Subsequently a rule was taken by Cummings and his sureties to open the judgment, which rule was discharged by the court.</p>

In this result we are unable to discover any cause for relieving tbe appellants from liability on their bond. Tbe testimony submitted by them to support the rules to show cause why the judgment on the bond should not be opened and they let into a defense, failed to establish fraud or mistake in the execution and delivery of the bond or in any transaction connected with it. <em>We </em>therefore conclude that the court below did not err in refusing to open the judgment.</p>
