In the first place, it is but fair to the counsel for the plaintiffs to state that such counsel requests tins court to say to you, as a matter of law, that that credit cannot be allowed, the evidence of it being too vague and indefinite. So the counsel for the-plaintiffs contend, but I decline to so instruct you, as a matter of law, and submit for your consideration, under the evidence as it has been adduced in this trial and the instructions as to the law as this court gives them to you, whether this credit on April 15, 1876, of $1,571.04, should or should not be allowed; with the instruction, however, the same instruction that I gave you in relation to the $150, that the burden is on the defendant to satisfy you by the weight of the evidence that the defendant is entitled to that credit. And when you come to the question as to whether this credit shall be allowed, you will recollect, in the first place, as to the receipt. The receipt which the defendant offers is the main evidence of such payment and reads as follows:] [1]</p>

It is alleged that it does; that there is no evidence of any other estate transaction between Henry Rothrock, Jr., and John Hoffer, administrator, except in the Henry Roth-<a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>rock, Sr., estate ; and, that it is not conceivable that this receipt refers to any other estate, or that John Hoffer intended it for any other administrator, except as the administrator of the Henry Rothrock, Sr., estate. How is this, gentlemen? If the weight of the evidence satisfies you that the word “ administrator” was intended to mean the administrator of the Henry Rothrock, Sr., estate, then you will go on and inquire in the second place, on account of what was this sum of $1,571.04 paid. You will have to determine this question by the weight of the evidence, and the evidence on the subject is principally inferaitial, that is, it consists not of direct testimony but of in ference or deductions to be drawn from certain facts ; and it will be for you to draw such inferences from the facts in evidence, because counsel for the respective parties differ widely in the inferences which they draw or attempt to draw from the facts in evidence.] [2] [Counsel for the defendants say that this payment was on account of the deferred bond. The counsel for the defendant claims that this must be so because they aver that there was no other amount due from Henry Rothrock, Sr., to John Hoffer, administrator; and they base their inference that no other amount was due, on certain facts. As I have said before, the sale and confirmation of the sale of this land occurred in November, 1875, and the following spring a deed for the property was delivered to Henry Rothrock, Jr., and a mortgage was delivered by him to the administrators, cum testamento annexo, for the deferred payment of the dower bond. That is what Henry Rothrock, Jr., testified to, but the deed in question and the mortgage in question do bear date April 4, 1876, and were acknowledged on that day, and the presumption of the law is that the papers were delivered on that day.] [2]</p>

Therefore, they contend that this amount could not, on April 15, 1876, have been paid on the hand money, because they allege that the hand money was fully paid prior to or on April 4, 1876. And, in addition, counsel for the defendant point to the fact that on April 13, 1876, these administrators with the will annexed, the trustees in the partition proceedings, filed an account of their trustee<a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>ship, and as administrators of the estate, wherein they charged themselves with the hand money as received. And it was urged by the counsel for the defendant that they would not have so charged themselves with this hand money unless it was actually received; and if it was actually received prior to April 13, 1876, when they filed their account, then the payment of April 15, 1876, could not apply to the hand money. So it is alleged by counsel for the defendant, because the hand money had been fully paid. Now these are the principal reasons why it is alleged on the part of the defendant that this payment was on account of the deferred bond. In addition, it is argued by counsel for the defendant that had this large sum of money, $1,571, not been paid at that time, the plaintiffs, or use of plaintiffs rather, would not have waited nearly twenty years before bringing suit for it; that they were not persons in such circumstances and they would more promptly have brought suit.] [3]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.4",556,[267,1245,1186,1229]]]'>The plaintiffs reply to this that the reason why the plaintiffs or use plaintiffs did not bring suit was that one of the administrators with the will annexed, Mrs. Rothrock, was their mother; that they did not want to annoy her with suits; and that the defendant, Henry Rothrock, Jr., was their brother, and they did not want to annoy him with suits; and that the explanation of the seeming delay is to be found in the relationship of the respective parties. And it is argued by counsel for the plaintiffs that there is no statute of limitations which would bar this suit short of twenty years. Then again the counsel for the plaintiffs draw an entirely different inference from the facts than do the counsel for the defendant. The counsel for the plaintiffs claim, in the first place, that Henry Rothrock, Jr., is falsifying either designedly or because of faulty memory, when he says that the deed to himself and the mortgage from himself were delivered on April 4, 1876. The counsel for the plaintiffs claim that they were not delivered until April 15, 1876. And as showing that they were not delivered until April 15, 1876, counsel for the plaintiffs point to the fact that the deeds were not recorded until April 15, 1876, and the mortgage was not recorded until April 15, 1876. The plaintiffs say Judge Hoy, counsel for the estate, was a careful lawyer, and had the mortgage been delivered to him April 4,1876, he woiild have it recorded earlier than April 15.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[195,613,1181,661]]]'>Then the counsel for the plaintiffs point to the fact that a number of other deeds were executed on April 15, 1876, the same day on which the plaintiffs’ counsel claim that the deed and mortgage from Henry Rothrock, Jr., were in fact delivered. It seems that Henry Rothrock, Jr., sold out certain subdivisions of the farm from the tract of land which he bought to certain other parties; and on April 15, 1876, there were executed, delivered and recorded, deeds from Henry Rothrock, Jr., to George Garbrick, for seventy-five acres, consideration, §6,225; from Henry Rothrock, Jr., to Theodore Kelley for forty acres and ninety-four perches, consideration, §3,531.65; and from Henry Rothrock, Jr., to John Wood for twenty acres and twenty perches, consideration, §1,811.25.</p>

The counsel for the plaintiffs attach some importance to the fact that this receipt is not for an even amount of money, that it is not for §1,500, such an amount as parties generally pay on land or on bonds, but it is for an odd amount. The counsel for the plaintiffs would have you infer that the reason why it is such an odd amount, §1,571.04, is that that was the balance of the purchase money. The counsel for the defendant, however, would have you infer that the reason why it is such an odd amount was that that was the amount which one of the purchasers from Henry Rothrock, Jr., paid to him that day, and that he turned it <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>over, not on account of the hand money, but on account of this deferred payment.</p>

If the weight of evidence satisfies you that it should be applied on account of the deferred bond, then you will so apply it and will give a credit for that amount to the defendant. On the contrary, if the weight of the evidence fails to so satisfy you then you will disregard it wholly. The questions at issue are within a narrow compass, namely, is the defendant entitled to a credit, first for the $150, the purchase money of a horse ? Second, is he entitled to a credit for the amount of money mentioned in receipt of April 15, 1876, towit: $1,571.04?] [4] I have not endeavored to recount all the testimony in the case to you.

Hoffer lived until December, 1885, nine years after the bond was due; Judge Hoy who prepared all the papers involved in the entire transaction, acting as counsel for the estate, lived until August, 1887, eleven years after the bond matured; the widow lived until 1894, and the heirs who were in need of money and whether they were in need or not, would naturally require payment of money which was due them, never even raised a question as to the payment of this money on the bond for a period of twenty years after it became due to them if it was unpaid. It is simply incredible that this money was due during all this time, or that any of the parties including the administrator and his counsel so regarded it. The question whether it had been paid was a pure question of fact which would in all circumstances have to be decided by a jury, and which was carefully and correctly submitted to them by the court. It would have been the gravest error to withdraw it from their consideration. We are thoroughly convinced that the verdict was right and fully sustained by all the testimony. The assignments of error are dismissed.</p>
