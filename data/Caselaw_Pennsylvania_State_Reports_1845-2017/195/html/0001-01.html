The provision that if Theodore shall survive his wife, then the trust shall terminate, and Theodore’s moiety shall be conveyed to him in fee, is conclusive of this view. It is not a trust to protect the corpus of the estate for remainder-men, nor to protect the estate of a spendthrift or lunatic from himself or his creditors. It seems clear that the testator intended to give his son Theodore as unrestricted use of his share of the estate as was compatible with the purpose mentioned. To accomplish this he gave the trustee power to devote as much of the principal, interest or income to the maintenance of his son Theodore and his children as in the discretion of the trustee should be advisable for their good. At the death of Theodore the remainder-men were to receive only what might “ remain,” and the injunction is absolute and clear that the trustee was not to be held to account to the remainder-men for any part of the trust property which he might in his discretion pay over and convey to Theodore in his lifetime. The meaning of the will plainly is, that the trustee might with safety pay over to his brother any portion of the principal, interest or income without fear of accountability that he thought his brother might use to advantage, or which might be for his or his children’s good. Indeed, your auditor is of opinion that the trustee might with safety and without accountability have paid over or conveyed to his brother Theodore his entire moiety <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>of the estate, the sounder view being, in his judgment, that the discretion to pay over or convey to Theodore in Ins lifetime was unlimited.</p>

The judge cites with approbation this language from Judge Strong : “ A court of equity does not interfere with a discretion reposed, except in cases of clear abuse, when the court can conclude that the donee of a power is acting in fraud of it. But when, as in your case, the trustee acts in accordance with his own best judgment, and in so doing follows the positive directions of his testator, it would be altogether unprecedented for a court to interfere and substitute its discretion for that invoked by the will: ” Pulpress v.

The will certainly did give to the executor, who was also the brother of Theodore Beaumont, an absolute discretion to devote as much of Theodore’s one half of the residue of the estate to the maintenance of Theodore and his children as he chose. And as if to insure the absolute character of the discretion entrusted to Rush, the testator added another provision, equally explicit, in which he positively and expressly declares that the trustee shall not be held accountable to any of the children of Theodore “ for any part of the trust property which he may in his discretion pay over or convey to my said son Theodore Beaumont in his lifetime.” The words used are entirety free of doubt as to their meaning and, therefore, need no rule of interpretation to be applied to them to explain their meaning. It was perfectly competent to the testator to make such a provision; there is nothing in it contrary ,to law or public policy, and we see no reason why it should not be sustained. The reasons for this conclusion are well expressed by the auditor in his supplemental report, and without any unnecessary repetition of them here we affirm the decree for the reasons stated in that report.</p>
