      <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>Under clause <em>(o') </em>the first important question to be settled in this case is, When is the proceeding which includes a judgment by confession to be deemed to have “ begun ” ? The answer seems free front doubt: When the judgment is confessed of record, i. e., when the warrant for its entry is actually delivered to the prothonotary. See Polhemus’s App., <a href="/pa/32/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="32 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="986647" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0328-01">32 Pa. 328</a>. A legal proceeding is not begun when a party empowers an attorney to appear and act for him, but when the attorney, in pursuance of that authority, does appear and act for him. Of course, no question can arise as to the “ beginning ” of a judgment both authorized and entered within four months of the filing of the petition of bankruptcy. But it follows that a judgment by confession, treated as a legal proceedimg beginning somewhere, is “begun” within the four months if entered within that period, no matter when the instrument on which it is founded was executed.</p>

Its validity if unaccompanied by positive fraud, is recognized and enforced in bankruptcy. But a transfer intended to enable one to secure payment of an antecedent debt is a preference if its effect is to give that creditor an advantage over others. If that is not its effect, it is a valid payment: Tiffany v.

    <p id="b298-6" data-blocks='[["BL_298.6",298,[261,556,1182,870]]]'>In this ease a petition in-bankruptcy against the defendant Greth was presented on April 3, 1899, upon which a contest arose as to the fact of his insolvency which was followed by an adjudication of bankruptcy on October 17, 1899. The appellant’s judgments were entered against him on January 10, 1899, and as that date was within four months of the time when the petition was filed, the case was brought directly within the express words of the 67th section of the present bankrupt law. It is very clearly and forcibly shown in tlie opinion of the learned court below, that it is not the date of the warrants of attorney authorizing the entry of judgment, but the date on which the judgments are actually entered that fixes the time from which the four months’ period begins to run. We do not see any escape from the conclusion thus reached, and we therefore find that there was no error in the order making absolute the rule to show cause why the fund in court should not be paid to the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>
