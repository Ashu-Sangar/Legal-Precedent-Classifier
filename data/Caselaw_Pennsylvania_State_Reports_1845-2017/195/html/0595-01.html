The action was trespass to recover damages for the alleged wrongful removal and sale of stock and farming implements, the right to the possession of which the plaintiff claimed. The property in question was owned by Susan A. Vosburg. The plaintiff claimed that he had entered into an oral lease with her for her farm and the stock and implements for one year, and his right to the possession of the property was based on the. lease. The defendant Litts sold the property at auction as agent for Mrs. Vosburg under a written power of attorney. The question of fact on which the case turned was whether a lease had been made. Mrs. Vosburg died before the trial.</p>
