It was conceded that services had been rendered and that the defendant might be held liable on a quantum meruit, but its liability on the contract was denied on the ground that the president had not been authorized by the board of directors to make it. The defendant offered no testimony, but relied wholly upon the incompetency and insufficiency of that offered by the plaintiff.</p>
