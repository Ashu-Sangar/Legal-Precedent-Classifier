Prior to this deed Peters had laid out a tract of land of which the Osterheldt lot was a part, in lots, according to a plan upon which streets were indicated. This plan was recorded. The description in the deed referred to the streets mentioned in the plan. One of these streets was known as Preston street. In reference to this street the referee reported as follows:</p>

In this fence were two gates, the positions of which were subsequently shifted, by means of which side entrances were gained from the said Preston street to the plaintiff’s lot. For three or four years there was no inclosure of the bed of Preston street, either on the Lancaster avenue or Story street side. The public used it in driving chiefly in passing from Story street, then a summer road, into Lancaster turnpike, with a view of avoiding a toll gate on Lancaster turnpike. The natural grade of Preston street at the Story street end was about four feet above that of Story street, and as a result of the public use a hole or quagmire was worn, which, proving dangerous to an equestrian, led to the erection by the plaintiff’s testator, about four years after the vesting of his title, of two or three posts with a rail on top for a distance of fifty feet, at the top of the bank at the Story street end. The result of this was to divert the public <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>travel from Story street into Lancaster avenue, and vice versa from a track at right angles to a track at an oblique angle across what was known as the Wallace lot, lying opposite to the plaintiff’s lot, and separated from it by Preston street. This continued to be the condition of affairs until some time between 1865 and 1870, when both Story street end and the Lancaster avenue end of said Preston street were enclosed by the plaintiff’s testator by the erection of substantial fences and a large gate on the Lancaster avenue front, by which means twenty-five feet of Preston street were occupied by the plaintiff’s testator, making a side yard or entrance into his place. The board fence, with gates, was still maintained along the original line of Preston street. Mr. Wallace acted in the same manner as to the remaining twenty-five feet of Preston street, and both Wallace and Osterheldt erected a line fence between them down the middle of Preston street.</p>

Dig. 1875, pi. 8, is as follows: “ Any street, lane or alley, laid out by any person or persons in any village or town plot or plan of lots, on lands owned by such person or persons, in case the same has not been opened to, or used by, the public for twenty-one years next after the laying out of the same, shall be and have no force and effect and shall not be opened, without the consent of the owner or owners of the land on which the same has been, or shall be, laid out.” The ordinance to open Fairmount avenue is dated <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>April 5, 1884. The city council, by this ordinance, directed that the department of surveys be authorized to revise plan No. 105, so as to place thereon Fairmount avenue from Mt. Vernon street to Lancaster avenue of the width of fifty feet. The avenue was laid out and opened the year the ordinance was passed. If the plaintiffs’ decedent was injured or his rights invaded by the action of the city in appropriating his land for the use of the avenue, it was at this time, and his right of action, if he had any, accrued to him then. If under the law at that time, he was not entitled to recover, the subsequent statute, enacted in 1889, would not enable him to do so. There is nothing in this statute that would justify us in giving it a retroactive construction, so as to apply to streets opened and used prior to its passage.</p>
    <p id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[180,1084,1180,821]]]'>Applying to the facts of this case the principles enunciated in the well considered opinion of Mr. Justice Fell in Quicksall et al. v. Philadelphia, supra, we are of opinion that the plaintiffs had no cause of action against the city. The effect of the deed from Peters to Osterheldt in 1849 was to dedicate to public use the strip of land of the grantor now included within the lines of Fairmount avenue and to stamp upon it the character of a public street. It gave the right to use this street not only to purchasers of lots laid out by Peters, but to all other persons who might desire to use the street. The dedication was irrevocable by either the grantor or those claiming title under him. Therefore, the deed of Peters to Osterheldt in 1849 operated as a relinquishment of all claims for damages for the use of the land within the line of Fairmount avenue for street purposes and the act of 1889, having no application, the plaintiffs here have no basis upon which to sustain a claim for damages.</p>
