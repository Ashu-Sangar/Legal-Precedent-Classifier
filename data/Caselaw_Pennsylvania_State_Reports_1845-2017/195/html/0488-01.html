The defendant claimed that the obstruction in the street was building material placed there by a contractor named Walz, who was constructing a building for an adjoining owner named Stead.

    <p class="summary" id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[217,836,1182,1596]]]'>[I may as well say that the question has been raised here whether this plaintiff, Phoebe Koch, being a married woman, can recover without her husband joining in the action. The act of 1897 requires that where an injury is sustained by the wife, suit shall be brought in the name of the husband and the wife, and the husband can recover what he is entitled to under the law and the wife what she is entitled to, and a separate verdict would be rendered for both the husband and wife. But as the testimony in this case shows, the wife was deserted by the husband, who left her a year before the accident occurred and has not been living here and not supporting and maintaining her since. It would be impossible for her to bring the suit joining the husband, because he is not here to assert his right, and we do not know what injury he has sustained. She might not be able to bring a suit where the husband deserts her—if the husband deserts her and remains away. So we say to you that this wife is entitled to recover for the injury she has sustained to herself, and not for injuries her husband might be entitled to recover under the law. . . . Mrs. Schneider also testified that she was unable to stoop down and perform labor in the usual way; that when she did that she became dizzy. Mrs. Koch also testified that she was unable to do but very little labor since that; that her one side is partially disabled, and that her hand is disabled, and in consequence of that she has been unable to labor. She seeks to recover compensation from the city of Williamsport for the injuries which she alleges she has sustained. If, under the instructions of the court, the jury believe she is entitled to recover, then she would be entitled to be fully compensated for these alleged injuries whatever the jury in their judgment think would be a fair and reasonable compensation.] [7]</p>

It was clearly stated in the charge to the jury that there was no evidence that the city had actual notice of the obstruction in the street. In the absence of evidence of actual notice it remained to inquire whether the city was properly chargeable with constructive notice. The instructions relating to constructive notice and what constituted it, and to negligence and proximate cause were plain, comprehensive and impartial. Under these instructions and upon the evidence in the case it was for the jury to determine whether the cause of the injury received by the plaintiff was the negligence of the city.
