To sever the pole line would be to destroy the plant. The pole line was necessary to carry the electric light current to consumers in Lehighton. It was attached physically and continuously to the plant in Weissport, and while the plant was in operation the electricity created by the machinery was passing to and fro, going from and returning to the dynamos, and thus constituting one machine or plant. Evidently it was the full intent of the parties who erected the plant in Weissport to make the pole line in dispute a part of the machine plant attached to the real estate.” The controversy turned upon the question-whether the part of the plant which was contained within the territory of the borough of Lehighton was real or personal estate, whether it was so connected with the plant in Weissport as to be a necessary part of it and therefore bound by the lien of the mortgage. The above findings, which in our opinion could not have been otherwise under the evidence, dispose of the question. We are clearly of opinion that the court below was entirely correct in its findings of fact and conclusions of law The principles upon which the question was ruled are thoroughly well established and very familiar to the professional mind. It is beyond doubt that they have direct application to the clear facts of the present case.</p>
