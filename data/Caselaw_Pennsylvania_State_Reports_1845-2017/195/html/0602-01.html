A promissory note for $25,000, to the order of the Spring Garden National Bank, payable on demand, was signed by the directors of the National bank as individuals, and then sitting in their capacity as directors, they ordered that the amount of the note should be passed to the credit of the new trust company on the books of the National bank.

A day or two- prior to July 19,1887, Mr. Scbieffelin, who was a resident of California, called upon Mr. Kennedy and asked that his bonds be put in the Safe Deposit Company and a certificate issued to him therefor. Mr. Kennedy asked him to call again which he did. In the mean time, Mr. Kennedy, using the facilities of the National bank, paid off the loans for which the bonds were held as collateral, and put them in a safe deposit box in the vaults of the trust company. Upon Mr. Schieffelin’s calling, he was taken in and shown the safe deposit box with his bonds in it, and with the aid of a clerk in the bank he checked them off in accordance with a list he had, and found them all on hand. Thereupon the certificate of July 19, 1887, was issued to Mr. Schieffelin and he left within a day or two afterwards. In a few days afterwards, Mr. Kennedy again borrowed money on these coupon bonds as collateral security, and they never came back again into the custody of either the old or the new trust company. The use of these bonds was made without the knowledge of any of the officials of either the old or the new trust company, except Mr. Kennedy. After the failure of the new trust company in May, 1891, these bonds were sold, and the loan for which they were collateral security paid.

This assignment can mean nothing more than that the new com-' <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>pany took tbe assets subject to any liens that then existed against them in the hands of the old company.

If their argument is sound, the new company became liable for every debt, no matter how large, by the fact that they took these assets, and it is of no moment whether the assets were large or small. This position your auditor does not think sound ; if a properly authorized person attempted to recover back the assets for the benefit of all the creditors of the old company it would then be a question as to whom these assets or their value belonged, but no such claim is presented here; the claimant does not contend that he is entitled to the value of the assets transferred; he relies entirely upon the implied promise or trust that is to be created for his benefit by the receipt of the assets. Your auditor therefore considers this question only.</p>

Wit<a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>nesses speak of Pfeiffer and his associates having purchased the old charter, but this phraseology does not 'represent what was really done. Pfeiffer and his associates continued the old corporation; they purchased all the stock and continued in business, merely changing the name of the corporation and its management. There was, therefore, nothing in this sale which in any way affected the rights of Schieffelin or Ms claim against the company. The corporation had a perfect right to dispose of any or all of its assets wliich were held at that time, provided .they did not defraud their creditors by so doing, and if Pfeiffer and his associates, after they undertook the management of this corporation, substituted assets far more valuable than those which had been passed over to Kennedy, the claimant would have no right to complain, nor could he say that he had any right or claim in the old assets that were transferred. Until the claimant has shown that he was defrauded by reason of the transfer of the assets to the new company, he has no right to follow those assets, nor to ask that the corporation who received them be held liable to him in any way. So far as the evidence discloses, the change of management of the corporation that had issued the certificate of deposit may have been of the greatest benefit to the claimant, and if those new managers substituted cash for the questionable assets that were transferred, the advantage to Mm was unquestionable. The evidence leaves us in ignorance as to these facts. The claimant cannot, therefore, be said to have established Ms case.</p>

If this is done in this case, it is very clear that the present claimant is striving to take advantage of a fraud, for if the new company impliedly promised to pay all the old debts, they could only have done so because Kennedy fraudulently concealed this Schieffielin liability, and thus tricked them into assuming its burden. The real value of the assets transferred was an inadequate consideration for such a contract, and it is not contended by the claimant that the new trust company would have agreed for a moment to pay this claim had they known of its existence. A contract formed in such a way <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>could not be enforced against the present innocent creditors, even if the evidence warranted a finding that such a contract had an existence.</p>

Before the auditor her contention was that the new company was liable for the payment of the debts of the old by virtue of an agreement express or implied. .This contention is conclusively answered by the re<a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>port of the auditor. A new ground of liability is now presented,—that the new company took the assets charged with the duty of paying the debts of the old company irrespective of any contractual relation between them, express or implied. This can be only by reason of a fraud. The old company could not’ divest itself of its assets in fraud of its creditors, and any one taking the assets in aid of a purpose to defraud, would be liable to the extent of the value of the assets received. But here there was no intent to defraud creditors, and no creditor was in fact defrauded. The old company now known as the Philadelphia Finance Company has continued in business, and it is nowhere suggested that it is not fully able to meet all claims upon it. While the appellant has a responsible party primarily liable, it cannot be said that she was injured by the transfer of the assets, and unless injured she has no standing to contest the transfer.</p>
