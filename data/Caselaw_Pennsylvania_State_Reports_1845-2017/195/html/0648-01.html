That said Carson McDonald appears to have been of a roving disposition and to have resided away from home most of the time subsequent to his father’s death. He was a dentist by profession and had worked thereat in several different states. He visited his home in Conneautville in August, 1886, at which time he was a man about twenty-seven years of age, of good education and ability. He was without means and desired to procure sufficient money to proceed to New Mexico and to establish himself there in the profession of a dentist. At his request, his mother, said Kasiah McDonald, called upon Mr. Sturtevant, above defendant, to endeavor to procure the said necesaary means. The said Carson McDonald and defendant appear to have had several interviews upon the subject, which resulted in the defendant paying to said Carson McDonald, on August 13,1886, <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>the sum of §300, at which time said Carson McDonald made, acknowledged and delivered to defendant a special warranty-deed for three pieces of land in Erie county, one of which was situate in Erie city, one in Girard borough and one in Girard township; which deed recites a consideration of §200, and which deed included all the real estate of which his father had died seized in Erie county, and which deed was duly recorded in the recorder’s office of Erie county on August 13, 1886. At the same time he executed and delivered to said Sturtevant a deed covering his interest in the land belonging to his father’s estate in Crawford county, the consideration named in said last deed being §100.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b673-6" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[185,968,1180,406]]]'>It is claimed by plaintiffs that the said §300 was loaned by said defendant to said Carson McDonald and that the deeds above referred to were given to secure defendant for such loan, and that at the same time the defendant executed and delivered to said Carson McDonald a writing, in which it was stipulated that the said Carson McDonald was to have five years’ time in which to redeem said lands by repaying said §300, with interest at eight per cent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b673-7" data-blocks='[["BL_673.5",673,[183,1384,1180,190]]]'>This contention is emphatically denied by the defendant, who contends that he purchased outright the interest of the said Carson McDonald in said lands in Erie and Crawford counties for the said sum of §300.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b673-8" data-blocks='[["BL_673.6",673,[183,1591,1180,301]]]'>The answer and evidence of defendant being responsive to that of plaintiffs, and there being no other evidence directly upon this point, T decline to find that the defendant gave to said Carson McDonald any defeasance at the time of receiving said deed. It is not alleged that any such paper was ever acknowledged or recorded.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b673-9" data-blocks='[["BL_673.7",673,[180,1900,1183,560]]]'>4. Carson McDonald immediately thereafter wentto New Mexico, where he established himself in business and remained several years and afterwards returned to Pennsylvania, where he continued to practice his profession in different places. Tie was taken sick in the summer of 1892 and died at Conneautville after a protracted illness, on January 23,1893. It does not appear that he ever made any claim to said real estate after the date of said deeds, and it is not alleged that he ever paid or offered to pay to said defendant the said §300, or any part thereof. The evidence tends to show that ho continued in somewhat straitened circumstances financially up until his death.</p>

In August, 1886, the real estate in Erie county belonging to the widow and heirs of said George B. McDonald was worth about $8,000, and the interest therein conveyed by the said Carson McDonald to defendant by said deed was a one-quarter undivided interest in said lands, subject to the life estate of the said Kasiah McDonald, she being at that time a woman fifty years of age, in good health and with a life expectancy of about twenty-one years. That the said A. Lincoln McDonald had died intestate, unmarried and without issue, on September 24, 1885, before the making of said deed, and that the said George E. McDonald died thereafter, on March 28, 1890. The evidence tends to show that the said Carson McDonald left surviving him a widow, but no children, and that his widow has since died, so that the said plaintiffs are his only heirs at law.</p>
