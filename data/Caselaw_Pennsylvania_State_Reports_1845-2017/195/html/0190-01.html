He had been on an errand for his mother, and came from Pine street and was going north towards Spruce street. Edward H. Cloud, Esq., came out of DeLancey street, which is a short distance south of Spruce street, on a bicycle, and followed him on the east side of the street at a distance of fifty or seventy-five feet. As the boy neared the foot crossing at the corner of Seventeenth and Spruce streets, he met the garbage wagon of the defendant, and was struck by it, or was thrown by trying to save himself in dismounting, and fell with his left foot under the rear wheel of the wagon. The wheel passed over his foot inflicting severe injuries. The boy was riding at an ordinary rate of speed and rang his bell as he approached Spruce street. The garbage wagon was a four-wheeled vehicle, drawn by one horse. It came west on Spruce street and turned south at the southeast corner of Spruce and Seventeenth streets, “ hugging the curb,” and so close thereto that • the boy could not pass between it and the curb. The wagon made an angle of about forty-five degrees with the east curb line of Seventeenth street, and the horse was more nearly parallel with the street, the apparent intention of the driver being to proceed south along the east side of Seventeenth street. At or near the street crossing the boy first saw the wagon which was then directly in front of him and he immediately began to check his speed by back-pedaling. In thus attempting to prevent a <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>collision with the wagon and to dismount, the light pedal of his bicycle struck the curb and he was thrown to the left under the left rear wheel of the wagon. When the wagon turned into Seventeenth street, the horse was going at a moderate rate and was stopped a few feet from the place of the accident. When the boy first saw the wagon, the rear wheel was not clear of the Seventeenth street curb, but when it ran over his foot, it was about two feet from the curb.</p>
    <p id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[188,772,1178,499]]]'>An ordinance of the city of Philadelphia, approved February 2, 1897, provides that “ all persons driving or riding upon the streets or highways of the city, whether on horseback, in carriages, wagons, or other vehicles, or upon bicycles, tricycles or other mechanical contrivanees, shall at all times drive on the road upon the right side of the street or highway, and shall pass all vehicles traveling in the opposite direction by driving or riding to the right of such vehicle or pass all vehicles traveling in the same direction by driving or riding to the left of such vehicles.”</p>

This, very frequently, would prevent an appeal by enabling the counsel to see the correctness of the court’s position, and, if an appeal should be taken, it would aid very materially the appellate court as well as counsel in an intelligent review of the case.</p>

Each was required to obey the law of the road and to conform to its requirements. “ By the law and the custom of the land, it is the duty of persons traveling in wagons or other vehicles meet<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>ing each other on the public road, to pass on the right-hand side of the road. . . . This law or custom applies to, and is intended to regulate the duty and conduct of, those traveling on the road as between themselves : ” Grier v. Sampson, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pa.%20188" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="27 Pa. 188">27 Pa. 188</a>. The evidence in the case at bar did not justify the court in declaring as a matter of law that the boy was within the well recognized exception to the rule stated that a light vehicle or bicycle must give way to a heavily laden wagon. There was no apparent necessity here for the application of this exception to the rule. Under the act of April 23, 1889, the boy had the same right and was subjected to the same restrictions in the use of his bicycle as a person using a carriage drawn by a horse. That he was riding the bicycle, therefore, did not deprive him of the protection of the law of the road, but required the driver of the garbage wagon to accord to him the same privileges and rights in the street as though he were using a carriage.</p>
    <p id="b218-5" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[248,1171,1199,715]]]'>In passing north along the east side of Seventeenth street the boy was where he had a right to be and where, if traveling on the street in that direction, the law of the road as well as the city ordinance required him to be. When the collision occurred the driver was turning his wagon around the southeast corner of Spruce and Seventeenth streets, and the plaintiffs claim that it was with the intention of going south on the east side of the street. When no one was approaching with a desire to pass ' him with a vehicle, the driver had the right to use any part of the street, not occupied by another, yet when he turned abruptly on Seventeenth street in the manner shown by the testimony, he was taking the chance of a collision with other travelers going north on that street, whose rights at that place were superior to his.</p>

Nor was it for the court to say that his effort ''to free himself from his danger was a negligent act contributing ^to his injury. Even if he saw the wagon on Spruce street as he approached the corner, unless he could also see that it was too close to the curb to permit him to pass, he had a right to assume that the driver, if he did turn on Seventeenth street, would keep to the right so that he could pass between the wagon <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>and the curb. This was the rule of the road, and he had a right to act on the expectation that the driver would observe it: Baker v.

If acting on this assumption without any fault on. his part, the boy was placed in a dangerous position by the negligence or carelessness of the driver, he will not be held to the same strict measure of care as under ordinary circumstances, in attempting to relieve himself from a perilous situation.</p>
