A church was erected on it, and subsequently the representative of the original purchaser conveyed the land to two persons as trustees of the Greek Catholic Church of Wilkes-Barre. At the time of the creation of the trust there were two separate and distinct religious organizations existing among the Slavonic people. One was known as the United Greek Catholic Church, which recognizes the religious supremacy of the pope and the second was known as the Orthodox Greek Catholic Russian Church, which recognized the religious supremacy of the czar. The first two pastors of the church at Wilkes-Barre were members of the United Greek Catholic Church, and conducted the services in accordance with the rules of that organization. The third pastor was when he was installed, a member of the United Greek Catholic Church, but subsequently he and the trustees renounced that organization and filed a petition in the court of common pleas with certain members of the congregation, praying that the church property should be conveyed to the petitioners, and to the bishop of the Orthodox Greek Catholic Russian Church, having jurisdiction over the United States. The prayer of this petition was granted. The evidence showed that a very large proportion of the members of the Wilkes-Barre church at the time of the creation of the trust were members. o.f the United Greek Catholic Church acknowledging the supremacy of the pope. A bill in equity was filed by the adherents of the United Greek Catholic Church to restrain the adherents of the Orthodox Greek Catholic Russian Church from continuing in possession of the church and from interfering in the conduct of the service. <em>Held </em>that the bill should be sustained.</p>

Quite a number of these immigrants settled in Wyoming valley in and around Wilkes-Barre, Kingston and other places where coal mining operations were being carried on. These immigrants who came from Hungary, Galicia and the western portions of Russia, that settled in and around Wilkes-Barre, naturally brought with them the desire to have some place of worship established where they might attend and worship God, according to the forms and manners that they had been accustomed to in their native countries. While all these people did not speak the same language or at least the same dialect, yet there was such a similarity in their various dialects, that most of them could understand each other; all or nearly all speaking the Slavonic language, though of course in different dialect according to the region from which they might come.</p>

Who then was the pastor in charge of this church and parish and to what church did he belong ? And what religion or doctrine did he teach ? The reply to this is not difficult. There is no dispute upon the point as to who was the pastor, none as to what church he belonged and verjr little that has any weight or is entitled to consideration as to the doctrines he taught.</p>

Toth. We are confirmed and strengthened in our belief that this trust was originally for the Greek Catholic Church as the United Greek Catholic Church by the action taken by Rev. Toth when he came to visit this congregation in December, 1892. The first thing he did or required of this congregation and the trustees, was to renounce their belief in the doetrinces and dogmas of the “ United Greek Catholic Church.”</p>
