In October, 1927, the borough council passed the ordinance here complained of, to annex the land of plaintiff township. Plaintiffs contended that defendant borough lacked power to annex land; the court below overruled this contention, saying, inter alia, “The defendants ground the annexation proceedings squarely upon the Act of [April 22,] 1903, [P.

L. 312, 427, 446, 455. In 1921, however, the legislature passed the Act of April 26,1921, P.

      <em>heretofore applied to, any boroughs incorporated under special acts of assembly and to which boroughs, as limited by the provisions of this section, this act does not apply.” </em>It is claimed by appellees that tbe effect of tbe above quoted provision of tbe Act of 1921 was to revive in defendaht borough the power of annexation given to it by the Act of 1903, notwithstanding the absolute repeal of that statute by the Act of 1915, and the court below sustained this contention, — a conclusion with which we cannot agree, because the complicated method of expression in the above quoted excerpt from the Act of 1921 tends to defeat itself, since it indicates an intention to accomplish by indirection an end forbidden by the Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.4",326,[307,1122,1150,1290]],["BL_327.1",327,[147,373,1152,1023]]]'>Article III, section 7, of the Constitution of 1873, prohibits the legislature from passing any local or special law regulating the affairs of boroughs or changing borough limits, and also from “indirectly enact [ing] such special or local law by partial repeal of a general law.” Piad the legislature, by the Act of 1903, attempted to stipulate that the power of annexation therein provided was given only to boroughs “incorporated under special acts of assembly,” such legislation would undoubtedly have fallen squarely within the constitutional prohibition just mentioned, unless all boroughs chartered by special acts of assembly could justifiably be considered as possessing in common peculiar conditions, differing from those prevailing in other boroughs, the existence of which conditions would warrant putting boroughs specially incorporated in a class by themselves for the purpose of regulatory legislation. The statement of such a classification shows its fallacy; for it is a matter of general knowledge that, prior to the Constitution of 1873, boroughs were incorporated indiscriminately by special acts of assembly, and that, in point of fact, boroughs thus formed are not possessed of conditions in common which so distinguish them from other boroughs as to warrant separate classification for pur<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>poses of legislation regulating their affairs. While the fact that numerous boroughs possess special charters meets with recognition in our written law, we find no legislation prior to 1921 attempting to group them as a separate class for legislative purposes; nor is that course warranted. Therefore, since the General Assembly could not legislate for boroughs incorporated by special acts of assembly alone, as a class, by granting to them powers not previously in any degree enjoyed (Georges Township School Directors, <a href="/pa/286/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="286 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1096468" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0129-01">286 Pa. 129</a>, 136-7), it cannot by indirection accomplish that which it is forbidden to do directly, as is attempted by the Act of 1921. The General Borough Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 519, 663, expressly repeals the Act of 1921, but section 106 of article I contains a saving clause as to boroughs “incorporated under special acts of assembly,” such as hereinbefore quoted from the Act of 1921 itself, so that a consideration of the Act of 1927 would not add anything to the present case.</p>
    <p id="b327-3" data-blocks='[["BL_327.4",327,[143,1408,1153,800]]]'>In November, 1923, section 34 of article III of the Constitution of 1873, was amended by providing that “the legislature shall have power to classify......boroughs......according to population, and all laws passed relating to each class......shall be deemed general legislation......but boroughs......shall not be divided into......more than three classes.” Such a classification according to population is the usual and well-recognized mode of dividing up municipalities for purposes of legislation regulating their affairs, and in Com. ex rel. v. Patton, <a href="/pa/88/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="88 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="1061212" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0258-01">88 Pa. 258</a>, 260, we said, “There can be no proper classification of cities or counties except by population.” It is not necessary, however, to apply that principle to this case, where the classification depended on is obviously unreasonable.</p>

Section 6 of article III of the Constitution of 1873, provides that “so much” <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>of any law as shall be “revived” or “amended” must be “reenacted and published at length” in the act which attempts to revive or amend the law in question. Here the act intended to be revived is that .of April 22, 1903, and the law attempted to be amended is that part of chapter 13, article I, (c), P. L. 446, 455, of the Act of 1915, which provides that, “The following acts and parts of acts of assembly are repealed in so far as they relate to boroughs, viz.: — ...... An act entitled ‘An act enabling the burgesses and council of any borough or incorporated town, by ordinance, to annex......territory ......,’ approved the 22d day of April, 1903 (P. L. 247),” yet nothing in the Act of 1903, or in the part of the Act of 1915 just quoted, is “reenacted” or “published at length” in the Act of 1921; on the contrary, the only previous legislation referred to in the Act of 1921, as intended to be affected thereby, is section 6, chapter 1, article I, of the Act of 1915. Appellees contend that, in this indirect way, the Act of 1903, specifically repealed by the Act of 1915, was impliedly revived by the Act of 1921; their theory, — also stated by the court below, — being that, “when an act repealing a former act is [itself] repealed, the original act is revived,” citing Directors of the Poor v. Ry. Co., <a href="/watts-serg/7/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 236" data-case-ids="481764" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0236-01">7 W. &amp; S. 236</a>, 237. But the Act of 1921 does not repeal the Act of 1915; it attempts to amend a part of the latter statute, which, as before shown, is not even the portion that directly repeals the Act of 1903. Such a course cannot be made effective by reliance on the principle, called to our attention by appellees, that implied amendments are not within the constitutional provision (Searight’s Est., <a href="/pa/163/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="163 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="859034" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0210-01">163 Pa. 210</a>, 216-17) noted at the head of this paragraph, and thus serve to confer on defendant borough the power which it for a time enjoyed under the Act of 1903, before the repeal of that statute by the Act of 1915.</p>
