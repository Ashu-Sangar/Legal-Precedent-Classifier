He had sold all the stock, fixtures, machinery and good will of his woodworking business to plaintiff, Vogt, under a written agreement dated September 14, 1925, for the sum of $5,000, $2,000 of which was paid in cash on the day of the agreement, $1,000 more was to be paid on January 1, 1926, and the balance, $2,000, on or before April 1, 1926. The installment which was to be paid on January 1st was not liquidated and on February 20, 1926, the parties entered into a new agreement under which Vogt released his title in the business, stock, good will, machinery and fixtures to Birch, it being stipulated that Birch should resell for the best figure he could obtain “and if the price obtained with apportionment of rent, interest, fire insurance, telephone and electric service bills, <em>is in excess of the amount due to date </em>to the said John Birch by the said John H. Vogt, the said excess amount shall accrue when paid, unto the <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>said John H. Vogt.” In other words, Birch had sold the business to Vogt for $5,000 and had been paid $2,000 on account. Vogt reconveyed to Birch for the purpose of reselling it and Birch was to account to Vogt for “the excess of the amount due to date” to Birch. Birch sold for $3,000, of which sum $200 was admittedly due to him for materials purchased since repossessing the business. We, therefore, have this situation: Birch sold to Vogt for $5,000 and was paid on account $2,000. On the resale, Birch receives $2,800 out of which he must pay Vogt, if the verdict in this case is to stand, $2,545.84. Which means that for the business which he originally sold to Vogt for $5,000, he will realize but $2,254.16. When Vogt’s side of the account comes to be stated, the result seems more inequitable so far as Birch is concerned. Vogt paid but $2,000 on account of the business. He was in control of it from September 14, 1925, to February 20, 1926, realizing on the verdict now in his favor he will get back the $2,000 he paid and $545.84 in addition. No such result we think could have been in the minds of the parties when they entered into the resale agreement and it should not be permitted to stand unless the language of the contract imperatively so requires and we are of opinion that it does not.</p>

He held that, “the amount due to date to the said John Birch by the said John H. Vogt” was $1,000 not $3,000. In his opinion, he says, “In writing this agreement it seems to us the defendant, if he had intended that he was to receive the $2,000, that is, the third payment which was not due, he would have <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>simply said 'due’ but he added the words 'to date,’ and that date was February 20, 1926, and the third payment of $2,000 was not due at that time.” This reasoning sticks too close to the bark and ignores the situation of the parties, the nature of the transaction, what the likelihood is of what they were seeking to accomplish (to save as much for both of them as was possible) and the usual and ordinary meaning of the word “due.” “The word 'due’ is used by judges, legislators and lexicographers as synonymous with 'owing’: Fulweiler v. Hughes, <a href="/pa/17/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="17 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="967602" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0440-01">17 Pa. 440</a>.
