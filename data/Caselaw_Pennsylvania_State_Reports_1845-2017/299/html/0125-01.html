He was suffering from a disease of one of the <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>kidneys, which had been progressively growing worse. As a result of a careful examination, his physicians concluded it was necessary to perform an operation, and that he was in a proper condition to have it done. They advised him of the necessity, that the operation would be a major one, consisting of the removal of the diseased kidney, and that he would have to be anaesthetized by a specified anaesthetic, which was considered to be the safest one known. The insured consented and selected the operating surgeon. The anaesthetic was properly administered and the operation skillfully performed, without any slip, mischance or mistake, and without resulting in a hemorrhage or shock. After it was completed and while the doctors were closing the wound, the patient suddenly stopped breathing, and all efforts to revive him failed. All the physicians testified that such a result was exceedingly rare, occurring perhaps once in a hundred thousand administrations; that the reason why it ever occurred was unknown; and that the death was known as an anaesthetic death, due to the hyper-susceptibility of the particular individual to the particular anaesthetic. No complaint is now made of anything that was done or left undone before, during or after the operation, but only that a death occurring under such circumstances was within the clause of the policy above quoted. To this we cannot agree. Before we apply the settled rule that a policy of insurance is to be so construed as to make certain that the beneficiary is not deprived of the indemnity provided for, we must first determine, under the plain language of the policy, if its language is untechnical and unambiguous, as here it is, what was the loss insured against: 14 R.

Nor, if appellant could escape this fact, would she be greatly helped, for decedent’s “bodily injuries [were not] effected directly and <em>independently </em>of all other causes” through such means. On the contrary, admittedly the effective cause was his hypersusceptibility to the particular anaesthetic. Defendant did not insure against a loss resulting from such a cause, yet admittedly it was at least a contributing cause of the death, which did not result “independently” of it; and this alone is sufficient to exclude liability under the policy.</p>

In that case plaintiff slipped on icy ground, and thereby sustained an injury to his abdomen, to recover for which that suit was brought. The casualty company defended on the ground that plaintiff had adhesions of the bowels, following a previous operation for appendicitis, and that, if those adhesions had not existed, the accident to the plaintiff would not have had any serious results. The jury were told “that the plaintiff could not recover unless the testimony showed to their satisfaction that the slipping of the plaintiff as described by him was the sole, efficient cause [of the injury]......and that no other cause contributed” thereto. The legal principle applicable to that situation was stated to be that “The phrase ‘resulting, directly, independently and exclusively in death’ refers to the efficient, or, as some courts speak of it, the predominant cause of death at the time it occurs. In other words, it means the proximate cause.” It will be noticed, however, that there the insurance <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>company could have ascertained the existence of the adhesions, if a proper examination had been made, while here plaintiff’s hypersusceptibility to the anaesthetic could not possibly have been discovered. It will be recalled also that here there was no accident, as that word is ordinarily used, but that the efficient, predominant or proximate cause of plaintiff’s death, was the hyper-susceptibility referred to, and without this the death would never have occurred.</p>

An operation was recommended for the removal of the diseased organ, and it was decided to use nitrous oxide and oxygen as an anaesthetic. The physicians made the usual preliminary examination of the patient and decided his physical condition was proper for an operation, and while his blood pressure was somewhat low, this was considered no cause for alarm, and did not in any way contribute to the result which followed. The anaesthesia was administered in the usual way by an expert and there was nothing in the inductive stage tending to show unusual circumstances or conditions in the patient, but, on the contrary, his reactions were normal and his pulse remained normal throughout the operation. Although at one time during the opera<a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>tion the patient experienced difficulty in breathing, this situation was relieved at once by removal of what was referred to as a shelf, placed under the patient’s abdomen for the purpose of rendering the kidney more accessible for the operation. After this device was removed or lowered the patient resumed normal breathing and further difficulty was not encountered until the completion of the operation and the operator was in the act of closing the wound, when the patient ceased breathing. He was immediately given artificial respiration and all known remedies were resorted to for reviving him but without effect. Three doctors who were present and assisted in the operation testified the anaesthetic was the cause of death. They testified further that such deaths were extremely rare and death was unexpected in this case, there being nothing in the patient’s condition to give warning. The testimony is that nitrous oxide and oxygen had been considered the safest anaesthetic known, and the only explanation the doctors could give was that the patient had “an intolerance or idiosyncrasy to the gas anaesthetic” and there was nothing in the reaction of the patient to indicate he had such idiosyncrasy which the doctors referred to as a condition and not a disease.</p>

A. Well, not necessarily so. It should be that way. If everything had been done beforehand to determine a man’s capability of taking an anaesthetic and, by all the rules that we observe we consider him a safe risk and then death would occur, why, I should say there is nothing more <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>that could be done, that it is unexpected.

Then do you mean by that that you cannot tell what was the cause of death in this case except that he died while under the anaesthetic? A. He died an anaesthetic death. Now, why he died an anaesthetic death, I don’t know. Q. Why do you say he died an anaesthetic death? A. Because he died of nothing else. Q. And that would be due to what? A. Do you mean other things he might have died of? Q. No, that he died an anaesthetic death? A. Because there was not any reason for the man to die and he did die that quick. The operation was done expeditiously, there was no hemorrhage, there was no shock. Ordinarily a kidney operation is an easy operation, and it was without any special technical difficulty and the man showed no evidence of doing badly from the operation. Why should he die? There was no bleeding and no rough manipulation to produce shock. I know he had no symptoms of shock. Now, why should he die? And he just died that quick. So it must have been an anaesthetic death. Q. Would that be due to some condition of the patient that you could not determine? A. Well, possibly so; I don’t know. To be candid, I do not know.

The happening of an event without the concurrence of the will of the person by whose agency it was caused; or the happening of an event without any human agency.’ In Anderson’s Law Dictionary, the following definitions of accident are given, with citation of authorities: ‘An event or occurrence which happens unexpectedly from uncontrollable operations of nature alone, and without human agency; .or an event resulting undesignedly and unexpectedly from human agency alone, or from the joint operation of both. An event from an unknown cause or an unusual or unexpected event from a known cause; chance, casualty.’ A definition corresponding substantially with those quoted above may be derived from our own case of North American Life and Accident Ins.

First, it was an unusual effect of a known cause, to wit, the administering of the anaesthetic preparatory to the operation.

Third, the result was not the natural and probable consequence of the drug, but it was unusual and wholly unexpected and could not have been reasonably anticipated. It is true the insured assumed all the <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>usual risks and dangers incident to the operation. Had death resulted from shock, for example, though the surgeon performed the operation in a skillful manner and without slip or misstep in the performance, and with full knowledge of all natural factors, such death would have been a probable consequence which, though not intended or expected, was one of the usual risks attending major operations and consequently one which the patient was bound to anticipate might occur. The evidence here, however, is that the operation did not in any respect contribute to the result except, of course, in so far as it made necessary administration of the anaesthetic as a preliminary step; and while it is true such-act was an intentional one performed in the usual manner, the unusual and unexpected feature of the case was the application of the anaesthetic, which it is conceded was as a rule harmless, to an individual who, unknown to the physician or the patient, had an idiosyncrasy or a hypersusceptibility to the drug, — a condition which was so rare and unusual that none of the doctors had observed it in his experience and which could not be predetermined by any known method. The result from such a cause was not a natural or a probable result of administering the drug, nor one which the patient was bound to anticipate, and was accordingly accidental.</p>

It was held that death resulted from external and violent causes, notwithstanding an express provision in the policy that it should not cover death resulting from inhalation of gas, this provision being construed to mean a voluntary and intelligent act by the insured and not an involuntary and unconscious one. It was stated in the opinion of the court (page 91) : “As was well said in Paul v. Insurance Co., <a href="/ny/112/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="112 N.Y. 472" data-case-ids="2219647" data-case-paths="/ny/112/0472-01">112 N.

In the majority opinion of the court it is stated that the injuries were not effected by the administering of the drug independently of all other causes, but that the cause was hypersusceptibility to a particular anaesthetic. This same reasoning, however, might be applied to the case of any injury which produces a result depending to some extent upon the physical condition or peculiarities of the person on whom the injury is inflicted. If, for instance, the individual had a latent disease or a weak heart an injury to such person might prove fatal, although in the case of an ordinary person it would not necessarily or even probably produce such result. In all such cases, applying the rule stated in the majority opinion, the question whether the injuries resulted from the blow independently of other causes would depend upon proof of the physical condition of the person rather than upon the nature of the injury. What seems to be the proper rule was stated in the case of Kelley v. Pittsburgh Casualty Co., <a href="/pa/256/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="256 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1030669" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0001-01">256 Pa. 1</a>, where plaintiff was injured by twisting his body in an unusual position in endeavoring to avoid a fall on slippery ground.

In the opinion of the court below, which was affirmed by this court on appeal, sustaining a verdict for plaintiff, it was said (page 6) : “ ‘If disease, while existing, be but a condition and the accident the moving, sole and proximate cause of the death, the exception in the policy will not relieve the insurer for death so caused......’ [Page 7:] The fact that the physical infirmity of the victim may be a necessary condition to the result does not deprive the injury of its distinction as the sole producing cause. In such case, disease [and] low vitality do not arise to the dignity of concurring causes, but, in having deprived nature of her normal power of resistance to attack, appear rather as the passive allies of the agencies set in motion by the injury...... Where accidental injury aggravated a disease, and thereby hastened death so as to cause it to occur at an earlier period than it would have occurred but for the accident, it is the direct, independent, and exclusive cause of death at that time...... The phrase ‘resulting directly, independently, and exclusively in death,’ refers to the efficient, or, as some courts speak of it, the predominant cause of death at the time it occurs. In other words, it means the proximate cause. ......It must be remembered that the policy is couched in language, chosen by the insurer, and must be given the construction, of which it is susceptible, most favorable to the assured...... Moreover, it is the duty of courts to give such construction to a policy, if the language used fairly admits, as will make it of some substantial value and carry out the intention expressed therein that liability is incurred where death occurs from accidental injury. If liability is to depend upon the physical condition of the assured as contributing in some degree to death, then it should be so stated plainly in the policy. We are of the opinion that the language <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>of this policy does not mean that there shall he no liability in case death results from the aggravation of a preexisting disease.”</p>
    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[274,524,1151,801]]]'>In the present case, the majority opinion states that the effective cause was the hypersusceptibility of the deceased to the particular drug. The obvious answer is that without the administering of the drug this latent susceptibility would never have harmed the insured, just as latent tuberculosis germs may exist in the human body without causing harm until a blow or injury arouses them into activity. The opinion of the court also states defendant did not insure against loss resulting from such hypersusceptibility of the insured. This same statement was, in our opinion, effectively answered in Kelley v. Pittsburgh Casualty Co., supra, by saying that the policy contained no clause limiting liability when the result of an accident is aggravated or contributed to by disease or bodily infirmities or peculiarities.</p>

There is no clause in the present policy, at least none appears in the part printed in the record, limiting liability to only such accidents, the result of which are in no manner affected by the presence of bodily ailments or idiosyncrasies, or such accidents as happen to persons who are physically sound and normal. It would be practically impossible to conceive of a serious injury to the body, the result of which is not in some manner contributed to by the age, physical condition or even mental attitude of the victim toward his injuries. Under the majority opinion an accident insurance company would no doubt be able to show in many cases, by <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>expert testimony, the existence of a contributing cause which helped produce the result, and thus escape liability. In my opinion the only logical construction is to hold that, in absence of an express provision in the policy, the doctrine of proximate cause must be applied and if the external force was the proximate cause of a specific result it is immaterial that a bodily condition or ailment existed which contributed in some measure to the result, or made the result possible.</p>
