A part of the consideration was to be satisfied by the assumption of an outstanding mortgáge on the land. Of the balance, due in cash, $1,000 was paid when the contract was signed, $4,000 the day after, and the balance at the time fixed for settlement. When the contract of sale was entered into, a pencil sketch of the property offered was exhibited to the vendee, upon which streets were marked, as the agent testified. Later, a draft was prepared which showed the possible subdivision of the tract into lots, which Andrien insisted was displayed to him before the purchase was made. The court, in its 13th finding, found the plot, last referred to, was submitted prior to the execution of the agreement, but, on exception, this conclusion was set aside. As we view the <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>case, this disputed question of fact is immaterial to a proper determination of the real controversy.</p>

It was not marked on the ground, and its existence was unknown to either of the parties to this proceeding. One end was closed by a fence, which had been in place for at least 40 years, and the right-of-way, 25 feet in width, was covered with trees and shrubbery. Because of this unextinguished easement, — for nonuser would not destroy it (Hall v. McCaughey, <a href="/pa/51/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="51 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="999805" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0043-01">51 Pa. 43</a>; Howell v. Northampton R. R.

It contained in all fifty six-hundredths of an acre, and passed through 11 of the paper lots marked on the plan finally prepared, which had an area of forty five-hundredths of an acre, making a total of one and one-hundredth acres affected by the unused roadway.</p>

The abatement in the amount of the consideration was deemed by Andrien to, be insufficient, and the parties agreed, on July 23, 1928, that $6,000 be deposited until the question of a proper allowance for damages sustained should be fixed by the court in a judicial proceeding; the amount found due, with interest thereon, to be turned back to the vendee, who paid the balance of the purchase money, and the remaining portion, if any, to the vendor.</p>

This is not so where the parties have expressly reserved their rights, as here, by agreement, or an express covenant to protect is inserted in the deed. The vendee may, however, insist that the vendor perform in so far as able where it is impossible for him to fully carry out his contract of sale, and, for this purpose, secure the aid of the equity court to force the delivery of a conveyance upon payment of the purchase price, less a just abatement from the consideration agreed on for the deficiency of title, quantity or quality of the estate: Burk’s App., <a href="/pa/75/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="75 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1036747" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0141-01">75 Pa. 141</a>; 25 R.

In the present case, the trial court first found that the land within the right-of-way, plus that contained in the 11 paper lots affected, amounted to one and one-hundredth acres of the entire 14 and a fraction, sold for $50,000, and allowed to the vendee a proportionate sum of this amount, with interest from the time the money was deposited with the trust company, as deductible compensation. On exceptions, the court in banc determined this sum did not fairly measure the loss. So that the proper amount could be arrived at, the decree first entered to No. 140, January Term, 1930, and now appealed from by Andrien, was set aside, and additional testimony taken to fix the damages.</p>

As to the last item, it is clear that the land outside of the right-of-way, marked out on the unrecorded plan prepared, but not staked off on the ground, could not be treated as so many separate subdivisions affected by the encumbrance.

Nor could the acreage within the right-of-way be regarded in assessing the damages as so many square feet of land taken, but the effect thereof on the property which it covered, as well as the disadvantages to all of that remaining, furnished the proper test.

After considering all the evidence, the court, as finder of the facts, and having before it sufficient proof to justify its conclusion, which makes interference with the determination impossible here, fixed $1,750 as the proper sum to be allowed, and directed, in its final decree, that this amount, with interest from July 23, 1928, the time of the deposit of the retained purchase money, be paid to the vendee, and the balance to the vendor.</p>
