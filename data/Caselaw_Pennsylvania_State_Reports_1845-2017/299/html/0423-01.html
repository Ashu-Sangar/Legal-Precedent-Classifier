He also avers that defendant had made default, in that he did not pay the rent due on the first day of March, 1928, or for ten days thereafter, as required by the lease, and that, because of this default, “the rent for the whole term became due and payable and collectible”; further, that defendant moved from the premises and took certain permanent fixtures therefrom, contrary to the terms of the lease. Finally, at the end of his averment of default, plaintiff gives credit for the $1,250 rent paid, as itemized in the endorsement on the lease (above recited), adding thereto an item of $368, “Proceeds from Landlord’s Warrant,” making in all $1,618, which he deducts from the above sum of $9,230, showing a balance of $7,612 due to him.</p>

Then the court correctly added: “The amount due not being ascertainable from the face of the instrument, the prothonotary could not enter judgment upon it;......the Act of 1806 gives him no power to inquire beyond” the information furnished by the instrument itself. These statements accord with the precise terms of section 28 of the Act of 1806 (4 Smith’s Laws, 270, 278) which reads as follows: “It shall be the duty of the prothonotary ......, on the application of any......holder......of a note......or other instrument......, in which judgment is confessed,......to enter judgment against the person or persons, who executed the same for the amount, which, from the face of the instrument, may appear to be due.”</p>

Halstead, <a href="/pa/73/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="73 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1032302" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0354-01">73 Pa. 354</a>, 357, that the Act of 1806 “does not confer upon the prothonotary all the powers of an attorney-at-law to confess a judgment, but only authorizes him......to enter a judgment......for the amount which from the face of the instrument may appear to be due [or] where the sum due can be ascertained by calculation from [information furnished by] the face of the writing. [The prothonotary’s power under the act] is not like the general authority of an attorney-at-law, who may appear and confess judgment and arrange the details of the judgment.” Again, in Whitney v. Hopkins, <a href="/pa/135/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="135 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="817420" data-case-paths="/pa/135/0246-01">135 Pa. 246</a>, 254, we said that, “If the amount due cannot be ascertained from the face of the instrument, <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>the prothonotary cannot enter judgment upon it, for the Act of 1806 gives him no power to inquire beyond.” Then, in Oberlin v. Parry, <a href="/pa/287/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="287 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="1099653" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0224-01">287 Pa. 224</a>, 228, considering this particular phase of the Act of 1806, we said that the authority there given to the prothonotary must “be strictly construed,” citing earlier authorities, and we added that the instrument upon which the prothonotary acts in entering the judgment by virtue of the authority vested in him under this statute, must contain sufficient “definite” information to bring it “within the provision of the statute,” and that, if such information does not “exist expressly or by clearest implication,” no judgment can be entered. By the expression, “clearest implication,” we mean an implication so clear that only one meaning can be taken from it. In the controversy now before us, the instrument relied on by plaintiff, from which the prothonotary was to gather information to calculate the amount of the judgment, fails to furnish the definite data required by the Act of 1806; for, as suggested in the above noted opinion of the court below, it is possible to make at least two inferences from the indefinite information furnished by the endorsement on this lease (counting that endorsement as information “on the face of the instrument,” within the meaning of the statute, as we shall do for the purposes of this case, though not deciding as a matter of law that it should be so considered). One possible inference is that the first payment of $150, on August 2,1927, established the rent at that rate as of August 1,1927, while another is that the payment in question represents, in part, rent in advance. The rent at $150 per month was, according to the lease, not to commence until the addition to the demised premises was completed, and, as before shown, the instrument on which the prothonotary acted in entering judgment contains no information on its face as to when this completion took place; therefore it furnished no definite information of a date from which to <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>calculate the increased rent, and thus to arrive at the total amount of the judgment.</p>

There Judge Henderson said: “No one could tell by an inspection......of the instrument [giving rise to the judgment]......what the rights of the plaintiffs and defendant were......on the day when the judgment was entered;......they could only be ascertained by an inquiry [aliunde the instrument itself]. This difficulty was recognized and an attempt was made to supply the lack of facts contained in the instrument by the filing of an affidavit made by one of the plaintiffs......
