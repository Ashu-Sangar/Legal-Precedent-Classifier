In creating a public highway the legislature intended that the rights of the public to its use and enjoyment should not be subjected to the uncertainty, of parol testimony. It is not pretended that the plaintiff in error acquired any right in the only form prescribed by the Act of Assembly for vesting the same in him. The court was therefore right in giving the jury binding instructions to find against him.</p>
