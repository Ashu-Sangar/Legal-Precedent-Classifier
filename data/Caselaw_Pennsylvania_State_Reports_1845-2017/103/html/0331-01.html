Judgment was recovered thereon by the Fidelity Insurance, &amp;c. Go. for $4,126, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. A writ of error wa,s then taken by said Koecker, and bail entered with two sureties in the amount of only $4,500, instead of double the amount of the judgment as provided by rule of court IV.</p>

He therefore dismissed the exceptions without calling on the bail to justify.</p>

L. 762, Purd. 605). And Buie of Court IV. provides that the recognizance shall be in double the amount of the judgment. The case of Hosie <em>v. </em>Gray (23 Smith, 502), is not an authority for the prothonotary’s decision, for in that case the mortgage expressly provided that there should be no personal liability on the part of the mortgagors, and that “ the lien and collection of the purchase-money shall be limited and restricted to the property covered <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>by and included in the mortgage.” This amounted to an express waiver of any other security for the payment of the mortgage-debt than, the land itself. The mortgagee, therefore, had no right to require bail'in error conditioned for the payment of that debt. The point has been expressly decided by the supreme court as lately as 1877. Admitting Hosie <em>v. </em>Gray to be an authority, it has been overruled: Brown <em>v. </em>Lovrein, 4 Weekly Notes 538.</p>

Smith 502, does rule, that, the recognizance of bail in error, where the proceedings were by scire facias on a mortgage, need not be in double the amount of the judgment. The mortgage, however, in that case stipulated that “ the lien and collection of the purchase-money shall be limited and - restricted to the property covered by, and included in, the mortgage.” It was, therefore, not only a proceeding in rem, but no other remedy could be invoked. There was no personal liability. The present case shows no such limited and restricted liability. It does not appear that other property may not be made liable for the debt secured by the mortgage. , Then, under the authority of Brown <em>v. </em>Lovrein, 4 Weekly Notes 538, due regard must be had to the sum recovered; as in a personal action. It was there said, “ prior liens, fire or failure of title, may make the delay a serious injury.” Be that as it may, we think the distinction, when the collection is restricted to the mortgaged property alone, rests on a substantial basis, and-should be recognized in determining the. sum for which the recognizance should be taken. - . , •</p>
