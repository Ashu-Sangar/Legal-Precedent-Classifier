    <p id="b569-7" data-blocks='[["BL_569.7",569,[200,835,1166,303]]]'>On the 25th of April 1879, such proceedings were had, that a paper was prepared for subscription to the bonds of the Lehigh Valley Iron <em>Go., </em>on the terms of the proposed reorganization and upon the basis and plan adopted at the meeting of April 15th 1879, providing for the unsecured creditors as contemplated according to that plan. In this paper it was, inter alia, stipulated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b569-8" data-blocks='[["BL_569.8",569,[201,1136,1164,173]]]'>“ This subscription is not to be binding, unless satisfactory arrangements are made for the reorganization of the company, and the transfer of the real and personal property, late of the said Lehigh Valley Iron Company, to the reorganized company.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b569-9" data-blocks='[["BL_569.9",569,[201,1306,1158,88]]]'>Upon this paper the present plaintiffs, S. A. Brown <em>&amp; </em>Bro., as creditors, subscribed for bonds to the amount of $1,750.</p>
    <p id="b569-10" data-blocks='[["BL_569.10",569,[198,1393,1166,215]]]'>Other meetings were subsequently held; the scheme for reorganization was finally perfected, and on the 1st day of July 1879, the property purchased by Balliet at the sheriff’s sale was formally transferred to the Coplay Iron Co., the new organization, and was delivered accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b569-11" data-blocks='[["BL_569.11",569,[195,1607,1167,687]]]'>Tin's transfer, and the entire scheme of reorganization, was effected by and with full sanction and authority of the directors of the Lehigh Valley Iron Co.; although it appears that the plaintiffs, one of the creditors, withdrew from the subscriptions they had made, and did not enter into the organization of the Coplay Iron Co., as they had agreed. Now, if these facts which appear in the testimony are true, and the transaction was unaffected by fraud, we think that as Aaron Balliet had parted with the property, in good faith, with the approval of the board of directors of the Lehigh Valley Iron Co., he could not in any sense be held as a garnishee, either for the property or the value of it, as he had neither the property nor the value of it, in his hands at the time of the service of the writ of attachment upon him. He held the personal property as a trustee for the company, and the transfer of it was with the company’s consent.</p>

Brown &amp; Bro. were of course not obliged to enter into the scheme of reorganization; they might, by issuing execution,-have seized the property in Balliet’s hands; they had a right to rely upon their rights as creditors, but they did not; on the contrary, they appear to have encouraged the reorganization based upon the transfer subsequently made.</p>
    <p id="b570-6" data-blocks='[["BL_570.6",570,[277,800,1168,386]]]'>It is objected,'however, that the “directors of a corporation are its agents, with limited power, having authority to do everything that is needful and proper to carry on its business ; to conduct its affairs in furtherance of the end of its institution, and for these purposes to control its property and assets. They have no right, without the sanction of the stockholders, to wind up the corporation, to destroy its business or to deprive it of property essentially necessary to carry out the purposes for which the company was organized.”</p>
    <p id="b570-7" data-blocks='[["BL_570.7",570,[272,1185,1170,386]]]'>It is certainly true, that the directors of a corporation have no right to sell or dispose of its movable property where this prevents the continuance of their business ; such a sale made by them is void as against non-assenting stockholders. But, if the stockholders are silent, make no objection whatever, by their acquiescence they will be taken as assenting. This proceeding is not by a stockholder, but by a stranger. How can creditors complain, if the stockholders are consenting to the negotiations ?</p>
