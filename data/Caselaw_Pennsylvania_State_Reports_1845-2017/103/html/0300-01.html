Then it is argued the exceptant will take the income absolutely under the general rule, that “ a devise of the rents, issues and profits of. land is equivalent to a devise of the land itself.” We have stated the rule of law as it was argued by the counsel to be, but there must be added to it this important qualification, that in order to carry the fee, a devise of the rents, issues and profits must be without limitation as to time of enjoyment or other conditions: Bentley <em>v. </em>Kauffman, 5 Norris <em>99; </em>France’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20220" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="25 Smith &amp; H. 220">25 Smith 220</a>.</p>

It follows, then, that John S. has no more right to the income from the coal lease than he would have to the proceeds of a sale of the entire land in case one had been made.

The word - income means the gain which proceeds from property, labor or business (Bouvier’s Law Diet.), and in its ordinary and popular meaning cóvers rents received from a coal lease. We have a right to presume that the testator understood and used it in that sense, and intended the first objects of his bounty to have the benefit of the rents during the existence of their estate. It is only by a strained and unnatural construction that the payment of legal interest on the installment of rent to the owners of the life estate can be held to satisfy the requirements of the will and the intent of the testator; when, as we said before, there is no provision, express or implied, that the rents shall be accumulated for those taking in remainder.</p>

The word'income means the gain which accrues from property, labor or business. In its ordinary and popular meaning, it is strictly applicable to the periodical payments, in the nature of rent, which are usually made under coal and other mineral leases, and we have no doubt it was used in that sense by the testator. In the absence of any provision, express or implied, that the payments in the nature of rent shall be accumulated for the -ultimate benefit of those in remainder, it would be a strained and unnatural construction of the will to hold that he intended to give appellants only the annual interest on the installments of rent. The fact that they are tenants for life by virtue of the will of the owner, and not merely by operation of law, as in the case of tenant by the ■ curtesy, &amp;e., must not <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>be lost sight of. In the latter case, the right of the life-tenant is absolutely fixed and determined by law, while in the former, the extent of the rights appurtenant to the life estate, must be determined by the will construed in accordance with the intention of the testator. If testamentary life-tenants are authorized by the will, creating their estate, to open and work new mines or quarries, or what is the same thing, to lease the minerals for that purpose, the remaindermen are necessarily without remedy for any in jury that may be thus done to their inheritance, because the will by which the life tenancy, with its incidents, was created is paramount, and they take, subject to all the rights and privileges of the life-tenant. The reason why tenants for life, as a general rule, cannot open and operate new mines, is because it would be a lasting injury to the inheritance ; but their right to operate previously opened mines, and work the same even to exhaustion, cannot be questioned : Neel <em>v. </em>Neel, 7 Harris 323 ; Irwin <em>v. </em>Covode, 12 Harris 162 ; Griffin <em>v. </em>Fellows, 32 P. F. Smith 114; Westmorelaud Coal Co.’s Appeal, 4 Norris 344. By empowering his executors, with the written consent of six-tenths of the owners, to lease the coal for mining purposes, the testator virtually gave appellants the same rights they would have had if the mines had been opened and operated in his lifetime. The instrument, by which their equitable life interest was created, authorized the leasing of the coal, and in the absence of any provision to the contrary, they are entitled by virtue of their life interest to participate in the proceeds or income accruing from the lease. As- has already-been observed, there is no provision for the investment of proceeds of the lease for the benefit of those in remainder. " In Daly <em>v. </em>Beckett, 24 Beavan 114, one of the questions was whether the power contained in the deed of settlement was sufficient to authorize the lease of unopened mines, and the other was whether the tenant for life was entitled to the proceeds of the mines opened under the lease, or only the interest thereon. After deciding the first point in the affirmative, and sustaining the lease, the Master of the Bolls says : “ With respect to the second point, as to how the produce of the mine is to be considered, I must treat it ... as if this was an ordinary power to lease the mines and minerals, in which case all the authorities establish this, that the produce of the mines is made part of the annual profits of the estate, and that whether in royalties, or in whatever other way it is produced, it forms part of those profits,” and it was accordingly held that “ the royalty reserved by the lease was in the nature of rent, and was payable to the tenant for life, and did not form corpus.”</p>

If, under the power contained in the will, the land, including the coal, had been sold, it will not be questioned that appellants would each have been entitled to the interest on one-tentli of the consideration money during the term of their natural lives respectively : and wé think it equally clear that when the requisite number of the beneficiaries under the will elected to avail themselves of the power given them to lease the coal, they are each entitled to one-tenth of the proceeds or income derived from the lease. In their ordinary signification, and as the testator himself doubtless intended they should be understood, the expressions, “ income arising from the same,” “ income arising from the tenth part of my estate,” and “ all the income arising from said portion,” as applied to a lease like the one before us, mean the current proceeds of the lease, and not the interest which would accrue from the investment of the proceeds.</p>

      <em>Wo </em>are not prepared to say there was error in refusing to hold that Thomas Eley, one of the appellants, took an estate in fee under his father’s will. It is impossible to mistake the intention of the testator in revoking and changing his bequest to his son Thomas, as he did in the codicil. Instead of giving him one share, absolutely, as he had done in the body of the will, he devised the whole to a trustee for the purpose of securing the payment of the income to Thomas during his natural life, and at his death, the conveyance of the corpus to those who may then, be his legal heirs. It is a mistake to suppose that the trust is not an active and continuing one. The legal title is vested in the trustee, and upon him are devolved active duties, such as the care and management of the estate, collecting and paying over <em>rents, </em>income, <em>&amp;c.</em>
