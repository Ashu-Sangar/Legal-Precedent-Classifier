In Stevens <em>v. </em>Martin, 6 Harris 101, a deed was acknowledged before a judge of the court of common pleas of Hunterdon county, New Jersey, on.the 26th of October 1796, and a certificate of this acknowledgment was made by the clerk of that court, on the 24th of October 1849. The deed being for lands in Pennsylvania, and offered in evidence in an ejectment tried in Mercer county, was objected to, and the objection overruled, and the deed admitted in evidence. The supreme court, in affirming the judgment, use this lánguage : “ The objection to the interval between the acknowledgment before the judge, and the date of the certificate of the clerk of the court, is not sneh as will vitiate it, and prevent the admission of the deed in evidence; circumstances may prevent the acknowledgment and certificate from being consecutive, and it is not essential they should be.”</p>

It has been uniformly held by the courts of this and other states that the taking of the acknowledgment .of a deed is a “ judicial act.” The statute requires the grantors to be present at the taking of the acknowledgment, but not at the certificate thereof ; the latter is a ministerial act; any person may draw the certificate ; the officer affixes his name to it as evidence that he has done flie judicial a'ct. The law requires a class of deeds to be acknowledged in open court. The judge holding the court takes the acknowledgment. This is the judicial act. The judge passes the deeds down to the clerk who makes the certificate. This is a ministerial act. The judge may discover the next day, or the next term, the clerk has made a mistake in the, certificate, and that it needs to be corrected to conform to the truth. The sheriff, or other person, who made the acknowledgment may not be present, or if present, may be unwilling to re-acknowledge. Can it be said.thatthe court, or the judge before, whom the acknowledgment was taken, is functus officio, .and is-without power to cause the correction ? Suppose the notary had made this discovery of the omission in his first certificate, immediately after he had signed it; will'it be doubted that he then had the power to insert the. missing words ? Or, that: he had power to erase the certificate he had made and attach another ? If so, when did his power cease until he eer<a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>tilled to the truth, as required by law to do, or until the rights of new parties intervened ? All the adjudged cases rest the sufficiency of the acknowledgment on the certificate of the officer, and not on the time when made. The acknowledgment, of the lease in question was certified according to law, and the controversy is between the original parties and affecting them only.</p>

All this granted, but her title does not pass by the certificate of acknowledgment. The title passes when slio acknowledges the instrument according to law, and delivers it. The instrument cannot be used as evidence of title until properly certified. The certificate showing the acknowledgment is essential only as rendering it evidence, in the same manner as affixing a revenue stamp required by the Act of congress was essential before permitting the instrument to be read. The absence of the stamp did not render it void. When this married woman with her husband signed the lease, acknowledged it according to law, and placed it in the hands of the notary to be certified and delivered to the lessee, her title passed.
