In such a case the presumption of payment from lapse of time, is not, in our judgment, a sufficient defence.] Here the defendants have appeared by counsel, have entered a plea, and have consented to amendments of the record. Under our practice there has been no time in the last twenty years when they might not have ordered the case on the trial list and have compelled a trial. For this reaspn, and because, during all this time, they have had notice and knowledge of suit pending, the doctrine of presumption of payment cannot now be invoked by them to prevent the revival of the judgment.

No further proceedings were had until 11th January 1882, when the cause was brought to trial. A period of twenty-six years from the entry of the judgment, and twenty-one years from the scire facias thereon, had elapsed before the trial; the delay to prosecute the claim for this great length of time, was not accounted for, nor any evidence given, of any fact or circumstance, by which this forbearance could be explained.

The scire facias at the date of its issue was an assertion of the debt on the part'of the plaintiff, but the plea of payment was an undoubted denial of it, on the part of the defendant, and that denial was in the direct line of the presumption which afterwards arose. The scire facias was issued to revive the judgment and continue the lien, the defendant, inter alia, pleaded payment, and in the face of this plea the plaintiff not only failed to revive the judgment, within the five years allowed by law, but suffered the judgment to lose its lien altogether, and twenty-one years to elapse without any effort or act of his, in further assertion of his claim.</p>
