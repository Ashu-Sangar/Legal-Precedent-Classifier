To avoid confusion of expression, we will first determine the inquiry as • to the “ penalty ” of $1,000, first mentioned in the agreement. This is a question of construction, and is to be determined by the intention of the parties, as that may be found in tlie language of the agreement itself, and in the subject matter out of which the agreement came. There has been some inconsistency or conflict in the decisions, on the question raised here, but the later cases in this court, when properly understood, we think, have to a great extent, reconciled these differences. It is true, that every such contract, as indeed almost any other contract, must stand for its construction upon its own peculiar facts, and the conflict in principle is oftentimes more in appearance merely than in reality.</p>

The parties themselves denominated it a penalty, and it would require very strong evidence to authorize the court to say that their own words do not express their own intention.”</p>

The contract should be expressed, or it should be a necessary implication from the nature of the transaction itself.

The concurrent declarations of the parties are inadmissible,except to show mistake or fraud, and neither is here alleged.

Tyson.” The consideration of the obligation was not stated in the writing, nor was there any other <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>writing shown in evidence disclosing the consideration ; the bond was in the ordinary form, and the condition was in the words above stated ; the seal, of course, technically imported a consideration sufficient to enable the plaintiff to recover, but upon its face it was a penal bond, the sum stipulated was, prima facie, onty a penalty, and it therefore devolved upon the plaintiff to show actual damage, or that from the nature and circumstances of the transaction, the face of the obligation was to be treated as an adjudication. The plaintiff testified that he paid a full consideration, that he agreed to give, and did give the defendant $1,100 over what the property was worth, as a consideration for the bond ; this the defendant denied, and as the fact wras most material, it should have been submitted to the jury. The truth or falsity of the plaintiff’s- statement was for the jury ; if true, its effect was for the court. There was no fact found, except such as appeared upon the face of the bond; nothing was submitted, the' court instructed the jury that the sum designated in the bond was to be deemed and treated as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty. The court either usurped the function of the jury, by assuming the truth of the facts alleged by the plaintiff, or regarded them as immaterial. If it were true that Tyson paid a full consideration for the bond, a consideration equal to the amount expressed upon its face, it would certainly have justified the conclusion that the sum set down in the bond was an adjustment of the damages for its breach, but of this the court was not informed, and could only be informed through the instrumentality of the jury.</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[258,1568,1167,211]]]'>Thus the construction of an agreement is, in all cases, a matter of law for the court; the truth of the facts bearing, on that construction is for the jury, whilst the force and effect of those facts upon the construction, are for the court in their instruction to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.6",358,[258,1780,1166,431]]]'>In the case in hand, $1,000 is denominated a penalty, and it is provided that “ in case either party fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement, he shall forfeit and pay to the other the sum of $1,000.” It is improbable that they meant to set up two penalties or forfeitures of the same or different character, for the same violation, therefore, we assume that the sum denominated “ a penalty of $1,000 ” and the $1,000 which “either party” is to forfeit and pay, are the same, and that the clause quoted was merely intended to apply the penalty to both parties to the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b358-7" data-blocks='[["BL_358.7",358,[263,2207,1163,218]],["BL_359.1",359,[216,414,1165,601]]]'>The terms of the agreement, on one side, required of Allahough the payment of the money only, on the other they required of March, delivery of the goods sold, and the performance of the covenants recited in the clause quoted at the opening of this opinion. It will be observed, therefore, that the <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>damages for breach of the agreement by Allabough were necessarily certain and easily and readily ascertainable by calculation, and that the damages for breach of the sale and delivery of the goods by March were also capable of easy adjustment. And although the damages for violation by March, of that part of the agreement in which he bound himself not tc engage in, or open a store in Morristown, noith-west of Stony Creek, are altogether uncertain, are not susceptible of definite proof or capable of any easy adjustment, yet the facts are controlling, that the parties denominated the sum in the bond as a penalty, and that the stipulations of the agreement were various, to some of which the damages might be considered liquidated, and to others necessarily unliquidated, the stipulated sum being made payable on a breach of any of them.</p>
    <p id="b359-6" data-blocks='[["BL_359.6",359,[216,1016,1159,171]]]'>The testimony as to the declaration of the parties prior to, and at the time of the execution of the bond, even if they had been admissible, established nothing more than appeared upon the face of the bond, but they were clearly inadmissible.</p>
    <p id="b359-7" data-blocks='[["BL_359.7",359,[214,1187,1162,128]]]'>We are clearly of opinion that this sum of $1,000, under the evidence before the court, should have been held to be a penalty and not liquidated damages.</p>
    <p id="b359-8" data-blocks='[["BL_359.8",359,[212,1315,1163,432]]]'>We are also well satisfied that the second sum of $1,000, under which March bound himself, not to lease the new store building, on the corner of Marshall and Chain streets, to any person carrying on the same business, was also a penalty. It was not only denominated as such, but March bound himself “under the samé penalty of $1,000.” The word, “same,” clearly refers to the previous sum which we have found to be a penalty merely. If, therefore, he binds himself with reference to the store room “ in the same penalty,” the latter sum must necessarily be taken as a penalty also.</p>
