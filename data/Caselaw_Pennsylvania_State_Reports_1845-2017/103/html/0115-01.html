    <p class="summary" id="b132-6" data-blocks='[["BL_132.6",132,[241,785,1182,1014]]]'>“ There are two questions which you will have to determine. First, whether the leaf tobacco was sold to be paid for in money, or in cigars. If you find that it was to be paid in cigars, then you should render the verdict accordingly. '[Secondly; whether the $650 note was an accommodation note, that is, given by Mr. Roig to Mr. Ertheiler merely as a loan by the former to the latter, to accommodate the latter; or whether it was given in part payment of the tobacco. If it was given as part payment-you should deduct the amount of the note from the amount you would otherwise find to be due by Mr. Roig to Ertheiler. If you find, however, it was an accommodation note, then as it did not mature until some time after the service of the attachment, and was not paid by Mr. Roig before its maturity, the note cannot be offset against the, fund or property attached, for the reason that the attachment operates as a legal assignment of the money or property attached to the attaching creditor, the moment the attachment is served on tlie garnishee. The note not having been paid at or before that time, by Mr. Roig, it could not be set off against the plaintiff’s attachment, served several months before the payment of the note. If the note was an accommodation note there was no right of demand by Mr. Roig against the accommodation payee, until after the latter had neglected to provide for the note in the hands of his indorsee. ■</p>

Even if Ertheiler was ever liable to Roig on it, it conld only be after its maturity and payment by Roig.
