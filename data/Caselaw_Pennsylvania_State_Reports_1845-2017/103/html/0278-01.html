Chase <em>v. </em>Harding, 6 Nor. 343. We contend that when a county is brought within one of the classes named in the “ Salary Act ” of 1876 by that certain enumeration ascertainable only from the last preceding decennial census, she must stay there until a like subsequent enumeration raises her to a higher class, or, as the case may be, sinks her beyond the reach of the Act altogether. This view is not affected by the “ New county Act” of April 17th 1S78, which merely directs the commissioners “to estimate as nearly as possible,” the population of the proposed new county district. Such “ estimate ” for a special legislative purpose, cannot be availed of by a court to impair a vested individual right, accruing under a prior and positive law.</p>

As the new county erected in 1878, “ had a population of 80,000 inhabitants” (Case stated § 3) it follows that by the same census of 1870, Luzerne county had, after the separation, in legal contemplation of the Salary Act, less than 150,000 inhabitants.

    <p id="b297-9" data-blocks='[["BL_297.9",297,[198,909,1174,345]]]'>This Act is general in its terms. It is designed to apply to counties then containing the requisite population, and also to those which might thereafter acquire it. Whenever an effort is made to apply this Act to an officer of any particular county, the fact to be ascertained is whether the county contained sufficient population at the time the officer entered on the duties of his office.

Without any increase of population in the meantime, that would have reduced it in the portion of territory remaining in the comity of Luzerne, to less than 81,000. In the case stated, the plaintiff does not aver, and the defendant does not admit, any increase of population. In the absence of any such agreement, the plaintiff asks us to assume that the original county had increased its population 69,000. An increase of more than 42 per cent, in eight years. Or if the increase was not so much at that time, yet that the superadded increase in the reduced comity of Luzerne prior to the 1st of January, 1880, brought it up to the 69,000.</p>
