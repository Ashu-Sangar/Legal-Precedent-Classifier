The record fails to disclose that such notice was given. By reason of there being no service and no publication the court did not acquire jurisdiction, and the entry of judgment, and subsequent sheriff’s sale were without authority of law, and no title passed at the sheriff’s sale.

He buys under the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and that judgment includes within itself a presumption that all formal prerequisites haye been complied with. In this case it is- aslced that nineteen years after a judgment and sheriff’s sale, said judgment and sale shall be declared illegal and void, not as against an original party to the suit, but as against the holder, under a sheriff’s, sale, after three intermediate conveyances between the original sheriff’s vendee and the present holder, because of a supposed irregularity in the sheriff’s return to the writ.

Judgment was signed in default of an affidavit of defence, execution issued whereon the sheriff: sold the premises, and on October 22d 1864, executed a deed to the purchaser. The sole question is whether the judgment was void; for if void, the purchaser acquired no title, if voidable only, his title is as good as if the judgment were unassailable.</p>

But no presumptions in support of a judgment are allowed in opposition to any statement made in the record. If it appear that process was served in a particular mode, no other and different service can be presumed, for such presumption would contradict the record, which imports verity. When, therefore, the record shows that certain steps were taken to procure jurisdiction, and those steps are insufficient, the judgment is void for want of jurisdiction over the defendant or subject: Freeman on Judgments, §§ 124, 125.</p>

The record shows that the writ was not served as directed by law, and the judgment would have been reversed on writ of error: Wister <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/86/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="86 Pa. 215" data-case-ids="1056585" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0215-01">86 Pa.

But was due notice of the writ so essential that the judgment was void? This is answered by a case decided in 1858, directly upon the very point: Delaney <em>v. </em>Gault, <a href="/pa/30/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="30 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="415613" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0063-01">30 Pa.

There <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>the record showed the same service as here, with precisely the same defects or omissions, and the judgment was held valid .After observing that the jurisdiction of the court attached upoD the filing of the claim, this court said : “ After judgment upon the scire facias it is too late to inquire in any collateral proceeding, into the sufficiency of the sheriff’s return of service of the writ, or whether service has been properly made, if it be re-1 turned. . . A purchaser at sheriff’s sale under a judgment obtained in a scire facias on a municipal claim, is no tbound to show that the Acts of Assembly have been strictly complied with. In regard to all that he is protected by the judgment. . . He buys under the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, a judgment which includes within itself an adjudication that all formal prerequisites have been complied with.” That decision, has remained unshaken, and has been authority for the belief by all interested persons, that a sheriff’s sale and deed under a judgment upon a municipal claim, vested good title in the purchaser, although the record showed that the scire facias had'not been served as directed by, the statute. To overrule it, without doubt, would destroy many titles heretofore supposed to be perfect by purchasers. We are not convinced that this should be done.</p>
    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[270,1383,1171,1070]],["BL_193.1",193,[197,421,1164,300]]]'>Under the statutes as they existed in 1864, it was unnecessary to náme the owner in the claim, or process. Costs were made, often without reason, to the oppression of owners of lots, who, in some instances,, would learn of the proceedings in time to prevent a sale, and in other instances owners were despoiled of their property for want of knowledge. For remedy of grievances the Acts of March 23d 1866 (P. L. 303), and of March 29th 1867 (P. L. 600), were enacted, and since, no property returned and registered, shall be subject to sale for municipal claims, “ except in the name of the owner as returned, and after recovery by suit and service of the writ as in the case of a summons:” Simons <em>v. </em>Kern, <a href="/pa/92/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="92 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="490979" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0455-01">92 Pa. St. 455</a>. In that case Justice Stjbbrett referred to the distinction between irregularities in the conduct of a suit, which do not strike at the foundation of authority for a sheriff’s sale, and the absence of authority either to enter judgment or to issue a writ to sell the property. But the legislature has not prohibited sale in all cases where the owner of the property is not named in the proceedings, and where the scire facias has not been served in the same manner as the service of a summons. If the owner neglect to make return to the proper office for registry, he still risks the sale of his property upon a municipal claim, without notice to himself and without the name of the owner in the record. Where the record shows a defective service, a judgment by default may be reversed, but <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>not declared void, in a collateral proceeding. This case is not controlled by the statutory prohibition of the sale of the property of a minor, or of the issue of legal process against a soldier, or of the sale of the property of a registered owner without naming him in the suit and service of the writ as provided for the service of a summons ; and decisions relating to such statutes have little, if any, application.</p>
