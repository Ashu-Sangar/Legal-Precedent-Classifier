Messrs. Burton and Michie, who represented both Mrs. Young and the children above named of deceased sisters, argued with much force in favor of the claim of the latter, basing their argument, chiefly upon the provisions of the Act of May 6th 1844, section 2, Purdon, page 1476, pi. 15, passed to prevent the lapse of a legacy to a brother or sister, nephew or niece in the case of the death, of the legatee in the lifetime of the testator, but while much may be said in favor of the position taken, the auditing judge is of opinion that the act of Assembly does not help the children of a deceased child of Robert Gay, claiming in the present case.</p>

That part of the will, which is material to this case reads thus : t; Item 8. I give and bequeath unto each of the children of Robert Gay, of Augliedella, county of Tyrone, and Eliza his wife, formerly Eliza Stewart, who may apply for the same within twelve months after my decease, the sum of two thousand dollars.” There was also a codicil to this will, dated June 21st 1879, as follows : “ Second, in explanation of item 8, of my will, I further direct that as to such of the children of Robert Gay as shall fail within twelve months of my decease to communicate, by writing, information of their existence and whereabouts to my executors, the legacy to them thereafter shall be treated as can-celled.” On behalf of the appellants, it is contended, that they are entitled to take the bequests to their parents, by virtue of <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>the second section of the Act of May 6th 1844, .in and by which the legislature speaks in this manner : “ No devise or legacy hereafter made in favor of a brother or sister, or the children of a deceased brother or sister of any testator, such testator not leaving any lineal descendants, shall be held or deemed to lapse or become void by reason of the decease of such devisee or legatee in the life-time of the testator, if such devisee or legatee shall leave issue surviving the testator; hut such devise or legacy shall be good and available in favor of such surviving issue, with like effect as if such devisee or legatee had survived the testator, saving always to every testator the right to direct otherwise.” It is seriously contended that this part of the statute covers every point claimed by the appellants. “ <em>(a.) </em>These are legacies in favor of the children of a deceased sister of the testator. (5.) The testator did not leave any lineal descendants, <em>(a.) </em>Four of the legatees died in the lifetime of the testator, <em>(a.) </em>Three of the deceased legatees have left issue surviving the testator; viz., these appellants. <em>(e.) </em>The execution of tlie will was subsequent to the enactment of the statute, and hence subject to its provisions.”</p>
