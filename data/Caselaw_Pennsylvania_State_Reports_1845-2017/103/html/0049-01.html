This is a well settled rule of law in Pennsylvania: Shnyder <em>v. </em>Noble, 13 Norris 286. In this ease it was said “a bond secured by mortgage is part of tbe mortgage, and must be regarded as one or more of the conditions of that instrument put, for the sake of convenience and more ready enforcement, into the shape of a bond.” It was true this was said in a case of purchase money for land — the only ease in which a married woman can bind herself by bond — but where she borrows money <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>to improve her own estate, or to secure money loaned to her husband, or for the payment of his debts, her bond and mortgage are valid, and they form one instrument or obligation as much as if given for purchase money, and I am unable to see why her confession or judgment in the bond is not equally valid. A judgment entered upon it would be a lien only on the land described in the mortgage — that is, no other land belonging to her, would be bound by it, and a sale, made under such judgment, would convey all the interest that a sale would, on the mortgage, for the reason that “the bond secured by the mortgage is a part of the mortgage,” and if suit could be maintained on the bond, I see no want of power’, on her part, to give a valid warrant of attorney; and as Judge <em>Gordon </em>said, in the caso already referred to, “we cannot understand why such conditions may not be enforced as well when contained in the bond as when written in the mortgage itself.” The mortgage was given to better secure the payment of the bond, and the power to confess jndgment was no greater exercise of power than to obligate herself to pay money. I have been of this opinion for years, and although some doubt has been raised by the individual expression of opinion by some of the judges of the Supreme Court, I do not understand that court to have decided different from what is here indicated, and I think their ruling in the distribution of the fund, raised by the sale mentioned in the affidavit of - defence. is a substantial determination of the validity of the sale on.the jndgment entered against Wells and wife on the bond, secured by the mortgage in this suit. At least, it is my opinion that such sale vested in Gr. H. Tandyke, all the title that Wells and wife had in the land, and'hence this proceeding on the mortgage is unnecessary.</p>

The question is whether the voluntary confession of judgment by a married woman contained in the -joint bond of herself and husband, which accompanies her mortgage of her real estate, for-borrowed money, duly executed, is valid, as' against the mortgaged premises, so as to sustain a sheriff’s sale <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>upon execution issued upon such judgment. The agreement of Mr. Vandyke to release the bond upon a sale of the mortgaged premises upon the mortgage, will not of course be held to discharge the debt, if the sale upon the bond was not a valid sale. If the sale upon the bond was valid, it is conceded that no judgment can be rendered for the plaintiff. No decision of this court has been found which rules this case. The judgment upon the bond cannot be sustained merely because the confession of judgment is the joint confession of husband and wife. Such confession is of no validity as to the wife : Shallcross <em>v. </em>Smith, 31 P. F. Smith 132; Keiper <em>v. </em>Helfricker, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20325" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Wright 325">6 Wright 325</a>. Nor can it be sustained merely because the married woman might be compelled by resort to an appropriate remedy to pay the debt: Keiper <em>v. </em>Helfricker, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20325" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Wright 325">6 Wright 325</a>. A judgment in a personal action can be obtained against a married woman only for necessaries contracted for by herself, or in some of the cases enumerated in the Act of Assembly, and ,thc facts to fix her liability must affirmatively appear on tile record, otherwise the judgment is void: Huguss <em>v. </em>Dithridge Glass Co., 15 Norris 160; Hecker <em>v. </em>Haak, <em>7 </em>Norris 238; Steinman <em>v. </em>Henderson, 13 Norris 313; Schriffer <em>v. </em>Saum, 31 P. F. Smith 385. It is said in the following cases that a married woman’s confession of judgment is void except in the single case of a debt for purchase-money of laud, and then valid only as against the land purchased : Brunner’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%2067" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="11 Wright 67">11 Wright 67</a>; Quinn’s Appeal, 5 Norris 447; Shnyder v.

The cases settling the liability in the present instance are Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 Casey 81; Ramborger <em>v. </em>Ingraham, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20146" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Wright 146">2 Wright 146</a>. In the first ease the ruliug is put upon the principle, that as a married woman has power to purchase, her application to deprive the creditor of hissecurity for the purchase-money, could not be granted as to the lands purchased. In the second case it was put upon the ground that the conveyance and the lien for the unpaid purchase-money, are one transaction, and both benefit and burden must be treated as valid. Other, grounds on which these cases are based have been denied, and Judge Strong, in Brunner’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%2067" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="11 Wright 67">11 Wright 67</a>, after criticising these cases, said: “It matters not whence comes her power to bind land which she lias purchased by confessing a judgment. It is enough that it is settled that slie has power to confess a judgr ment in this one case.” In Schlosser’s Appeal, 8 P. F. Smith 493, Judge Sharswood said : “ The cases which permit a married woman to bind her separate property, are exceptions to a general rule of sound policy, and ought to be strictly confined, within the limits prescribed. If we begin to reason on the abstract justice of making her property answerable for her honest debts, the exceptions will soon eat out the rule-itself!” ’</p>

The confession of judgment is in furtherance of the remedy for <em>the </em>collection of the mortgage, is in recognition of a liability which the law has imposed in the creation of the pledge which has been made in the exercise of an undoubted legal right, and has the effect to enable the'Creditor to accomplish amicably and with little expense the same result which otherwise must be reached by adverse and- more expensive process.

The reasoning upon which these cases are based is that what the married woman may do directly, she may do indirectly: that power to convey includes the power to convey upon condition, and power to convey upon condition implies power to prescribe the terms; that the creation of a power of sale in an <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>agent or creditor, which is permitted, implies a right to vest the same authority in officers of the law, through legal forms, and that she should be permitted to do that voluntarily in furtherance of remedy, which she is legally bound to submit to, and which creates no new liability.</p>

The only question now is, was the case, as presented in the affidavit of defence, a proper one to be sentó a jury. The position of Amelia Wells at each stage of the transaction must be regarded. Prior to July 2d 1873, she could clearly have avoided her agreement of September 1872. But the only consideration for the mortgage, of July 3d 1873, was a past consideration, and a married woman cannot enlarge her contractual powers by mortgage (except for purchase money of real estate), so as to subject herself to forbidden liabilities: Wolbach <em>v. </em>Building Ass'n, 3 Nor. 214; Schlosser’s Appeal, 8 P.

The real estate of the wife was sold upon execution on this judgment, and purchased by the plaintiff in the judgment. Subsequently a scire facias was issued against the wife and her husband, on the mortgage, which was given with the bond to secure its payment. Against this scire facias the defendants interpose an affidavit of defence alleging that the bond and mortgage were given to secure the payment of $5,757.28 borrowed by the defendants from the mortgagee, that the money was loaned upon a bond accompanying the mortgage and bearing the same date, a copy' of the bond being annexed, that it contained a clause authorizing the entry of judgment, upon which judgment was entered, execution issued and the land described in the mortgage was sold to the mortgagee for $4,000, the said sum being received by the mortgagee <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>■less the expenses of sale. The affidavit further alleged that the mortgagee by an agreement attached to the bond and signed by him, agreed that in the event of a sale of the premises upon ■the mortgage, and of the mortgagee’s receiving all of the money arising from the sale, he would release the payers of the bond from the further payment of any sum remaining due upon the bond ; that the mortgagee did receive the full proceeds of the sale and therefore the bond and mortgage became extinguished and void.</p>
    <p id="b74-4" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[304,788,1178,1357]]]'>So far as the effect of this annexed agreement is concerned we do not see how it can operate as a defence to this action, for the reason that it was only to become effective in the event of a sale <em>upon the mortgage. </em>There has never been a sale upon the mortgage, and hence, literally, the agreement to release has no operation. Of course if a sale upon the judgment entered on the bond had the same legal effect in divesting the title of the mortgagors as a sale upon the mortgage, it could be argued with great, and possibly with controlling force, that the remander of the debt was extinguished by force of the provision for a release. But we are very clearly of opinion that the sale under the judgment had no such effect. It was a judgment against a married woman and her husband. It was good enough against the husband but it had no validity, against the wife,, and the title to the land was in the wife. The title was somewhat curiously complicated by the fact that the wife and her husband had made a deed for the ground — about a quarter of an acre of land in the country — to the mortgagee, who in turn executed and delivered an agreement to the grantors, by which he undertook to reconvoy the promises to them, upon their paying to him certain advances to the extent of $3,000 which he agreed to make, for the building of a mill upon the land. It was agreed between the parties that these papers should constitute a mortgage, and in the following year a mortgage was actually executed by Wells and wife to Vandyke, treating the title as in the wife. It was upon this mortgage t.he present writ of scire facias was issued. The transaction therefore was, what the parties agreed in writing and under seal it should be, a bond and mortgage to secure the payment of a loan of money to the wife. On this bond the judgment was entered, on which execution was issued and the premises sold as set out-in the affidavit of defence.</p>

The circumstance that the money borrowed was obtained for the improvement of the land of Mrs. Wells is of no consequence. It was, nevertheless, a loan of <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>money for which the bond was given, and that fact avoids it without any regard to the use to which the money was put. Thus in Keiper <em>v. </em>Helfricker, 6 Wr. 325, it was held that where a married woman gave a judgment bond to one who advanced her money, to be applied, at the time, for the purchase of real estate by her, for her sole and separate use, and which was in fact so applied, the bond so given was void and could not be enforced against lier separate estate. Head, J., on p. 329 said, “ The bond and warrant of attorney being those of a married woman, were absolutely void, and, of course, the judgment upon the bond was a nullity as against her.” He further said that the bond, warrant and judgment “would not be good even though given for debts contracted before marriage, or for necessaries for the support and maintenance of her family.” This was directly held in the case of Glyde <em>v. </em>Keister, 8 Cas. 85, and in Caldwell <em>v. </em>Walters, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.W.%20Harr.%2079" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="6 W.W. Harr. 79">6 Harr. 79</a>, it was held that not only was the bond and warrant void as to the wife, but that a sale of her real estate upon the judgment entered on the bond, and the purchase of it during coverture by the plaintiff in the judgment, did not divest her title. These eases have never been departed from. The ease of a bond given by a married woman directly for the payment of purchase money of real estate conveyed to her as a part of the same transaction, is the one exceptional case, in which the instrument is treated as valid and made effective against the land sold, but no further: Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 Cas. 81; Ramborger <em>v. </em>Ingraham, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20146" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Wright 146">2 Wright 146</a>. The reasoning of those eases is perfectly familiar to the profession, and it is unnecessary to repeat it here. In Brunner’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%2067" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="11 Wright 67">11 Wright 67</a>, we held that a judgment given by a mairied woman for a debt contracted for the improvement of her real estate is void. Strong, J., on p. 73, said that the judgment bond given by a married woman for the purchase money of real estate was the single exception to the rule of invalidity, admitted in this state : and on p. 75 he said that had the land of the wife in that case been sold upon the judgment no title would have passed. Our brother Tbunkey, in delivering the opinion of this court in Hecker <em>v. </em>Haak, 7 Norris on p. 242, said, “ She cannot give a valid warrant of attorney to confess judgment, even for a debt contracted by herself for necessaries used by herself and family. A judgment on such warrant, though in legal contemplation the judgment of the court, is a nonentity. The only exception is where the warrant and judgment are for purchase money of real estate conveyed to her, which may be enforced against the land itself, but not against her other lands or goods.” lie also held that a sale of the wife’s land upon a void judgment was a nullity and passed no title. In Quinn’s Appeal, 5 Norr. 447, Woodward, J., said on p. 452, <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>“ A judgment confessed by a married woman can be enforced in the single instance where, when a conveyance is made to her, it forms part of an-agreement under which she takes land subject to the condition that she shall pay its price.” The case of Shnyder <em>v. </em>Noble, 13 Norr. 286, upon which the learned judge of the court below ruled this case for the defendants, is no exception to the rule. There the bond was given directly for purchase money of land conveyed to the wife. There was also a mortgage to secure the bond, and both instruments were executed by the husband and wife. It is true the action was debt on the bond, and it was held that the circumstance that there was no warrant of attorney, and confession of judgment, did not affect the case. It was the bond, or rather the contracting power to make the bond, that gave validity to the warrant, and not the power to make the warrant that gave validity to the bond. Judge Gordon said what had been so often said before, that the bond “still would remain a bond for purchase money, the single and only case in which a married woman has power to execute such an instrument.” Whether the peculiar conditions of the transaction were incorporated in the bond or in the mortgage made no difference, since botli were given for the same purpose. In no respect was this case intended to chango the existing law. It remains as before. Entertaining these views, we are of opinion that the learned judge of the court below was in error in refusing judgment under the rule for that purpose, and the case must, therefore, be reversed.</p>
