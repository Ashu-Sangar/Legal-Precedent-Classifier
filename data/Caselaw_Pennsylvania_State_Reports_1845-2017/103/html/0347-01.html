About fourteen hundred pupils are taught in these schools. In former years, for the purpose of securing greater efficiency in the schools of the district, the board of directors elected a “ superintendent ” of the schools. It seems to have been bis duty to exercise a general supervision, to advise and instruct the teachers, to see that the pupils are properly classified and the schools graded, to fill the place of any teacher temporarily absent, to attend, to supplies that might be. required, to report to the board, from time to time, as to the condition of the schools and the efficiency, of the teachers, and generally to do whatever was required to secure efficient and uniform modes of teaching. During the past year the board of directors elected John O.

On the contrary, both may be exercised in entire harmony aud with evident advantage to the cause of education. The work of a county superintendent, scattered over a territory as large as the county of Schuylkill with its population of 130,000, is necessarily small in amount within a single district. A visit or two in a year is perhaps all that he may be able to give to the schools of a district. His opportunities of giving “directions in the art of teaching and the method thereof in each school, as to him, togethér with the directors or controllers, shall be deemed expedient and necessary,” of advising with the boards of directors, &amp;e., are at best but meagre. His supervision must be of the most general character.</p>

In the filling of such a position, every thing will depend upon the motives actuating the boards of directors. If the position is made simply to provide a place for some favorite, at the public expense, then no good can be expected. But if, on the contrary, the position is created for the good of the schools, and ability, fitness, and character,-are the tests which govern the selection of the official, then no one will deny that a great benefit may be derived. Such a position as this is quite different from that of a borough superintendent, elected <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>under the act of 9th of April, 1867, and who acts independently of the county superintendent. “ The law does not give to any district the right, in distinct terms, of appointing superintendents, except in cities and boroughs of over live thousand inhabitants.” But under the large discretion which is entrusted to the directors of school districts, the right to appoint such officials, acting under the direction of the county superintendents and the boards of directors, seems to have been ■uniformly recognized by the school department of the Commonwealth.

The answer avers that his duties are “ to see that the teachers are in their places; to see that the schools are opened as required by law; to see that the pupils are properly classified, and the schools graded, and to teach in such schools as may be temporarily without teachers, and, by such directions, suggestions and illustrations, to the other teachers, to establish' and maintain a uniform mode of teaching in the said schools.”</p>

All agree “ that the law does not give to any district the right, in distinct terms, of appointing superintendents, except in cities and boroughs of over five thousand inhabitants.” Nut the appellees claim that under the large discretion entrusted to the directors they may appoint such officials to act under the county superintendent and directors, and that such appointments have been uniformly recognized by' the school department of the Commonwealth. The authority for this claim is section 334 of the School Laws and Decisions. Power is not vested in the superintendent of public instruction to appoint officers not provided for by law, or to legalize their appointment by others, and he has not attempted such usurpation. Section 335 of the Decisions show that no person, not a director, has been recognized as capable of performing the duty of district superintendent. It is said that it is often impracticable for directors to perform the duty of visitation according to law; that the law wisely provides that they may perform it by one of their number; that they have power to pay the secretary for “ other acts and duties ” pertaining to his office; and that“ all that is necessary, therefore, in districts advanced enough for this most efficient agency, is to assign the required duties to the secretary, with a reasonable compensation for the service, and the district superintendency is at once in legal existence and operation.” This section is referred to, not for unqualified approval, but as evidencing the absence of recognition of the appointment by directors of a person, not one of their number, to act as a dista-ict superintendent. The law names certain things to be done by the secretary, and adds that he shall “ do and perform all other acts and duties pei’taining to the office of secretaiy of the board, and for his services shall l'eceive such compensation as the board may direct.” It also declares that the directors ££ shall, by one or more of their number, visit every school in the district at least once a month.” "VVlien the secretary is assigned to perform that duty he visits as a director, and to pay him for such service out of the school fund is as illegal as it would be to pay any other director for like service, when he is directed <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>by the board to do it for them. lie shall be paid for services pertaining to Ills office of secretary; not for performance of dnties common to all the directors. The twisted view of the statute which seemed to give legal existence to a district superintendency, when filled by the secretary, with right to compensation for the service, has borne natural fruit in the appointment of Mr’. Noonan, not a director, and voting him a salary for his services.</p>
    <p id="b371-6" data-blocks='[["BL_371.6",371,[179,767,1170,858]]]'>Doubtless tiie directors believed it for the interest of the district to employ Noonan to perform many of their own duties, and some of the dnties of the county superintendent, in relation to the fifteen schools widely scattered over a large township. The grading of these schools is necessarily limited ; only one admits of three grades. All are supplied with teachers, and Noonan is not to teach, except when a school is temporarily without a teacher. The directors honestly arranged to supervise, grade and visit the schools by proxy. Put their good faith does not stand as authority for employing a superintendent for the district. The provisions of the law’ may be inadequate to the needs of the district because the county superintendent has too much to do, and the directors are indisposed to do all that is required of them. If so, the power that made the law alone can remedy its defects. Since the beginning of the system of common schools, from time to time, changes have been made to promote its advancement to a high standard. The end of its improvement has not been reached, and proposed supplementary changes and provisions will he enacted whenever the legislature shall be convinced of their utility.</p>

The duties of the principal teacher, though more extensive, are as easily comprehended as the duties of the principal in a school in the district of Mahanoy township, where an assistant is employed. If the town he so large as to embrace more than one series of graded schools, each principal has charge of his own. No provision has been made for the appointment of a district superintendent in townships, or in boroughs or cities having less than five thousand inhabitants. That office is unlike a principal teacher, for it extends over all the schools of the district, whether its territory he large and sparsely settled, or small and densely populated. The power to establish graded schools includes the power to employ principal and assistant teachers. Expressly granting the right to the school directors in cities and boroughs having over five thousand inhabitants to elect superintendents, forbids inference that the directors in other districts have such right. Noonan’s employ-<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>merit is much like that referred to in sections 334, 335 and 336 of decisions of the state superintendent, materially differing from a city or borough superintendent, and is unauthorized by statute. It does not follow that his employment was lawful, from the fact that his duties are not the same in all respects as those of a city or borough superintendent.</p>
