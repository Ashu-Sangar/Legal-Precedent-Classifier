But, the court adds “ even if we supplied the words, ‘ while the policy is in force,’ the policy was in full force, for the whole amount, when the assured died. It was in force in all respects and to all intents and purposes, and subject to be forfeited if the assured did any act prohibited by the conditions, such as traveling in certain countries, and engaging in certain occupations.

Where equity would set aside or reform the instrument, parol evidence is admissible to contradict or vary its terms, but not otherwise. As expressed by Mr. Justice Williams, in the case of Martin <em>v. </em>Berens, 17 P. F. Smith 459, “ Where parties, without any fraud or mistake, have deliberately put their engagements in writing, the law declares the writing to be not only the best, but the only evidence of their agreement, and we are not disposed to relax the rule.” “ Nor,” as stated by Mr. Justice Gkeen, in Thorne <em>v. </em>Warfflein, 3 Out. 519, “ can we throw the whole case into the jury box, on the ground of fraud, simply because one of two parties to a written contract testifies that there were parol stipulations, contradictory of the terms of the writing, agreed to at the ■same time. There must be evidence of fraud other than that which may be derived from the mere difference in the parol and written terms.” The principles which govern the admission -of parol evidence affecting written instruments are well ■established. For some purposes, which are well defined, it is ■admissible : Martin <em>v. </em>Berens, supra; but as a general rule it is not ireceived to contradict or vary the terms of a written <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>agreement. The pamphlet is not referred to in tlie policy ; it is not annexed to it; it contains statements of the company as to the special features of the several forms of contract which they are authorized to make, but in the absence of proof of fraud or mistake, all previous regulations and propositions in relation to the contract, are merged in the final agreement.</p>
    <p id="b201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_201.5",201,[213,679,1161,390]]]'>In the case of Ruse <em>v. </em>Ins.

    <p id="b201-6" data-blocks='[["BL_201.6",201,[210,1062,1164,564]]]'>It is contended that the failure of the defendant company to send the customary notice excused the plaintiff’s default. By the terms of the contract it was certainly the duty of the assured to pay on the day stipulated whether lie received notice or not; he knew, or was bound to know, the several dates at which the premiums were due, and his neglect to pay was at his own peril; the company was under no obligation to give the notice: Thompson <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., <em><a href="/citations/?q=14%20U.S.%20252" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="14 U.S. 252">14 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=14%20U.S.%20252" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="14 U.S. 252">Otto 252</a>. Assuming, however, that the assured may have been misled by the company’s course of business, there can be no apology or excuse for two whole years’ neglect upon that ground; such a default could not be traced to the misleading effect of the company’s uniform practice in sending notices.</p>
