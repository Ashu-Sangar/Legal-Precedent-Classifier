The original validity of the judgment, and of its lien on the land, are unquestioned. The executions thereon were regular and in due form.</p>
    <p id="b653-9" data-blocks='[["BL_653.11",653,[150,1060,1167,417]]]'>The sole objection is, that after the writ of venditioni ex-ponas issued, but before the sale was made, the five years from the rendition of the judgment had expired. In behalf of a good-faith purchaser of the land, who bought before the sale made by the sheriff, this objection would be valid. Another judgment lien obtained within five years before the sheriff’s sale, would be preferred in the distribution of the fund. One so obtained was preferred here. Those questions are not now before us. The only question is,- did the purchaser at that sale take title to the land ?</p>

This error of fact was corrected, and the true date made matter of record after the judgment in this case was entered. Whether lie was correct, had the fact been as assumed, has ceased to be important. Under the facts now unquestioned the judgment is wrong.</p>
