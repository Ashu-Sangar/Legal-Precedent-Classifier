Packer and Ur. Francis O. Harrison the executors. He died in September 1877, seised and possessed of a large estate, both real and personal, all of which he had disposed of in said written instrument. He had therein given to Mrs. Harrison,' his daughter, and one of the' defendants, a large portion of his estate, but not so large as would have descended to her had lie-died intestate. Being therefore dissatisfied, Mrs. Harrison-joined with some other of the heirs to contest the validity of-said alleged will. The plaintiff and other distinguished members of the bar became retained for that purpose. The matter in due time came before the court on an application for an issue,which after argument and due consideration was refused. The other counsel, originally retained, then dropped their connection with the case and the plaintiff came to be more especially the counsel of Mrs. Harrison, and at her special instance and request rendered his professional services in and about an appeal to the supreme court from the lower court’s action in refusing the issue. The supreme court, however, affirmed the proceedings, and the validity of the will was finally established.</p>

In point of fact there is in this case, so far as this contest is concerned, neither common law nor statutory separate estate. The plaintiff’s services were secured to contest a will that devised an estate to Mrs. Harrison. If that will was a valid instrument then the testator having therein disposed of his whole estate, no part of William Cameron’s estate ever could descend, and none of it had then descended to the contestant. But it was to secure the alleged <em>descended </em>estate that the plaintiff’s services were employed, and as the sequel proved the will to be good, there was, of course, no estate to be bettered or improved by those services. That Mrs. Harrison had other legal estate does not better the case. It was not in or about, <em>that </em>estate the plaintiff was employed, and neither was <em>it </em>bettered or improved by the employment; and in the absence of a general legal capacity to contract, <em>it </em>could not be held liable for her debts, except for <em>necessaries for ike support and maintenance of her family : </em>Williams <em>v. </em>Hugunin, <a href="/ill/69/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="69 Ill. 214" data-case-ids="2635834" data-case-paths="/ill/69/0214-01">69 Ill. 214</a>; 18 American Reports 607.</p>

It is therein alleged to be necessaries in the shape of work and labor for the necessary improvement of, and the enhancement of, and repairing.to the separate estate of Mrs. Harrison. But, as we have seen, there was no such separate estate, and a married woman has no general capacity to contract. A bond and warrant of attorney executed by her under the circumstances would have been void : Dorrance <em>v. </em>Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%20313" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Whart. 313">3 Wh. 313</a>.

If her judgment or written agreement is void, except when specially authorized by and executed in conformity with law, for a stronger reason the merely implied contract of a married woman, under similar circumstances, is a nullity.

C. 324</a>. It is not disputed that if the decision on the validity of the will had been in Mrs. Harrison’s favor, she would have been liable to the plaintiff, because there would have been an improvement in fact to her separate estate. But the result of that litigation one way or the other ought to be immaterial to the question of her liability in this action. The law gave her the title to the property which was the subject of the contract. It was hers by the will or without the will in a larger measure. If she could not defend it, she could not exercise the rights which the law gives. Her husband could not be made liable without his consent, and without the right to put in operation the law which is open to every one else she would be defenceless. With the right of property which the Act of 1848 gives to a married woman is given as an incident to it the right to take care of it and defend it — the right independent of her husband to invoke the Jaw in its defence — and with the right, the duty to pay the necessary and legitimate expenses of the litigation. That was the case here. It was absolutely necessary for the wife to take care of herself. The husband was an executor undel- the will and a devisee, and it was to his interest <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>to maintain the will. This case differs from all others in the fact that it is a claim for services rendered at her special in stance and request in defence of her right to take and enjoy her separate estate. And if she had a right to institute the proceeding, all the correlative duties and incidents follow, and she is liable to pay counsel fees and expenses.</p>

A married woman is enabled to hold, use and enjoy her property, not as a feme sole, hut as if it were settled to her separate use as a feme covert.

Her alleged contract or obligation is not binding upon her, unless made upon the footing of a statute. Her note or bond, though given for necessaries contracted for the support and maintenance of her family, or for improvement of her real estate, is absolutely void. By reason of her disabilities, her rights are so carefully guarded that there can be no recovery against her for a debt which, under the statute, she is competent to contract, unless the requisite facts are averred in the pleadings and proved at the trial.</p>

There is no express provision covering such a case, but the liability is the necessary result of the right of the wife to own, use and enjoy her prop<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>erty, without its being subject to transfer or encumbrance by her husband, which' right includes-the power to take cafe of it and preserve it from ruin: Lippincott <em>v. </em>Leeds, <em><a href="/citations/?q=77%20Pa.%20422" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="77 Pa. 422">77 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=77%20Pa.%20422" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="77 Pa. 422">Pa. St. 422</a>. It is not enough to charge a married woman’s property, or to render her personally liable, to lend her money for the purpose of making repairs, or to furnish work and material for improvements; it must also affirmatively appear that the money was so' applied] or that the improvements were actually made, and that the same were necessary for the preservation or enjoyment of her property. Her power to contract for improvements is limited by the requirements of necessity: Hough <em>v. </em>Jones, <a href="/pa/32/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="32 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="986815" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0432-01">32 Pa. St. 432</a>; Schriffer <em>v. </em>Laum, 81 Id. 385; Shannon <em>v. </em>Shultz, <em>87 </em>Id. 481; Kuhns <em>v. </em>Turney, Id. 501. Thus, it has been judicially determined that a married woman is not the sole judge of the necessity for repairs and improvements of her ■ real'estate for its preservation or her enjoyment; that if she borrows money for the avowed purpose of making repairs and uses it for something else,.she is not legally bound to pay it; and that if she contracts for unnecessary improvements and the same are made, neither her land nor herself can legally he held for payment. The jury, or other, tribunal for determination of facts, must find from evidence that improvements' were actually made and were necessary to justify enforcing her alleged cóntract. The statute does not intend that a married woman may contract debts tó her injury, under a mistaken opinion, or under a pretext, that repairs or improvements of. her property are necessary. It is essential to the plaintiff’s case to show that her Weakness or,credulity has not been'imposed upon into the ordering of some useless alteration or building.</p>
