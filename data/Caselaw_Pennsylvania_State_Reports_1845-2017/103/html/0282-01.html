But this consideration does not warrant the court to declare that such an incumbrance as this would not in fact increase the risk; and that, therefore, the company would not be entitled to notice of it. The effect of this would be to set aside the express covenant which the parties saw lit to make. If there were any doubt as to the proper construction of the terms of the condition, then, possibly, the purpose of the condition would assist the court <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>in ascertaining their meaning. But where there is no such doubt we are compelled to enforce the covenants as the parties made them, even though we might consider them unreasonable, arbitrary and unnecessary. The case of Commonwealth Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Berger and Butz, 6 Wr. 285, illustrates the authority of the court to refer to the purpose of a condition in construing terms of doubtful meaning. It was there held that the phrase ‘ levied on ’ was defined by the immediately succeeding phrase, ‘ taken into possession or custody,’ and meant an actual manual seizure. But there is no room for such construction here. The words are plain and unambiguous, and their effect cannot be avoided without substituting another contract for the one which the parties made.”</p>

No value is set upon the personal property in the bond. Why then should this judgment be deemed an incumbrance, and a valuable contract forfeited thereby, until it is actually liquidated ? This is doubly unjust when, as in this case, there1 being no breach of the condition, there was, in fact, no enforceable judgment. To work a forfeiture, there should be shown an absolute judgment, which was a lien beyond the possibility of a doubt. Smith <em>v. </em>Ins. Co., 8 Norris 287, which was in affirmance of Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>O’Maley, 1 Norris 400, is directly in point. There the question of incumbrance was the vital question, and it was held that a technical incumbrance or a technical seizure would not avoid the policy. Our incumbrance was not merely technical, it was also contingent. The courts of New York have held that mechanics’ liens were not incumbrances within the meaning of similar conditions in other policies. In Baley v. Ins. Co., <a href="/ny/80/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="80 N.Y. 21" data-case-ids="2173300" data-case-paths="/ny/80/0021-01">80 N.

This judgment was an incumbrance upon the insured premises within the meaning of the policy. It was contended, however, that as the condition of the bond was to restore certain personal property which had been levied upon by the sheriff, or pay the amount of the execution with costs, and said condition had never been broken, there was no point of time when execution could have been taken out on the judgment, and hence it was not such an incumbrance as was contemplated by the policy. This is arguing in a circle. It is not a question of execution but of incumbrance. There was a judgment and a lien. That the condition of the bond was not broken is not material. A judgment for borrowed money may be upon record for years, and yet no right to an execution exist during all that time. This is always the case when the money is paid at maturity. In either case an execution may issue upon breach and not before. I am unable to distinguish this case from that of an ordinary judgment for borrowed money. The theory upon which tiie clause in the policy rests, is that encumbered property is not as safe a risk as property that is free from liens, and many companies require a higher rate of insurance in such cases. It is so with the defendant company, and it defends upon the ground that the assured has not paid the inmeased premiums for the increased risk. That it was an increased risk is fixed by the terms of the policy and the agreement of the parties. It is not an open question for our consideration. The terms of the policy are not ambiguous and do not need <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>construction; henee, Butz <em>v. </em>The Insurance Company, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20285" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Wright 285">6 Wright 285</a>, and other eases cited, have no application.</p>

It was entered upon liis confession, and he is chargeable with knowledge. A man who gives a judgment or mortgage knows that it may, and probably will be, placed on record.
