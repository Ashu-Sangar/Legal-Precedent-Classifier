    <p class="summary" id="b383-5" data-blocks='[["BL_383.6",383,[186,515,1169,215]]]'>This was an appeal by Peter F. Coleman from an order of said court, dismissing his exceptions to and confirming an appraisement of certain real estate, levied upon in execution, and awarding $300 of the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale thereof, to the defendant in the execution, under his claim for exemption.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b383-6" data-blocks='[["BL_383.7",383,[179,729,1173,941]]]'>The facts of the case were as follows : On April 19th 1880, Peter Coleman obtained judgment in the common pleas of Montgomery county against T. Coleman for $1,300. On March 27th 1882, $700 of this sum remained unpaid, and plaintiff issued a fi. fa. to June Term, 1882, under which the sheriff levied on certain lands of the defendant. Before the return day of the writ, to wit, on May 9th 1882, the defendant gave the sheriff a written notice that he claimed the benefit of the exemption law out of the said real estate levied on, and demanded an appraisement thereof. No notice was taken of this claim by the sheriff, who made return of the fi. fa., and a jury of inquisition condemned the said real estate, which the court confirmed. The plaintiff then issued a writ of vend. ex. to sell the real estate levied on, and the sheriff accordingly advertised it to be sold on August 23d 1882. On the morning of the sale the sheriff appointed three appraisers, who certified that the said real estate could not be divided so as to set off a tract of the value of $300, “ and that the sum of $300 due the defendant under the exemption act shall be paid to the defendant out of the proceeds of said real estate; that is to say that the defendant’s interest in said real estate under this appraisement is $300.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b383-7" data-blocks='[["BL_383.8",383,[246,1674,1097,43]]]'>The plaintiff filed exceptions to said appraisement, inter alia:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b383-8" data-blocks='[["BL_383.9",383,[179,1717,1166,299]]]'>“ Because said appraisement is illegal and void in that it was not made under the fi. fa. issued on the judgment of the plaintiff <em>v. </em>the defendant, and because it was made at a time when the sheriff could not hold it, to wit: long after the writ of vend. ex. was issued under which the sale was made of defendant’s real estate, and on the day of the sale, without notice to the plaintiff in the execution.”</p>
