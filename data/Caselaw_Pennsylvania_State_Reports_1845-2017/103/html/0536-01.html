    <p class="summary" id="b552-8" data-blocks='[["BL_552.10",552,[264,1136,1173,599]]]'>The jury found the following special verdict: “Boiling Springs is a village, unincorporated, containing five hundred inhabitants. Third street, as shown by the plan, was laid out and dedicated, by Dr. Kauffman, to public use as a street and public highway, over twenty years ago. As opened and dedicated it was thirty-six feet wide. The defendant, Hauck, who owns a house built within six inches of the line of this street, put in curbstones and laid a pavement eight feet wide, being seven and one-half, feet into the highway, along his house and lot, and planted six trees and put in two hitching-posts along the outside edge of the pavement. If this amounts to a nuisance in law, then we find the defendant guilty in manner and form as he stands indicted ; if not, then not guilty, and the county to pay the costs.”</p>

There was no such violation of the rights of the public in the highway as to constitute a nuisance per se.

The right to use a foot-way implies a right to reasonably improve it in such manner as not to unreasonably obstruct the wagon-way. Every obstruction in a highway is not necessarily a public nuisance: Addison on Torts, sec. 121; King <em>v. </em>Russell, 6 B. &amp; C. 566; City of Allegheny <em>v. </em>Zimmerman, 14 Norris 287.</p>
