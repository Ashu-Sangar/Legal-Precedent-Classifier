A coal mine, containing five strata or seams of coal, was operated through a shaft extending from the surface through the various seams of coal ; and the entrance to the shaft was covered by the breaker. In the first and third seams fifty or more miners were employed, mining coal for market. The second and fourth seams were not being worked. In the fifth seam a number of miners, not exceeding twenty, were engaged in working a gangway to connect with a second opening, which had not been completed to that scam, although said second opening or outlet was already connected with the first and third seams, in accordance with the requirements of the Act of March 3d 1870 (P. L. 3). Under sections three and five of said Act. the Inspector of Mines filed a bill in equity to restrain the working of the first and third seams, at the same time that work was being carried on to make a second opening or outlet in the fifth seam. A demurrer to said bill was overruled by the court below, and the injunction granted.</p>

Such a construction would result in serious losses to mine owners, and is not in conformity with the natural and obvious meaning of the words of the Act.

In the proviso the subject matter treated is merely as to men employed in the necessary work of opening a new mine or seam. The enacting clause treats of persons generally employed within the mine. The proviso treats only of certain particular men employed for a special purpose. Hence the proviso cannot be construed to embrace persons about which it does not profess to treat, viz : men employed generally in other seams besides the new one that is being opened. The enacting clause prohibited the employment of men in any coal mine unless there were two outlets always accessible to every seam for the time being at work. The proviso deals with a limited class of men and cannot be extended to a class not contemplated specifically within its subject and to whom the danger would be increased by such working and who would thereby be deprived for a time of two outlets always accessible in case of accident. Further, by no other construction can anj? sensible meaning be given to the words “ for the time being at work.” By our construction these words refer to this very case. They permit work in the upper seams having two outlets when there exists another seam not having two outlets, but in which no work or manual labor is being performed ; but if the lower seam is “ for the time <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>being at work,” that is if manual labor is being performed there, then the prohibition is absolute.</p>

The breaker and buildings covering the shaft were entirely consumed, and one hundred and eight unfortunate miners instantly perished.

In other words, that the working of the first and third seams and the opening, at the same time, of the fifth, which had but one outlet, is •exactly within the letter of the prohibition, whilst the proviso simply withdraws from the operation of that prohibition the opening of a new mine, or the driving of a gangway, that and no more. The prohibition arises, they say, not from the fact that there is another partial ¡y opened seam, connected with the same shaft, which has no second outlet, but the fact that there is another such seam, in the language of the statute “ for the time being at work.” The reasoning, in support of this view, certainly displays great ingenuity of counsel, but it involves such a refinement upon the language of the section, as we think was riot in the minds of the legislature. The natural and obvious meaning of the words used in the entire section, we think, is to be taken, rather than such as only results from a subtle and adroit analysis of the prohibition, and the proviso, considered separately. To find the intention of the legislature we must read the different parts of a statute together, and, if there is a simple and apparent meaning in the whole, which stands out in bold relief we must adopt that rather than one which is forced, and the result of laborious reasoning. The phrase “for the time being at work ” is clearly used to qualify and limit the seams or strata which are embraced in the prohibition and not the period of time, daily or otherwise, when the laborers are actually employed. The fifth seam was simply in course of preparation for working; whilst, it is true, a limited number of men were working there, it could scarcely be said that they were working the mine; they were removing coal from the gangway, not for the coal, but for the gangway, they were not working the seam, they were opening it for work.</p>

The proviso was altogether unnecessary, indeed absurd, if its purpose was merely to except such acts from its provisions ; this proviso was doubtless framed, in part, to exclude auy possible ground of misinterpretation, and further, but principally wo think, to limit the employment, in this more dangerons department of the work, to twenty men, as without the proviso there was necessarily no limit. The objects and purpose of the Act are thus extended by the proviso.</p>

It is to be assumed that the legislature meant just what in the language of this xket is clearly expressed. The first and cardinal rule for construction of statutes is, that when the intent of the legislature is plainly expressed, it must prevail, that when the language of a statute is clear and unequivocal, without ambiguity or uncertainty we are to presume that it expresses the intent of the legislature, and no construction is necessary. It may be that the working of the first and third seams at the same time that the communication was being made in the fifth, increases the hazard and risk to those engaged in the work, but this is a matter for legislative action, we cannot make the law.</p>
