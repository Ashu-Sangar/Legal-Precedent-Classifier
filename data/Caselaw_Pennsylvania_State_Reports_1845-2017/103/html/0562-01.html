She also, as executrix of John Ulrich, deceased, claimed from the balance of the fund the sum of $1,083.57, with interest from .1859,. by virtue of the above assignment— the amount of this indebtedness of H.

    <p class="summary" id="b580-7" data-blocks='[["BL_580.7",580,[392,1635,948,45]]]'>Upon this question the auditor reported as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b580-8" data-blocks='[["BL_580.8",580,[321,1678,1167,770]]]'>“It is claimed that the assignment, was only a collateral security for any debt of H. H. Grove which might exist at the death of Catharine Grove, and that there is no evidence of any debt then existing, that the notes are barred by the statute of limitation, and that Grove’s administrator is the proper person to receive the fund for distribution, excepting the $120.69 tendered to Mrs. Ulrich. If the assignment was only as collateral security, I do not think the statute of limitations could be set up, but that the executrix of Rev. John Ulrich would have the right to receive whatever had not been paid prior to the decease of Catharine Grove. The assignment is in effect also an agreement to pay at the death of Mrs. Grove whatever should be due to Ulrich and the statute would not commence to run until the happening of that event. The case of Acheson <em>v. </em>Shenk, 2 Legal Gazette 861, has been cited in support of this position: ‘Where a judgment bond is held as collateral security for advances the statute cannot be pleaded against such debt.’</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[173,777,1162,332]]]'>“ There can be no doubt that the intention of the parties was not that which took the assignment merely as a collateral and that the dower fund would have to go to Grove’s administrator and the claim made against his estate, or his representatives, but it provides that whatever is owing shall be paid to Ulrich, his executors, &amp;e. The amount due at the assignment was fixed at $1,083.57. There is no pretence of any payment, and it seems that the debt due is established.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[175,1118,1158,256]]]'>“ It is urged that it was not the bond that was assigned, but there can be no doubt that it was the intention of Grove to assign his interest in the dower fund, payable at the death of his mother, and this included the reservation in the deed — the assignment after the requisite proof was recorded, as shown by the testimony.</p>

This inventory cannot be found on file, search having been made by the register and by the auditor ; the records show the date of its filing, but there is no record showing the items it contained. There is testimony as to its contents which clearly establishes that it contained the item referred to and that IÍ. II. Grove was one of the appraisers.</p>

It amounted on April 1st 1880, to $2,440.79 — much more than Grove’s interest in the dower fund. We have, <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>therefore, concluded to sustain the exception and distribute the fund in accordance with the opinions above expressed.”</p>
