Said commissioners having lawfully performed said duty, their report became under the terms of said Act of 1859, “ final and conclusive,” and the boundary line so run and marked cannot be impeached by the owners of lands affected thereby.</p>

In order to determine this question, it will be necessary to refer to the various Acts of Assembly which have been offered in evidence, the Act of Assembly creating the county of Clinton, and the several Acts of Assembly authorizing commissioners to fix the boundary line between the counties of Centre and Clinton. The county of Clinton was, by an Act of Assembly approved the twenty-first day of June, 1839, erected out of parts of Centre and Lycoming counties. This Act of Assembly prespribes the boundaries, and authorizes the erection of Clinton county out of all those parts of Lycoming and <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>Centre counties, and lying within the following boundaries, namely: “Beginning at Pine Creek, where the north line of Lycoming county crosses said creek,” and so on until it comes to the line in controversy in this suit, “ thence in a straight line to the north-east corner of Centre county, thence to include Logan, Lamar, and Bald Eagle townships in Centre county, thence along the Lycoming county line to the southwest corner of said county.” In this section of the Act, the general outline and boundaries of the county are defined. The second section of the act prescribes how these boundaries were to be ascertained and marked. It provides that William Colt, of Columbia county, Joseph Bressler, of Dauphin county, and John Cresswell, of Huntingdon coirnty, be and are hereby appointed commissioners, whose duty it shall be to ascertain and plainly mark the boundary lines of said county of Clinton. They were also required, after having ascertained and marked the boundary lines, to make out in writing and transmit their report, accompanied with a draft or plot of said county of Clinton, to the governor of the Commonwealth. Whether this part of the duty of said commissioners was performed or not, does not appear in the evidence, as no draft or plot has been shown, and this created the necessity for the passage of the Act of Assembly of 1848, in order that the boundary lines might be determined and fixed upon the ground. This Act of Assembly of 1848, appointed Joseph F. Quay and Dr. Jonathan Moyer, of Clinton county, and Nathan J. Mitchell, of Centre county, commissioners, whose duty it was, or a majority of them, to correctly run and mark distinctly the boundary line, or lines, between the counties of Clinton and Centre, agreeably to the Act of Assembly creating Clinton county. After these commissioners had run and marked the line upon the ground, they were required to make out two drafts, one of which was to be filed in the commissioners’ office of Centre county, and the other in the commissioners’ office of Clinton county. The commissioners named in this Act of Assembly of 1848, in pursuance of the authority conferred upon them by this act, did run the boundary line known in this case as the line of 1848, and filed in the respective counties a draft of their work, with their report appended and signed by them. One of these drafts and reports taken from the commissioners’ office of Centre county has been produced in evidence. It appears from this draft and report, that the commissioners did run and mark a boundary line in 1848, and that with reference to this lino a small portion of the Rebecca. Kelso Tract lay in Clinton county, about twenty-three acres. As to that portion of the tract, the defendant has filed a disclaimer of title.</p>

It would seem that the lines found upon the ground, which 'were run by the commissioners under the Act of Assembly of 1848, did not correspond'with the courses and distances laid down upon ■their draft. " At least, it was alleged that there were discrepancies between the draft filed and the marks found on the ground. Consequently, in 1857, this other Act of Assembly was passed for the purpose of correcting the supposed or real discrepancies between the courses and distances laid down by the commissioners of 1848, upon their draft, and the marks of the boundary line found upon the ground, of that portion of the line running from the waters of Beech Creek to the west branch of the Susquehanna River. Under this last mentioned Act, Nathan J, Mitchell, of Centre county, Joseph F. Quay, and David Carskaddon, of Clinton county, were appointed' commissioner's, whose duty it was, or a majority of them, to run correctly and mark distinctly the boundary lines between Clinton and Centre counties, from the west branch of the Susquehanna- River to the waters of Beech Creek, agreeably to the Act of Assembly creating the county of Clinton. They were also required to make out two drafts, one of which was to be filed in the commissioners’ office of each of the said counties. The commissioners were required to perform’ the duties enjoined upon them by this Act on or before the first day of December, after the passage of said Act of Assembly, which would be the first day of December, 1857. Notliing was done by the commissioners under this act of 1857, and consequently the Act failed of its purpose.</p>

There were really no facts for the jury to pass upon, as the question of location of the Rebecca Kelso tract was not disputed. Nothing was controverted on the trial, but the location of the boundary line between Clinton and Centre counties, which was a question of law for the court.

We still adhere to that view of the statute; but it does not support the contention of the plaintiff in error here. We were not there discussing the power of the commissioners to correctly run and mark the boundary line on the ground, thus locating it; but we were considering their absence of power to change the location of any tract of laud. We said they could not change the line of any tract, nor move its cornel’s ; that they could neither relocate any tract of land, nor decide on which side of the county line any tract might lie We distinctly declared the power was given to them to locate the boundary line and establish the evidence thereof on the ground and in their report.
