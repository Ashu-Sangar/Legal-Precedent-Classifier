It certainly cannot be the law that under such circumstances the creditor entering into such an agreement must show the knowledge.and acquiescence of all the other creditors. This would often be impossible ; and if there was an unconsenting creditor who was injured by the agreement, this should have been shown by the defence. Slingluff <em>v. </em>Eckel, cited by the plaintiff in error, does not apply here, because in that case the consent of the debtor was not obtained to the contract.</p>

The verdict removes all pretext that any person interested in the sale was defrauded. The plaintiff in error cannot now invoke the rule that under many circumstances his contract might have been contrary to public policy and therefore void.
