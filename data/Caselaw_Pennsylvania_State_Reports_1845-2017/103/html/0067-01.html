      <em>“ </em>The suit is brought against Susan Miller and her husband, Lewis B. Miller. This is the proper form of action and joinder of parties where the tort is by the wife in the absence of and not under the control of the husband, and in that case it is proper to aver the injury to be done by the wife. Assuming then that the law holds the husband responsible for damages done by the tort of the wife, if this declaration avers the utterance of the words by the wife in the absence of the husband, this verdict could clearly stand. Is it necessary to so aver ? It is clearly necessary to prove the utterance by the wife in the absence of the husband, for if uttered in his presence there is a misjoinder of the wife. If the declaration lays the words as uttered by the wife, with no averment as to the absence of the husband, it is possible a verdict would cure the want of such averment, the fact being proved by the evidence and the verdict not being supportable on any other basis...... And we do not apprehend that this would be the case when the declaration either by positive averment asserts that the words were uttered by both defendants, or by ambiguity of language or inconsistent averments leaves it in doubt who uttered the words. ... A verdict may stand that is not inconsistent with the declaration, but one that is inconsistent, we do not consider is supported, whether at common law, under the statute of Jeofails, or by pleading over. ... As this declaration stands, the averments are conflicting. It avers utterance by both defendants, if we amend from the singular number to the plural, and by Susan Miller. If uttered by her it is left in doubt as to whether they were uttered in the presence or absence of the husband. A natural conclusion would be they were uttered in his presence .... We cannot believe that when the legislature as an act of justice deprived the husbamd of the right to the wife’s property, they intended to imprison him in a civil action for the wife’s slander. . . . We must hold that in tort for slander by the wife in the absence of the husband, he is not liable, or we must enforce this judgment by arresting and imprisoning the husband, or must repeal the law allowing a capias or, if bound to enforce that act, hold that it is essential that no ambiguity is allowable in the declaration, and the averment must be clearly made that the tort was committed by the wife in the absence of the husband. We choose the latter. The husband for his own reputation would have the right to know <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>and liave it known from the record why he was under arrest. .... But if the husband must be joined and held to liability the reasons are trumpet-tongued why he should be so joined on the record as to show his liability is not of his own fault. .... "We now hold that since the act of 1848, in case of slander by the wife, in the absence of the husband, the pleadings must conform strictly to the new law and aver all that is required to be proved. Only so can we protect the rights of husband against the rigor of the law.”</p>

The intention of the legislature was to discourage the removal of causes, except upon penalty of paying, upon affirmance, all the costs that have accrued. An action of slander would lie against a husband and wife, for slanderous words spoken by the wife, before the Act of 1848, because by marriage the husband acquired absolute control over the personal property of the wife, and even over her person to the extent of corporal punishment. But by that Act the husband’s rights in his wife’s property were taken away, and with them the reason for his liability for her debts and torts. The proviso to the Act of 1848 does not designate what torts are referred to, and we submit that it is a proper question for judicial decision to determine, whether slander or only trespasses are intended. The declaration should have averred the absence of the husband when the words complained <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>of were spoken by the wife, and the omission to do this is such a defect in substance as is incurable by a verdict: Say. 282; Arch.

The action was against husband and wife for a tort; if the tort of the wife, her husband was a necessary party ; if the tort of the husband, his wife was improperly joined ; and if she did the act in her husband’s presence, prima facie, he was alone liable. In all the counts it is averred that the defendant, said Susan Miller, did the wrong complained of ; her husband is joined in the suit, but is not charged with having committed the injury. It was necessary to prove that the wife uttered the. words in the absence of her husband, so far. as appears in this case. Had they been uttered in his presence and against his will and power of restraint, the case would be different. Conceding that the fact of the husband’s absence when his wife uttered the words, ought to have been averred in the narr., the omission is cured by the verdict: Weinberger <em>v. </em>Shelly, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 336" data-case-ids="480074" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0336-01">6 W. &amp; S. 336</a>. There, the action was for malicious prosecution and the declaration contained no averment that the prosecution was commenced without probable cause. This court approved the rule that, “ Where there is any defect, imperfection or omission in any pleading, whether in substance or form, which would have been a fatal objection upon demurrer, yet if the issue joined be, such as necessarily'required on the trial proof of the facts ,so defectively or imperfectly stated or omitted, and without which-it is not to be presumed that either the judge would direct the jury to give or the jury would have <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>given the verdict, such defect, imperfection or omission is cured by the verdict by the common law.” And “ after verdict it will be presumed everything was done at tlie trial which was necessary to support the action, unless the contrary appears on the record.” In an action for malicious prosecution it is quite as essential to aver and prove want of probable cause for the prosecution, as, in an action for slander by words spoken by the wife, to aver and prove absence of her husband. Then it must be taken as settled that after a trial upon the merits, such an omission, whether in substance or form, will not defeat the verdict. The justice of the rule is illustrated by this case, which had already been tried twice before a jury, and the omission could not have misled or prejudiced the defendants. To the declaration they pleaded in effect, that Susan Miller did not utter the words as charged, hut should it be proved that she did, they would establish the truth of said words. And. now L. 13. Miller, in his history of the case, insists the verdict was wrong because the jury did not find, from the evidence given in justification, that the words expressed the truth. Here, the point for consideration arises upon the record, not upon the conflict of testimony or credibility of witnesses.</p>
    <p id="b87-6" data-blocks='[["BL_87.6",87,[180,1301,1174,375]]]'>2. The defendant in error claims that by operation of the statute relative to the rights of married women, a husband is no longer liable for the torts of his wife. With this view the learned judge of the Common .Pleas was so impressed as to “ hold that since the Act of 1848, in case of slander by the wife in the absence of the husband, the pleadings must conform strictly to the new law and aver all that is required to be proved. Only so can we protect the rights of the husband against the rigor of the law.”</p>

She may contract a debt for necessaries for the support, of her family, but in such case execution, upon the judgment recovered, shall first issue against the husband alone, and if no property belonging to him can be found, then an execution may be issued and levied upon the separate property of the wife. The earnings of married women in all cases are the property of their husbands, except where a petition by a married woman has been presented to the court and recorded, as provided by the Act of April 3d 1872. And the husband is not relieved from any duties or liabilities, except the provision that he shall not be liable for the debts of his wife contracted before marriage, and that if a judgment be obtained against him for the torts of his wife, execution shall first-be had against her .property.</p>

Its purpose, limits and specifications plainly show that no exemption is given the husband from liability for his wife’s torts, other than is expressly named. By no pertinent rule of interpretation can the statute be held to abrogate the common law relative to the marriage relation. It makes some material and important changes or exceptions, and, subject only to these, the law remains as before. Rothing can be found that requires any change in the pleadings where a husband and wife are sued for the wife’s tort, or that calls for greater strictness in averments, or that overrules the doctrine in Weinberger <em>v. </em>Shelly, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 336" data-case-ids="480074" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0336-01">6 W. &amp; S. 336</a>.

The recognizance was in the sum of $100, with the prescribed condition, except the stipulation “for payment of all costs that have accrued in the cause.” That it is sufficient to secure payment of all the costs that can be legally taxed against the plaintiff, in case of affirmance, is not gainsaid.

The defendant claims that “ the intention of the legislature was to discourage the removal of causes, except upon the penalty of paying, upon affirmance, of all costs that have accrued that is, if this ease should be affirmed, the plaintiff shall pay the costs which had accrued, amounting to $1,726.19, as the penalty for removing her cause. If this be so, every party who obtains a judgment that carries costs in his favor, although he believes it is for a small fraction of what is justly his due, to obtain a review in the appellate court must obligate himself for payment of all costs in the cause, accrued and to accrue, in the event of affirmance of the judgment. This, indeed, would discourage removals by parties who had been erroneously deprived of only a portion of their rights, but not by those who had been wholly deprived. A party already liable for the accrued costs would incur no risk of a penalty by taking a writ of error.
