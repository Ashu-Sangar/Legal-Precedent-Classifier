Ulrich, 11 Harris 388. Under this definition, the surviving husband of the legatee was entitled to take as heir or representative of his wife within the meaning of the will: Patterson <em>v. </em>Hawthorn, 12 S. &amp; R. 112; Buckley <em>v. </em>Reed, 3 Harris 83; Gibbons <em>v. </em>Fairlamb, 2 Casey 218; 2 Redfield on Wills cap.

S. 190; Rewalt <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 11 Harris 388; Letchworth’s Appeal, 6 Casey 175.
