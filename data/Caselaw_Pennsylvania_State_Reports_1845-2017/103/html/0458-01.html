McCormick, Esq.), the facts appeared to be as follows : On March 24th 1880, Austin Curtin &amp; Co. leased an old furnace situated in Mill Hall, Clinton county, for the purpose of manufacturing pig-iron for rolling mill purposes. Many years before the furnace had been used for that purpose, but at the time of the said lease it had been idle for a period of twenty-four years and was greatly out of repair. The lessee reconstructed and repaired the mill property, and on October 6th 1881, the work of manufacturing pig iron was resumed. Subsequently, other repairs were made by rebuilding an old bridge house, upon which ore, coke and limestone were deposited for filling the furnace. On December 21st 1881, the sheriff of Clinton county levied upon all the lessee’s personal property and rights in said furnace under a fi. fa,., issued by the Bellefonte Nail Co., Limited, against Curtin &amp; Co., and on January 14th 1882, sold the same for $2268.71, which sum constitutes the fund for distribution.</p>

Llewellyn was a millright and carpenter, and his claim was for carpenter repairs to the furnace property. Similar claims for work done in the repair and reconstruction of said furnace property were made by Keener, McGregor, Parker and Mayes, all of whom were carpenters and millwrights. None of these claimed to have assisted in the actual manufacture of iron. The Stiver Brothers owned a blacksmith shop situated near the furnace, where they had carried on the business for twelve years previous to the recommencement of the furnace. Their claim was for work done in shoeing horses and repairing wagons and tools used in the operation of the furnace, for which, generally, they charged by the hour. They disclaimed any connection with the furnace. liobert Miller, who was a farmer, owning a team of horses, agreed to haul and deliver limestone at the furnace for use of Curtin <em>&amp; </em>Co., for $1 a ton, and his claim was for his actual labor in so hauling. He testified that he paid the owners of the quarry fifteen cents per ton for the privilege of quarrying the limestone and then having <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>quarried it, personally hauled it with his own team to the furnace.

He is not a contractor, in such a sense as will defeat his claim. The work of his own hands is protected.</p>

After the works were started, however, the old bridge house, upon which was deposited the ore, coke and limestone, used in the manufacture of iron, was found to be insufficient for the purpose, and it was rebuilt by the lessee.</p>
