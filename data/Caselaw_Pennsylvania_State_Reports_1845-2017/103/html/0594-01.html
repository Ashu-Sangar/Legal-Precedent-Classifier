A judgment was entered in favor of A. against A., B. <em>&amp; </em>C., on a joint and several judgment note drawn to A.’s order and signed by A., B. &amp; O. The purpose of the note was to enable B. to procure money from A. It appeared that A.’s name was on the bottom of the note, as one of the makers, by mistake, and that O. made no inquiry about it at the time of signing the note. The court, on motion of A., under the Acts of May 4th 1852 (P. L. 574) and April 12th 1858 (P. L. 243), ordered the record to be amended by striking oil A.’s name as defendant; leaving the judgment in his favor against B. &amp; C. O. afterwards claimed that he had put his Dame to the note at B.’s request, receiving no benefit therefrom, and relying upon A.’s solvency and B.’s statement that both A. <em>&amp; </em>B. being on the note before him, he was entirely safe. Upon an appeal from a refusal of the court to grant a petition which recited the above facts, and prayed that the judgment be opened and O. allowed to defend:</p>

That he never contracted, or intended to contract, as would appear from the judgment record, after the name of John Keener had been stricken from the note. That the loan from John Keener to Daniel Miller was usurious, which fact was not disclosed to the petitioner, nor was he informed until seven years afterwards that John Keener had loaned Daniel Miller any money on the said note. That for several years after the note became due the said Daniel Miller ivas solvent and able to pay and did offer to pay the said debt <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>to John Keener ; and the said John Keener neglected to collect the same until after Miller had become insolvent.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b612-6" data-blocks='[["BL_612.6",612,[236,631,1177,1283]]]'>A rule to open the judgment, based on this petition, was discharged by the court, and the prayer of the petitioner denied, Wiokes, J., delivering the following opinion : “ If the defendant, Henry Weller, occupied the position of a guarantor, instead of a surety, in the note upon which this judgment was entered, there would be much force in the contention that the delay of the plaintiff, in proceeding to collect it until after the insolvency of Daniel Miller, the principal, is fatal to his claim against the surety. It is clear law that the contract of guaranty is conditional on the creditor’s diligence to collect the debt, but that mere delay will not release a surety; to be released, he must demand proceedings with notice that he will not be bound if they are not instituted : 2 P. F. S. 440, 525; 3 Penn. R. 437; 9 P. F. S. 356. There is no evidence that such a demand was ever made upon the plaintiff, and mere forbearance or delay will not operate to discharge the surety from his liability. Nor would the fact that Miller paid the plaintiff a bonus for the use of the money, or at times more than the legal rate of interest, discharge the surety, unless there was evidence of some change in the contract. Of this, however, there is no evidence; indeed it is denied by the plaintiff that lie ever charged usurious interest, and that whatever was paid above six per cent., was when Miller voluntarily paid him something for waiting when the interest became due. Rut there is nothing to show that the original contract was changed, and without this the surety would not be released: 9 Ca. 106. Nor does the evidence submitted in support of the application show such “ mistake, misrepresentation, and laches,” either on the part of the plaintiff, or principal, as entitles the defendant, Weller, to be released from his liability.</p>

But it is said he was misled by the appearance of Keener’s name at the foot of the note, and supposed himself protected by Keener’s liability. He was asked to sign the note by Miller, who told him he wanted to borrow some money. Whether he told him from Keener or not is perhaps doubtful. Weller says not. Miller says ‘ Yes’ and ‘No.’ But Weller signed a joint and several note as surety for Miller, and the note showed on its face that John Keener was the payee. His name appeared, it is true, by mistake, as maker also; but the error was apparent on the face of the note, and the case is absolutely destitute of evidence to show collusion <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>between Keener and Miller to mislead him. Keener was not present when Miller signed the note and never seems to have had any communication with him on the subject; he ought not therefore to be affected by what took place between Miller and Weller at the time: Graves <em>v. </em>Tucker, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20S.%20%26%20M.%209" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 S. &amp; M. 9">18 S. &amp; M. 9</a>.

The action of the court in striking Keener’s name from the record as defendant, in effect reformed the contract and changed the legal rights of the appellant. There is no authority for this under the Acts relied upon. Amendments depriving the opposite party of any valuable right should not be allowed : Kille <em>v. </em>Ege, 1 Norris 110. Keener did not cause judgment to be entered until April 2d 1879, and in the mean time other more diligent croditoj’S had consumed with their executions all the property of Miller, to an amount several times greater than this judgment. Miller also testified that he paid 8 per cent, interest and at one time caused Keener to reduce the rate by threatening to pay the note. We believed that the cumulation of these equities entitled us to relief, or at least entitled us to have a jury pass upon the facts. This note and warrant as it stands, signed by John Keener and payable to himself, is of no more avail to hold Henry Weller to any liability, than a blank form would be. A bond or other instrument of writing in which the obligee also appears as an obligor is senseless, and of no force and efficacy as a cause of action or evidence of liability : Faulkner <em>v. </em>Lowe, 2 Exch. 595; Teague <em>v. </em>Hubbard, 8 B. &amp; C. 345; Moffatt v.

The reasoning of the court below is : That the error was apparent on the <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>face of this paper, and therefore Weller is to be bound to any agreement shown' to have been the intention of Keener. We submit, that even to an experienced business man or lawyer this paper would appear perfectly consistent with Weller’s understanding of it. It is a frequent method for a man to draw a note to his own order, sign it himself with his sureties and then indorse it over to the lender of the money.</p>

The mistake of Keener’s name on the foot of the note was apparent on the face of the paper. Weller made no inquiry as to the fact of Keener’s name at the bottom of the note, nor was there any misrepresentation- or undue influence used. He was informed that he was to go as security for the loan of the money from Keener, and the, matter was, as the court says, open to his own inquiry, and he made none and cannot now avail himself by saying that he was misled by the appearance of Keener’s name at the bottom of the note.</p>

Has the appellant been injured by the amendment or deprived of any valuable right ? He alleges that he signed the note on the strength of Keener’s name, knowing, him to be responsible. Even if this be so, appellant would not be relieved unless some fraud was practiced upon him. It is not pretended there was any collusion between Keener and Miller. The appellant knew, -when he signed the note, that lie-was becoming bail for Miller. Ho knew the latter expected to&gt; raise money upon the note. If he had read the note he would have seen that Keener was the payee. This of itself was sufficient to put the appellant upon inquiry. It is true the note of Keener to his own order was regular and might have passed from hand to hand without comment. But wdien Miller took such a note to appellant and asked him to become bail for him (Miller) upon it, the case is widely different. As before stated, the object of the transaction was to enable Miller to get the money from some one. From whom could he get it but Keener? The note was payable to his order, and could not be used without his indorsement. A man of ordinary intelligence could not have been deceived by Keener’s name appearing on the note as maker. In any event there was such an irregularity as to put appellant upon inquiry. If he had made such inquiry, he would have ascertained the truth ; that Miller was to get the money from Keener, and that he (appellant) was becoming bail for Miller to Keener.</p>
