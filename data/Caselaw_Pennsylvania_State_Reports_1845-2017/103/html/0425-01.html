The only effect of a refusal to accept its provisions was to deprive the non-accepting corporation of the means of indemnity provided in the third section of the said Act, and also of the benefits resulting from a modification of its charter as provided for in the fourth section.</p>

They now again present themselves for adjudication. Whether the Act of 1868 applies to non-accepting companies, can hardly be an open question, for it clearly appears, that in numerous cases where it has not appeared on the trial or in the discussion, whether it had or had not been formally accepted by the litigant companies, its provisions have been acted upon in determining the status of the parties under the first section, and as a basis for determining the measure and amount of damages under the second. In the North Pennsylvania Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Kirk, 9 Norris 15; Cummings <em>v. </em>Pittsburg, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway Company, 11 Norris 82; and in Mulherrin <em>v. </em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co., 31 P. F. Smith 366, the provisions of the first section of the Act were applied to the eases of the plaintiffs to determine whether they stood in the relation of employees to the respective companies. And in the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Keller, 17 P. F. Smith 300, where it did not appear in the case that the provisions of the Act had been accepted, the chief justice declared that Act to be with the Act of 1855 a system for determining the compensation for the loss of life ; and in the case of the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Rowan and Wife, 16 P. F. Smith 393, Thompson, C. J., in delivering the opinion of the court, quoted the rule as stated in the Act of 1868 for estimating the compensation, and added, “ I understand this to have been the rule prior to the passage of the Abt, notwithstanding a dictum or two to the contrary. It is now the rule of this statute, and as such to be obeyed where the action is for loss of life.”</p>

A member, Mr. Hay, seeing the insufficiency of § 21 of art. III. of the proposed Constitution to repeal the Act of 1868, proposed an amendment to cover that view of the case. His proposition was to strike out the words in the last line, “ so limiting or prescribing,” and to insert the words, “ inconsistent with this section.” “ Then,” he said, “ there will be no possibility of misunderstanding what is the meaning of this phraselogy.” The question was put on that amendement, and it was rejected, (5 Debates, 292-3). There is no possibility of misunderstanding the meaning of the Convention on that subject. The members did not mean to avoid any law except that which limited the time of bringing suit. They refused to avoid “ existing laws inconsistent with this section; ” but left the repealing clause stand, “ and existing laws so limiting or prescribing are annulled and avoided.” These words, limiting and prescribing, were immediately preceding and connected with the repealing clause, and such laws only were intended to be repealed. And the subsequent change of the words “ limiting and prescribing ” to “such Acts,” have the same meaning, and it was so intended.</p>

The learned judge refused to so charge, and instructed the jury that the proper measure of damages in this case, is the pecuniary loss suffered by the plaintiffs, “ without any solatium for distress of 'mind, and that loss is what the deceased would have probably 'earned by his intellectual or bodily labor in his business or profession during the residue of his lifetime, and which would have gone for the benefit of his wife and children, taking into consideration his age, ability and disposition to labor, and his habits of living and expenditure;” and, that the Act of 1868, in so Tar as .it limits the amount to be recovered incases like, the present, Avas avoided by the 21st section, art. 3 of the Constitution, which ordains as follows, viz : “No Act of the gen<a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>eral assembly shall limit.the amount to be recovered for injuries resulting in death, or for injuries to persons or property <em>; </em>and, in ease of death from such injuries, the right of action shall survive, and the general assembly shall prescribe for whose benefit such actions shall be prosecuted.

The persons entitled to recover damages are designated by the Act of April 26th 1855, which also limits the time, within which suit may be brought, to one year from the death. The amount of damages to be recovered “ against common carriers or corporations, owing, operating or using a railroad, as a public highway, whereon steam or other motive power is nsed,” is limited by the second section of the Act of April 4th 1868 (P. L. 58), in cases of personal injury to $8,000, and in cases of death resulting therefrom to $5,000. The third section of this Act authorizes-such carriers or corporations to indemnify themselves by insuring the lives and persons of their passengers, etc. The fourth section, after repealing all Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent therewith, declares that “ any provisions in the Acts incorporating such common carriers or corporations, inconsistent therewith, shall be repealed upon the acceptance of this Act by such carriers or corporations; and upon the acceptance of the provisions hereof the same shall become a part of its Act of incorporation.”</p>

The purpose of the twenty' first section of the third Article of the Constitution was to nullify, as far as possible, then existing legislation limiting the amount to be recovered for injuries resulting in death, or for injuries to persons or property, as well as that limiting the time within which suits could be .brought.against corporations for injuries to persons or property or for other causes, so far at least as said limitation of time differed from that fixed by general laws regulating actions against natural persons.; and, at the same time, prevent all such legislation in the future. The phraseology of the section as well as the discussion that took place during the course of its adoption clearly indicates that such was the intention of the framers of the Constitution. It commences by declaring, “Ro Act of the general assembly shall limit the amount,” &amp;e. The language thus employed cannot be fairly restricted to future legislation alone. It is quite as applicable to then existing as it is to prospective legislation. If its authors had intended that it should apply only to the latter they would have used some such expression as we find in the 1st, 6th, 7th, 8th, lltli and 20th sections of the same article, viz: “ Ro law shall be passed except by bill,” &amp;c ; “Ro law shall be revived,” &amp;c. “The general assembly shall not pass any local or special law,” &amp;c. “Ror shall the general assembly indirectly enact,” &amp;c. “Ror shall any law be passed granting powers or privileges,” &amp;c. “Ro local or special bill shall be passed giving any extra compensation,” &amp;c. “ The general assembly shall not delegate to any special commission,” &amp;c. These expressions manifestly have reference solely to future legislation, while the language of the 21st section is applicable to then existing as well as prospective legislation. It is equivalent to saying : Ro Act of the general assembly now in force or hereafter to be passed shall limit, &amp;c. If this. be so, it follows that the second section of the Act 'of 1868 is inconsistent with the Constitution, and therefore not within the protection of the second section of the schedule. Moreover, in endeavoring to determine the full scope and meaning of the section, it should be considered, as a whole in the light of the evil intended to be remedied by its adoption. It is very evident , that the evil at which it was aimed was the obnoxious statutory limitation as to the amount of damages to be recovered, and the time within which suit for the recovery thereof had to be brought, in the class of cases therein mentioned; and it is equally clear that the purpose' was to apply the constitutional remedy forthwith, and thus avoid the risk of possible tardy legislation on the subject. The closing words of the sec<a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>tion, “ and such Acts now existing, are avoided,” were doubtless intended to refer to the Act limiting the amount as well as that limiting the time within which suit might he brought for the recovery of damages.</p>
