It is not the spirit or letter of the Act of Congress that national bank stock should be taxed, if 5 per cent, of the “ other moneyed capital ” is so taxed, and 95 per cent, is <em>exempt. </em>When Congress spoke of “ other moneyed capital,” it meant the corpus or vast bulk of such capital and not a minute portion of <em>it. </em>But a better reason is to be drawn from the purposes of Congress in creating the restriction under consideration. Its purpose undoubtedly was to protect national banks from unfair discrimination ; its creature, its instrumentality, was not to be taxed to death by the state, nor even taxed to its injury as contrasted with other moneyed capital. Equality (perfect equality, if attainable : Davis, • J., in Lionberger <em>v. </em>Rouse, 9 Wallace 468) with other moneyed investments of the citizens of the states — no greater taxation than that which the citizens of the states impose upon themselves — this was the rule by which protection was to be afforded to this national agency.</p>

If the legislature can tax five per cent, of the moneyed capital in the hands of the citizens'of the state at a high rate and exempt the other ninety-five per cent., then it can without difficulty tax national banks out of existence. If the Act of Congress means “ other moneyed capital which is taxed by the law of the state,” then it will be perfectly easy for a state to tax some insignificant stock at a rate practicably destructive, then impose the same rate upon national bank shares and thus destroy the <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>national banking system. For instance, Pennsylvania might impose a tax of ten per centum per annum upon the shares of canal company stock, exempt all other moneyed capital and then tax national banks at the same rateas the canal companies. A construction which produces such a result cannot be right and we have then the converse as the only alternative.</p>

In several cases the subject has been under discussion by the supreme court of the United States and by other courts, but always in cases where taxation of other moneyed capital was the rule and exemption was the exception, whereas here the fact is precisely the opposite, exemption is the rule and taxation the exception. The leading case of those referred to is Hepburn <em>v. </em>School Directors of Carlisle, 23 Wallace 480. In this case Waite, C. J., said : “ This is a partial exemption only. Necessarily, there may be other moneyed capital in the locality than such as is exempt. If there is, money capital as such is <em>not </em>exempt. Some part of it only is. It could not have been the intention, of Congress to exempt bank shares from taxation because some moneyed capital is exempt.” And this is commented upon and explained in City Nat. Bank <em>v. </em>Paducah, 1 Thompson’s Nat. Bank Cases 309, as follows : “ In the ease of Hepburn <em>v. </em>School Directors it was held that the exemption of small amounts of moneyed capital, in particular cases, would not invalidate the tax, if the great body of money capital was subjected to it. However, the amount exempted was small in proportion to the aggregate amount of moneyed capital, and the great mass of moneyed property was subjected to the same tax levied upon the shares of national banks.” See also Everitt’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20Penn.%20216" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="71 Penn. 216">71 Penn. 216</a>; Lionberger <em>v. </em>Rouse, <a href="/us/76/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 Wall. 468" data-case-ids="3440892" data-case-paths="/us/76/0468-01">9 Wall. 468</a>; People <em>v. </em>Weaver, <a href="/us/100/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="100 U.S. 539" data-case-ids="4619" data-case-paths="/us/100/0539-01">100 U.

But the case of Hepburn <em>v. </em>The School District seems to embody the very contention which we have now before us. There, as here, it was said, as the state has exempted from local taxation mortgages, judgments, and <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens, therefore, the shares of national banks must, in like manner, be exempted. But here, as there, we may answer; this exemption, by your own showing, is but partial. Not only is some other moneyed capital of a miscellaneous character taxable for local purposes, but all such capital of the same character as that which you desire to exempt; that is to say, the shares of state banks, and savings institutions.</p>

In this we fully agree with the case of the People <em>v. </em>Weaver, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20U.S.%20539" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="10 U.S. 539">10 Otto 539</a>, that no discrimination against the capital invested in national banks can be allowed ; if taxed at all, it must be taxed as is like capital of the citizens of the state. But in the case now in hearing, our attention has not been called to any such discrimination as apparent from the laws of this commonwealth. The general assembly has authorized the taxation of the shares of these banks in no other manner, and at no higher rate than other capital of a similar character. It is true that certain investments, such as judgments and the like, have been exempted; these, however, are but partial exemptions, and it cannot be justly alleged that either in intention or in effect is this legislation specially adverse to these banks.</p>
