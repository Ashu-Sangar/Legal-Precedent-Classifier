Hamilton and any one or all of these creditors, thus reached in the distribution ; they are entitled to their money, whether they had actual notice or not, even allowing the Hamilton judgment to share in the distribution, they are entitled to their claims. It is, therefore, immaterial and unnecessary to inquire, whether there were any facts or circumstances which gave them or any of them notice of the Hamilton judgment; the fact of such notice to them might be' admitted, and the distribution, as to them, would not be affected thereby. The controversy, therefore, necessarily arises between Elizabeth L. Hamilton, on the one part, and Clarissa Eve and Henry E.

Newberry, “guardian of several minors,” for $2,400 entered 27th January 1881. This judgment is peculiar in form, the defendant, Henry E. New-berry, being the plaintiff therein, but as the judgment recites, in a general way, and the testimony discloses more specifically, the use for which it is held, the judgment is probably sustainable in equity, in relief of tbe persons interested therein. The plaintiff in this judgment, being the legally appointed guardian of those for whose use the same was taken, is the only person to whom notice could be given, touching the lights, interests and estates of his wards, to have any legal force or effect. Notice to the minors themselves would certainly avail nothing, but notice to their guardian is effective according to its purpose.</p>
