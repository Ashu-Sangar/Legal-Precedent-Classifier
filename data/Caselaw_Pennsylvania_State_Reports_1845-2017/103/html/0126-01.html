A. Richmond, trading under the name of Dr. S. A. Richmond &amp; Co., and doing business in the city of St. Joseph, in the State of Missouri, intending to invade the rights of complainant, has commenced to manufacture a compound medicine of a character similar to one of the said medicines manufactured and sold by complainant, and has sold and advertised the same under the trade-marks of complainant, saving a slight alteration in the same, to wit: By substituting the word “ Hervine ” in the trade-mark of the said Dr. S. A. Richmond <em>&amp; </em>Co., for the words “ Gift” and “Root and Herb Juices” in complainant’s trade-mark, and the said Dr. S. A. Richmond &amp; Co. have recently largely advertised the same in various parts of the United States,.and particularly in State of Pennsylvania, where complainant’s medicines are well known and highly valued. And complainant further complains that by the use of his trademark, altered as aforesaid, the said Dr. S. A. Richmond &amp; Co. well knew that they would be able to invade the rights of complainant, and that the public would be readily deceived in mistaking the medicines so vended by complainant as aforesaid. Further, that the use of his trade-marks so altered as aforesaid has deceived many persons who wrere willing and anxious to purchase the medicines of complainant; that the said firm of Smith, Kline <em>&amp; Go. </em>are now engaged in offering for sale the said medicines of the said Dr. S.

Because it is not alleged that there is any imitation or similarity between the appearance of the labels and wrappers alleged to be used by the defendants. Eighth. Because it appears by said bill that the only similarity in the names or words used by the defendants is in the use of the ríame “ Samaritan,” and that the name “ Samaritan,” being the name of a place, and, further, having a well understood and popular use, derived from the parable of the Good Samaritan, whereby it is popularly used to signify or describe any act, matter, or thing of a charitable or benevolent nature for the purpose of relieving the wounded, sick or afflicted, no trademark can be taken in such a word, it belonging in this use to the genera] popular vocabulary.</p>
