I do not think that the signature in question can have a two-fold force — one as a contract growing out of the certificate, and the other as an indorsement of negotiable paper.

The defendant was both maker and payee, and his promise to pay to his own order, six months after date, at a place specified, was certain and unconditional. The indorsement that “ the within obligation is given for goods bought by me,” followed by. a delivery, constituted a sufficient' transfer. The unnecessary averment in the certificate of transfer, that the maker owned property of a certain value in excess of his ■liabilities should not prejudice or affect it. • The certificate does not contain any condition .or contingency which would delay or impede the collection of the note.

The affidavit of defence denied the genuineness of Heller’s signature on the back. By rule 15 of the court of common pleas of Luzerne county, when, in such an action as this, a signature is denied by affidavit, the plaintiff must prove the signature before offering the note in evidence. This was not done in the present instance, and no indorsement whatever has been legally shown. But even if the signature of Heller were genuine, it does not amount to a legal indorsement. Indorsement technically means, writing one’s name on an instrument with intent to incur the liability of a party who warrants payment of the instrument, provided it is properly presented for payment to the principal and the indorser duly notified of his refusal : Daniels on Negotiable Instruments, § 667. The writing on this instrument is simply, First, a certificate that Heller has |4,000 worth of property; Second, that the paper was given in settlement of claims between him and the Queen City Fertilizing Company.</p>

They contain a statement as to ¿lie indorser’s pecuniary responsibility and the consideration of the note. It was unnecessary and perhaps foolish for the maker to put all this over his signature as indorser. ' But he has done it, and as it does not vary his contract as maker and indorser, we are unable to say, as a matter of law, that the note was not indorsed as required by the commercial law. Nor was the learned judge strictly- accurate in saying that the signature cannot have a two-fold force. The indorser may waive protest over his indorsement, which manifestly gives a two-fold character to his signature and affects the rights of the parties.</p>

The usual form of indorsement, is by writing the name of the indorser across the back of the note. When the note is payable to order any order in writing is sufficient which shows an intent to pass the title. Thus : “I give this note to A., George Ohaworth,” was held to be a sufficient indorsement: Chaworth <em>v. </em>Beech, 4 Vesey 555.
