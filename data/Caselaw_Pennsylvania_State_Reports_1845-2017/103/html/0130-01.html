      <em>“ </em>The payment of the annuities by the executors seems to have been a temporary expedient, which was planned by the testator to prevent the partial failure to the annuitants, which might otherwise have happened. The trustees are restricted to the income of the residuary estate as the fund from which this charge is to be mot; and it is doubtful whether if all the converted capital should be turned over to the trustees, the annuitants, in any year in which a deficiency might occur, could resort' to the executors for payment of the balance. It would seem safer, therefore, to the interests of the legatees to leave the payment of their portions in the hands of the executors, upon whom no such resti’ictions have been placed. While the testator evidently supposed that enough of his estate would be very speedily converted to constitute an ample fund for the use of the trustees, he also provided for any length of delay which might ensue. Three several provisos, in regular order, fix a lengthening time for the payments by the executors; they arc to pay during the first year after the death; then, if sufficient, funds have not accumulated, until the settlement of their first account; and then, if the deficiency continues, until they shall turn over sufficient funds to the trnstee. This last proviso is certainly large enough to cover the delay which has now occurred, and any possible doubt is removed by the words which immediately follow: ‘ The duty of said executors in respect to said annuities shall cease when they have placed the trustee iu possession of sufficient funds for the income thereof to enable the latter to assume the payment.’ This is only another form of saying that their duty shall continue until then.</p>

The testator knew that his executors might not be able, at once, to deliver sufficient funds to enable the trustees to pay the whole, and, therefore, in order to prevent a partial failure, he imposed a duty upon the former to make good the deficit out of the unconverted estate. His intention, however, would be defeated, not furthered, by construing a proviso, meant only to insure such payment, in such way as will violate the expressed direction to pay over proceeds from time to time by compelling the retention of everything until the executors shall be able to turn over enough to insure thereafter an income equivalent to the aggregate of the annuities. We carry out the entire intent by saying that until funds enough have been paid over to the trustees to meet the annuities, there shall be a duty upon the executors to appropriate so much of the income of the unconverted estate as shall be needed to supply the deficiency. The will does not say that until the executors have in hand, ready to pay over, sufficient funds, etc., hut “until they shall turn over sufficient funds,” which is consistent with the positive direction to pay over from time to time.</p>

He provided for the payment of seven annuities, amounting in the aggregate to a large sum. He directed substantially that until the executors should turn over a sufficient fund to the trustee to enable it to pay the annuities out of the income, the executors should continue to pay them. The executors have not yet converted the real estate into personalty so as to have in their hands a fund sufficient for that purpose. It manifestly was <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>not the design of the testator that the executors and trustee, should, at the same time, each be paying a part of the annuities. ■Until the income of the fund became sufficient to pay all the annuities, the executors were to pay them. When sufficient, the trustee must pay them. Hence the testator directs the executors to “ eventually pay and turn over” to the trustee the whole net capital of his estate after it shall have been sold and converted into personalty. Until they can pay over to the trustee a fund large enough to produce an income sufficient to pay the annuities, a compulsory order to pay over is premature. There is no allegation of any mismanagement of the fund by the executors, either in delaying to convert the land, or in neglecting to properly invest the funds in their hands.</p>
