Hartman, and offered in evidence in this ease, was discounted by the First Rational Bank of Lancaster for the benefit of D. G. Swartz, and that the proceeds went to his credit; that D. G. Swartz was at that time a director of the bank; that on or before the 25th of July 1877, and before George H. Hartman guaranteed' the note, Í). G. Swartz delivered to the First Rational Bank of Lancaster the following paper, to wit: ‘I hereby guarantee the payment of all notes drawn by Diller <em>&amp; </em>Groff and indorsed by me, now held by tlie First Rational Bank of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, whether matured or to mature. D. G. Swartz. July 25th, 1877.’ That, at that time and afterwards, D. G. Swartz, who was a regular depositor of the .First Rational Bank of Lancaster, had money enough to his credit to pay.this note; that George H. Hartman made this guarantee on July 25th 1877, <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>the day the note became due, and that the First National Bank of Lancaster has never made the slightest effort to collect this note from David G.

His guaranty, alleged to have been given to the bank before the maturity of the note, was virtually a waiver of protest so far as he was concerned. If <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>his contract relation to the bank was such that it could have compelled him to pay the note, it was • bound to do so before resorting to the plaintiff in error, who was strictly a technical guarantor.
