      <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>On January 27th. 1869, Galland &amp; Go., rented from the plaintiff, Hofman, for the term of five years, a store, at $775 per annum, with the privilege on the part of the lessee of holding for another term of ten years. The lessee assigned the lease in January, 1864, to the defendant, Rohrheimer, who was accepted as tenant by Hofman. Rohrheimer notified Hofman that he elected to hold the premises for the further term of ten years, and he held over and paid the rent from 1874 to 1878, at the rate specified in the lease, viz : $64.58 per month. “ About April 1878, Rohrheimer requested a reduction of rent, and after some discussion between them it was reduced to $600 per annum, to be paid in monthly payments of $50 each. The rent, was reduced, as plaintiff testified, on account of the dullness of the time. Receipts from Hofman to defendant were given in evidence, each for $50 in full for one month’s rent, beginning .with June 15th 1878, and including April 16th 1880. The rent for the month ending May 15th 1880, having been settled by a previous trial, the present suit was for the rent from May 15th 1880. The plaintiff notified the defendant on the 26th May, 1880, that from and after the 15th May 1880, he would be required to pay $64.58 rent per month, according to the terms of the written lease. The defendant refused to pay more than $50 per month, by reason of the reduction of rent made in June 1878.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b426-5" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[285,1445,1168,556]]]'>“ The plaintiff and the defendant were the only witnesses examined before the court. They agreed that the rent was reduced to $600 per annum, but disagreed as to the length of time this reduction was to continue. Rohrheimer testified that nothing was said on this subject at the time, and he understood the reduction to be for the unexpired part of the term. Hofman, on the other hand, testified that he said he would reduce the rent “ for the time being.” The defendant having paid on account of rent .at the rate of $50 a month down to and subsequent to the bringing of this suit, the present action is brought to recover the additional amount claimed by the plaintiff, to wit: $14.58 per month, for eleven, months, from 15th May 1880, to 15th April 18S1, $160. 38, with interest.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Second. — [But we also think that the verbal agreement to reduce the rent was without consideration, and was, therefore, not binding upon the plaintiff.

This we conclude from the fact that tlxe only motive which led to the reduction was on account of the dullness of the times, from the fact that the agreement to reduce was only verbal; presumptively, a change in the rent to run to the end of the term would have been added to the lease, or at least put in wi’iting; and fi*oxn the further fact that the testimony of the plaintiff on the subject is positive, and that of the defendant mainly negative in its chai’acter.]</p>

The finding of fact by the court is entitled to as much weight as the- verdict of a jury. If a jury had arrived at the same conclusion that the court has on the same evidence, the verdict ought not to be disturbed. This finding of fact, appears to be supported by the evidence and controls the case.</p>
