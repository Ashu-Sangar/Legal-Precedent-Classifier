Zell, brother of David Zell, owed to one Mrs. Burk the sum of $941.49 ; on April 28th 1879, he procured David Zell to exchange two promissory notes with him, aggregating said sum, payable one and two years after date. Isaac Zell, having indorsed David Zell’s said two promissory notes, offered them on April 30th 1879, in payment of said indebtedness, to Mrs. Burk, who refused to accept them in that form, but she was willing to apeept a judgment note. Her agent thereupon filled up the judgment note in suit and gave it to Isaac Zell, who took it home with him, signed his own name and forged his brother’s name •thereto, and returned it to Mrs. Burk. David Zell knew nothing of this until September 2d 1880, when, as testified to by his sister, Isaac Zell, in conversation with David and herself, said to David : “ David, I must confess to you concerning this note. Those two notes which you gave me — when I took them to Mrs. Burk, she was dissatisfied and would not receive them, and I took the two notes and put them into one note and signed your name <em>to </em>it.” David Zell, in cross-examination, did not <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>deny this statement, but said that he did not know what kind of a note it was that Isaac referred to, until very recently when he consulted counsel to get the judgment opened; that he did not, during the conversation referred to, ask Isaac any questions about it, because he was provoked; he did not see Mrs. Burk about it, “ because ho thought there would be honor enough in them to let a body know; didn’t even ask when they would be due.”</p>

For this reason, and this reason only, the court declines to make the rale absolute; and therefore the rule is dismissed.”</p>

There is no evidence that he directed or authorized it to be written. Inasmuch however, as he did not, when first informed of the forgery, forthwith seek the plaintiff in the judgment and proclaim-the forgery, the court held this to be such an acquiescence on his part as to estop him from now setting it up. ¥e think the evidence shows no element of an estoppel. He neither said nor did anything to induce her to take the note. He had no knowledge before she took it, that his name purported to be subscribed thereto. *■’ It is not shown that she could have protected herself in any manner against loss, had he notified her as soon as he obtained information of the forgery.. Ho law imposed such prompt action on him. . The forger died insolvent a few days thereafter. Prompt disclosure would not have availed her. She could not have acquired anything thereafter, and she released nothing. It was clearly error not to open the judgment and permit the appellant to make defence.</p>
