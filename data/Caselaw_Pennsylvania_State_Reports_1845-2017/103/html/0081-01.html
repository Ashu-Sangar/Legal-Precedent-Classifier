J., the following facts appeared : — Laber was treasurer &lt;j&gt;f a beneficial society which became embarrassed and unable to continue business. A committee of seven members was appointed to collect and distribute the assets. Laber owed the society money which he failed to pay. A new treasurer was elected in his place, and a committee of three was appointed to settle with Laber. They caused him to be arrested on a charge of embezzlement, and in order to effect a settlement Laber gave the check in suit to J. M. Moyer, the attorney acting on behalf of the committee of three, saying at the time that he had no money in bank, but that if presentation was delayed until the following Monday he would make a deposit to meet i|t. The check was given on Wednesday, March 16th 1881. The society permitted Moyer to retain the check, in payment of fees due him, and on the Friday following Moyer passed it to the plaintiffs in a business settlement for a full consideration, without notice to or inquiry by the plaintiffs as to the circumstances under which the check had been given. On the same day the committee of seven, by their attorney, notified Laber toj pay no money belonging to the society to any one except said committee; whereupon Laber notified Moyer that he would not pay the check nor make any deposit to meet it. Moyer received this letter a few hours after ho had passed the check to the plaintiffs.</p>

According to the testimony óf Mr. Moyer, he paid the check to the plaintiffs on Friday. The fact that the check was taken by the plaintiffs two or three days after its date is a fact for the jury, and any other facts in connection with it might be received to show that the holder was put upon inquiry, but the fact standing alone is not notice of the defense here set up. It is not denied that Laber owed the money, and there is no reason that I can see why he should not pay it. The secretary testified that the society .was indebted to Mr. Moyer, and paid the check to him, and if that is so, a payment by Mr. Laber, even if it was the society’s money, would be a payment by the society and they would be bound and Mr. Laber with it.’’</p>
