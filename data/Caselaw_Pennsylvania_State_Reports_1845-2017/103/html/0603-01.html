Burner in Davenport, Iowa, in the latter part of October 1877, and on the 10th day of November 1877, they, together with Alice Nissley, went to the law-office of Joseph A. Crawford, in Davenport [there is a dispute as to whether E. A. Bailey was there or not] ; he, Crawford, drew an assignment for the legacy from Josephine R. Thompson to Harriet B. Burner. C. II. Kent, a notary public, took the acknowledgment of Josephine R. Thompson to the same, and it was witnessed by E. A. Bailey and Alice Nissley. For the purpose of setting aside the assignment, Josephine R. Thompson says in her deposition that Alice Mayberry signed the paper under a fictitious name, that of Alice ■Nissley ; that the paper was never read to her, and that it was represented to her that it was only for the purpose of getting her the money ; that she was not mentally competent to transact any business whatever, and was wholly under the influence of Harriet B. Burner. And to establish her mental condition,, depositions of a number of persons were taken, varying from A. Lewis, who says her mind and health were good enough in the fall of 1877, to Dr. Sliouse,who says she was not of sound mind from 1875 until the middle of November 1877, and one witness says she was not sharp, another that she talked foolish, and another that her mind was weak. A number of depositions were taken as to the character for truth and veracity of Harriet Burner, which say it is bad. E. A. Bailey says he was present at the execution of the <em>assignment; </em>that there were present Josephine R. Thompson, Harriet B. Burner, Crawford, and he is not sure about Kent, signed the paper as a witness, and saw some money paid about that time. Alice Fite, alias Mayberry, testified before your auditor, that Josephine R. Thompson, Harriet B. Burner, Crawford, Kent and herself were all that were present; that the paper was not read or any money paid <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>at tlie time of its execution ; that she did not sign the paper. Alice Nissley said that she did not sign the paper at all. Aud to sustain the assignment, Harriet B. Burner, the assignee, Alice Nissley, one of the witnesses, Joseph A. Craw-ford, the attorney who drewr the assignment, testify substantially to the same that it was made for the consideration therein mentioned ; that her mind and health were good ; that the paper.was read to her, and the money paid. Crawford says the transaction seemed satisfactory to all the parties. Mary Jane Orndorff says Josephine R. Thompson showed her money that she said she received from Harriet B. Burner for the assignment, shortly after that time.”</p>

Section 57, Act 29th March 1832, requires that the petition shall set forth facts necessary to give the court jurisdiction, the specific cause of complaint, supported by oath or affirmation. The legacy was not charged upon land. The executors were liable and had provided for that liability, and the court, as well as the parties, had notice by the answer. The money had not been paid to the- claimants, because of the inability on the part <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>of the legatee to contract; and of fraud and want of consideration on part of the claimants, three distinct allegations made by the legatee; each of which is determinable only in a court of common law or equity.

The first error assigned, viz: that “ The court erred in directing an account to be filed after answer to citation; court had no jurisdiction,” cannot be sustained. The testator had been dead'more than a year. No account of his estate had been filed. The petitioner, the appellee, was entitled by assignment to a legacy under the will of testator. She did not know whether the estate was solvent or not. The proper way to ascertain that fact was by petition to the Orphans’ Court for an account. After the account was filed her claim was disputed, and the Orphans’ Court was the proper tribunal to determine whether she was entitled to the legacy by virtue of her assignment or not: McGettrick’s Appeal, 2 Out. 12. The court exercised their discretion in refusing to grant ’an issue. The Act of 29th March 1832, sec. 55, Purtlon Í108, authorizes the Orphans’ Court to send an issue to the Common Pleas for the trial of fact by a jury whenever they shall deem it expedient to do so.

The Act of the 29th of March 1832, confers on the Orphans’ Court the power to direct an issue to the Common Pleas, but the exercise of tiiat power is left to the discretion of that court. Even should an issue be directed aud a verdict be had thereon, that verdict is no more binding upon the court than is an Auditor’s report. Whether the finding of fact be by the verdict of a jury, or by the report of an Auditor, the court is bound to revise it, and is responsible for its rectitude. So when the case comes to us we are not to inquire whether the facts have been settled by a verdict, an Auditor, or the court itself, but, in the language of the Act of the 16th of June 1836, we are to try, hear and determine the merits of such case, and to decree according to the justice and equity thereof. The idea, therefore, of an appeal from the action of the Orphans’ Court, on its refusal of a motion for an issue, has no support either in the letter or reason of the law.</p>
    <p id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[168,1107,1167,474]]]'>The complaint that the court was without jurisdiction to order the executors of William R. Ralston to file an account, and to make distribution of the balance of the estate found in their hands undisposed of cannot be sustained. The Orphans’ Court certainly has jurisdiction,, upon petition of any oue interested, to direct either executors or administrators to file their accounts, and when such accounts are filed to order distribution to be made to those entitled, whether creditors or legatees. So also had the court the power to determine as between the legatee, in this case, aud her assignee, which of the two was entitled to the legacy : MeGettrick’s Appeal, 2 Out. 9.</p>
    <p id="b623-6" data-blocks='[["BL_623.6",623,[165,1579,1169,858]],["BL_624.1",624,[300,430,1183,901]]]'>Then, as to the evidence, we fail to see that the court erred in approving the findings of the Auditor. It is hardly necessary to repeat what has been so often said, that a court ought not hastily set aside the conclusions of a Master or Auditor upon the facts of a case submitted to him. This ought to be done only upon the discovery of some plain and obvious error, or where the whole evidence shows such a preponderance against his finding, that, were it a verdict of a jury in a Court of Common Pleas a new trial ought to be granted. Here we find nothing of that kind ; the proof of insanity, or want of mental ability on part of the assignor to execute the assignment, was more than doubtful. It is true, if we were to take the evidence on part of the appellant as verity, we might be compelled to conclude that thei-e was a manifestation of some mental aberration about the time of the execution of the paper in controversy, hut this, in face of the adversary proofs produced by the appellee, we cannot do. Moreover, the prima facie presumption is in favor of her competency, and upon her devolves the task of rebutting that presumption. Of her sanity at the time of the audit there is no doubt; her own testimony is conclusive <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>of this, and if she was mad at the time of the execution of the assignment, it is remarkable that neither the attorney who drew that paper, the witnesses who attested it, nor the notary public who took the acknowledgment, observed that fact. Moreover, her own uncle was at that time present for the purpose of identifying her as the'proper assignor, and to him she declared, on being asked her object in making the assignment, that she was that much smarter than her brother and sister ; that whilst she had got her share of the estate, they would get nothing. Tírese circumstances would seem to clearly indicate her entire ability to dispose intelligently of her property, nor does there seem to have been a single fact apparent during the whole •transaction that would indicate the contrary. We also think the Auditor, was justified in finding that she received a full consideration for this assignment, and if such were the case we would not be over-nice in scrutinizing her mental condition. She may have been, as she herself says, in a weak condition when she executed the assignment: but whether weak or strong she needed the proceeds of her property for her support and maintenance, and having received them in good faith, we cannot agree to annul the contract by which they were obtained.</p>
