The return to the vend ex., stated that the property was sold to L. W. Peck for $3,010, and that he failed to comply with his bid. The record further showed that on December 1st 1881, the return was amended by leave 'of court so as to show the true name of the defendant, J. W. Peck. This amended return was objected to, on the grounds that the amendment was asked after the sheriff had gone out of office, and that it was granted over six years after the bid had been made, and thestatuteof limitations had run.

That rule does not apply to the facts in this case. Here the sheriff is merely the legal plaintiff in the action ; but it is solely for the benefit of the lien creditors entitled to the fund : Tindle’s Appeal, 27 P. F. Smith 201. The money, however, is not to be distributed on the trial of this cause. After the recovery is had, and due notice to all, claiming to share in the fund, a distribution will be made. They are not parties to this suit, and the precise quantum of their shares are not to be determined now. The amendment was properly allowed.
