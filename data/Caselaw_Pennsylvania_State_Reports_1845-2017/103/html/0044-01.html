      <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>The court charged the jury, inter alia, as follows : “ It is true that, at common law, a deed from a husband directly to his wife, was void, and that for the reason that they were considered one person in law, and it could have no more effect than if you convey your farm to yourself. But since the Act of 1848, relating to the separate property and rights of married women, they have the right to hold all their own property independent of and separate from their husband’s control, if they see fit; at least he cannot convey it away or encumber it, and even if he would get possession of her personal property it would not be absolutely his, as between them. She might follow it, as against him, if there were no rights of creditors intervening. [Therefore, if you find that Allen conveyed his land to his wife on the 6th day of April 1871,the date of this deed, and was free from debt, and it was done in good faith, with no intention to hinder, delay or defraud future creditors, upon debts that might be incurred in hazardous undertakings ; and if you also find that, in consideration of their living apart, he set apart to her the horses, wagon and harness, under the agreement that if he took it back he would convey to her this land —then the plaintiff cannot recover. Mrs. Allen can hold the land under that deed.] (Ninth assignment of error.) Even at common law in Pennsylvania, before the Act of 1848, while the law itself made a deed between husband and wife void, equity would interfere but would allow her to hold a reasonable part of his property, where the question of creditors did not intervene. [Thompson here claims to be a creditor. The evidence shows that he was not a creditor mi til more than a year after the conveyance. If so, and Allen was out of debt, was there anybody for him and his wife to intend to defraud ? If not, I think he may give his property to his wife, and nobody can intervene except creditors existing at the time, if the deed is made in good faith, and not with the expectation of going into hazardous undertakings, by which debts may be incurred.] (Tenth assignment of error.)</p>

He could hold the land if such was the intention of the parties. [It seems that they lived there for several years after the deed was given, and Allen did get in debt. But in order to affect Mrs. Allen, the intention and purpose must have been dishonest when she took the deed. Is there anything to show that she knew that he would become <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>indebted to any persons a year or two after that ?

    <p id="b64-6" data-blocks='[["BL_64.8",64,[295,637,1172,512]]]'>It is true a deed from a husband directly to his wife is a nullity at common law. Under modern legislation and the application of equitable principles, a wide departure has been made from the common law, in respect to the ability of a wife to acquire and hold property. Her right of acquisition and power of control is not restricted to property obtained from one not her husband. When not in fraud of creditors of the husband a conveyance from him directly to his wife may be sustained on equitable principles : Coates et al. <em>v. </em>Gerlach, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%2043" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 Wright 43">8 Wright 43</a>; Townsend et al. <em>v. </em>Maynard, 9 Id. 198; Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Co. <em>v. </em>Neel, 4 P.

    <p id="b64-7" data-blocks='[["BL_64.9",64,[296,1150,1172,131]]]'>A husband may not only convey directly to his wife for a valuable consideration : but he may also convey to her as a gift when not prejudicial to his creditors.</p>
    <p id="b64-8" data-blocks='[["BL_64.10",64,[296,1280,1175,257]]]'>The main effort here, appears to have been to sustain the conveyance as a sale and purchase for a valuable consideration. Conceding that the subsequent failure of consideration which led to the conveyance, weakens this branch of the defence, yet if the conveyance can be sustained without the aid of the. original transaction, it may be valid as a gift.</p>
    <p id="b64-9" data-blocks='[["BL_64.11",64,[295,1530,1170,766]]]'>This conveyance is attacked by one who was not a creditor of the husband when it was made. The evidence does not show that he was indebted to any person at that time. The debt under which the plaintiff claims was contracted more than a year thereafter. When the deed was made he had no creditor to defraud. The jury have found that it was made in good faith with no intention to hinder, delay, or defraud future creditors, on debts arising from hazardous undertakings. Under these facts he had a right to convey the land as a gift to his wife. She took and may hold it against the claims of all creditors who were neither defrauded nor intended to be defrauded by the conveyance. It matters not that this land w'as all the real estate he owned, and a large proportion in value of all his property. The conveyance being under seal implies consideration. The assertion of title by the wife against the subsequent creditors ©f her husband is no evidence of fraud in her prior acquisition of the property. The case was well tried and we discover no error in the record.</p>
