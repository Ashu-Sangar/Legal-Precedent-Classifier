The plaintiffs relied chiefly on the testimony of Wm. L. Banning (who acted as the agent of William Hollinshead), the entries in Mr. Whitaker’s books and his settlement of August 16th 1852.

First, of course, he to be paid back out of the security that this gave him, the money advanced to protect the estate. . . . There never was a more solemn understanding made between mortal men, than was made in regard to that transaction. . . .

And all, from the inception of the idea of purchasing the mortgage, up to the time of the consummation of the sheriff’s sale, all, with the positive, understanding; that he bought it in for the estate, and that he would restore it to the estate; all the time saying that he,wanted security for the amount of money that he had advanced.</p>

L. 532), as a bar to the proceeding. Where no money is advanced, there must be something more than the violation of a parol agreement in relation to land, in order to raise a trust which equity will support: Story’s Eq. Jnr. sec. 1201 ; Bisph. Eq. sec. 80. This principle is recognized in numerous cases. If nothing more existed in this transaction than the breach of Whitaker’s alleged agreement, the case would be within the rule above referred to. The rule is different, where one procures a title which lie could not have obtained except by a confidence reposed in him, which he has abused; the trust in such a case arises ex maleficio, and the purchaser will be treated as a trustee, for the purpose of working out the equity of the injured party. The plaintiffs, in their bill, charge fraud on the part of Whitaker in procuring the title, which wonld bring the case within the rule above referred to, if the trust is established by evidence, clear, explicit and unequivocal Kistler’s Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 400. But the question to be decided is as to the operation of the sixth section of the Act, upon this proceeding. The Act of 1856 was evidently intended to quiet the title to real estate, and to remove some of the uncertainties that clouded it. This appears from the title, the preamble, and the body of the Act.. It is a highly beneficial statute, and ought to be liberally construed. The sixth section provides that, “ no right of entry shall accrue, or action be maintained, for a specific performance of any contra(¡t for the sale of any real estate, . . . or to enforce any implied or resulting trust as to realty, but within five years after such contract was made, or such equity or trust accrued, . . . Provided, That as to any one affected with a trust, by reason of his fraud, the said limita<a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>tion shall begin to- run only from the discovery thereof; or when, by reasonable 'diligence, the party defrauded might have discovered the same. . . ' And provided, That any person who would be sooner barred by this section shall not be thereby barfed for two years from the date hereof.” It is clear from the proviso in the section, as to persons aifeeted with a trust by reason of their fraud, that trusts ex maleficio are within the Act. . . The trust as to this property arose, if at all, with the acquisition of title by Whitaker, in 1851. The eldest of these plaintiffs was not horn until 1853, and it was earnestly contended that the section is prospective, and the plaintiffs being minors, were not included in its operation. The authorities, however, show that the Act has no saving clause for minors and others, under legal disabilities; and'that this section is retroactive, appears in the final proviso, giving two years to those whose rights would be sooner barred by its operation: Maul <em>v. </em>Rider, 1 P. F. Smith 384; Warfield <em>v. </em>Fox, 3 Id. 385; Douglass <em>v. </em>Lucas, 13 Id. 12; Korn <em>v. </em>Browne, 14 Id. 58; Christy <em>v. </em>Sill, 14 Norris 380. In the Master’s opinion, the-settlement of August 16th 1852, discharged any obligation incumbent upon Whitaker. His promisé, whether to the trust estate, or to William Hollinshead, rested upon parol, and was extinguished by the receipt of the trustee and the release of William. Hollinshead; and the only witness who is called to prove the fact, and the terms of the obligation, gave his written declaration in approval of that settlement. The order of court, restoring Edmund I. Hollinshead as trustee, was made in the exercise of the discretion allowed by the seventeenth section of the Act of 14th June 1836 (Purd. .Dig. 1418), and imposed certain restrictions, which were personal to him. His successors, although not required to give security (Rigler <em>v. </em>Cloud, 2 Harris 361), were appointed without limitation or reference to this order; and each.of them was invested with the powers and authorities of the original trustee. “ The policy of the statute requires that it should receive a liberal construction,” and the discretionary powers given to a trustee by deed, will, upon his removal, pass to his successor appointed by the court of common pleas under the Act referred to : Kuhler <em>v. </em>Hoover, 4 Barr 334; Wilson <em>v. </em>Pennock, 3 Casey 238. There was no restriction upon Samuel Rhodes as trustee, and his right to receive the money, in discharge of the obligation, cannot be questioned. If he committed a breach of trust by permitting Hollinshead to receive the money, the present proceeding affords no remedy for his wrong-doing.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b181-6" data-blocks='[["BL_181.6",181,[143,492,1175,1279]]]'>“ We are of opinion that complainant’s case, whatever its merits may be, is barred by the analogy of the statute of limitations, and the reasoning of the Master upon this point is adopted as expressing the views of tlie court upon the facts as the Master was then considering them. But the Master does not find that there was any actual fraud, nor concede it, except arguendo. As Robert Whitaker was only connected with the parties at the time as husband of one of the co-tenants, between whom there had been a parol partition, sanctioned at least as a provisional division of the estate, by an order of the Court of Common Pleas, entered July 7th 1846, in the case of the Hollinshead estate, it might welf be doubted whether any resulting trust arose from his purchase at the sheriff’s sale. (See the remarks of Stkong, J., in Maul <em>v. </em>Rider, 1 Sm. 383.) But we do not desire to rest the case upon this point. W e have examined the whole evidence carefully, and fail to find any evidence of actual fraud by Whitakei;; and if he was liable to account at all, it was by virtue of a resulting or constructive trust arising from his position in relation to the other parties. In such cases of constructive fraud, the better opinion is that the statute of limitations runs from the date of the act committed, and not from the time of the discovery. (See Morrell <em>v. </em>Trotter, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20Leg.%20Int.%20256" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="39 Leg. Int. 256">39 Legal Intell. 256</a>, citing Musselman <em>v. </em>Eshleman, 10 Barr 394, and Waterman <em>v. </em>Brown, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Cow.%20161" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Cow. 161">7 C. 161</a>.) We are, therefore, of opinion that the complainants are barred by the express words of the sixth section of the Act of 1856, in addition to the grounds assigned by Master in considering the proviso relative to cases of fraud. With these views, which dispose of the whole case, we deem it unnecessary to review the numerous exceptions in detail.”</p>
