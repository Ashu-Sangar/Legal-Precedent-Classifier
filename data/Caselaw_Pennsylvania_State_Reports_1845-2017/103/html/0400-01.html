The agreement further provided that the vendor was to let “ said Alanson Knapp have a convenient road or way to get out on the public' road with said timber, without charging any damages, and to let said A. Knapp have all said timber, excepting the bark which is peeled and the staves which are made already, and to give him possession of the timber immediately, and also to leave him four years’ time from the above stated date to take off said timber.”</p>

In 1860 or 1861, Michael Hortung died and all 1ns lands, including the tract, of which the timber had been granted, descended to Samuel Hortung, the defendant, as heir at law. During the winter of 1861 and 1862, Knapp hauled some logs from the tract and deposited them in a meadow belonging to the defendant and not included in the written agreement. This was done with the verbal consent of Samuel Hortung, upon condition that the logs should be taken off in the spring, before they would injure the grass. The plaintiff further contended and offered evidence to prove, that on April 2d <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>1862, Knapp went upon this meadow for the purpose of hauling away the logs which he had deposited there ; that he found Samuel Hortung, with men, team and horses, sawing up and carrying away these logs. That upon making a demand for this timber, Hortung refused to surrender it and wrongfully carried it away and converted it to his own use; that the only way by which he could haul away the remaining timber upon the tract was across this meadow.</p>

That on the contrary two notices had been given to Knapp to remove them. That he failed for two weeks after the first notice to do anything toward their removal. That thereupon the defendant proceeded to remove the same from the land. The defendant claitned that his acts did not amount to a trespass, for which the plaintiff could recover as to these logs, in the form of action which the plaintiff had elected. That the placing of the logs on the lands, their continuance there, the custody which defendant had of them while in his care on his land, arose out of their verbal contract in relation thereto, and that when the plaintiff failed to remove logs within the time agreed upou,,and permitted them to remain on the meadow to the defendant’s injury, he was not liable in an action such as this, if he removed them.</p>

That it is the uncontradicted evidence in this case that the timber placed by Knapp in the meadow was placed there by the permission of Samuel Hortung, to be removed by Knapp at such time as would do no injury to the grass; that said part of the meadow was not included in the articles of agreement of <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>16th February 1859, and that by reason of said verbal agreement Hortung became the bailee of said timber, and Knapp having failed to remove such timber, if the jury find notice was given, and that the same was reasonable, and Hortung, having removed the same, would not thereby become liable in this action of trespass, and the verdict of the jury as to such , timber should be in favor of the defendant.</p>

    <p id="b418-12" data-blocks='[["BL_418.14",418,[278,1912,1168,258]]]'>The plaintiff has certainly been unfortunate in this case. The first trial, resulted in a.verdict in his favor. He was not' satisfied with the amount and the court below set it aside on his motion and granted a new trial. Upon the second trial there was a .verdict for the defendant, and as the case is presented here we see ho stíffiéient grounds of reversal.</p>

The allegation is, not that it is <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>bad law, but that it misled the jury. It is not so assigned for error however, and we are unable to see that it was misleading. It fairly submitted to the jury the question whether the defendant excluded the plaintiff from any part of the locus in quo, which included the meadow. The jury .were further told that if the defendant appropriated any of the logs in the meadow without plaintiff’s consent it would bo a trespass; but if there was no breach of plaintiff’s close. and no appropriation of his logs, there could be no recovery. This was well enough, and if the plaintiff desired more specific instructions he should have asked for them.</p>
    <p id="b419-6" data-blocks='[["BL_419.6",419,[181,881,1170,851]]]'>The second and third assignments allege error.in the answers to points. The plaintiff’s third point was substantially affirmed. The answer was that if the jury find the facts as stated in the point “ then we affirm this point.” What the plaintiff has to contend with here is the verdict. The court affirmed his law, but the jury did not find his facts. Nor do we see any material error in the affirmance of the defendant’s sixth point. It is true the learned judge inadvertently fell into error when he said the defendant was a bailee of the logs in the meadow, but it was a harmless error. Calling him a bailee when he was not did the plaintiff no injury. The material instruction was that if the logs were placed in the meadow by plaintiff with defendant’s permission, that the plaintiff was to remove them at such time as to do no injury to the grass; that if plaintiff failed to remove said logs after a reasonable notice to do so, and the defendant thereupon removed them, he would not thereby become liable in an action of trespass. Here again, if there was any error it was on the part of the jury. The case was left to them with proper instructions, and it is not our province to revise verdicts. . ' .</p>
