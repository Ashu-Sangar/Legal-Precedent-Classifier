    "head_matter": "Haverstick\u2019s Appeal.\n1'. Where the context in a will shows that the testator used the word \u201cheirs\u201d in the sense of children, it will be so construed.\n2. A testator bequeathed to the children and grandchild of his deceased sister (naming them) a sum of money in equal parts or shares, and provided as follows: \u201c Should any of the above named not survive me then their shares to go to their legal representatives in equal parts or shares, and should any of them die before the distribution of my estate. without heirs, then the part allotted to such, shall be divided equally among the others named.\u201d One of said legatees died soon after the testator\u2019s death,, without leaving issue to survive her: Held, that by the words, \u201cwithout heirs,\u201d the testator meant \u201cwithout children,\u201d and that the bequest over to the other legatees named in the will therefore took effect. Held, further, that neither the surviving husband nor the administrator of the deceased legatee was entitled to take\u00bbthe share which said legatee would have taken if living.\nApril 19th 1883.\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunket, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ.\nAppeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court of Montgomery county : Of January Term 1883, No. 176.\nThis was an appeal by Horace Haverstick, administrator of Mrs. Melcense McAlonan, from a decree of the said court dismissing his exceptions to the report of an Auditor in the matter of the distribution of the balance in the hands of the executors of Eli Stover, deceased, and confirming the said report.\nThe facts of the case were as follows: Eli Stover died September 4th 1881, having by his will, dated October 11th 1879, proved September 20th 1881, provided, inter alia as follows:\n\u201cItem. I give, devise and bequeath in the first place unto the children or legal representatives of my deceased sister, Mary, who was intermarried to Abraham Hendricks, the sum of four thousand dollars ($4,000,) in five equal parts or shares as follows: To Mary Hartzell, wife of John Hartzell, eight hnudred dollars. To Aaron H. Harley, son of Isabella Iiarley, deceased, the sum of eight hundred dollars. To Aaron Hendricks the sum of eight hundred dollars. To Mary Ann Detwiler, wife of William Detwiler, the sum of eight hundred dollars. To Melcense Shrawder (widow) the sum of eight hundred dollars.\n\u201c Should any of the above named not survive me, then their share to go to their legal representatives, in equal parts or shares, and should any of them die before the distribution of my estate, without heirs: then the part allotted to such shall be divided equally among the others named.\u201d\nThe said Mrs. Melcense Shrawder, widow, married Archie McAlonan in May 1881, about four months prior to testator\u2019s decease. She died November 19th 1881, about ten weeks after the testator. She left her husband surviving, but no issue. Letters of administration on her estate were granted to Horace llaverstick, who appeared before the Auditor appointed to distribute the estate of Eii Stover and claimed the $800 as bequeathed to Mrs. Shrawder under the above cited bequest. The Auditor rejected the claim of Mrs. McAlonan\u2019s administrator and decided that the testator meant that if Mrs. Shrawder died without children, her share should go to \u201c the others named,\u201d and also that the husband was not \u201c an heir.\u201d\nThe Auditor therefore distributed the legacy or sum of $800 which would have gone to Mel cense McAlonan, had she been living, to Elizabeth Hartzell, Aaron II. Harley, Aaron Hendricks and Mary Ann Dotwiler.\nExceptions filed by Horace llaverstick, administrator of Mrs. McAlonan, deceased, to the said findings and report of the Auditor were dismissed by the court and the report was confirmed. Whereupon, the exceptant took this appeal, assigning for error the decree of the court.\n11. K. Weand, for the appellant. \u2014\nUpon the death of the testator, the bequests vested in the legatees subject to be divested only in case a legatee \u201c died before the distribution of the estate \u201d and \u201c without heirs.\u201d By a violent change in the language used by the testator, the court below substituted the word \u201c children \u201d for \u201c heirs.\u201d There may be cases where the evident intent of the testator would warrant sncli a construction ; but we contend that there is nothing in this case to show that the testator did not use the word \u201c heirs \u201d in its usual and ordinary sense as understood by laymen, viz., \u201c those who inherit from each other:\u201d Rewalt v. Ulrich, 11 Harris 388. Under this definition, the surviving husband of the legatee was entitled to take as heir or representative of his wife within the meaning of the will: Patterson v. Hawthorn, 12 S. & R. 112; Buckley v. Reed, 3 Harris 83; Gibbons v. Fairlamb, 2 Casey 218; 2 Redfield on Wills cap. XIII. \u00a7 4,d. The fact that the husband can take, excludes from consideration the bequest over to the \u201c others named :\u201d Biddle\u2019s Appeal, 19 P. F. S. 190; Rewalt v. Ulrich, 11 Harris 388; Letchworth\u2019s Appeal, 6 Casey 175. The fact that the legatee died before actual distribution did not affect the legal question of the vesting of the'legacy.\nCharles Hunsicker and Aaron Swartz, for the appellees.\u2014\nThe bequest was to Mrs. Shrawder, widow, with a bequest over, in default of her leaving heirs, to the other nephews and nieces. Had Mrs. Shrawder died a widow without issue, no question could have arisen as to the intent of the testator. The fact that at her death she left to survive her a second husband, does not, we submit, either obscure or illumine the question of the testator\u2019s intent. It being quite clear from the context that the testator used the word \u201c heirs \u201d in the sense of children or issue, the court below was justified by the precedents in so construing it: Berg v. Anderson, 22 P. F. S. 90; Fahrney v. Holsinger, 15 P. F. S. 388; Bundy v. Bundy, 38 N. Y. Ct. of Appeals 421; Myers\u2019s Appeal, 13 Wr. 113.\nMay 7th 1883."
