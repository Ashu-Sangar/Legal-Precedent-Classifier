        "text": "Chief Justice Mekcui\u00ed\ndelivered the opinion of the court,\nArticle IV., section 2 of the constitution of this Commonwealth declares \u201c the supreme executive power shall be vested in the governor.\u201d Section 8 declares he shall nominate, \u201c and by and with the advice and' consent of two thirds of all the members of the s\u00e9nate appoint,\u201d certain officers therein named, \u201c and such other officers of the Commonwealth as he is or may he authorized by the constitution, or by law to appoint.\u201d\nArticle VI., section 4, inter alia, provides, \u201cthat appointed officers other than judges of the courts of record, and the superintendent of public instruction, may be removed at the pleasure of the power by which they shall have been appointed.\u201d\nSection lof the Act of f 8th April 1878 declares, \u201c Recorders of cities of the first class shall be appointed by the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate.\u201d Under this Act the plaintiff in error was appointed recorder of the city of Philadelphia.\nIt will be observed that the appointment was made under a statute which departs from the language of the constitution in two respects. It omits the word \u201c nominate \u201d and declares the recorder shall be \u201cappointed\u201d by the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate, wholly omitting the words \u201c two thirds of all the members\u201d thereof.'\nConceding the language of this statute may not give to the governor any more controlling power relating to the appointment than if it had adopted the words of the constitution, yet it in no wise attempts to narrow that power.\nThe office of recorder of this city is not one of the officers named in the constitution. Article XII., section 1, declares, \u201c all officers whose selection is not provided for in this constitution shall be elected or appointed as may be directed by law.\u201d Although the office of recorder has existed here, under various changes of powers, for nearly a century, yet the plaintiff in error holds the office in virtue of legislation enacted under the constitution of 1874. That legislation prescribes the manner in which the recorder, shall be appointed. It recognizes the governor as the appointing power.\nAs already shown, the Constitution declares in section 8 cited, the governor shall nominate and he shall appoint. Before he completes the appointment the senate shall consent to his appointing,the person whom ho has named. It may prevent an appointment by the governor, but it cannot appoint. It may either consent or dissent. That is the extent of its power. There its action ends. It cannot suggest the name of another. If it dissent the governor cannot appoint the person named. If it consent he may or may not, at his option, make the appointment. If for any reason his views as to the propriety of the proposed appointment change, he may decline to make it. That option is not subject to the will of the senate.' Until the governor executes the commission, the appointment is not made. Prior to that time at his hiero will, he may supersede all action had in the case : Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137; Story\u2019s Con. \u00a7 1540.\nThe language of section 8 of the Constitution cited, gives further evidence that the governor is recognized as the appointing power. Thus he can nominate such officers only as he is or may be authorized by the Constitution, or by law \u201c to appoint.\u201d Again, the temporary commissions which he may-grant to fill vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate, is limited to offices to which \u201c he may appoint.\u201d Thus, whenever and wherever the Constitution speaks of the appointing power, it recognizes it as being vested in the governor. JSTowhere does it declare that the senate can appoint. The whole tenor and spirit of the Constitution, in speaking of the power of appointment, recognizes that it is lodged in the governor. He is charged with the duty \u201c to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d The senate may not be in session for a year and a half at one time. The powers of the governor are never suspended. He'is at all times duly authorized to 'exei\u2019cise \u201c the supreme executive power.\u201d The fact that an officer may be removed by the dilatory process of impeachment, creates no argument against the summary power of removal by the governor. Crime, imbecility or gross neglect of duty may demand that an officer shall be removed at once. The power to protect the people of the Commonwealth by prompt action is wisely given to the governor. In giving construction to the Constitution we cannot assume that he will abuse that high trust.\nIn considering where the power of removal is lodged, we may draw some light from the interpretation given to the Constitution of the United States. It declares the president \u201c shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint\u201d officers therein named. It is silent on the question of removal of any officer, but declares the judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold the offices during good behavior. As to other officers, congress in 1789 affirmed the right of removal to exist in the president, Avithout any cooperation of the senate. That vieAV was acquiesced in as the true construction of the constitution until the passage by congress of the Tenure of Office Act of 2d March 1867,' which was superseded by the Act of 5th April 1869, of a modified character. Apart from this legislation, the fact that the consent of the senate was necessary to authorize the president to appoint, did not prevent him from removing the officer\u2019s at his pleasure.\nThe constitutional right of the governor to remove from office, differs from that of the president in this: It does not rest on power implied, but on poA\\rer expressly given. Hence, the cases cited by counsel for the plaintiff in error are not applicable to the present case. They were decided under former constitutions, in which there was no express declaration as^ to whom the power of removal was given. The present contention is determined by ascertaining in whom the power of appointment is vested. As we have shown, the letter and the spirit of the Constitution both unite in declaring this power to be in the governor, it necessarily follows that officers appointed by him, other than those excepted, may, in the language of the Constitution, be removed at his pleasure. It follows the learned judge committed no error in entering judgment for the Commonwealth upon the demurrer.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Lane versus Commonwealth ex rel. The Attorney General.\nThe governor of this commonwealth has power, alone, without the concurrence of the senate, by virtue of the provisions of art. YI. section 4 of the constitution, to remove at his pleasure, during their terms of office, recorders of cities of the first class appointed under the Act of April 18th 1878 (P. L. 26).\nMay 4th 1883.\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas No. 3, of Philadelphia county: Of January Term 1883, No. 411.\nQuo warranto, by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, at the relation of Lewis C. Cassidy, Esquire, Attorney-General, directed to David H. Lane, requiring him to show by what authority ho exercised the office of recorder of Philadelphia.\nThe information set forth that by the Act of April 18th 1878, entitled \u201c An act to define the term of office and enlarge the duties of recorders of cities of the first-class,\u201d it is provided that recorders of cities of the first-class shall be appointed by the governor; that by virtue of the power vested in Hon. Henry M. Hoyt, then Governor of the State of Pennsylvania, he did, by and with the advice and consent of the senate of Pennsylvania, on January 30th 1879, appoint to said office of recorder of the city of Philadelphia, one David II. Lane, and the said David H. Lane did by virtue of said appointment enter upon the duties of said office, and from that time perform and discharge the duties of said office ; that on February 1st 1883, Robert E. Pattison, then being Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, did by virtue of the power vested in him by the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth, remove the said David H. Lane from the said office of recorder of the city of Philadelphia, and of said removal gave him personal notice; and that notwithstanding the premises, the said David H. Lane unlawfully intrudes himself into the said office, and usurps the same contrary to, law. The information therefore suggested that a writ of quo warranto should issue, which was accordingly done.\nThe defendant pleaded that on January 30th 1879, he was nominated by His Excellency Henry M. Hoyt, Governor of the said Commonwealth, and by and with the advice and consent of two-thirds of all the members of the senate of said Commonwealth, appointed recorder, as in the said information it is suggested, for the term of ten years, pursuant to the provisions of the Act of April 18th 1878, entitled, \u201cAn Act to define the term of office, and enlarge the duties of recorders of cities of the first-class,\u201d wherein it is, inter alia, provided, \u201c that recorders of the cities of the first-class shall be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and \u25a0\u2022.consent of the senate, and shall hold their offices for the term of ten years from the date of their appointment, and until their successors shall have been duly appointed, and qualified,\u201d to fill a vacancy .then existing in the said office \u2014 the right and power of filling the said vacancy was then concurrently and exclusively vested in the said governor and senate aforesaid, in the manner aforesaid ; and the said defendant was on January 30th 1879, duly qualified in all respects as required by law, to accept the said office, and by force whereof, and of his said appointment, and the laws aforesaid, he did then take, and has continuously from thenceforth, taken upon himself the exercise and enjoyment of said office of recorder, and has behaved himself well in his said office, and that by reason whereof, and of the laws of said Commonwealth and the Constitution thereof in this behalf, he is entitled to continue in his said office, and not be disturbed therein,'or be removed therefrom, unless it be shown that he has been impeached by the House of Representatives of this Commonwealth, or convicted of misbehavior in the said office, or of some infamous crime, or that he has been removed therefrom by the-power that appointed him, as aforesaid; and he further said that He had not been impeached by the House of Representatives of said Commonwealth, nor convicted of misbehavior in his said office of- recorder, as aforesaid, nor of any infamous crime, nor-been removed by the power that appointed him. Wherefore the said defendant prayed judgment, and that the said office, liberties, and franchises, in the form aforesaid claimed \u25a0 by him, might'be adjudged and allowed to him, and that he might be dismissed and discharged by the court in the premises. '\nTo this plea the Commonwealth demurred, generally, on the ground that the same, and the matters therein contained, were not .sufficient in-law to bar her from having her aforesaid writ against the defendant; and specially, because the assertion in the said plea filed, that the power to remove resides concurrently with the governor and senate, is not a sufficient answer to the suggestion filed.\nThe defendant joined in demurrer, and prayed judgment thereon, which was entered by the court in favor of the Commonwealth, FranETTEB, J., delivering the opinion. Thereupon the defendant took this writ, assigning for error the action of the court in giving judgment for the Commonwealth on the demurrer.\nAmos Briggs, for plaintiff in error.\n\u2014 The only question involved is whether the governor alone has power to remove the recorder. The article of the Constitution on impeachment and removal from office provides that certain officers may be removed by \u201cthe power which shall have appointed them.\u201d What then is the power which appoints the recorder? Art. 4, section 8 of the Constitution says the governor \u201c shall nominate\u201d (not appoint), \u201cand by and with the advice and consent of two-thirds of all the members of the senate appoint.....such .....officers of the Common wealth,\u201d <fcc., among which officers the recorder is included. Before the governor can appoint he must have the advice and the consent of the senate, and if that body advises adversely, the nomination fails. This clearly shows that alone he has no power to appoint; and this fact further appears from the succeeding section of the Constitution which provides that \u201c he shall have power to fill all vacancies which may happen in offices to which he may appoint, during the, recess of the senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of the next session.\u201d This language limits the appointing power of the governor in vacation to the close of the next session of the legislature, when the advice of the senate may be obtained'to make the appointment valid. It follows that the appointing power is the concurrent act of the governor and the senate, and under art. 4, section 8 of the Constitution the governor alone cannot remove from office. This view is supported by the decisions : People v. Bissell, 49 Cal. 408; United States v. Avery, Deady\u2019s Rep. 208; Field v. People, 2 Seammon (Ill.) 107; People v. Molyneux, 1 Hand (N. Y.) 113; United States v. Guthrie. 17 Howard 284; Taylor v. Hebden, 24 Md. 202; Watkins v. Watkins, 2 Md. 354; Tappan v. Gray, 9 Paige 507; The People v. Cazneau, 20 Cal. 503; The People v. Tilton, 37 Id. 619; The People v. Carrique, 2 Hill (N. Y.) 93. The power of removal exercised by the president under \u00e1 similar section of the Constitution of the United States is based upon the legislative authority of congress, in their construction of the clause: 1 Kent\u2019s Com. 309; Story on Const. 1537, 1538, 1542 and 1,543; Vol. 1, Abridgment of the Debates of Congress 85-108. It must logically follow that the withdrawal of such authority would destroy the power.\nLewis C. Cassidy, Attorney-General, for the defendant in error. \u2014\nThe governor, alone, is the appointing power in this case. The senate in no sense appoints, it simply gives its advice to the man who does appoint. He alone selects the person, and by his signature to the commission can furnish the only evidence of appointment. The; appointing power under our Constitution is the same as that provided in the constitution of the United States; under that instrument it has always been held that the president could remove officers without the consent of the senate : Ex parte Hennen, 13 Peters 230. The appointment and removal of officers is essentially an executive act, and if the constitution had been silent on the subject the president, or as here the governor, must have had full and sole powrer to make all appointments. The duties of the senate are exclusively legislative, except where other power is expressly given. \u2018 No power of appointment is given in any case to the senate, but is in express terms in this particular case given to the governor. Because part of the process of making the appointment requires that he shall take the advice of the, s\u00e9nate, does not in any degree impair his power or transfer any part of it to anyone else. The reasons for giving it to the president alone will be found thoroughly considered : Pomeroy op the Constitution, 3 Ed. 431-2-3-4. See as to the same 1 Kent\u2019s Com. 287-310; 2 Story on Con. \u00a7 1541-2. \u201cThe senate has but a slight participation in the appointments to office. The president is to nominate and appoint, and the senate is called upon merely to confirm or reject the nomination:\u201d 1 Story'on Cons. \u00a7 752. The appointment is the sole act of tlie president: Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cr. 157-161. It is of the essence of executive power that it should be always Papable of exercise: Sfanbery\u2019s Opinion, 12 Att\u2019y G\u00e9n\u2019l Op. 35-40. The power of removal belongs to the president alone and this now has been maintained since the first congress: Sergeant on Con. 372-3.\nMay 23d 1883."
