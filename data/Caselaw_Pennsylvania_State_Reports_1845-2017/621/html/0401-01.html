    <p id="b464-7" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[279,782,1150,1049]]]'>Appellant was first convicted of possession of child pornography in 2001. That conviction resulted in a sentence of five years’ intermediate punishment which Appellant completed in September 2006. In January 2007, the .police received a cyber-tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that Appellant had sent and received images of child pornography by computer. A search warrant was issued for computers and related items located in Appellant’s residence. The evidence seized from Appellant’s bedroom as a result of the search included a computer and multiple DVDs containing dozens of video clips and hundreds of photographs of children engaging in sex acts. Subsequent forensic analysis showed that the computer had been used to share this illicit material online. Appellant was arrested and arraigned on child pornography charges, and the Commonwealth, although not required to do so at that point in the proceedings, informed Appellant that if convicted, he would be subject to a 25-year mandatory minimum sentence under the provisions of the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9701-9799.9, at Section 9718.2 (Sentences for sex offenders).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

For each clip, the Commonwealth presented corresponding expert testimony that at least one of the persons seen engaging in sex was less than eighteen years of age. The videos were graphic, and a number of them showed very young children, some of whom appeared to be toddlers, being anally and/or vaginally raped by adult men. The jury convicted Appellant of 29 counts of “sexual abuse of children — child pornography,” 18 Pa.C.S. § 6812(d)(1), and one count of criminal use of a communication facility, 18 Pa.C.S. § 7512.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The court ordered a pre-sentence investigation and a hearing to determine whether Appellant was a sexually violent predator (“SVP”) pursuant to Section 9795.4. At the SVP hearing, the Commonwealth presented evidence that Appellant had sent instant messages on the computer seized from his bedroom, attempting to solicit adult women in the Philippines to commit sex <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>acts upon children at his direction while he watched via live web-cam. A member of the Sexual Offender’s Assessment Board testified that in his opinion, Appellant met the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia and the legal criteria to be deemed an SVP. Thereafter, the court determined that Appellant was an SVP, and sentenced him to 29 concurrent mandatory terms of 25 to 50 years’ imprisonment for his convictions of sexual abuse of children — child pornography, and a concurrent sentence of 1 to 7 years’ imprisonment for his conviction of criminal use of a communication facility. The court also ordered that Appellant be subject to lifetime registration with the state police under Section 9795.1(b)(3).</p>
    <p id="b466-5" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[271,961,1149,899]]]'>Appellant appealed to the Superior Court, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that his sentence under Section 9718.2 violated the prohibition against “cruel and unusual punishments” contained in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the prohibition against “cruel punishments” contained in Article 1, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence, and determined, as a threshold matter with respect to Appellant’s constitutional challenge, that Appellant had failed to show that the length of his sentence raised an inference of gross disproportionality when compared to the gravity of his crime. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant also argues that the Superior Court erred to the extent it affirmed his judgment of sentence on the basis that the possession of child pornography creates a demand for the production of child pornography. Appellant claims “this type of supply-and-demand analysis has little place in determining whether the sentence was grossly disproportionate[.]” Appellant’s Brief at 12.</p>

Amicus Curiae’s Brief at 18, 21-22.

Appellant’s amicus also contends that such <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>blurring leads to the “anomaly” that the mandatory minimum sentence here exceeds by 500% the otherwise applicable statutory maximum penalty for a felony of the second degree under the Crimes Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The Majority has explained at length why this crime, though it may not involve the persons who actually committed the horrific assaults upon the children depicted in the images, nevertheless is pernicious and loathsome; the demand for the <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>images directly encourages the unspeakable abuse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>

The General Assembly has classified any conviction under Section 6312(b) as a second degree felony, even for a first offense, exposing a defendant to a maximum of ten years imprisonment for a first offense, or subsequent offenses. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. 1103(2). A conviction under 6312(c) is legislatively classified as a third degree felony for a first offense (seven year maximum under 18 Pa.C.S. 1103(3)), and a second degree felony for a second or subsequent offense (ten year maximum, 18 Pa.C.S. 1103(2)).</p>

Under 18 Pa.C.S. § 1103(3), therefore, the maximum term of imprisonment to which an offender might be sentenced for this crime is seven years for a first offense. In fact, for his first offense, appellant was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment at all, but to 60 months of intermediate punishment, with credit for time served. A second conviction for the same offense is classified more seriously, as a second degree felony, but the General Assembly still has not deemed the offense to be as serious as the underlying sexual assaults of children that are depicted. Absent the mandatory sentencing provision, a second time offender would be subject to a maximum term of ten years imprisonment under 18 Pa.C.S. § 1103(2). As a result of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9718.2(a)(1), however, the mandatory minimum for a second offense for possession of child pornography is twenty-five years, which is the same term facing recidivist offenders under Sections 6312(b) and (c).</p>

The recidivist provision, however, draws no such distinctions, and treats the third most serious offense the same as the most serious one. An individual such as appellant, who is convicted of possessing child pornography for the second time, is mandated to serve a least five more years of prison time than the maximum term allowable for a first time child rapist.</p>

For example, I do not understand appellant's position as being that his crime was a "simple, non-serious, possessory offense” involving "so-called ‘dirty pictures.' " Rather, the core of appellant's argument is that, while an offense against children cannot be taken lightly, his sentence is cruel because it is disproportionate to his crime in that it far exceeds sentences imposed on other offenders for similar behavior, as well as sentences imposed upon those who actually commit sexual assaults upon children, those who commit violent offenses inflicting serious bodily injury, and intentional killers. Appellant does not dispute that punishment for possession of child pornography properly may be severe. The question he poses is: how proportionately severe? Likewise, the Majority’s suggestion that appellant was an "after the fact” "willing voyeuristic participant” in the actual commission of the sexual assaults depicted gratuitously overstates the offense.</p>
