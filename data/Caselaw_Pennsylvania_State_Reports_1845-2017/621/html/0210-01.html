Appellant and his girlfriend, Victoria Adams, lived together with their 19-month-old son, Sidney Parrish, in an upstairs apartment located at Route 115 and Gilbert Road in Cresco, Pennsylvania. N.T. Trial, 3/27/12, at 40. Sidney was born with a heart defect and received a heart transplant in September 2008, when he was 9 months old. N.T. Trial, 3/26/12, at 7. As a transplant recipient, Sidney was required to take anti-rejection medications, which Victoria administered to him at around 8:00 p.m. each night, before he went to bed. N.T.

N.T. Trial, 3/28/12, at 98. As several hours passed and Victoria did not return, Appellant grew concerned that she would not be home in time to give Sidney his medication. Accordingly, Appellant began calling Victoria numerous times to inquire into her whereabouts and when she would return. <em>Id. </em>at 99. Victoria, who had been drinking, initially answered Appellant’s phone calls, but began ignoring them as the evening progressed. N.T. Trial, 3/27/12, at 77.</p>

When Victoria failed to return home in time, however, Appellant claimed that he grew increasingly worried and upset, and that he began to fear Victoria was cheating on him. <em>Id. </em>at 99. According to Appellant, when Victoria finally returned home that night, she was disheveled, laughed at him, and refused to answer his questions about where she was going with Sidney or where she had been. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 105.

Evidence introduced at trial further proved that Appellant acted -with malice and specific intent, as the autopsies revealed that bullets were recovered from vital body parts of both victims, including Victoria’s heart and Sidney’s brain.

The jury found the existence of the following aggravating circumstances with regard to both murders, reciprocally: Appellant was convicted of another offense that qualified for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment or death, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(10); and Appellant was convicted of another murder at the time of the offense at issue, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(ll); <em>see generally Commonwealth v. Chamberlain, </em><a href="/pa/612/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="612 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="4204791,4205247" data-case-paths="/pa/612/0107-01,/pa/612/0107-02">612 Pa. 107</a>, 182, <a href="/pa/612/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="30 A.3d 381" data-case-ids="4204791,4205247,7278610,7278801" data-case-paths="/pa/612/0107-01,/pa/612/0107-02,/a3d/30/0381-01,/a3d/30/0381-02">30 A.3d 381</a>, 426 (2011) (noting that multiple murders may serve as aggravating circumstances for each other). Notably, the Commonwealth also submitted a third aggravating circumstance to the jury: the victim, Sidney Parrish, was under the age of 12 at the time of the killing, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 971 l(d)(16). While there was no question at trial that Sidney was well under the age of 12 at the time of his death, based on the record before us, the jury did not find this aggravator. We note, however, that the trial court suggested this discrepancy may be the result of a photocopying error because the sentencing verdict slip for the death of Sidney Parrish is nearly identical to the sentencing verdict slip for the death of Victoria Adams. <em>See </em>Trial Court Opinion, 10/11 /12, at 4 n.3.</p>

With regard to mitigating circumstances, the parties stipulated that Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(1). Additionally, the jury found that Appellant was under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(2), and found the "catchall” mitigator concerning Appellant's character and record, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(8).</p>
