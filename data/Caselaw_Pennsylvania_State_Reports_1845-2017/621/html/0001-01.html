We agree <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>with the Commonwealth Court’s concerns that the prothonotary “lacks authority to interpret statutes, evaluate the merits of a litigant’s pleading, and decline to accept a timely filed document.” <em>Brown II, </em>at 420 (citing <em>Administrative Order, </em>at 9). The prothonotary, however, did not interpret the PLRA or evaluate the merits of appellee’s pleading — his motion to dismiss on the basis of “three strikes” required the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas to make these underlying determinations — the trial court did. While the prothonotary’s actions could be viewed as a rejection of a timely-filed complaint, the complaint was only rejected because it was missing some of the defendants’ addresses. Had appellee complied with the prothonotary’s request to amend his complaint, the prothonotary would have accepted it, as he has in many of appellee’s other cases regardless of his status as an unremitting filer of prison conditions litigation. Appellee chose to forego the standard procedures of the court and file a petition for writ of mandamus to force the prothonotary to accept his complaint, even though it was incomplete, rather than properly amend the complaint.</p>
    <p id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[279,1390,1150,677]]]'>Appellee demands this Court force the prothonotary to accept his complaint, containing prison conditions litigation allegations, just so the court may dismiss the complaint as prison conditions litigation. This is a clear waste of judicial resources, and in the interest of judicial economy, we hold this mandamus petition to force acceptance of a complaint about prison conditions is itself prison condition litigation within the meaning of the statute; it relates directly to an underlying complaint regarding prison conditions litigation. An individual may not skirt the legislature’s intent to preclude him from filing frivolous litigation merely by filing for an extraordinary writ. <em>See In re Smith, </em>at 1250 (“[I]t would defeat the purpose of the PLRA if a prisoner could evade its requirements____”).</p>

While the causal connection between the prothonotary’s actions and such injuries is foggy, appellee avers the prothonotary’s actions have had an effect on his life in prison.
