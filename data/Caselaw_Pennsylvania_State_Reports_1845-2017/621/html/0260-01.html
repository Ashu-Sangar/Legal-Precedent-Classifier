The MCARE Act also created the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Fund (the “MCARE Fund”), which is designated as a “special fund” within the state treasury. 40 P.S. § 1303.712(a). The MCARE Fund is administered by the Insurance Department of Pennsylvania. <em>See id. </em>§ 1303.713(a).</p>

      <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>Under the MCARE Act, Pennsylvania physicians, hospitals, and certain other health care providers, as a condition of practicing in Pennsylvania, are required to purchase medical professional liability insurance (or provide self-insurance) in the amount of $500,000 per occurrence or claim, and to participate in the MCARE Fund. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1303.711(a), (d)(2), (e). The MCARE Fund provides a secondary layer of liability coverage to providers by paying, subject to the fund’s liability limits, damages awarded in medical malpractice actions in excess of the required minimum level of professional liability coverage. <em>See id. </em>§ 1303.711(g). Presently, the fund’s liability limit is $500,000 per occurrence. <em>See id. </em>§ 1303.712(c). The MCARE Fund is funded by annual assessments levied upon health care providers based on a statutory formula, and loans secured, when needed, from other state funds, such as the Catastrophic Loss Benefits Continuation Fund. <em>See id. </em>§§ 1303.712(d), 1303.713(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Rather, the statutory formula for assessments levied against health care providers is designed to: (i) reimburse the fund for the payment of reported claims that became final during the preceding year; (ii) pay expenses of the fund incurred during the preceding year; (iii) pay principal and interest on monies that the fund borrowed; and (iv) create a reserve that is ten percent of the sum of (i)-(iii) above. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1303.712(d). At any time there may be unfunded liability arising from unreported or unresolved claims. If and when the Insurance Commissioner determines that the private insurance market has the capacity to satisfy professional liability requirements, the MCARE Fund will cease providing coverage for new liability. <em>See id. </em>§§ 1303.712(c)(2), 1303.711(d)(4). The fund will not immedi<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>ately terminate, however, as it will still be responsible for excess coverage on unreported or unresolved claims stemming from events that occurred during coverage years. Because assessments are based on the claims paid in the prior year, the MCARE Fund will continue to collect assessments until all claims for which it is responsible have been satisfied. The fund’s actuaries have projected that it may continue to pay claims — and thus, collect assessments — for forty years after the fund ceases to provide coverage. At that time, monies remaining in the fund are to be distributed to health care providers in proportion to their assessments during the preceding year. <em>See id. </em>§ 1303.712(k).</p>

      <em>See </em>Act of Oct. 9, 2009, P.L. 537, No. 50 (“Act 50”).

They alleged that the only way to preserve the status quo pending the outcome of the litigation would be to retain the monies in the MCARE Fund, since there was no guarantee that the Commonwealth could reconstitute the funds from any other source. The Commonwealth responded that a preliminary injunction was unwarranted because, <em>inter alia, </em>it was not needed to prevent immediate and irreparable harm. <em>See generally Warehime v. Warehime, </em><a href="/pa/580/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="580 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1100667" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0201-01">580 Pa. 201</a>, 209-10, <a href="/pa/580/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="860 A.2d 41" data-case-ids="1100667,9145660" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0201-01,/a2d/860/0041-01">860 A.2d 41</a>, 46-47 (2004) (reciting the six prerequisites that a party must establish to obtain preliminary injunctive relief, including a showing that such relief is necessary to prevent immediate and irreparable harm). The Commonwealth suggested, in this regard, that it could “make [Appellees] whole” by depositing $100 million back into the MCARE Fund in the event of an adverse judgment. Commonwealth’s Memorandum in Opposition to Petitioners’ Application for Special Relief in the Nature of a Temporary Restraining Order at 15, <em>reproduced </em>in R.R. 202a. By order dated October 19, 2009, the Commonwealth Court expressed agreement with the Commonwealth’s position in this regard, and denied the requested relief.

On April 15, 2010, the Commonwealth Court granted Appellees’ request in a published opinion, holding that the transfer of monies from the MCARE Fund to the General Fund was unlawful in that it impaired Appellees’ vested rights. <em>See Hosp. &amp; Healthsystem Ass’n of Pa. v.

Finding that the trans<a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>fer of $100 million from the MCARE Fund diverted those monies from their intended purpose of providing insurance coverage to participating health care providers and prevented them from ultimately being refunded to those providers upon the MCARE Fund’s termination, the court concluded that Appellees were aggrieved and had standing to bring the present legal challenge. <em>See <a href="/a2d/997/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="997 A.2d 392" data-case-ids="7287710" data-case-paths="/a2d/997/0392-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/997/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="997 A.2d 392" data-case-ids="7287710" data-case-paths="/a2d/997/0392-01">at 397-98</a>.</p>

Const, art. I, § 11 (“[EJvery man for an injury done him ... shall have remedy by due course of law[.]”); 1 Pa.C.S. § 1976(a) (“The repeal of any civil provisions of a statute shall not affect or impair any ... right existing or accrued____”).

It then noted that Sections 712(a) and 712(k) of the MCARE Act guarantee that the monies in the MCARE Fund will be used for MCARErelated purposes or returned to contributing health care providers upon the fund’s termination. Particularly in light of this latter observation, the Commonwealth Court ultimately held that Appellees have a vested entitlement — rising above the level of a “mere expectation” — to have the monies used for those purposes, and that such a right “cannot be extinguished by the addition of Section 1717.1-K of the Fiscal Code.” <em><a href="/a2d/997/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="997 A.2d 392" data-case-ids="7287710" data-case-paths="/a2d/997/0392-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/997/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="997 A.2d 392" data-case-ids="7287710" data-case-paths="/a2d/997/0392-01">at 401</a>.</p>

It acknowledges that Section 712(a) of the MCARE Act states that Fund monies “shall be used to pay claims against” health care professionals. The Commonwealth reasons, however, that statutory pledges are unenforceable as against subsequent General Assemblies, and that, in any event, the money has never been promised to providers themselves, but to the victims of their alleged malpractice. As well, the Commonwealth develops that, in the pre-budgetcrisis timeframe, the fund received well over $100 million derived from cigarette taxes and motor vehicle violation surcharges, which was used to fund abatements to provider assessments under the state’s Health Care Provider Retention Program (addressed more fully in <em>PAMS II). </em>Thus, in the Commonwealth’s view, it was entitled to reallocate at least $100 million on that basis alone. The Commonwealth contends further that the MCARE Fund has always met its statutory obligations, and there is no reason to believe that any future claim will remain unpaid as a result of the transfer of $100 million. Overall, the Commonwealth argues that, to hold that the already-paid-in money could not be diverted to <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>another governmental use would restrain legislative bodies from reacting to changing priorities and circumstances.</p>

First, the Commonwealth avers that the funding formula for calculating assessments is independent of the balance in the fund and, as such, it is independent of the amount diverted from the fund. Second, the Commonwealth maintains that, because the MCARE Fund has covered all claims for which it has been liable, Appellees have received the benefits to which they were entitled under the MCARE Act. Rather than suffering an impairment of a vested right, according to the Commonwealth, Appellees have received — and will continue to receive — fair exchange for their assessments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a>

In this respect, Appellees note that the language of Section 712(a) is mandatory, providing that MCARE money “shall,” rather than “may,” be used to pay claims against health care providers. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1303.712(a). Appellees proffer that the mandatory nature of the directive remains in force regardless of whether some monies have been included in the fund from non-provider sources such as cigarette taxes or vehicle violations, and regardless of whether the Governor’s manual classifies the fund as a trust fund or a special fund.</p>

Thus, because the MCARE Fund pays liabilities by levying annual assessments according to the statutory funding formula, and future liabilities are unfunded, Appellees reason that they will be subject to higher annual assessments to pay for present and future claims as a result of Act 50. In this respect, they also argue that, in the event the MCARE Fund has insufficient funds to pay claims and expenses, it will have to borrow money, a cost providers will have to bear via the following year’s assessments. Accordingly, Appellees state that it is immaterial whether they have received all to which they are entitled, as the Commonwealth highlights. Rather, Appellees aver that, regardless of the MCARE Fund’s history of claims payments leading up to Act 50, providers remain obligated to pay assessments sufficient to cover claims that will become payable in the future, and that the subtraction of a substantial amount of money from the fund to balance the 2009-10 budget cannot help but increase their future payments.</p>

Rather, it mandates that $100 million that had already been paid into the MCARE Fund be transferred to the General Fund. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 1717.1-K(1). At the time those monies were paid in, the governing statute provided that they “shall be used to pay claims against participating health care providers.” 40 P.S. § 1303.712(a). Such use was thus a legal consequence of their payment at the time they were supplied. The change in use dictated by Section 1717.1-K(1) alters that consequence and, as such, is retrospective in nature. <em>See generally Landgraf v.

To this end, MCARE conditions a medical provider’s ability to practice in Pennsylvania on participation in the MCARE Fund, which entails the payment of substantial monetary assessments within a statutory scheme that mandates that all such assessments be used to satisfy claims against the providers. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1303.712(a). This latter condition is the linchpin to having the system work as intended. The assessment program was never intended as a general mechanism to raise tax revenue and, furthermore, there is a rational relationship between the monies paid in and their mandated use under Section 712(a) so as to prevent the condition-of-doing-business aspect of MCARE from having extortive overtones.</p>

Although, as the Commonwealth points out, some of the monies in the MCARE Fund may have originated from sources other than assessments, the fact remains that all such monies were commingled and, upon entering the MCARE Fund, were dedicated to the fund’s purposes. The Pennsylvania Senate, as amicus, adds that the General Assembly must retain the authority to "re-appropriate [funds] as the public’s needs change from year-to-year,” and emphasizes that the 2009 budget crisis was severe. Senate’s Amicus Brief at 15-16. To clarify, we are not suggesting that Section 712(a) binds subsequent legislatures on how MCARE monies may be used going forward. The question is whether the General Assembly was free to redirect assessment monies already paid into the MCARE Fund at the time the 2009 budget legislation was enacted. If the Constitution precluded it from doing so, the severity of the fiscal crisis is immaterial, as the Senate acknowledges. <em>See id. </em>at 15.</p>

Appellees grounded their assertion of vested rights on the Due Process and Remedies Clauses. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. XIV; Pa. Const, art. I, §§ 1, 9; and Pa. Const, art. I, § 11. The Majority appears to credit Appellees’ argument that the nature of the MCARE Act created a vested entitlement to have the money in the Fund utilized in the manner directed by statute. The Majority also, however, holds that Appellees’ vested rights are immaterial if the money transferred from the Fund represented a surplus, deems the existence of a surplus to be a material fact in dispute, and remands for factual development in this regard. Because I believe that <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>Appellees have demonstrated that they have a constitutionally protected vested right to the monies in the MCARE Fund irrespective of whether there was a surplus, I would conclude that under the Remedies Clause, the transfer of monies out of the Fund unconstitutionally impaired that vested right.

The Majority chooses to address Appellees’ argument in terms of due process rather than the Remedies Clause because we have often considered the Remedies Clause as being directed to protecting accrued causes of action and defenses, and Appellees do not contend that they have a cause of action that has been undermined by legislative action.

This balance is comprised primarily of assessments from the health care providers in accord with the statutory funding formula in Section 712(d)(1), and accumulated under the legal compulsion that, absent formal participation, health care providers could not practice medicine in Pennsylvania. When the providers made contributions to the Fund via assessments pursuant to Section 712(d), the law afforded them the right to have the monies in the Fund used for specific purposes or returned to them upon termination. The balance in the Fund that was depleted by the 2009 budget legislation was the accumulation of these assessments. Indeed, between 2002 and 2008, health care providers paid nearly $1.5 billion in assessments to the MCARE Fund for its administration and for the medical professional liability coverage this special fund was created to provide.</p>

However, unlike the majority, I would not remand the issue to the Commonwealth Court for a determination of whether Act 50’s transfer of $100 million was from surplus monies. Again, in my view, that court has already decided that the assessment formula leaves no surplus. Furthermore, if the Commonwealth Court’s analysis in <em>Hosp. &amp; Healthsystem </em>is correct, there would appear to be a direct correlation between the $100 million transferred out of the fund by Act 50 and an increase in the aggregate assessment on Appellees the following year.

This approach, in my view, pays insufficient regard to the constitutional rule that this Court “has only that jurisdiction as is provided by law,” and is tantamount to allowing parties to confer jurisdiction on the Court, which cannot be permitted. <em>See In re Nader, </em><a href="/pa/588/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="244" data-cite="588 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="3787896" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0450-01">588 Pa. 450</a>, 461, <a href="/pa/588/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="245" data-cite="905 A.2d 450" data-case-ids="3787896,8467425" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0450-01,/a2d/905/0450-01">905 A.2d 450</a>, 457 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em><a href="/pa/588/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="246" data-cite="905 A.2d 450" data-case-ids="3787896,8467425" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0450-01,/a2d/905/0450-01">id.</a> </em>("The fact that Appellees in the instant matter agreed that the Order was appealable cannot confer jurisdiction on the Court if it is otherwise lacking.”); <em>see also </em>Pa.

Special revenue funds account for transactions related to resources obtained from specific revenue sources (other than for expendable trusts or major capital projects) that are legally restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. Special revenue funds account for federal grant programs, taxes levied with statutorily defined distributions, and other resources restricted as to purpose.
