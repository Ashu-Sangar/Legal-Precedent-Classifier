The PHFA explains that both it and Beneficial interpreted the statute as requiring the notice to inform the mortgagor of the opportunity for at least one of the two alternative types of meetings available under the statute. <em>See </em>Brief of <em>Amicus Curiae </em>PHFA at 10. In this regard, PHFA develops that the use of the word “or” gives rise to an ambiguity with two reasonable resolutions; namely, the General Assembly intended that: (1) the notice inform the mortgagor of the availability of either a meeting with the mortgagee or a meeting with a consumer credit counseling agency, and the mortgagor chooses between the two alternatives; or (2) the PHFA exercise its discretion in promulgating the notice and select among the alternative types of meetings. <em>See <a href="/a3d/37/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="37 A.3d 596" data-case-ids="7299798" data-case-paths="/a3d/37/0596-01">id.</a> </em>at 14 (citing <em>In re Paulmier, </em><a href="/pa/594/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="594 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="3595247" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0433-01">594 Pa. 433</a>, 448, <a href="/pa/594/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="937 A.2d 364" data-case-ids="3595247,8361411" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0433-01,/a2d/937/0364-01">937 A.2d 364</a>, 373 (2007) (engaging in a statutory construction analysis, and stating “[t]he word ‘or’ is defined as a conjunction ‘used to connect words, phrases, or clauses representing alternatives.’ ...

The PHFA asserts that, although the trial court and Superior Court read Subsection 403-C(b)(l) as only supporting the latter construction, its interpretation of this Subsection is also reasonable, since the statute does not designate who is to choose between the alternatives generated by the use of the disjunctive conjunction “or.” <em>See <a href="/pa/594/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="937 A.2d 364" data-case-ids="3595247,8361411" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0433-01,/a2d/937/0364-01">id.</a></em>

Brief for Appellant at 17-18; Brief of <em>Amicus Curiae </em>PHFA at 16-17.

Face-to-face meetings •with lenders or their representatives created challenges for meeting the goals of the program .... The Act imposes some procedural notice requirements upon mortgagees, but it has never required lenders to meet with borrowers. Lenders have never really been a part of the HEMAP application process and, therefore, could not help a homeowner apply for assistance. They could not be relied upon to document the occurrence of a face-to-face meeting with a homeowner consistently, or to notify other mortgagees of the meeting’s occurrence. Because the Act did not compel lenders to meet with homeowners, and the offices of most larger lenders are outside of Pennsylvania, many lenders were unwilling or unable to schedule a face-to-face meeting with a homeowner. In large part, the opportunity for a face-to-face meeting with the lender was illusory from the beginning of the program, and <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>homeowners’ efforts to meet with lenders wasted precious time.[<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>]</blockquote>

To better serve homeowners, to increase administrative efficiency, and to better control the timing of the HEMAP application process, the [PHFA] consciously and intentionally revised the Act 91 Notice to remove all references to the availability of face-to-face meetings with lenders or their representatives.</blockquote>

Rather, while that Subsection can be reasonably interpreted in this manner, I find the PHFA’s interpretation to be likewise reasonable. The PHFA construed Subsection 403 — 0(b)(1) as vesting the PHFA with the discretion of choosing among the alternative forms of a meeting to include in the notice that Act 91 directs it to promulgate; in my view, this is a rational construction of that Subsection given: the use of the disjunctive term “or” in the statutory language, <em>see </em>35 P.S. § 1680.403c(b)(l); the fact that Act 91 does not specify who is vested with the power to choose among the alternatives for the face-to-face meeting; and the statutory directive bestowing the PHFA with the authority to develop the notice that <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>mortgagees must provide to mortgagors prior to instituting foreclosure actions under Act 91, <em>see <a href="/pa/607/0377-02" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="7 A.3d 249" data-case-ids="4199059,7284059" data-case-paths="/pa/607/0377-02,/a3d/7/0249-01">id.</a> </em>§§ 1680.401 c(b)-(c); 1680.402c(a); 1680.403c(a)-(b).
