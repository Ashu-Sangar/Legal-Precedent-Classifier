Specifically, the Commonwealth Court explained that, in <em>Olenginski, </em>it examined the Pennsylvania Constitution and found that county prothonotaries are expressly listed as “county officers” under Article IX, Section 4. Moreover, county prothonotaries have no power to act in a judicial capacity or to act as an attorney; they perform ministerial functions derived from statute. Nor, as <em>Olenginski </em>noted, does the Pennsylvania Constitution provide that prothonotaries are part of the judiciary or supervised <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>by the judiciary. Thus, in <em>Olenginski, </em>the Commonwealth Court held that prothonotaries are “county officers” as opposed to “judicial officers,” subjecting them to being abolished by the legislature. Extending the reasoning of <em>Olenginski </em>to the instant case, the Commonwealth Court similarly concluded that the Pennsylvania Constitution provides that the office of jury commissioner is a “county office” and not a “judicial office.” Though recognizing the office of jury commissioner is not specifically listed as a “county office” in Article IX, Section 4 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, the Commonwealth Court concluded it is a “county office” from “time to time” provided by law such that it is part of the county government under this State’s Constitution.</p>

As indicated in our discussion <em>supra, </em>Chapter 21 of the Judicial Code, Sub-chapter C, provides that jury selection commissions consist of three people, including two elected jury commissioners and the county’s president judge (or another judge of court temporarily assigned to perform his duties), who is the chairman. 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 2121, 2122. The Judicial Code further provides that all of the powers and duties lie within jury selection commissions as a body. Specifically, Section 2124 provides, “[e]ach jury selection commission shall exercise the powers <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>and perform the duties vested in and imposed upon such commissions by Subchapter B of Chapter 45 (relating to selection and custody of jurors) and any other powers and duties vested in and imposed upon such commissions by law.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 2124. Furthermore, Section 2122 provides a jury selection commission has a quorum and “may act by a majority of its members.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 2122(e). Act 4 of 2013, as suggested by our discussion <em>supra, </em>permits the governing authority of a county subject to the law to eliminate the two elected jury commissioners, leaving the president judge (or another judge of court temporarily assigned his duties) as the sole remaining member of the jury selection commission. We agree with the Commonwealth Court that Act 4 of 2013 does not eliminate the jury selection commission as a body, does not permit local laws stripping from jury selection commissions the powers and duties conferred on the commission by Section 2124 of the Judicial Code, and does not authorize counties to opt out of the duties vested and imposed upon the commissions by Subchapter B of Chapter 45 of the Judicial Code (relating to selection and custody of jurors). Thus, for a county where the governing body elects to eliminate the elected office of jury commissioner, the president judge (or another judge of court temporarily assigned to perform his duties) will ensure that the county continues to compile lists of potential jurors in a manner consistent with the Judicial Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> On this issue, we simply find no merit to Appellants’ expressed concern that Act 4 of 2013 will do “nothing to safeguard the [jury] system itself or to prevent political or other influence [and] would undercut any future hope for a unified [judicial] system[.]” Appellants’ Brief pp. 23-24.</p>

While it is indisputable that the legislature may abolish government offices which it has statutorily created, the legislation accomplishing that purpose must, nevertheless, comport with the Pennsylvania Constitution. In my view, Act 4 of 2013 does not do so, as I deem meritorious Appellants’ claim that it violates Article II, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution because it constitutes an impermissible delegation of legislative power to counties regarding the conduct of a vital part of the operation of our unified judicial system — the jury selection process. In my view, Act 4 is constitutionally infirm because it <em>sub silentio </em>permits counties,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> through the abolition of the office of jury commissioner, to effectively supersede the comprehensive provisions of the Judicial Code which currently govern the jury selection process, while providing no guiding standards to those counties on how they are to carry out the jury selection process after abolition. Further, I consider Act 4 to deleteriously effect the administration of our unified judicial system by substituting the current uniform statutory framework for selecting jurors with a vast and possibly conflicting patchwork of local, <em>ad hoc </em>standards, which may ultimately be as varied as the number of counties in our Commonwealth. I would, therefore, reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court denying Appellants summary relief or, alternatively, pursuant to our supervisory authority over the Pennsylvania Unified Judicial System, promulgate specific rules of procedure to ensure that jury selection procedures remain uniform throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

Rather, these statutes demarcate a clear division between the commission’s duties as an independent body and the separate responsibilities of the court of common pleas. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 4521(f) (“On application by the commission, the court shall compel compliance with subsections (a)(2), (3) and (4) and (d).”); <em>id. </em>§ 4524, (providing that “[u]pon receipt of a court order pursuant to section 4531 (relating to issuance of court orders for jurors), the commission shall publicly select at random from the master list or jury wheel such number of names of persons as may be required to be summoned for assignment to jury arrays,” and also requiring that the array be made available at the offices of “the commission” for inspection at least 30 days prior to the first day on which jurors in the array are eligible to serve at a <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>trial); <em>id. </em>§ 4531 (providing that orders of the court directing the jury selection commission to select a jury array from the master list shall be issued in conformance with general rules of court); <em>id. </em>§ 4532 (specifying that “jurors shall be summoned to serve in a manner determined by the jury selection commission with the concurrence of the president judge.”).</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[269,641,1153,943]]]'>Critically, I note that the Judicial Code also sets a minimum quorum requirement in order for the jury selection commission to take any action — namely,, “a majority of its members.” <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 2122(e) (“Quorum. — A jury selection commission may act by a majority of its members.”). Since each jury commission is required by 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 2122(a) to have three members — a statutory provision that Act 4 did not amend — it may, therefore, act only if two of the three members of the commission authorize the action. If a county’s jury commission ceases to have the requisite three members, because the county has chosen to abolish the two jury commissioners, then, by the plain language of these statutes, the commission is no longer authorized to take any action. Consequently, when a county officially abolishes the office of jury commissioner it is also, in actual effect, eviscerating the jury selection commission as a functional body and depriving it of continuing authority to take any action, which includes performance of the aforementioned duties.</p>
    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.5",454,[269,1614,1150,736]],["BL_455.1",455,[183,311,1153,843]]]'>The majority correctly observes that Act 4 did not explicitly abolish the jury commission as a body; however, it also did not repeal or amend any of the aforementioned statutes setting forth the minimum required number of members, or eliminate the statutory requirement that the commission carry out its duties in the jury selection process while acting as a whole. While the majority acknowledges that Act 4 does not alter the statutory requirements setting forth the structure and operation of jury commissions in counties which abolish the office of jury commissioner, the majority nevertheless assures that, after abolishment, the president judge of the judicial district covering the county may, as the sole remaining member of the jury commission, single-handedly carry on at least some of its duties. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 388, 78 A.3d <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>at 1036 (“[F]or a county where the governing body elects to eliminate the elected office of jury commissioner, the president judge ... will ensure that the county continues to compile lists of potential jurors in a manner consistent with the Judicial Code.”). I have no doubt that president judges, who are all very able jurists, are capable of performing such a task, if provided with sufficient administrative and budgetary resources such an undertaking could require. Nevertheless, I respectfully submit that this consideration is irrelevant as there is simply no language in the above-referenced statutes governing the structure and operation of jury commissions which permits the president judge of the judicial district covering a county which has abolished its jury commissioners to act as “a jury commission of one.” Rather, the president judge is strictly limited by those statutes to act as a member of a three person commission.</p>
    <p id="b455-4" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[179,1178,1155,952]]]'>Further, when the jury commission functions as a three member body, the president judge is not solely responsible for the selection of the members of the jury pool which will be utilized for trials over which he or she may preside. Under those circumstances, the selection process is jointly conducted by all three members of the commission, which, as Appellants point out, was- explicitly structured at its inception to give the public confidence that the jury selection process was not within the exclusive purview of any one governmental official. If the commission were to operate with only one member, this would defeat that laudatory purpose, and it would place the president judge in the unenviable position of being solely responsible for selecting the very jurors who will hear cases in his or her courtroom. This is not, in my view, a position he or she should be involuntarily forced to assume, since, under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 4526, any challenge by a party to a juror array, which will now be selected at the exclusive direction of the president judge, must be heard by his or her court.</p>

The sparse language of Act 4 merely requires county commissioners, prior to abolition of the office of jury commissioner, to conduct a one-time “review of the procedures in effect within the county to ensure that lists of potential jurors are a representative cross section of the community.” 16 P.S. § 401(f). Act 4 does not otherwise specify which “lists” the county commissioners are to review, does not oblige the county commissioners to further maintain those lists, nor, critically, does not contain any requirement that, after their one-time review, the county commissioners must continue to maintain the very procedures which they have concluded resulted in a representative pool of jurors. I regard such a wholesale, standardless delegation of the jury selection commission’s statutory duties to county commissioners in this fashion to be a violation of Article II, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>

Here, as discussed above, the only policy choice expressed by the legislature in Act 4 regarding the jury selection process is that county commissioners, before abolishing the office of jury commissioner, must conduct a one-time review of the existing procedures to ensure that the lists of prospective jurors are, at the time of that review, a representative cross section of the community. Act 4 provides no standards for the conduct of the other functions now performed by the jury commissioners as part of the jury selection commission, including the annual preparation of updated master juror lists using methods to secure the broadest possible <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>pool of prospective jurors from the community, maintenance of those lists, and the screening and summoning of prospective jurors. Indeed, Act 4 fails to provide any guidance for implementing an alternative method to carry on the duties of the jury selection commission after the office of jury commissioner is abolished. Act 4, therefore, meets neither of the <em>PAGE </em>requirements and, in my view, is violative of Article II, Section 1. <em>See PAGE </em>(striking provisions of the Gaming Act which permitted the Gaming Control Board to “consider” local zoning ordinances in deciding whether to issue a license since the act failed to provide adequate standards to govern how the board’s consideration process should proceed). Accordingly, I would reverse the Commonwealth Court on this basis.</p>

I do not agree with Appellants’ premise that the mere inclusion within the Judicial Code of the statutory provisions governing the office and duties of jury commissioners renders the office itself judicial in nature, and, as discussed by the majority, our Court has previously characterized jury commissioners as “county staff.” <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 384-86, 78 A.3d at 1034-35 (citing <em>Beckert v. Warren, </em><a href="/pa/497/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="497 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="1775344" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0137-01">497 Pa. 137</a>, <a href="/pa/497/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="497 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="1775344" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0137-01">439 A.2d 638</a>, 644 (1981)). Nevertheless, I concur with Appellants’ assertion that jury commissioners play a vital role in the juror selection process. As essential members of the jury commission, they, through the commission, bear primary responsibility for selecting the individuals who will be tasked with rendering ultimate factual determinations in all criminal and civil jury trials — a process integral to effectuating the fundamental constitutional guarantee of every individual to a fair trial by a jury of his or her peers. <em>See generally Commonwealth v. Ellison, </em><a href="/pa/588/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="588 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="3787965" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0001-01">588 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/588/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="902 A.2d 419" data-case-ids="3787965,8413416" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0001-01,/a2d/902/0419-01">902 A.2d 419</a>, 423 (2006) (underscoring principle that the jury selection process is critical to preserving the right to an impartial jury). In fulfilling <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>this responsibility, they are required to exercise judgment regarding important matters such as assessing the necessary scope and breadth of the records to be used in the jury selection process to ensure a jury pool which is a representative cross section of the community, the qualifications of prospective jurors to serve, and their ability to serve. Thus, though the jury commissioners themselves are statutorily classified as county staff, the jury commission on which they serve ensures the proper functioning of the trial processes of our statewide Unified Judicial System.</p>

C.S.A. § 2121 (referring to required composition of jury commission in “each county”); <em><a href="/pa/588/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="902 A.2d 419" data-case-ids="3787965,8413416" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0001-01,/a2d/902/0419-01">id.</a> </em>§ 2122 (allowing separate method of selection of jury commissions in Philadelphia, home rule counties, and all other counties); <em><a href="/pa/588/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="902 A.2d 419" data-case-ids="3787965,8413416" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0001-01,/a2d/902/0419-01">id.</a> </em>§ 2124 (“Each jury selection commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties vested in and imposed upon such commissions by Subchapter B of Chapter 45 (relating to selection and custody of jurors) and any other powers and duties vested in and imposed upon such commissions by law.”). This statutory scheme established a reasonably standard jury selection methodology which assured that variances in jury selection procedures between counties were minimized — thereby ensuring an individual’s fundamental right to a fair trial by an impartial jury of his or her peers. <em>Ellison, supra. </em>These provisions of the Judicial Code also secured the individual privacy of our citizenry by requiring that personal information which potential jurors submit as part of their questionnaires be strictly limited from public disclosure during the period of their service. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 4526(d) (prohibiting disclosure of “contents of any records or papers used by the jury commissioners or their clerks in connection with the selection process ... until ... all persons selected to serve as jurors ... have <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>been discharged.”). As Appellants note, however, Act 4 creates the very real possibility that each Pennsylvania county will substitute a jury selection process of its own creation after eliminating the office of jury commissioner. This raises the specter of a proliferation of divergent, and possibly inadequate, jury selection methods among the counties which have abolished the office.</p>
    <p id="b459-4" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[182,687,1150,1393]]]'>The impact such a balkanization of the jury selection process would have on the conduct of civil and criminal trials, and on judicial administration, should be a matter of profound concern to our Court, particularly as we seek to achieve greater synchronicity in the administration of justice through the integration into the Unified Judicial System of various court related offices currently under the control of county government, pursuant to the broad framework outlined by former Justice Montemuro in his interim report prepared for our Court as a special master. <em>See generally Pennsylvania State Ass’n of County Comm’rs v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/617/0231-02" class="citation" data-index="135" data-cite="52 A.3d 1213" data-case-ids="4209715,4209880,4209935,7313086,7313094,7313111" data-case-paths="/pa/617/0231-02,/pa/617/0231-01,/pa/617/0230-01,/a3d/52/1213-01,/a3d/52/1213-02,/a3d/52/1213-03">52 A.3d 1213</a>, 1223-24 (Pa.2012). For this reason, and because, as explained above, I deem Act 4 to have disrupted the continued ability of jury commissions to operate, I consider the implementation of Act 4 to implicate our Court’s duty under the Pennsylvania Constitution to supervise the operation of the Unified Judicial System. <em>See </em>Pa. Const. art. V, § 10(a) (“The Supreme Court shall exercise general supervisory and administrative authority over all the courts.”). Pursuant to our supervisory duty, in order to ensure uniformity of the jury selection procedure among all counties which abolish the office of jury commissioner, I would exercise our Court’s rulemaking authority to promulgate specific rules governing the jury selection process to be followed in judicial districts covering all counties which choose to exercise the option of abolishment. Such clear and certain guidance by our Court is, in my view, necessary on a matter of such vital importance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
