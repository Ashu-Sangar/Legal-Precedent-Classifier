The WCJ had determined that Appellant was entitled to workers’ compensation disability benefits based on factual findings that Appellant established the existence of a mental disability that had been caused by abnormal working conditions. We now conclude that it was error to reverse the WCJ’s decision, and we accordingly reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Appellant was a trooper with the Pennsylvania State Police (“State Police”) and had worked for the State Police for approximately twelve years prior to the incident in question, which occurred on November 29, 2006. At approximately 5:45 a.m. on that date, while it was dark, Appellant was driving his patrol car on Interstate 81 en route to his barracks.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A woman dressed all <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>in black, including a black hat or cap, suddenly ran in front of, and was struck by, Appellant’s patrol car. The woman flipped over the vehicle and landed on the highway. Appellant immediately pulled his car around into the traffic lane and rushed to attend to the woman. Appellant began giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as she bled from the mouth. At the same time as he was attempting to revive the injured woman, Appellant had to divert oncoming traffic from hitting him and the woman. The incident was caught on film by a camera mounted in Appellant’s patrol car, and, in accordance with State Police procedure, a DVD was made of the incident, which DVD was later admitted into evidence by the WCJ.</p>
    <p id="b629-4" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[179,957,1150,411]]]'>Following Appellant’s request for assistance, other troopers arrived at the incident site. The woman could not be revived and was pronounced dead at the scene. It was later discovered that she suffered from mental illness and had been seen by several drivers walking up and down the area adjacent to Interstate 81 prior to the incident. Appellant was transported from the scene to a hospital for testing and treatment connected to his exposure to the deceased woman’s blood.</p>
    <p id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.6",629,[177,1392,1150,359]]]'>Appellant was permitted to be off work until January 2, 2007. On that date, he returned to work but performed office work rather than his normal patrol duties. After working four days, however, Appellant’s recurring feelings of anxiousness and stress led him to believe that he could not continue to perform his duties as a state trooper. Appellant has not returned to work since January 5, 2007.</p>

The first NCD asserted that although an injury had occurred, Appellant was not disabled as a result of it. However, it did provide that expenses for medical treatment reasonably related to Appellant’s exposure to the deceased’s woman’s blood would be paid. The second NCD asserted that Appellant had not been injured while in <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>the scope of his employment and specifically rejected any claim for post-traumatic stress. However, and somewhat contradictorily, this NCD also continued to accept responsibility for medical treatment related to Appellant’s exposure to blood.</p>

The State Police filed an answer denying Appellant’s material allegations, and a hearing was scheduled before a WCJ.</p>
    <p id="b630-6" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[270,917,1148,1156]]]'>At the hearing, Appellant testified and presented the supporting medical expert testimony of a psychiatrist and a psychologist, both of whom diagnosed Appellant as being temporarily totally disabled because of PTSD, which disorder had arisen directly from the November 29, 2006, incident. The State Police presented the testimony of Major Steven McDaniel, the Commander of Area 1, who testified about police cadet training regarding stress management, standards for State Police response to automobile accidents, and State Police practice of rendering first aid at a crash site. Major McDaniel also testified regarding an incident of which he was aware where another State Trooper had struck and killed an individual who had dashed in front of his patrol vehicle. Major McDaniel testified that he had given the name of this State Trooper to Appellant in case Appellant desired to contact him. The State Police also presented the testimony of their own psychiatric expert, who opined that Appellant had fully recovered from any PTSD related to the incident, and presently suffered only from mental conditions that pre-existed the November 29, 2006, incident. Two other troopers testified regarding Appellant’s job duties and his failed attempt to return to his work duties after the incident.</p>

Based on these credibility findings, the WCJ <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>determined that Appellant had proven a mental injury arising from a work-related mental stimulus. The WCJ further found that, although state troopers may expect to encounter or be involved with violent situations, the particular work-related mental stimulus here was not one normally encountered by or expected of state troopers, as illustrated by the following relevant findings of fact:</p>

While he stated he never heard of this kind of event happening to anyone else on the job, Major McDaniel credibly testified that a member of the department had a similar situation years ago where someone ran in front of a patrol car and was struck and killed, and he provided [Appellant] with that person’s contact information. Thus, encounters involving fatalities were a foreseeable part of the job and not an unheard of occurrence.</blockquote>

In essence, Appellant argues that it was error for the court to disregard the total, singular nature of the event, as found by the WCJ, and to analyze the event as a series of unrelated component parts.

However, because the “work-related” injury here is a psychic injury, Appellant was further required to prove that the causative working conditions were “abnormal,” a highly fact-sensitive inquiry that required Appellant to establish that he was subject to conditions to which an employee in his position is not normally subject. Because Appellant’s injury arose from a single incident, such inquiry rested on whether that incident alone, and not any purportedly comparable sets of incidents, was abnormal. The WCJ found, based on the credible evidence before him, that the type of incident in this case was not one to which state troopers are normally exposed.

One cannot undertake this most honorable profession without that understanding, and it is that understanding that causes us to hold them in such high regard.</p>

      <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>As the Commonwealth Court noted, appellant, as a police officer, “can be expected to be witness to horrible tragedy. This includes, as acknowledged by [appellant], responding to motor vehicle accidents in an emergency capacity. Undoubtedly, in doing so, he may be subjected to traumatic visuals such as injured children, maimed adults, and, unfortunately, death.” <em>Payes, </em>at 861. Situations like the instant one, although traumatic, are simply not extraordinary or abnormal for police officers. <em>See City of Philadelphia v.

    <p id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.4",654,[273,1046,1150,731]]]'>The fact appellant never thought an event “like this” could happen, <em>see Payes, </em>at 857, or that “he never thought he would be involved in someone’s death,” <em>id., </em>at 859, does not make the event an abnormal working condition. <em>See Wilson, </em>at 344 (citing <em>Martin, </em>at 164) (“ ‘[A]bnormal working conditions,’ describes the requirement that the claimant prove that the psychic injury is in fact a work-related injury. The requirement is an objective one, rather than subjective. Thus, a claimant may not recover benefits for psychic injuries that arise from subjective reactions to normal working conditions.”). Absent sufficient objective evidence the event constituted an abnormal working condition, appellant’s experience of the event constitutes no more than a subjective reaction. <em>See id.</em>

    <p id="b654-5" data-blocks='[["BL_654.5",654,[271,1827,1149,524]]]'>Finally, the majority notes “the abnormal-working-conditions analysis [does not end] when it [ ] established] that the claimant generically belongs to a profession that involves certain levels or types of stress.” Majority Op., at 584, 79 A.3d at 555. While I agree job title alone is not dispositive of the issue, we should not fail to appreciate the determination that an injury results from abnormal working conditions crucially depends on the job performed, for “what may be normal for a police officer will not be normal for an office worker.” <em>RAG, </em>at 1288 (citation omitted).</p>

      <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>It would be gratifying to award benefits here, for the triggering event was unquestionably traumatic, but trauma is not the test for psychic injury. In my opinion, considering the limited evidence and relevant case law, the Commonwealth Court committed no error when it concluded the injury did not result from abnormal working conditions. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>
