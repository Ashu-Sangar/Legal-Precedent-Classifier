We recognize two exceptions, however, both falling within the discretion of the trial judge. First, we appreciate that there may be extraordinary circumstances where a discrete claim (or claims) of trial counsel ineffectiveness is apparent from the record and meritorious to the extent that immediate consideration best serves the interests of justice; and we hold that trial courts retain their discretion to entertain such claims. <em>See infra </em>Part 111(C)(1).</p>

The next year, this Court recognized a limited exception to the <em>Grant </em>deferral rule in <em>Bomar, </em>a direct capital appeal that was decided post-Groni but which involved a <em>pre-Grant </em>procedure in the lower <em>court </em>— i.e., Bomar’s newly-appointed counsel had filed comprehensive post-sentence motions raising ineffectiveness claims. The <em>Bomar </em>trial court held evidentiary hearings, heard from trial counsel, and then denied the ineffectiveness claims on the merits.

In addition, application of <em>Bomar </em>in <em>post-Grant </em>cases would inject arbitrariness as it essentially leaves the question of whether to award an additional and accelerated round of collateral review within the trial judge’s discretion.

The Commonwealth suggests that such a procedure will not result in fewer PCRA petitions because a defendant can always file a timely second PCRA petition attacking prior counsel’s effectiveness and the validity of his PCRA waiver, allegations which, in turn, would require the layering of ineffectiveness claims that <em>Grant </em>had sought to avoid.

Indeed, <em>Bomar </em>arose on this Court’s non-discretionary capital appeal docket; appeal was not by allowance, to consider whether to adopt or accept a procedure, in all cases, which would allow for unitary review and an advance additional round of collateral attack.

Even those judges who entertain such claims may fail to hold an evidentiary hearing, thereby impeding review and failing to satisfy <em>Bomar. </em>Other judges may allow for review of select collateral claims, but not others. It is impossible to imagine a workable discretionary rule which allows some defendants a full, pre-PCRA collateral attack in the direct appeal context, and confines others to preserved claims. Given the existence of the PCRA as the presumptive repository for collateral claims, the general rule should be that the defendant cannot expand post-verdict motions and direct appeal to encompass collateral claims (at least, absent an agreement to waive his PCRA rights). There may be certain fundamental, albeit collateral complaints (such as a relevant new and retroactive rule of constitutional law) that require immediate vindication. But, post-verdict motions should not become an accepted repository for laundry lists of collateral-appropriate complaints, with concomitant delay, such as occurred here — all in advance of a second round of statutorily-authorized collateral attack via the PCRA as of right.</blockquote>

Moreover, as <em>Wright </em>and the <em>Liston </em>concurrence noted, there is no limiting principle to govern and identify which cases should be permitted to proceed in unitary review fashion. It would be one thing if trial courts permitted the practice only to capture exceptional claims, <em>i.e., </em>cases involving record-based ineffectiveness claims of alleged obvious merit. But, experience has shown that the exception, even in the post-Grcmi cases, has been invoked to permit litigation of numerous and relatively common claims of ineffectiveness of counsel which the trial court, and the appellate court, later rejected. <em>See, e.g., Wright, </em><a href="/pa/599/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="961 A.2d 119" data-case-ids="3441590,8189813" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0270-01,/a2d/961/0119-01">961 A.2d at 148-57</a> (numerous claims, including non-record-based claims); <em>Rega, </em><a href="/pa/593/0659-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="933 A.2d 997" data-case-ids="3248242,8347983" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0659-01,/a2d/933/0997-01">933 A.2d at 1018</a> (four claims); <em>Commonwealth v.

It is important to recognize the distinction between individual claims of ineffective assistance alleged to be of such merit and importance as to warrant immediate review, and instances where the defendant seeks review of a range of ineffectiveness claims and/or of non-record-based - claims — the circumstance represented in the cases which have permitted unitary review under the <em>Bomar </em>exception.</p>

We believe that a similar flexibility should be recognized with respect to certain ineffectiveness claims that emerge at the post-verdict level. In short, there may be an extraordinary case where the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, determines that a claim (or claims) of ineffectiveness is both meritorious and apparent from the record so that immediate consideration and relief is warranted. The administration of criminal justice is better served by allowing trial judges to retain the discretion to consider and vindicate such distinct claims of ineffectiveness, and we hereby approve such a limited exception to <em>Grant.</em>

Permitting broad and unitary review where there is a waiver of PCRA rights does not raise the prospect of arbitrarily affording some defendants two rounds of collateral review as of right, while denying that option to other defendants; such a rule merely advances PCRA review.

The prospect of unitary review allows for more timely litigation of strong collateral claims without having to forego direct review claims. Unitary review also offers the prospect of the defendant locating witnesses and developing collateral claims when the relevant events are fresher in the memories of necessary witnesses. And, perhaps most importantly, unitary review offers defendants who receive shorter prison sentences or probationary sentences the prospect of litigating their constitutional claims sounding in trial counsel ineffectiveness; for many of these defendants, post-appeal PCRA review may prove unavailable. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(1)® (to be eligi<a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>ble for relief,' PCRA petitioner must be “currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, probation or parole.”).

The PCRA is commonly understood as contemplating a single petition as of-right, filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final, with serial petitions subject to Section 9545(b). In fact, however, the restriction to three exceptional claims raised within sixty days of accrual only applies to petitions filed more than a year after the judgment becomes final.

But, PCRA review is designed to embrace all cognizable claims deemed worth pursuing, in counsel’s judgment. Thus, counsel must be cognizant that the PCRA embraces ineffectiveness claims other than record-based ones, which may require further investigation and research, and the PCRA embraces claims other than ineffectiveness, which likewise may require development.

And, again, it should be remembered that, in cases where the only viable issues are collateral, and the sentence is of sufficient length that the defendant will likely satisfy the PCRA custody requirement, the defendant always has the option of proceeding immediately to PCRA review, without first pursuing a direct appeal. Ultimately, we trust in the discretion of the trial courts to determine which cases present appropriate circumstances to warrant post-verdict unitary review of prolix claims, contingent upon a waiver of PCRA review.</p>

As the High Court noted, a state could determine to allow claims of ineffective assistance of initial-review counsel to be litigated in federal court in the first instance, under the rubric of cause for procedural default. In that environment, “When faced with the question whether there is cause for an apparent default, a State may answer that the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is insubstantial, <em>i.e., </em>it does not have any merit or that it is wholly without factual support, or that the attorney in the initial-review collateral proceeding did not perform below constitutional standards.” <em>Martinez, </em>566 U.S. at -, <a href="/us/566/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="566 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="12188233" data-case-paths="/us/566/0001-01">132 S.Ct. at 1319</a>. The question of whether to take measures to otherwise account for the concerns of <em>Martinez </em>is one of policy, and it should await either the action of the General Assembly — in response to <em>Martinez </em>and cases such as <em>Ligons </em>and Pitts — or a case where the issue is properly joined.</p>

The question implicates the terms of the PCRA, the difficulties in litigating ineffectiveness claims on direct review, and the issue of equal treatment which we have discussed earlier in this Opinion. The reasons favoring deferral of ineffectiveness claims already have been addressed at length in <em>Grant </em>and nothing in <em>Martinez </em>or <em>Trevino </em>operates to alter that calculus. We recognize that the High Court has so far framed its concern in terms of state review paradigms where trial counsel ineffectiveness claims categorically (Martinez) or “systemically” (Trevino) cannot be raised on direct appeal. But, the area obviously is dynamic; for example, it is not difficult to imagine the Court expanding its approach to individual cases, <em>i.e., </em>holding that the <em>Martinez </em>remedy may be made available <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>if the defendant in fact did not have an opportunity, in his own case, to raise ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal. This Court’s motivation in cases such as <em>Grant </em>and the one <em>sub judice </em>has not been to address or blunt such concerns; our focus has been on fashioning a procedure that comports with the terms and role of the PCRA, the hindrances to reviewing ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and recognition of an exception that affords a measure of equalization of authorized opportunities for review.</p>

In short, PCRA petitions in CURA cases were subject to the same time-bar restrictions that governed non-capital PCRA petitions not filed within one year of the judgment becoming final.

I do not agree, however, that consideration under the latter “good cause” exception must include waiver of all future collateral review. Rather, I would hold this to be issue-specific; consideration of discrete issues raised on direct review precludes collateral review of those issues only. Once raised and addressed, such issues can no longer serve as the basis for collateral relief, whether they deal with trial counsel’s services or appellate counsel’s performance in litigating the issue.</p>

The majority’s thoughtful analysis has caused me to reconsider my personal position on the matter. As explained <em>infra, </em>to obtain consensus and provide clear guidance to the bench and bar, I now join the majority’s sentiments that our holding in <em>Bomar, </em>which permitted certain claims of ineffective assistance of counsel to be raised on direct appeal, should be limited to cases litigated in the trial court before this Court decided the seminal case of <em>Commonwealth v. Grant, </em><a href="/pa/572/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="572 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="716471" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0048-01">572 Pa. 48</a>, <a href="/pa/572/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="813 A.2d 726" data-case-ids="716471,9381173" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0048-01,/a2d/813/0726-01">813 A.2d 726</a> (2002).

However, as set forth <em>infra, </em>I would caution defendants to employ the good cause/PCRA waiver exception only in <em>O’Berg-</em>type cases where they would otherwise lose PCRA review entirely if not invoked imminently. Presentation of routine ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal in exchange for waiver of subsequent PCRA review would be unwise and highly prejudicial because the defendant would be forfeiting the extended time period allotted under the PCRA to investigate non-record-based ineffectiveness claims.</p>

First, the reasoning of <em>Bomar </em>— that <em>Grant’s </em>primary concerns over impediments to developing and reviewing ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal are eliminated where the defendant preserved the ineffectiveness claims in the trial court, they were the subject of an evidentiary hearing, and were disposed of by the trial court in its opinion — is equally persuasive in both the pre<em>Grant </em>and <em>post-Grant </em>scenario. Second, entertaining ineffectiveness claims that had already been subject to an evidentiary <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>hearing and reasoned disposition by the trial court appeared, at first blush, to save judicial resources and give finality to a defendant’s judgment of sentence. Third, and most significantly, a broad application of the <em>Bomar </em>exception afforded trial courts discretion to consider a claim of ineffectiveness on direct appeal, which allowed for immediate vindication of a clearly meritorious claim without having the defendant await disposition of his direct appeal to assert a claim of ineffectiveness under the PCRA. Otherwise, a defendant with a claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness that was of obvious record-based merit would have to forego his direct appeal and proceed directly to PCRA review or wait an indeterminate amount of time until his direct appeal was decided before he could seek relief in a PCRA petition. Finding such “Hobson’s choice” undesirable and absent any existing alternative to afford trial courts discretion to entertain only those ineffectiveness claims that warranted immediate review, this author supported a broad interpretation of the <em>Bomar </em>exception.</p>

Application of the <em>Bomar </em>exception became arbitrary as there were no existing standards to channel the trial court’s exercise of discretion as to when to entertain the ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal. <em>See Rega, </em><a href="/pa/593/0659-01" class="citation" data-index="176" data-cite="933 A.2d 997" data-case-ids="3248242,8347983" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0659-01,/a2d/933/0997-01">933 A.2d at 1032</a> (2007) (Castille, J., concurring) (recognizing that questions of arbitrariness arose because there were “no existing standards or guidelines governing when a trial judge should permit litigation of ineffectiveness claims, or other collateral claims, on post-verdict review or should defer to review at the collateral stage”). Concerns also arose because defendants who challenged trial counsel’s performance on direct appeal could potentially receive a second round of collateral review by subsequently filing a PCRA petition after the direct appeal had been resolved. <em><a href="/pa/593/0659-01" class="citation" data-index="177" data-cite="933 A.2d 997" data-case-ids="3248242,8347983" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0659-01,/a2d/933/0997-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/pa/593/0659-01" class="citation" data-index="177" data-cite="933 A.2d 997" data-case-ids="3248242,8347983" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0659-01,/a2d/933/0997-01">at 1030</a> (Castille, J., concurring) (opining that “a defendant afforded such hybrid direct review faces no existing impediment in the PCRA, the Criminal Rules, or the case law to pursuing a second round of collateral <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>claims under the PCRA, after a first round of direct/unitary review concludes”).</p>

In an effort to obtain consensus and provide guidance to the bench and bar, I now agree that the <em>Bomar </em>exception should be limited to its facts, where the claims of ineffectiveness were litigated in the trial court before this Court announced the general rule of deferral in <em>Grant. </em>My concern over trial courts lacking discretion to entertain the exceptional claim of ineffectiveness that would warrant the grant of immediate relief has been allayed by the majority’s insightful adoption of the “extraordinary circumstances” exception. For the first time, trial courts will possess the requisite guidance to channel their discretion to entertain a claim of ineffectiveness on direct appeal that is apparent on the record and meritorious to the extent that immediate consideration of the claim best serves the interests of justice. While there may be litigation over what circumstance constitutes an extraordinary one, I am confident that the majority has narrowly crafted the exception, and that further elucidation will arise through the exercise of trial court discretion, as well as subsequent case law addressing specific claims of ineffectiveness in the appropriate cases. I further acknowledge that judicial resources will not be wasted by appellate courts deferring consideration of ineffectiveness claims that have already been adjudicated by the trial court because such procedure will ultimately eliminate circumstances where defendants obtain two rounds of collateral review.

This sentiment, in part, was based on the fact that investigation and development of a claim of ineffectiveness, in the general sense, takes longer than the time necessary to present a claim on direct appeal. We explained that an appellate counsel who presents ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal “must not only scour the existing record for any issues, but also has the additional burden of raising any extra-record claims that may exist by interviewing the client, family members, and any other people who may shed light on claims that could have been pursued before or during trial and at sentencing.” <a href="/pa/572/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="813 A.2d 726" data-case-ids="716471,9381173" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0048-01,/a2d/813/0726-01">813 A.2d at 737</a>. Notably, we acknowledged that when ineffectiveness claims are raised on direct appeal, appellate counsel must perform this “Herculean task” in the thirty-day period for filing an appeal from the judgment of sentence, Pa.R.Crim.P. 720, rather than the one-year period from the date the judgment of sentence becomes final in which the defendant may file a PCRA petition. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b). While the mandatory nature of the PCRA waiver resolves the problem of a defendant obtaining a second round of collateral review, it does not dissipate these remaining concerns articulated in <em>Grant </em>relating to the distinct and essential roles served by separate direct appeal and collateral criminal proceedings.</p>

For example, should the defendant invoke the good cause exception to raise a claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to lodge an evidentiary objection, I would require the defendant to waive the right under the PCRA to raise any layered ineffectiveness claim for which trial counsel’s failure to object is part of the arguable merits assessment.

Yet, as all defendants are entitled to rely on the good cause exception — should they meet it — it is unclear what improper asymmetrical “benefit” the majority would preclude with its waiver requirement. By imposing a standard for invoking the exception, a standard we will no doubt refine in subsequent cases and ensure is applied uniformly, we treat all defendants equally. If by “benefit” the majority means we should not grant certain defendants additional rounds of review, I completely agree. A limited waiver achieves that, again, by requiring waiver of discrete derivative ineffectiveness claims.</p>

Further, I agree that a concomitant waiver of PCRA review of discrete derivative claims should be required to avoid multiple rounds of review of the same underlying question. I simply disagree, for the above reasons, that to accomplish this it is necessary or reasonable to require a defendant to do more than waive related derivative claims, much less all PCRA claims, as the majority requires. Rather, limiting the waiver of PCRA rights to related derivative claims when a defendant invokes the good cause exception accounts for legitimate concerns about permitting multiple rounds of collateral review <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>while simultaneously diminishing the pitfalls of invoking the exception.

Under <em>Collins, </em>trial court error, trial counsel’s ineffectiveness (for ineffectively litigating the trial court error), and appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness (for ineffectively litigating trial counsel’s ineffectiveness) are each distinct "issues” under the PCRA, and, thus, where the underlying claim is raised on direct appeal, typically the derivative claim may still be raised under the PCRA — that is, the derivative claim is not barred as previously litigated. However, under either a limited waiver approach, or the majority’s comprehensive waiver approach, some otherwise meritorious layered claims will be waived, as the cost for accelerated consideration.</p>

Of course, our <em>pre-Grant </em>caselaw required direct appeal counsel to do just that: to raise, or be found to have waived, all meritorious trial counsel ineffectiveness claims. However, before <em>Grant, </em>where direct appeal counsel, perhaps unsurprisingly, imperfectly identified meritorious ineffectiveness claims, the PCRA stood as an avenue for relief for such overlooked claims, couched as layered claims. Under the majority’s waiver approach, there is no such avenue for relief. In that sense, the majority’s waiver approach is more onerous that the Hubbard-era ■ requirement that counsel raise ineffectiveness claims at the first opportunity — which usually meant on direct appeal — a state of affairs we emphatically rejected in <em>Grant.
