In an article in the Erie Times-News on January 5, 2008, appellee was quoted as saying: “It’s (graffiti) a real problem that’s growing worse by the day, especially in the inner city.” In that same article, he was also quoted as saying that a local businessman “offered to donate funds to come up with a solution, and many others have volunteered their time, so we’re putting together a group to address the problem.” In a March 21, 2008 article, the Erie Times-News reported that appellee said that the task force would seek community help in identifying the vandals and would suggest tougher fines for violations. He was also quoted as saying that the task force would “work our hardest to abate it.” <em>See In re Carney, </em><a href="/a3d/28/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="28 A.3d 253" data-case-ids="7272210" data-case-paths="/a3d/28/0253-01">28 A.3d 253</a>, 261-62 (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc.2011).</p>

He was also identified as a “district judge for Erie’s 3rd Ward.” The editorial stated that appellee had some ideas to “strengthen local anti-graffiti efforts,” including establishing a reward fund for “any good Samaritan (who can) help us and assist us.” The editorial then stated that “a local businessman has donated $2,000 to start the <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>reward fund.

The CJD’s findings of fact state that on January 11, 2009, appellee was driving northbound on 1-79 on his way home to Erie after having attended a Pittsburgh Steelers football game at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh. Approximately 4-5 miles north of Exit 105 (the Slippery Rock exit), appellee drove up behind a vehicle driven by Nico Baldelli, a freshman at Mercyhurst College-North East. Baldelli’s college roommate, Ryan Tanner, was a passenger in the car. Both cars were traveling in the left-hand lane. Appellee indicated that he wanted to pass the students by flashing his high beams.

Appellee reduced his speed and Baldelli returned to the left-hand lane and drove up alongside appellee. Baldelli turned on his inside light and raised his middle finger while yelling obscenities. Appellee then increased his speed until his vehicle was approximately alongside the front bumper of Baldelli’s car. He then rolled his window half way down, retrieved a silver handgun from the console beside the driver’s seat, and held it with his thumb and index finger out the window briefly, for two to three seconds, so that Baldelli could see it. Baldelli backed off and continued northward to Erie at a slower speed. The CJD apparently credited appellee’s account of his motivations in displaying the gun to the young men. Thus, in its <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>findings of fact, the CJD stated that: “respondent was concerned about the escalation of the incident and displayed the gun in an effort to defuse the situation with the intention (or hope) that showing Baldelli the gun would result in Baldelli ‘backing off,’ which it did.” <a href="/a3d/28/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="28 A.3d 253" data-case-ids="7272210" data-case-paths="/a3d/28/0253-01">28 A.3d at 265</a>.</p>

The State Police then stopped appellee at a point 75 to 80 miles north of the location where he had displayed his handgun. The State Police initially filed four misdemeanor charges against appellee, including terroristic threats, simple assault, disorderly conduct, and recklessly endangering another person. The charges were subsequently dismissed by Magisterial District Judge Lorinda L. Hinch of Magisterial District 35-3-01, Mercer County. The State Police later refiled two misdemeanor counts each of the same four charges. On November 10, 2009, appellee pled guilty to two lesser, summary offenses of disorderly conduct and was ordered to pay fines and costs totaling $541. In exchange for the plea, the Mercer County District Attorney’s Office dropped the other charges. <em><a href="/a3d/28/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="28 A.3d 253" data-case-ids="7272210" data-case-paths="/a3d/28/0253-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a3d/28/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="28 A.3d 253" data-case-ids="7272210" data-case-paths="/a3d/28/0253-01">at 266</a>.</p>

On consideration of the arguments related to the solicitation of funds for the task force, the CJD concluded that the Board’s case for a violation of Rule 11 was premised entirely on a newspaper editorial. Furthermore, the CJD concluded that the Board took the quoted portion of the editorial out of context. When viewed in context, the CJD determined, it was clear that appellee had not made any of the objected-to statements. Instead, the <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>statements were made by the author of the editorial.

The CJD also determined that appellee’s involvement in the task force did not violate Rule 2A by lending the prestige of his office to a private interest because the eradication of graffiti was a matter of public interest. “Graffiti — its existence and its proliferation — is clearly a public issue and efforts by the Anti-Graffiti Task Force to eradicate graffiti or control it are certainly of public interest — not private.” <em><a href="/a3d/28/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="28 A.3d 253" data-case-ids="7272210" data-case-paths="/a3d/28/0253-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a3d/28/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="28 A.3d 253" data-case-ids="7272210" data-case-paths="/a3d/28/0253-01">at 270</a>.</p>

Const, art. V, § 18(d)(1), the judicial officer must have engaged in conduct which is “so extreme” that it brings the office itself into disrepute. The CJD then reasoned that the following factors weighed in favor of appellee: he legally possessed the gun; he did not threaten Baldelli and Tanner with the gun; he never pointed the gun at the young men or their vehicle, but rather “took particular care” not to point it; the incident as described by all three participants had escalated to a point where it was reasonable for appellee to have been “concerned, worried, even scared that it would continue or escalate further;” it was not unreasonable for appellee to believe that showing the gun “would prevent further escalation and end the episode;” the display of the gun lasted only 2-3 seconds; and everyone “proceeded peacefully” to Erie after appellee displayed the gun.

The Board asserts that the standard for measuring disrepute is the reasonable expectations of the public. According to the Board, judicial officers have been sanctioned for conduct “far less egregious” than the conduct in this case. For example, the Board points to <em>In re Marraccini, </em><a href="/a2d/908/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="908 A.2d 377" data-case-ids="8456359" data-case-paths="/a2d/908/0377-01">908 A.2d 377</a>, 382 (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc.2006), where the CJD found that an MDJ violated Section 18(d)(1) when he waved his hands in a dismissive gesture towards approximately twenty defendants (for traffic citations) and asked them if they “were all morons” when they asked whether they were excused. The Board also compares the circumstances here to <em>Harrington, supra, </em>where an MDJ parked at expired parking meters and placed parking tickets from other vehicles on her car in order to deceive the local parking authority. The <em>Harrington </em>Court concluded that the MDJ violated the “disrepute” proscription in Section 18(d)(1). Finally, the Board likens this case to <em>In re Hamilton, </em><a href="/a2d/932/1030-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="932 A.2d 1030" data-case-ids="8350281" data-case-paths="/a2d/932/1030-01">932 A.2d 1030</a> (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc.2007), where the CJD found a violation of Section 18(d)(1) based upon an MDJ assaulting a police officer and speaking profanely to the officer’s wife. Based on these prior cases, the Board asserts that, accepting the factual findings made by the CJD, this Court should find that appellee’s conduct in displaying a loaded handgun during a “childish escalating episode of road rage” was so extreme as to implicate the proscription against disrepute.</p>

The Board argues that whether or not appellee legally possessed the handgun was irrelevant because it was appellee’s inappropriate and threatening use of the handgun that was the source of the disrepute. According to the Board, appellee’s conduct, like that of the judicial officer in <em>Harrington, </em>is the type of behavior that would cause an ordinary person to believe that some judges consider themselves to be above the law. The Board also notes that a similar incident in Pennsylvania resulted in the revocation of a gun license, and a similar incident in another state resulted in attorney discipline.

The Board points out that the plain language of Rule 2A clearly requires an MDJ to “respect and comply with the law.” The Board recognizes the <em>Cicchetti </em>Court’s interpretation of Canon 2A of the Code of Judicial Conduct (the provision similar to Rule 2A applied to MDJs), which limits application of Canon 2A to instances where the misconduct implicates the actual judicial decision-making process. The Board submits, however, that this non-textual limitation frustrates the purpose of the rule and has effectively deprived the CJD of the power to enforce it. The Board asserts that <em>Cicchetti </em>has led to incongruous results in judicial disciplinary matters in the form of repeated determinations that a judicial officer violated Article V, Section 18 of the Constitution, but did not violate Canon 2 or Rule 2A. <em>See Harrington, supra; see also In re Murphy, </em><a href="/a3d/10/0932-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="10 A.3d 932" data-case-ids="7289907" data-case-paths="/a3d/10/0932-01">10 A.3d 932</a> (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc.2010) (finding that forgery by MDJ violated Section 18, but not Rule 2A, because pursuing disciplinary charge under Rule 2A “would be in <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>direct conflict with <em>Harrington.”). </em>The Board concludes that appellee committed a crime when he displayed the handgun, that it proved by clear and convincing evidence that he did not comply with the laws of Pennsylvania, and that he therefore was in violation of the plain language of Rule 2A. Finally, the Board notes that it continues to pursue charges under Rule 2A and Canon 2 because it is unconscionable that criminal conduct by judicial officers should not be disciplined under these Rules merely because the criminal conduct does not implicate the decision-making process.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The Board asserts that the linchpin of the CJD’s analysis was in error, since graffiti is both a public and a private concern. Graffiti affects private and public property; local businesses, <em>i.e., </em>private businesses, were affected by graffiti. Thus, according to the Board, the work of the task force benefitted private interests. The Board further emphasizes that members of the private business community were on the task force and the CJD ignored that there were substantial private interests which benefitted from the task force. The Board contends that the task force contributed its resources and labor to clean up privately owned buildings, including a synagogue. In the Board’s view, “By announcing his support in combatting graffiti at clearly private facilities, [appellee] championed the cause of private interests.” Brief of Judicial Conduct Board, at 43.

The Board asserts that appellee sought in-kind contributions from the citizens and the business community of Erie by making statements seeking such contributions that were quoted in the local newspaper in violation of Rule 11. The Board further avers that appellee was identified as a “district judge for Erie’s 3rd Ward” rather than as the chairman of the task force in these articles. The Board notes that the newspaper reported that appellee had the idea to establish a reward fund and a local businessman had donated $2,000 to start the fund.

The only remaining question is whether the Board proved by those findings that appellee’s conduct was improper and was so extreme that it adversely affected appellee’s reputation and the reputation of the judicial office itself.

According to appellee, <em>Cicchetti </em>involved “hybrid” misconduct because there was an overlap between the inappropriate conduct — alleged sexual misconduct, the most significant of which involved complaints from a female probation officer assigned to the male judge’s courtroom — and the judge’s responsibility to serve on the bench with independence and integrity. Here, appellee submits, his display of his handgun on the highway involves no such overlap. In appellee’s view, Rule 2A properly requires that any judge will be held to a very high standard for any action that affects his ability to dispense justice, and there are other mechanisms for sanctioning out-of-court conduct or conduct that does not implicate the judicial decision-making process. Appellee thus argues that it is not necessary that Rule 2A be available to impose sanctions upon offending judges for out-of-court conduct.

Appellee also asserts that the Board provided no evidence that any private business owner or interest was benefitted by the task force.

Furthermore, Baldelli was shaken enough that, as the CJD found, he called his parents, who called state police, who in turn interrupted appellee’s “peaceful” return to Erie County, and ultimately filed criminal charges against him. Additionally, in reaching its legal conclusion, the CJD failed to account for the fact that it was appellee who initiated the entire incident by passing Baldelli’s car while making an obscene gesture.

Nor is there necessarily anything wrong in appellee moving to the right hand lane and then accelerating to pass when Baldelli’s response was not timely enough for his liking. Appellee then escalated the interaction, however, with the obscene gesture, and the ensuing back-and-forth between the two drivers — as common and dangerous as it is childish — played out predictably enough — until appellee introduced the gun. Viewed in terms of “escalations,” “ending the episode,” and reasonableness, it is notable that appellee chose not to “back off” himself. Instead, he brandished a firearm. The display of the handgun by appellee, during what was already a dangerous high-speed, mutual dispute, was obviously intended to intimidate the other driver. And, here, the tactic worked.

Baldelli “backed-down,” just as appellee intended; but, appellee never backed down. To the contrary, he proceeded toward home, ahead of Baldelli, at the pace of travel he preferred. Accepting the CJD’s factual finding that appellee himself subjectively believed that his conduct in speeding up and displaying the gun to force Baldelli to back down was reasonable, objectively viewed, and in light of appellee’s overall role in this encounter, it was unreasonable and extreme.</p>

Indeed, the Board’s observation that this sort of incident invites the view that judges appear to believe that they are above the law is especially apt here. People who brandish guns during road rage incidents should properly expect themselves to be viewed as exhibiting disreputable conduct. This incident involves facts more damning than the MDJ’s discourteous and undignified treatment of the traffic court defendants in <em>Marraccini </em>and is similar to the instigation of the altercation at a public golf course in <em>Hamilton. </em>Both cases resulted in a finding of disrepute under Section 18(d)(1).

The CJD found that Cicchetti repeatedly called her into his robing room where he discussed personal matters with her, including asking her to “get together” with him. She repeatedly refused him and he responded by telling her he could help her get ahead and threatening her father’s job (with PennDOT). <em>Cicchetti, </em>743 A.2d at 435-37.

It does not limit the phrase by requiring the conduct to occur within the judicial decision-making sphere; and such a limitation would have been easy to express affirmatively. A judicial office represents a public trust, and the conduct of a judicial officer may bear upon the independence and integrity of the judiciary regardless of whether the conduct implicates the decision-making process.

Rule 2A is written to address those activities that “advance” private interests. By its plain language it does not apply to those activities which advance a public interest, but may incidentally benefit a private interest. Furthermore, the Board’s argument that private interests were benefitted by the task force’s work is tenuous at best. The Board’s argument is based on the fact that local business leaders and people from the private sector were involved in the task force and the task force cleaned up graffiti on a synagogue and other private businesses when eradicating graffiti in Erie. According to the Board, these facts show that private interests were advanced by the task force. However, merely because a public interest project also benefits a private citizen or entity does not necessarily prove “advancing” a private interest for purposes of the proscription in Rule 2A. Indeed, most public interest projects incidentally benefit private individuals or entities in some fashion; the “public” consists of private citizens. It would defy common sense to discourage members of the judiciary from participating in public interest groups merely because the work of the group also incidentally benefits some private individual or entity. Accordingly, we conclude that the CJD did not err in determining that the Board did not <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>establish a violation of Rule 2A by clear and convincing evidence.</p>

In our view, appellee’s involvement as head of the task force is not the type of “conduct [that] is so extreme as to have brought the judicial office itself into disrepute.” <em>Berkhimer, supra. </em>Obviously, judges should be circumspect in their public associations, mindful of the effects on public perception. But, we do not read the disrepute provision in such a broad way as to exclude involvement in a public interest group, especially when the particulars of the association derive from information appearing in a newspaper editorial.
