The deference that the OOR contends is due appears to encompass several concepts. Most prominently, the OOR argues that when a Chapter 13 court reviews a determination of one of its appeals officers, the “traditional” or so-called “deferential” standard of review must apply, namely, whether the appeals officer committed an error of law or a constitutional violation or whether the critical findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. Thus, the OOR argues that the essential components of Section 704 of the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. § 704, applied by the Commonwealth Court to appeals from Commonwealth agency determinations under the old RTKA, should continue to apply to appeals under the RTKL. Appellant’s Brief at 8, 13-17.

      <em> </em>The answer to this question is complicated by the fact that although the RTKL explicitly provides that the provisions of 2 Pa.C.S. (which include a standard of review on appeal) will not apply, it does not explicitly provide for any alternative standard of review on appeal. Moreover, although the RTKL appears on its face to support the Commonwealth Court’s determination that Chapter 13 courts conduct a <em>de novo </em>review <em>(see </em>65 P.S. <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>§§ 67.1301(a) and 67.1302(a), providing that the Chapter 13 courts shall issue decisions that contain findings of fact and conclusions of law), the RTKL also appears to limit the permissible scope of review of such courts <em>(see </em>65 P.S. § 67.1303(b), purportedly circumscribing the record before the Chapter 13 courts). As we determine <em>infra, </em>however, Chapter 13 courts are not so hampered in their duties to provide appropriate appellate review. Clearly, the RTKL presents some ambiguities. Given the RTKL’s statutory lapses and ambiguities regarding issues of the appropriate standard and scope of review, we are required to engage in statutory analysis. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c).</p>

Under the RTKL, agency records are presumed to be public records and must be made available to a requester unless they fall within specific, statutory exceptions. 65 P.S. §§ 67.305, 67.701(a). A document may be exempt from disclosure if it is protected by a privilege (65 P.S. § 67.305(a)(2) or (b)(2)), or is exempt under federal or state law or regulation, or judicial order or decree. 65 P.S. § 67.305(a)(3) and (b)(3).

Indeed, to come to the result advanced by the OOR, we would have to do the following: (1) ignore or explain away that “findings of fact” are mentioned in the RTKL only in connection with Chapter 13 courts, not appeals officers, and hold that, nevertheless, the appeals officers are the statutory finders of fact; (2) hold that the appeals officers are the finders of fact even though the RTKL provides that they are not required to hold a hearing, take evidence, or even issue a written decision (in that, should the appeals officer fail to issue a written decision, the appeal will be deemed denied); and (3) devise an explanation as to how the findings of fact of appeals officers must be granted deference under a statute that specifically allows appeals officers to not adhere to the due process safeguards found in Title 2 In short, for us to accept the argument of the OOR regarding the appropriate standard of review, we would have to effectively rewrite the <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>RTKL.

Our administrative agency decision-making process generally relies heavily upon a multi-tiered system, where initial determinations are made by a hearing officer or examiner, whose decision becomes final if there is no further appeal. Should there be an appeal, however, then the agency head is typically charged with making a <em>de novo </em>review. This system, which stands in stark contrast to the current system under the RTKL that has only one level of administrative scrutiny, in no manner makes the initial agency determination redundant or superfluous.

The OOR averred that it has handled more than 3000 appeals since the agency’s creation in 2009, but that only approximately 50 appeals went further than the decisions its appeals officers- made in 2009. Clearly, these statistics, if accurate, erase any doubt that the General Assembly has created a superfluous review regime with the creation of the RTKL <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>appeals officers.

Under both versions of the RTKA, once the agency denied or limited a request for records, the initial appellate process took place within the agency itself. Such a system undoubtedly was burdensome on agencies whose primary focus was on the goals set forth in their enabling statutes, not on public records requests. Thus, the General Assembly, among other things, created a new agency, the OOR, to help facilitate records requests in various manners. Additionally, the General Assembly created, within the OOR and other agencies, a subset of public servants — the appeals officers — who decide appeals from denials of or restrictions on records requests initially made by the agencies in whose custody the records reside. All appeals officers are directed by the RTKL to make their decisions in an expedited fashion, and they are given considerable discretion to achieve this goal. However, the RTKL does not require that the appeals officers conduct their determinations in a manner comporting with the process provided under Title 2. The more streamlined process before appeals officers under the RTKL is apparently designed to dispose of most disputes in an efficient and timely fashion, with the probable contemplation that most disputes will end at the level of the decision of the appeals officer. The averments of the OOR in its brief regarding the high numbers of appeals decided in comparison with the relatively far lower number of appeals taken to the Chapter 13 courts clearly show that this legislative scheme is a success.</p>

As we observed, Section 1304 of the RTKL permits a Chapter 13 court to award costs and attorneys’ fees, and to impose sanctions, after the court, not the appeals officer, makes relevant factual findings and legal conclusions. The necessary factual record for the significant decisions that the reviewing courts must make under Section 1304 (and Section 1305 pertaining to civil penalties) would quite likely not be found in a record confined solely to “the request, the agency’s response, the appeal filed under section 1101, the hearing transcript, if any, and the final written determination of the appeals officer.” 65 P.S. § 67.1303(b). Indeed, Section 1304(a)(1) requires a court to make factual findings regarding whether an agency denying access to records acted “willfully or with wanton disregard” or “otherwise ... in bad faith.” 65 P.S. § 67.1304(a)(1). In similar fashion, the RTKL contemplates that the foundational question of whether a record or <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>document is exempt from disclosure is a factual one. 65 P.S. § 67.708(a) (providing that the relevant government agency bears the “burden of proving ... by a preponderance of the evidence” that an exemption applies).</p>

For example, in considering what deference may be due to determinations under Section 1102 of the RTKL, 65 P.S. § 67.1102, the majority focuses on the deference associated with determinations which are discretionary by nature. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 157-59, 75 A.3d at 467-68.

Accordingly, to the extent that OOR determinations reflect a consistent and reasonable approach in fleshing out the boundaries of the statutory exemptions from disclosure in the myriad factual scenarios arising on a daily basis before the agency, I would favor the affordance of some deference to these administrative-level developments. Along these lines, I do not believe that these sorts of boundaries are as concretely apparent from the face of the statute as may be inferred from the majority opinion. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 158-60, 75 A.3d at 468.</p>

Engaging in statutory construction of the law, the Majority holds that judicial review of administrative agency appeals from the Office of Open Records (“OOR”) is plenary and <em>de novo, </em>allowing reviewing courts to adopt an OOR appeals officer’s findings of fact and legal conclusions when appropriate. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 168, 173, 75 A.3d at 474, 477. My position with respect to the proper review paradigm in RTKL matters is more closely aligned with that expressed in Madame Justice Todd’s Dissenting Opinion. As Justice Todd develops, administrative agency review in matters decided by the OOR plainly should be in the appellate jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court (where Commonwealth agencies are involved) and in the courts of common pleas (where local agencies are involved), and the courts should defer to the OOR’s role as factfinder in the first instance. I also agree with the Commonwealth Court that where the OOR does not hold a hearing, courts acting in their appellate capacities should remand to the OOR for additional findings of fact where necessary. <em>See Bowling v. Office of Open Records, </em><a href="/a2d/990/0813-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="990 A.2d 813" data-case-ids="7290660" data-case-paths="/a2d/990/0813-01">990 A.2d 813</a>, 820-22 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010).

The plain language of the RTKL reveals little legislative attention paid to establishing a defined means of judicial review following administrative review. This lapse perhaps resulted from an expectation that the vast majority of disputes would be resolved at the agency level, as happens in other Commonwealth agency disputes, and would not put parties to the additional inconvenience, expense, and delay that judicial review — including direct review of fact-bound issues as of right in this <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>Court — entails. While the expectation of streamlined agency review may have materialized to a degree, the deficiencies in the RTKL, combined with the OOR’s apparent inefficacy and inconsistency in performing its regulatory task (a point to which I have written in the past), have left parties with the worst of worlds: an incomplete or unsatisfactory administrative process that all-too-often forces unready and fact-bound merits disputes into the court system. <em>See Pa.

Short of that, however, the OOR is statutorily positioned to implement the existing legislation in a manner that would bring order out of this chaos, and ensure a fairer and more timely review process. Remarkably, it appears that the OOR still has not promulgated regulations to govern the administrative appeal process. Instead, the OOR employs an appeals procedure described in its “Interim Guidelines” which significantly departs from administrative procedures employed by most other Commonwealth agencies, and which apparently was intended to address due process concerns. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.1102(b) (addressing applicability of 1 Pa.Code Part II — General Rules of Administrative Practice and Procedure, and permitting OOR to adopt regulations, policies, or procedures “contrary” to those of Pennsylvania Code). These Interim Guidelines are not formal regulations promulgated in accordance with the process required by the Commonwealth Documents Law and the Commonwealth Attorneys’ Act (which require, <em>inter alia, </em>a period of public comment and review by the Attorney General for form and legality). <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.504(a); 45 P.S. §§ 1201-1208; 71 P.S. § 732-204(b). As mere informal policy, the OOR’s guidelines are also vulnerable to frequent and potentially disruptive <em>ad hoc </em>amendment. Unfortunately, the RTKL permits the OOR to operate indefi<a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>nitely under these Interim Guidelines and outside of the traditional administrative review process. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.1102(b). Concomitantly, the RTKL fails to articulate any failsafe procedures to vindicate litigants’ due process rights during the OOR administrative process — again, the result is defaulting cases into the court system following what amounts to meaningless agency review.</p>

Furthermore, the endeavor is pointless given that the General Assembly can displace the judicial “Band-Aids” at any time by legislative action. Alternatively, I believe the- RTKL can be construed as permitting the OOR a significant amount of discretion to formulate procedures, as its experience in implementation dictates: (1) to assist and direct Commonwealth and local agencies respecting how to provide access to public records; and (2) to provide for timely, meaningful and thorough administrative review of challenged Commonwealth and local agency decisions. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.504(a).

First, as noted by the Commonwealth Court, the most recent iteration of the RTKL reflects an intent by the legislature that issues regarding access to public records be conducted in an expeditious and efficient manner. <em>Bowling v. Office of Open Records, </em><a href="/a2d/990/0813-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="990 A.2d 813" data-case-ids="7290660" data-case-paths="/a2d/990/0813-01">990 A.2d 813</a>, 822-23 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010). A pure <em>de novo </em>review by appellate courts of all issues would add delay and expense to often unrepresented requesters seeking access to public records. Furthermore, while certain determinations by the OOR will surely constitute pure questions of law, and, thus, be subject to <em>de novo </em>review, other questions will involve the application of fact to law, entailing some discretion on the part of the OOR. <em>See, e.g., </em>65 P.S. § 67.102 (determining confidential nature of information includes whether disclosure of information would cause substantial harm); <em><a href="/a2d/990/0813-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="990 A.2d 813" data-case-ids="7290660" data-case-paths="/a2d/990/0813-01">id.</a> </em>(determination of trade secret); 65 P.S. § 67.706 (determining whether redaction appropriate); 65 P.S. § 67.708 (determining exemptions from access including reasonable likelihood of physical harm and public safety). Finally, the General Assembly mandates <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>that when a request for access to a record is denied, the appeals officer who considers the appeal shall issue a “final determination” on behalf of the OOR or other agency. 65 P.S. § 67.1102(a)(4). In my view, these aspects of the RTKL counsel towards a reviewing court giving at least some degree of deference to an OOR decision.</p>

Distilled to its essence, Section 704 instructs that a Commonwealth agency's adjudication must be affirmed unless the court finds the adjudication is violative of the constitution or the law, contains procedural irregularities, or where findings of facts lack a basis. Section 704 does not purport to explain the level of deference to be given to the lower tribunal’s decision; rather, it appears <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>to act as a limitation on the types of issues that an appellate court may consider. Thus, Section 704 is not instructive in explaining the appropriate degree of deference to be accorded a lower tribunal’s decision.</p>

      <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[280,1918,1147,430]]]'>. I recognize that the RTKL provides that a court's decision is to "contain” findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon the evidence as a whole. 65 P.S. § 67.1301(a). Yet, an appeals officer is not required to hold a hearing and this decision is not appealable. 65 P.S. § 67.1102(a)(2). Reconciling these seemingly conflicting provisions of the RTKL, I conclude that, where an appeals officer decides not to hold a hearing, the Commonwealth Court may engage in independent fact finding, consistent with its mandate to render a decision with findings of facts, but, where an appeals officer holds a hearing, the officer's factual findings should be subject to a review of whether they are supported by the competent evidence.</p>
