In October 2011, Drs.

Shah and Vant Zelfde were the only witnesses. Having undertaken the records review, Dr. Vant Zelfde testified that Appellee displayed cognitive rigidity, paranoid ideations, and personality disorders. She stated that some of these traits were evident from Appellee’s voluminous and highly detailed writings such as those reflected in his numerous prison grievances, as well as his history of dismissing professionals who could be of assistance to him. Overall, she indicated that, in light of Appellee’s documented history, her observations of Appellee during the June 2011 proceeding, and Appellee’s refusal to be re-interviewed on the grounds of an imagined conspiracy, Appellee was severely impaired in his decision-making and, within a reasonable degree of psychological certainty, he was incompetent to make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary decision to waive counsel. Dr. Vant Zelfde clarified, however, that she was not speaking of incompetence in a legal sense, but only in a psychological sense. <em>See </em>N.T., Jan. 17, 2012 (day session), at 41, 111, 159; N.T., Jan. 17, 2012 (evening session), at 20. <em>See generally Holmes v.

As to legal competence, Dr. Vant Zelfde indicated only that she would continue to endorse the language contained in the October 2011 addendum reflecting that she and Dr. Shah could no longer be confident in their initial assessment that Appellee was competent. <em>See </em>N.T., Jan. 17, 2012 (day session), at 119.</p>

Still, both experts stated that, in spite of Appellee’s mental difficulties, he is aware that: he was tried and convicted of first-degree murder; he was sentenced to death as a result of that conviction; a withdrawal of the PCRA petition could lead to his execution; and death is final. <em>See id. </em>at 28 (Dr. Shah); N.T., Jan. 17, 2012 (evening session), at 36-37 (Dr. Vant Zelfde).</p>

The Commonwealth explained that such testimony was necessary to rebut a suggestion made by Attorney Ñolas at the June 2011 hearing that Appellee should be found incompetent to make decisions, in part, because he displays a pattern of refusing to cooperate with professionals who are in a position to assist him. The Commonwealth stressed, in this regard, that the court’s mental-health experts had recited this alleged aspect of Appellee’s mental-health history in their October 2011 addendum, thus reflecting that their assessment may have been based on a false premise. Separately, the Commonwealth suggested that, although Appellee was already represented by counsel, he <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>should have his own standby lawyer since he viewed himself as having discharged counsel, whose interests were opposed to his own relative to the competency determination. <em>See supra </em>note 6.

The court expressed that Appellee had demonstrated a pattern of thwarting the attempts of individuals who could aid him, and of viewing opportunities for him to advance his case as conspiracies against him that would be furthered by his cooperation. The court reasoned, in this regard, that Appellee’s refusal to be re-interviewed by the experts was consistent with the “diagnosed difficulties” they delineated in their October 2011 addendum. <em>Commonwealth v. Wright, </em>No. 98-CR-1980, slip op. at 7 (C.P.Blair, May 29, 2012) <em>(“Wright I </em>”). The court explained, moreover, that the experts’ conclusions were based on: their exposure, during Appellee’s pro se cross-examination of them, to his preoccupation with minute detail while losing sight of the larger picture; Appellee’s pattern of dismissing professional resources available to him; his impulsive reactivity and “irritable and pressured” speech; his “rigid approach, theatrical behavior, and black and white thinking;” and his “underly<a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>ing paranoid frame of reference.” <em>Id. </em>at 7-9. As for the requested <em>Bronshtein </em>colloquy, the court developed that the procedure was unnecessary because Appellee’s answers during such questioning could not override the expert evidence of incompetence on which the court grounded its determination. <em>See id. </em>at 16.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[276,645,1149,838]]]'>The Commonwealth requested reconsideration, arguing primarily that the court should not have found Appellee incompetent absent a <em>Bronshtein </em>colloquy. By order and opinion dated June 19, 2012, the court denied reconsideration and elaborated on its reasons for declining to hold a colloquy. The court observed that, in <em>Bronshtein, </em>the county court was unable to obtain a definitive expert opinion as to the prisoner’s competence, and hence, it had to fashion an appropriate colloquy and rely solely on the inmate’s responses and the court’s own observations as the colloquy ensued. Here, by contrast, the court had the benefit of two expert opinions based on extensive court and medical records, combined with the court’s and the experts’ first-hand observations of Appellee during his pro se cross-examination of the experts. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Thus, a non-final ruling is appealable where three conditions are satisfied: (1) it is separable from and collateral to the main cause of action; (2) the right involved is too important to be denied review; and (3) if review is postponed, the claim will be irreparably lost. <em>See Rae v.

Unfortunately, the Commonwealth does not reference any other authority in its substantive argument, opting instead simply to develop that the underlying circumstances of this case closely mirror those in <em>Bronshtein.

Notably, Appellee engaged in this tactic even at a time when the mental-health experts were in agreement with his position that he was competent to waive his rights, <em>i.e., </em>at the June 2011 hearing.

The PCRA court noted that the particular level of cooperation between Appellee and his attorneys from many years ago, or the reasons underlying disagreements that Appellee may have had with his prior counsel, was largely irrelevant to the experts’ opinions. Rather, the court continued, “it is the fact of the multiple attempts to discharge counsel rather than the individual <em>reasons </em>surrounding each attempt to discharge them that underlie [Appellee’s] personality disorder.” <em>Wright I, </em>slip op. at 13. In this regard, the PCRA court recited that it had “heard [Appellee’s] accusations against virtually every authority figure who has touched the case.” <em><a href="/pa/605/0137-02" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="988 A.2d 618" data-case-ids="3699165,7291244" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0137-02,/a2d/988/0618-01">Id.</a> </em>Against this backdrop, the court concluded that the proffered testimony would have “no persuasive value.” <em>Id. </em>at 14; <em>see also id. </em>at 13 (“[W]e are no longer in a position where nuances in relationships from 12 years ago hav[e] the ability to persuade.”).</p>

The court, as noted, relied upon a pattern displayed by Appellee of distrusting, discharging, and cutting off all communications with, a long list of attorneys and other professionals who could have assisted Appellee’s case. <em>Accord Wright II, slip op. </em>at 12-13. Such individuals included Drs. Shah and Vant Zelfde, who had originally come to a conclusion favorable to Appellee’s stated interests. More generally, a review of the hearing transcripts supports the court’s determination that Appellee is prone to engage in delusional and distorted thinking involving imagined conspiracies by such individuals, and that, based on such thinking, his ability to assist counsel in his own defense has been, and continues to be, significantly compromised. We <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>therefore find that the PCRA court acted within its discretion in concluding that listening to testimony concerning details of particular attorney-client relationships from the past would constitute a waste of the court’s time, particularly where such details were not directly relevant to the basis on which the court ultimately determined Appellee to be incompetent.
