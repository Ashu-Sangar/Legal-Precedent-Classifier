Mother seeks a ruling as to the number of “occurrences” for which the MCARE Fund is liable based on allegations that her physician failed to diagnose in a timely manner discrete in útero infections suffered by her twins, which caused severe injuries to both children. The Commonwealth Court granted summary judgment in favor of the MCARE Fund, holding that the physician’s failure to diagnose Mother’s infection constituted the single cause of the children’s injuries, and, therefore, there was a single occurrence, limiting MCARE coverage to the statutory limit of one payment of $1 million. We reverse, and hold that the Commonwealth Court erred by <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>granting summary judgment because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the children’s injuries arose from the physician’s failure to diagnose a single infection, or whether the children’s injuries resulted from the physician’s failure to diagnose multiple infections from different organisms that infected each child in útero at different times.

Mother filed a motion to mold the verdict to include delay damages, and Dr. S. filed post-trial motions. Thereafter, on August 23, 2006, Mother, Dr. S., and the MCARE Fund entered into a “Settlement Agreement, Assignment of Certain Rights and Provisional Full and Final Release” (“Agreement”), which provided as follows: (1) the MCARE Fund would make a single $1 million payment to Mother for the benefit of Alec and Samantha, plus a corresponding amount for delay damages and postjudgment interest; (2) Dr. S. would withdraw his post-trial motions following approval of the agreement; (3) Dr. S. would assign to Mother his right to litigate whether the MCARE Fund is required to pay a second $1 million for two occurrences of medical malpractice, and whether it is required to pay delay damages and post judgment interest on the remaining $12.15 million of the $13.15 million verdict; (4) Mother would bring a declaratory judgment action in Commonwealth Court to decide these issues; and (5) the MCARE Fund would waive any requirement that Mother exhaust her administrative remedies before filing the declaratory judgment action.</p>

Mother subsequently filed an original jurisdiction petition for review in the Commonwealth Court seeking a declaratory judgment on the two enumerated issues.

Petition for Review at 3, 5. Second, Mother, again standing in the shoes of Dr. S. by virtue of her assigned claim, argued that the MCARE Fund was liable for delay damages and postjudgment interest on the entire $13.15 million verdict because it was the MCARE Fund’s breach of duty to conduct fair and reasonable settlement negotiations that made Dr. S. responsible for paying a verdict far in excess of the available $1 million in MCARE coverage. Mother thereafter sought summary judgment. The Commonwealth Court issued an unpublished memorandum and order dated December 8, 2008, denying Mother summary judgment. <em>Kinney-Lindstrom v.

First, the court relied. on its ruling in <em>Kinney-Lindstrom I, </em>and concluded that the failure of Dr. S. to determine promptly whether a chorioamniositis infection was present in the uterus of Mother constituted the single cause of the damages and, thus, there was a single occurrence in this case. Because the MCARE Fund already paid Mother $1 million for the single occurrence, the court concluded that the MCARE Fund was entitled to summary judgment on this claim.</p>

According to the MCARE Fund, the Legislature’s enactment of Section 714(h) effectively limited its liability to delay damages and post-judgment interest based solely on the MCARE Fund’s statutory coverage limit. Because the MCARE Fund had already paid delay damages and postjudgment interest on its $1 million coverage limit on the extended claim, the MCARE Fund argued that its proportionate share had been paid, thereby entitling it to summary judgment on this issue.</p>

In an unpublished memorandum, the Commonwealth Court denied Mother’s petition for review, holding that she was not entitled to delay damages and post-judgment interest on the entire <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>$13.15 million verdict. <em>Kinney-Lindstrom, v.

The appellants’ basic liability insurers tendered their limits of basic coverage toward settlement, but the predecessor to the MCARE Fund, the Pennsylvania Medical Catastrophe Loss Fund (“CAT Fund”), did not tender the statutory limits of its excess coverage, and the plaintiffs pretrial settlement offer was rejected. The case proceeded to a jury, which rendered a $4 million verdict. The trial court thereafter imposed delay damages and postjudgment interest against appellants.</p>

Specifically, the appellants sought recovery of those delay damages attributable to the period of time during which the CAT Fund was in control of the settlement negotiations, but withheld coverage. They maintained that if the CAT Fund had offered coverage during that time, the plaintiffs pre-trial settlement offer would have been accepted, and delay damages would not have been imposed against the appellants.

Unlike <em>Willet, </em>however, the Court in <em>Walsh </em>found that the CAT Fund did not have exclusive control over the settlement negotiations at the time the plaintiffs pretrial settlement offer was denied. Both the physician’s primary insurer and the CAT Fund in <em>Walsh </em>had failed to offer coverage limits in settlement, thus; the primary insurance had not been exhausted, and the CAT Fund’s obligation to contribute the next dollar amount in excess coverage was never triggered. Nonetheless, the physician argued that the CAT Fund retained exclusive control over the settlement negotiations because it urged the primary insurer not to tender its coverage limit in settlement. We held that the CAT Fund’s act of dissuading the primary insurer from tendering policy limits did not establish that the CAT Fund had exclusive control over the settlement negotiations as the primary insurer had no obligation to follow the CAT Fund’s direction.

The Commonwealth Court concluded that Section 714(h) allocates the liability for delay damages and postjudgment interest between the health care provider’s basic coverage insurer and the MCARE Fund, which generally acts as the excess insurer in the typical case. Because the instant case involves an extended claim filed more than four years after the alleged tort occurred, <em>see </em>n.4, <em>supra, </em>for which the MCARE Fund provides both basic and excess coverage, the court held there is no need to allocate liability for delay damages and postjudgment interest between the primary and excess insurer pursuant to Section 714(h), as both are the MCARE Fund’s responsibility. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court held that Section 714(h) in no way superseded this Court’s decisions in <em>Willet </em>and <em>Walsh </em>and did not prevent Mother, standing in the shoes of defendant/Dr. S. by virtue of an assignment, from seeking indemnification under common law for delay damages and postjudgment interest on the entire $13.15 million verdict.</p>

We reiterate those factual findings relevant to the Commonwealth Court’s holding in this regard. During negotiations, Dr. S. gave consent to the MCARE Fund to use the $1 million coverage limit to settle Mother’s claim against all three defendants (Dr. S., another physician, and a hospital) only due to concern for his codefendant/physician, as Dr. S. did not fear an adverse verdict and believed he had done nothing wrong.

First, it reasoned that, unlike <em>Willet, </em>where the defendant in the medical malpractice action recognized the merit of the underlying claim and sought to settle the matter and avoid trial, Dr. S. did not believe there was a significant case against him, and gave consent to the MCARE Fund to use his $1 million coverage only if the contribution of funds would settle the case against all three defendants. Thus, the Commonwealth Court reasoned, the MCARE Fund did not breach a duty to its insured/physician, Dr. S., by failing to offer a settlement that Dr. S. did not believe was warranted on his behalf. Second, the court held that the MCARE Fund’s failure to make a formal settlement offer was not a breach of duty to Dr. S. because the MCARE Fund reasonably believed, based on Mother’s representations, that she required $1 million from the MCARE Fund, plus additional funds from the hospital to settle the case.</p>

    <p id="b142-5" data-blocks='[["BL_142.5",142,[278,1557,1149,790]]]'>Mother argues that the Commonwealth Court erred by relying on Dr. S.’s subjective belief that the medical malpractice claim lacked merit, finding such fact immaterial because there is no consent to settle provision under the MCARE Act. According to Mother, the MCARE Fund ignored the likelihood of an extremely large verdict for her two infants who were severely and permanently injured, and would require care for their lifetimes. She relies on the testimony of defense counsel for the hospital in the underlying medical malpractice action, acknowledging that Mother potentially had a 40% chance of prevailing, and that if she did prevail, a very large award of damages would follow. In Mother’s calculation, unsupported by any authority, a 40% chance of obtaining a $13 million verdict renders the value of the case at $5.2 million, necessitating an offer of the $1 million statutory limit.</p>

She asserts that any demand for settlement appeared futile as the MCARE Fund adjuster indicated that he did not believe the case would expose Dr. S. to liability in excess of $100,000. In Mother’s view, the MCARE Fund’s valuation of a $13.15 million claim as being worth less than $100,000 establishes a breach of duty to conduct fair and reasonable settlement negotiations on behalf of Dr. S. She concludes that the MCARE Fund’s failure to offer Dr. S.’s $1 million coverage limit to settle the underlying medical malpractice claim exposed him to liability on the excess verdict, thereby rendering the MCARE Fund liable to pay postjudgment interest and delay damages on the entire $13.15 million verdict pursuant to <em>Willet </em>and <em>Walsh.</em>

Additionally, it reiterates the Commonwealth Court’s holding that Mother never indicated that an offer of $1 million might be accepted, and, instead, consistently led the MCARE Fund to believe that she would not consider settlement without a contribution from the other two non-settling codefendants, the hospital and a second physician. The MCARE Fund concedes there was a potential for a large recovery, but argues that such fact, in and of itself, does not require it to offer the maximum statutory coverage or risk liability for delay damages and postjudgment interest on the entire verdict. In sum, the MCARE Fund concludes that it was reasonable not to offer a settlement that none of the defendants wanted, and that it believed the plaintiff would not accept.</p>

Further, the mere fact that a large verdict would result if the jury credited the plaintiffs experts in the underlying medical malpractice case cannot alone render the MCARE Fund negligent in failing to settle.</p>
