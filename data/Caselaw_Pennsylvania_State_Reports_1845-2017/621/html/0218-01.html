To the extent the Superior Court held that an officer must inform an individual that a positive result in a blood test may have criminal repercussions, and such failure renders any consent to the blood test invalid, the court erred. We further hold that the totality of the circumstances presented instantly support the trial court’s conclusion that the suppression of blood test results was not warranted. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court, and we remand this case to that court for consideration of issues that remain in abeyance.</p>

He finished drinking at 11:00 or 11:30 that night and went to bed. He awoke the next morning and, apparently feeling no ill effects from his drinking the night before, drove himself to work. Around 11:00 a.m., Appellee drove from his place of employment to deposit the receipts from the previous day at a local bank. His course of travel took him along Oxford Valley Road in Middletown Township, Bucks County. He approached the intersection with Frosty Hollow Road and attempted to make a left-hand turn onto Frosty Hollow Road.</p>

After impact, Mrs. McHugh’s vehicle struck a third car on Frosty Hollow Road, driven by Robin Cunliffe, and only came to rest after striking a fence on the side of the road. While neither Appellee nor Ms. Cunliffe were injured, it was immediately apparent that the McHughs suffered severe injuries.

Officer Agostino, who had been off-duty at the time of the accident, arrived on-scene out of uniform but wearing a hat that said “Middletown Township Police Department.” He immediately began speaking with Appellee concerning the circumstances of the accident. He then walked over to the McHughs’ vehicle, to discover that Mrs. McHugh had been transported to a local hospital, and rescue workers were attending to Mr. McHugh. Accordingly, Officer Agostino returned to Appellee and “asked him due to the seriousness of the accident with a potential fatality if he would submit to a chemical blood test,” the purpose of which was “to eliminate any possibility that alcohol or controlled substance was involved.” Notes of Testimony, Suppression Hearing (N.T.), Sept. 24, 2009 at 10, 12.

Upon receiving the results of the chemical tests, Middletown Township Police arrested Appellee, and charged him with various crimes related to the accident, including DUI — general impairment/incapable of driving safely, DUI — general impairment (BAC of 0.08-0.10 percent), and homicide by vehicle while DUI.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

A jury trial thereafter commenced and on November 19, 2009, the jury found Appellee guilty of the above-stated charges.

The Commonwealth argues that Fourth Amendment jurisprudence does not mandate that an officer has “a duty to inform” the consenting party of the potential that a positive result will be used against him. <em>Smith, </em>at *11.

Officer Agostino further informed Appellee that he could refuse to take the test. Nonetheless, Appellee, who was not injured, agreed to be transported to a local hospital for the blood draw, gave a sample of his blood, and police returned him to the scene of the accident immediately thereafter. At no point did police ever place Appellee under arrest or in custody. The Commonwealth accordingly states, “A reasonable and objective evaluation of the facts and circumstances here demonstrate that Appellee had reasonable notice of what was being requested, the reason it was being requested and with that knowledge he consented to the blood draw.

First, the Commonwealth avers that the voluntary or knowing nature of the consent in <em>Danforth </em>was not primarily at issue, as the case primarily concerned the constitutionality of an implied consent law then in effect. <em>See supra </em>note 5. Thus, the trial court in <em>Danforth </em>never made factual or credibility determinations concerning the defendant’s consciousness of consent, the premise upon which the Superior Court based its decision concerning the validity of the consent. <em>Danforth, </em><a href="/pa-super/395/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="395 Pa.

Finally, <em>Danforth </em>did not set down a <em>per se </em>rule as the Superior Court did here. Rather, <em>Danforth </em>examined the totality of the circumstances presented in that case and determined that the defendant did not possess notice or awareness concerning the circumstances of the blood test.</p>

In <em>Danforth, </em>where suppression was deemed proper, the defendant had suffered injuries and been taken to the hospital, and had not been "Mirandized." Accordingly, a reasonable person could have believed that the blood draw was for medical purposes, and the finding that reasonable "notice of the possible criminal ramifications of the blood test” was not present in the case was supported by the record. <em>Danforth, </em><a href="/pa-super/395/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="395 Pa.

The practical and inevitable effect of a court conditioning the validity of a consent upon a defendant's appreciation of a specific fact — as <em>Walsh </em>and <em>Danforth </em>explicitly did — is to require police to issue <em>Miranda </em>style "warnings” respecting that fact. Otherwise, all consent searches are imperiled.</p>

Whatever the proper interpretation of those cases, certain language in <em>Walsh </em>could easily be expanded upon by our courts if we do not make our disapproval clearer. Indeed, I believe this was the case in <em>Danforth, </em>which, despite first explaining the analysis is one considering the totality of the circumstances, went on to cite <em>Walsh </em>for the proposition that, where a defendant “ ‘can establish that he had no notice of the criminal investigative purpose of the blood test, his consent would be invalid.’ ” <em>Danforth, </em>at 1023 (quoting <em>Walsh, </em>at 773).</p>

First, it implies a defendant must have a subjective knowledge of the purpose of the search, an issue properly rejected by the majority. Second, when read in isolation from the balance of <em>Walsh, </em>it implies objective awareness of the purpose of the test is an absolute requirement for valid consent. While the majority correctly notes “this Court has been clear that no one fact or circumstance can be talismanic in the evaluation of the validity of a person’s consent[,]” Majority Op., at 234, 77 A.3d at 572 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[182,492,1153,800]]]'>The majority states: “Accordingly, to the extent the Superi- or Court held that police officers must explicitly inform drivers consenting to blood testing that the results of the test may be used against them in criminal prosecutions in order for the consent to be valid, it went too far.” <em><a href="/pa/470/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="368 A.2d 272" data-case-ids="1723800,1723812" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0219-01,/pa/470/0220-01">Id.</a> </em>Not only did the Superior Court err here by requiring a police warning of the purpose of the test before consent can be deemed valid, but its prior holdings implying such an understanding (even an objective one gleaned without an explicit warning) is required for valid consent were also in error. Rather, an objective understanding of the purpose of the test is merely one element a court may consider when analyzing the voluntariness of consent under the totality of the circumstances, just as one’s knowledge of the right to refuse consent is merely a single factor to be considered, and not a requirement.</p>
