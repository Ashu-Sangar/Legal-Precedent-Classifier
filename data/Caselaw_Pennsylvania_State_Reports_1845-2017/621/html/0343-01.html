    <p id="b411-9" data-blocks='[["BL_411.10",411,[187,1015,1151,405]]]'>I agree with my colleagues that, upon Appellees’ evidentiary concession, the opinion of the Superior Court must be reversed. Respectfully, however, in my view, the Court should have stopped there; instead, the Court proceeds to “reaffirm” a series of unadorned holdings, simultaneously asserting they are “well established,” but nonetheless re-expressing them. I cannot join this seriatim <em>dicta, </em>and so concur only in the result.</p>
    <p id="b411-10" data-blocks='[["BL_411.11",411,[185,1452,1151,521]]]'>First, although the Court contends that these “governing principles” are “relevant to the appropriate disposition of the present case,” <em>Per Curiam </em>Order, ante at 348, 78 A.3d at 608, I cannot agree. Given the record before us, the parties agree that the Superior Court’s opinion should be reversed, and this Court concurs. Appellees’ evidentiary concession is the end of the matter, as it fully supports our summary reversal, and, indeed, the Court does not explain how the expressed principles are relevant to our disposition. In my view, these seriatim holdings are unmistakable <em>obiter dicta.</em>

That is particularly true when those proclamations are unnecessary to our disposition, and are unmoored from any factual context.</p>
