Appellant was driving a truck insured by Harleysville when he rear-ended a vehicle driven by Ryan Piontkowski, who was waiting to make a left-hand turn. The police were summoned, and the investigating officer spoke to appellant and Piontkowski; the police report contained no mention of a phantom vehicle being involved in the accident. Appellant later reported the accident to his employer, explaining he momentarily took his eyes off the road, and when he looked again, a vehicle was stopped <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>in front of him; he was unable to stop and rear-ended the vehicle. No phantom vehicle was mentioned. Twenty days later, appellant completed a written Workers’ Compensation Employee’s Statement<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in which he reported the accident occurred due to Piontkowski stopping suddenly in front of him.

Harleysville denied appellant’s claim and sought a declaratory judgment that he was not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits. At a non jury trial, Harleysville contended the phantom vehicle did not exist, and regardless, appellant failed to comply with the statutory requirement to notify Harleysville of the phantom vehicle within 30 days. The trial court determined the phantom vehicle existed, and appellant had reported it to the investigating officer at the scene and to Harleysville “as soon as practicable,” as required by 75 Pa.C.S. § 1702.

Those measures included hiring an investigator to canvass the scene within days of the accident, obtaining counsel to direct an investigation and develop a defense, employing an accident reconstruction list to certify the scene, securing schematics and scene photographs, interviewing the investigating officer when his memory of the accident was fresh, requesting 911 tapes, and tracking down witnesses. N.T. Trial, 8/24/10, at 22-23, 37-41. Although several of these measures were <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>taken upon Harleysville receiving notice of the alleged phantom vehicle, witnesses opined their effectiveness in aiding the investigation was significantly diminished by the delay due to the short-lived nature of prime <em>evidence </em>— e.g., tire marks and witness availability and memory. <em>Id., </em>at 14 (“[W]hen there’s a phantom vehicle being alleged, you have to get out there as soon as possible to get your investigation done.”); <em>id., </em>at 22 (due to late notice, “[t]hat accident was lost in obtaining witnesses that could have been there”); <em>id., </em>at 29-30 (911 tapes destroyed after 30 days; may have found additional witnesses if given earlier notice); <em>id., </em>at 33 (delay means “evidence disappears”); <em>id., </em>at 35 (no additional witnesses “because [they] didn’t have the opportunity to go out and look for them”); <em>id., </em>at 41 (phantom vehicle cases very difficult because trying to prove negative; “Memory is very important in this thing.... [A] person’s memory is much fresher a couple days after the accident than almost a year after the accident. Police officers get involved much easier, much quicker right after the accident because things are fresh and they have the opportunity to do supplemental reports than a year later when their memories are not as fresh and they don’t want to even get into supplemental reports.”); <em>id., </em>at 42 (“[T]he importance to determining [whether a phantom vehicle was involved] is quick, immediate investigation using a team effort through investigators, reconstruction people, to try and track down any human being who is out there who may have seen it[.]”); <em>id., </em>at 48 (In “cases on phantom vehicles, you have to attack the phantom vehicle from day one and see if there is any evidence to support it----”); <em>id., </em>at 72 (“[T]he earlier the better to look for things like debris, marks on the roadway, damage, availability to look at vehicles. The longer you wait, then the less opportunity you have for that data.”). In particular, the investigator assigned to appellant’s case testified timing of the phantom vehicle notice impacts the scope of her investigation in that, when notice is timely received, it is more likely a canvass of the area will procure witnesses, physical evidence on the roadway is more likely to be available, she is able to more effectively interview the investigating officer, and the insured’s memory is more likely to be accu<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>rate. <em>Id., </em>at 53-57. By the time notice was received in this case, there was nothing left on the roadway in terms of physical evidence from the accident, and conducting a canvass of the area for additional witnesses was deemed pointless; therefore, her investigation was limited to the statements of appellant, his employer, Piontkowski, and the investigating officer, all of which contained no reference to a phantom vehicle. <em>See id., </em>at 61-62. Thus, the court concluded, “Under these specific circumstances, ... the trial court erred in requiring Harleysville to establish conclusively what evidence a timely investigation would have discovered.” <em>Vanderhoff, </em>at 748.</p>

The 30-day notice requirement is there for a reason. It is reasonable that insureds must alert the insurer within a month’s time. While an insurer will not be permitted to deny coverage absent prejudice caused by an insured’s delay in notice, showing such prejudice does not require proof of what the insurer would have found had timely notice been provided. To demand such evidence would result in a Mobius strip whereby, to show prejudice, the insurer would have to show through concrete evidence the evidence it was unable to uncover due to the untimely notice.

This broad inquiry supports the purpose of the notice requirement, which is to allow the insurer to investigate the accident to determine whether there is a legitimate claim of a phantom vehicle and to make an informed decision whether to cover the insured’s claims or to reject them as unfounded. Harleysville articulates the following factors for courts to consider in applying this test.</p>
    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[272,1455,1149,896]],["BL_503.1",503,[180,312,1149,413]]]'>First, to determine whether the insurer was prejudiced as a result of the late notice, courts should account for the evidence available to the insurer at the time notice is finally given from the accident itself. We may consider whether the insurance company has access to contemporaneous statements of disinterested eyewitnesses in police reports, video of the accident, or physical evidence that can either confirm or disprove the existence of the phantom vehicle. For example, if eyewitnesses blame the accident on another car, surveillance video indisputably confirms the existence of the other car, or paint marks match the insured’s description of the phantom vehicle, an insurance company has less reason to question the existence of the phantom vehicle and thus less need to pursue its own investigation. Moreover, there is a compelling argument that if an insurance company was previously aware of such evidence, it would <em>de facto </em>place the insurance company on notice of the existence of a currently unidentified vehicle’s <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>involvement in the accident, triggering its right to seek further information. Conversely, as in this case, if there are no eyewitnesses that mention the phantom vehicle and no physical evidence corroborating the insured’s claims, the insurance company may well suffer substantial prejudice if it is not provided timely notice to allow it to canvas the area for eyewitnesses and physical evidence or perform accident reconstruction to determine the legitimacy of the insured’s claims.</p>
    <p id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[179,749,1148,465]]]'>Similarly, courts should consider the details of the delay in notification. Obviously, courts must factor in the length of the delay. An insurer that receives notice one day after the expiration of the statutory thirty-day notification period will be hard pressed to establish prejudice just as an insured who does not give notice until a year after the accident may find it difficult to argue lack of prejudice, even recognizing that the insurer has the burden of demonstrating prejudice. <em>Vanderhoff I, </em><a href="/pa/606/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="997 A.2d 328" data-case-ids="4198581,4199096,4199290,7286989,7287040,7287153" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0272-01,/pa/606/0271-02,/pa/606/0271-01,/a2d/997/0328-01,/a2d/997/0328-02,/a2d/997/0328-03">997 A.2d at 335</a>.</p>
    <p id="b503-5" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[176,1239,1150,839]]]'>A court should also take into account the justification for the delay. An insurer may legitimately have reason to question the existence of a phantom vehicle, and thus suffer substantial prejudice from its inability to investigate the claims, if the insured’s delay in providing notice is unexplained. For example, in the case at bar, red flags are raised because the insured failed to mention the existence of the alleged phantom vehicle in several of his descriptions of the accident, without any explanation for the significant delay in providing notice. In contrast, one can imagine the hypothetical injured-insured who wakes up from a comma and immediately blames the accident on a phantom vehicle with detailed explanation. In such a case, the insurer will have less reason to suspect insurance fraud and, perhaps, less need to pursue further investigation. In accordance with Harleysville’s suggestion, the reason for the delay may factor into a court’s analysis.</p>

Additionally, I question whether the Majority Opinion’s statement that the "primary goal” of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (MVFRL) is to "keep automobile insurance affordable” adds anything to a court's review of disputes between insurers and insured in 2013. Maj. Op. at 438-40, 78 A.3d at 1066-67. I have previously "call[ed] for advocates and the judiciary to cease their continued reliance on the unthinking perpetuation of the long-ameliorated concern for cost containment.” <em>Williams v.

Moreover, a majority of justices have recently recognized that cost containment does not trump all other public policies. <em>See Heller v. Pa.

Accordingly, I respectfully reject the Majority's view of the policy of cost-containment as remaining pertinent to judicial interpretation of the MVFRL.</p>
