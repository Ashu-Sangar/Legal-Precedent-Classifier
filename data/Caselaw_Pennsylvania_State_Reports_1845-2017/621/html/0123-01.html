    <p id="b183-12" data-blocks='[["BL_183.11",183,[168,1147,1147,149]]]'>AND NOW, this 5th day of September, 2013, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED. The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:</p>
    <blockquote id="b183-13" data-blocks='[["BL_183.12",183,[213,1317,1103,256]]]'>(1) Is whether a sentencing court has the authority to sentence an individual for a violation of 75 [Pa.C.S.] § 3802(DUI) prior to the completion of a full drug and alcohol assessment under the requirements of [75 Pa. C.S. § 3814]?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b183-14" data-blocks='[["BL_183.13",183,[213,1597,1105,302]]]'>(2) Is the language of 75 [Pa.C.S.] § 3814 a mandatory sentencing provision requiring a sentencing court to comply with its requirements prior to the imposition of a sentence for a DUI violation, or is § 3814 an optional provision that can be disregarded at the court’s discretion?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b183-15" data-blocks='[["BL_183.14",183,[212,1928,1104,258]]]'>(3) Does a Defendant have the ability through conduct, or otherwise, to waive the requirements of 75 [Pa.C.S.] § 3814, and permit a sentencing court to enter a sentence even though a full drug and alcohol assessment has not been completed prior to sentencing?</blockquote>
