In resolving this question, the Court is called upon to determine whether expiration of the 500-week period set forth within the Act (also referred to, <em>infra, </em>as a statute of repose) operates as a bar to the assertion of total disability claims by employees who have experienced a suspension of benefits; that determination requires the Court to examine the Commonwealth Court’s decisional law in this area. Finally, to properly decide the case, we must examine the effect of payments made pursuant to supplemental agreements upon an otherwise expired workers’ compensation claim. The Commonwealth Court below affirmed the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board’s (“WCAB”) reversal of a Workers’ Compensation Judge’s (“WCJ”) decision granting appellant’s reinstatement and penalty petitions. For reasons that follow, we hold that appellant’s reinstatement petition was not timely filed. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court, albeit for different reasons.</p>

Over thirteen years later, on May 19, 2003, the parties entered into an agreement reinstating appellant’s total disability benefits from February 24, 2003, to March 17, 2003. His total disability benefits were then reinstated again from June 17, 2005, to August 29, 2005. And on June 20, 2007, his total disability benefits were once again reinstated.

    <p id="b91-5" data-blocks='[["BL_91.4",91,[167,594,1153,1058]]]'>The reasoning of the Commonwealth Court majority is relatively straightforward. The court concluded that since appellant’s benefits were suspended on September 20, 1989, when appellant returned to his pre-injury position without a loss of earnings, the Township was entitled to a suspension of appellant’s compensation payments as of that date, by operation of law, and notwithstanding the lack of any supplemental agreement or WCJ’s order establishing that suspension. The court reasoned that given the effective date of the suspension, appellant had until approximately April of 1999, <em>ie., </em>500 weeks (or nine and one half years) from the date of the suspension, to file a reinstatement petition before his right to benefits was completely extinguished according to Section 413(a) of the Act. Appellant, however, did not file his reinstatement petition within those 500 weeks, and, in fact, did not file it until September 26, 2008 — more than nine years after expiration of the allotted 500-week period. Thus, the Commonwealth Court held, because appellant’s reinstatement petition was filed beyond the 500-week period, the petition is time-barred by Section 413(a)’s 500-week statute of repose.</p>
    <p id="b91-6" data-blocks='[["BL_91.5",91,[169,1677,1150,684]],["BL_92.1",92,[293,309,1147,312]]]'>Appellant argues that the Commonwealth Court erred as a matter of law, misinterpreting and/or misapplying Section 413(a) in concluding that his reinstatement petition is barred by the 500-week statute of repose. Appellant notes that he filed his petition within three years of his most recent compensation payment, a filing which is permitted by the plain meaning of the first proviso of Section 413(a), which appellant argues provides a three-year filing window from the last payment of compensation, even if compensation had previously been suspended for a period of time. Alternatively, appellant argues that his petition is not barred by the 500-week statute of repose because the Township voluntarily reinstated compensation subsequent to the expiration date for his claim. <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>Along these lines, appellant notes that he filed his petition within three years of his most recent payment following reinstatement as required by Section 413(a). In fact, it is undisputed that payments were ongoing at the time of appellant’s filing. Therefore, appellant argues, the petition to reinstate was timely filed.</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[290,646,1153,1322]]]'>Appellant further contends that the court below overlooked the legislative purpose of Section 413(a), as well as the basis of many of the decisions interpreting and applying Section 413(a). In appellant’s view, the objective of the statutory scheme is to grant claimants whose benefits are suspended a longer period within which to file a petition for a change in status than claimants who are neither receiving benefits nor under suspension. To apply Section 413(a) to the detriment of a claimant who was not under a suspension, but was in fact receiving benefits, turns the objective of the statute on its head, according to appellant. He further notes that the common goal of statutes of limitations and statutes of repose is to protect employers from being called upon to defend against stale claims, a concern that is not implicated here because appellant’s claim was not stale, given that payments on the claim were ongoing when he filed his reinstatement petition, and that the Township voluntarily reinstated compensation four times. In support of his legislative purpose argument, appellant cites to a footnote from this Court’s opinion in <em>Stewart, </em>in which Mr. Justice Saylor, writing for a unanimous Court, described the Court’s understanding of the interplay of the various provisions of Section 413(a). Because that understanding is central to our ultimate disposition here, we do well to quote the footnote so as to provide a framework for the dispute:</p>
    <blockquote id="b92-5" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[328,1986,1107,365]],["BL_93.1",93,[217,314,1109,1027]]]'>The final sentence of Section 413(a) expressly indicates what is permissible during the 500-week period related to claims in suspension, namely, resumption of benefits. Thus, its primary, direct application is to permit a claimant whose benefits are in suspension to avoid the effect of Section 413(a)’s three-year limitations period applicable to claimants whose benefits have been terminated____Underlying this <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>substantive effect is a clear and sound policy justification— since a suspension for economic reason benefits an employer, the employer would be ill-heard to complain if a claimant’s subsequent loss of earnings power triggers restoration of benefits within the statutory period of eligibility---Certainly by implication, the statute also requires that periods of suspension be included within the 500-week calculation for purposes of determining when partial disability benefits have expired____ A further inference is required, however, to support the conclusion that all post-500week claims (including those for total disability) on the part of a claimant whose benefits have been suspended are precluded. Moreover, as noted, this would not appear to be as reasoned an inference, as we perceive no apparent sound policy justification for distinguishing between partially-disabled claimants who have received a full complement of partial disability benefits and those who have experienced some period of suspension, in terms of the effect of the expiration of 500 weeks upon potential future claims.</blockquote>

WCAB (Guthrie), </em>132 Pa.Cmwlth. 54, <a href="/pa-commw/132/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="571 A.2d 1112" data-case-ids="1401168" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/132/0054-01">571 A.2d 1112</a>, 1114 (1990). Appellant argues that those cases are distinguishable because, “none of these cases involve a circumstance where a claimant is attempting to reinstate total disability benefits or partial disability benefits when payments have been made pursuant to a series of supplemental agreements paying both total and partial disability [for] a period of over five (5) years and his petition was filed within three (3) years of both types of payments.” Appellant’s Brief at 22. Appellant also stresses that the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of Section 413(a) originated in <em>USX Corporation, </em>a case where, unlike here, the employer was advocating for application of the three-year limitations period, as opposed to the 500-week statute of repose, arguing that the claimant there was required to file his claim within the shorter three-year time frame.</p>
    <p id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[280,1393,1153,958]],["BL_95.1",95,[166,315,1149,201]]]'>Ultimately, appellant’s core position is that the Commonwealth Court erred by concluding that his prior suspension deprived him of his right to petition for reinstatement of his total disability benefits pursuant to the plain language of Section 413(a)’s proviso allowing for a petition for reinstatement of benefits within three years of the worker’s most recent compensation payment. Thus, appellant takes the concern carefully articulated, but not resolved by the Court in <em>Stewart, </em>and places it squarely before this Court. Appellant argues that there is “no ... sound policy justification for distinguishing between partially-disabled claimants who have received a full complement of partial disability benefits” and are still permitted to petition for reinstatement of total disability benefits provided they do so within three years of their most recent payment, and claimants who, like appellant, “have experienced some period of suspension, in terms of the effect of the expiration of 500 weeks upon potential future claims.” Appellant’s Brief at 24 (citing <em>Stewart, </em><a href="/a2d/756/0655-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="756 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="11243566,225953" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/0655-01,/pa/562/0401-01">756 A.2d at </a>658 n. 5). <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>Notwithstanding the expiration of his 500-week period, appellant maintains that he had a continued right to petition for reinstatement of total disability benefits, so long as he filed within three years of his most recent payment, which he did.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <em>Palaschak </em>misapprehended this Court’s opinion in <em>Stewart </em>in stating that we were being critical of Section 413(a), and inviting the Legislature to reassess its policy decision; that characterization gives the appearance that <em>Stewart </em>agreed with the Commonwealth Court’s construction of the statute, thought the statutory command itself was unfortunate, and invited the General Assembly to revisit the policy decision reflected in the plain language. To the contrary, there is nothing in <em>Stewart </em>questioning the logic or policy reflected in Section 413(a). Rather, what was expressly called into ques<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>tion by <em>Stewart </em>was the Commonwealth Court’s construction and interpretation of the statute. Specifically, we addressed whether the unexplained disparity in treatment between claimants represented in the Commonwealth Court’s decisional law presented an “appropriate basis for questioning those decisions which interpret the expiration of the 500-week period as a bar to the assertion of total disability claims by employees who have experienced a suspension of benefits (for example, <em>Edgewater, Deppenbrook </em>and Roussos), since such construction is less solidly grounded in the plain meaning of Section 413(a).” <em>Stewart, </em><a href="/a2d/756/0655-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="756 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="11243566,225953" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/0655-01,/pa/562/0401-01">756 A.2d at 658</a> (emphasis added). <em>Stewart </em>did no more than attempt to provide guidance concerning the proper interpretation of the plain language of the statute.</p>

The case <em>sub judice </em>presents this Court with the opportunity to conduct that closer scrutiny. We have already done so with our straightforward statutory analysis above.

Although overbroad, that statement was fitting in its context. There, a claimant was paid benefits pursuant to a supplemental agreement prior to being released to work with a suspension in benefits. The claimant worked for approximately two months thereafter, and was then laid off. Approximately four years and eight months from the claimant’s last payment, but only about 242 weeks from the date of suspension, the claimant petitioned for a reinstatement of total disability benefits. The employer argued that the claimant’s filing window was limited to three years from the date of the claimant’s last payment, notwithstanding the fact that the claimant’s partial disability compensation was payable for another 258 weeks under the Act. The court held that the controlling proviso was that which afforded the claimant 500 weeks to petition for reinstatement. Read against its facts, and the issue actually presented — whether the three-year limit or the 500 week limit applied — , the statement in <em>USX Corporation </em>that the three-year period was “totally inapplicable” was unexceptional. Plainly, however, <em>USX Corporation </em>did not deal with a post-500-week petition for total disability benefits, let alone the scenario wherein payment is made late in the 500-week period and the reinstatement petition is filed within three years of that payment.

For example, as we understand the statute, giving effect to both <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>provisions, if a post-suspension claimant receives a workers’ compensation payment pursuant to a brief recurrence of total disability 448 weeks after his return to work, while that claimant retains only 52 weeks of eligibility for partial disability benefits, the claimant nonetheless remains entitled to petition for reinstatement of total disability benefits for three years from the date of this most recent payment according to the plain language of Section 413(a). The court in <em>USX Corporation </em>did not purport to address this scenario. Moreover, none of the cases in this line advert to Section 1932 of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1932, respecting the proper construction of statutes <em>in pari materia. </em>In short, the holding in <em>USX Corporation </em>may have been correct for the dispute presented there; but the rote application of its summary statement concerning the two different timing provisions in Section 413(a) to distinctly different scenarios in later cases was erroneous.</p>

Indeed, even if appellant had received a payment on the last day of his 500-week statutory period (which he did not), he would have only been entitled to a three-year period from the date of that payment to file his reinstatement petition. In that event, the latest possible date for him to file a timely petition for modification relative to his January 24, 1989 work-related injury would have been April 21,2002. On that date, however, appellant continued to work without a loss in earnings, and without filing a petition to reinstate total disability benefits.

This assessment is incorrect. Where a statute of limitations pertains to a common law right of action, the expiration of the limitations period does not operate to extinguish the common law right, but only the remedy that may be obtained by the person asserting that right. However, as a general principle, where the right of action arises out of a statute, such as the Workers’ Compensation Act, “there is no right of action unless asserted in accordance with the provisions of the statute.” <em>First Pool Gas Coal Co. v.

Gina Cozzone, executrix of appellant Andrew Cozzone’s estate, has informed the Court that appellant is deceased as of May 4, 2012. While Gina Cozzone is substituted for appellant in this case as a technical matter, this Opinion refers to Andrew Cozzone as "appellant” throughout.</p>

In addition, the WCJ determined that the Township was equitably estopped from raising a statute of repose defense, because the Township <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>had lulled appellant into believing his compensation rights were fully protected by executing various agreements. The Commonwealth Court disagreed, as the Township is not alleged to have done anything to induce appellant to not seek reinstatement while he was actually eligible to do so. Appellant does not raise an estoppel argument before this Court.</p>

In addition, appellant contends that even if his reinstatement petition is barred, the Township should be held to compliance with its own supplemental agreement, pursuant to which it continued to pay partial disability benefits, unless it can show that benefits can be terminated or stopped in a manner consistent with the Act. In appellant’s view, periods of suspension do not count against the 500 weeks, and thus, appellant has only received 60 weeks of compensation. We note, however, that decisional law from the Commonwealth Court is to the contrary, <em>see Cicchiello v. WCAB (Frank L. Market Corp.), </em><a href="/a2d/761/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="761 A.2d 210" data-case-ids="11151560" data-case-paths="/a2d/761/0210-01">761 A.2d 210</a>, 213 (Pa.Cmwlth.2000) ("the period of limitations is not tolled during the time benefits are suspended"); appellant has forwarded no developed reasoning or criticism to warrant this Court considering and disapproving that precedent; and we did not accept review to consider the point. Accordingly, we offer no view on this particular argument.</p>

The Township further argues that the 500-week limitation warrants stricter construction than the three-year limitation because the 500-week limitation concerns the running of a benefit for a finite period, which benefit may not be expanded. In suggesting a "less strict” construction of the three-year limitations period, the Township cites to case law concerning whether a claim for disfigurement benefits was time-barred under Section 315 of the Act, 77 P.S. § 602, because it was made eighteen years after termination of the claimant’s benefits. The cited case, <em>Guthrie v. WCAB (Keystone Coal Co.), </em><a href="/a2d/767/0634-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="767 A.2d 634" data-case-ids="11125440" data-case-paths="/a2d/767/0634-01">767 A.2d 634</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2001), however, forwards no relevant discussion concerning the 500-week limitations period, let alone any comparative analysis concerning appropriate construction for the limitations provisions of Section 413(a).</p>
