Norfolk contends that Section 2702(a) limits the PUC’s jurisdiction to allocate costs associated with crossing projects only to a transportation utility which has constructed “its facilities” across a highway or where a highway has been constructed across “the facilities of any such public utility,” 66 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a). <em>See </em>Brief for Norfolk at 12 (“The usage of the possessive pronoun ‘its’ in conjunction with ‘facilities’ signifies that only transportation utilities that <em>own </em>facilities at rail-highway crossings are ‘concerned parties’ and therefore subject to cost allocation.”).

The difficulty with Norfolk’s conception of limited jurisdiction or power is that the company is unable to identify a statutorily-based principle cabining the Commission’s cost-allocation authority, once jurisdiction is acknowledged.

Norfolk, however, enjoys a benefit from crossing sites at large — through which it conducts daily railroad operations and over which it maintains a right of <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>way — directly associated with the purpose of the infrastructure that was there.

Norfolk's sensitivity in this regard seems somewhat misplaced, since its counsel characterized the operating arrangement as being in the nature of a lease at an initial cost-allocation hearing before an administrative law judge. <em>See </em>N.T., Mar. 27, 2001, at 75 (reflecting the representation of Norfolk’s counsel that "[wje’re a lessee, basically.”).</p>

Consistent with the bulk of its brief, Norfolk’s response here might be to say that the lack of facilities is precisely the reason why the Commission lacks jurisdiction or authority.

Norfolk does not reference a decision holding that the Commission is jurisdictionally precluded from assessing costs against a fixed utility beyond the cost of relocation of its own facilities, say, in a case where a crossing's overall infrastructure required material modifications to accommodate those facilities. This circumstance is not presently before us, and thus, we will not address it further at present. Our purpose here is merely to say that, once the cost-allocation power is acknowledged — as it is by Norfolk — Norfolk does not benefit from the same natural limiting principle applicable to fixed utilities.</p>
