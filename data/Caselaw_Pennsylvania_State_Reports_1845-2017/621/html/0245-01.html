There is no substantial duplication if “proof of each individual instance of possession and delivery in each county ... require the introduction of the testimony of completely different police officers and expert witnesses as well as the establishment of separate chains of custody[,]” <em>Bracalielly, </em>at 762, or if “there were three victims in three different counties requiring three different investigations, and different witnesses were necessary at each trial.” <em>Spotz, </em>at 1159. When determining if there is a duplication of legal issues, a court should not limit its analysis to a mere comparison of the charges, but should also consider whether, despite “the variation in the form of the criminal charges,” there is a “commonality” of legal issues within the two prosecutions. <em>Anthony, </em>at 1019. It should be remembered, however, “[t]he mere fact that the additional statutory offenses involve additional issues of law or fact is not sufficient to create a separate criminal episode since the logical relationship test does not require an absolute identity of factual backgrounds.” <em>Hude, </em>at 181 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

      <em>Bracalielly, </em>at 761. A proper analysis requires courts to determine whether there is a substantial duplication of issues of fact and law. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).

The witnesses for the 2007 case were Detective Shoemaker, another member of the Drug Task Force, and the chemist who tested the cocaine — its locale involved a convenience store and the rear of the Hilltop Bar. The 2010 case, which alleged acts before and after the prior delivery, involved four witnesses in addition to Detective Shoemaker.
