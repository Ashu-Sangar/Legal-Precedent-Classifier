The issue, as stated by petitioner, is:\nWhether offenses which are not specifically enumerated by the General Assembly as offenses which disqualify defendants from eligibility under [the Recidivism Risk Reduction Incentive Act (\u201cRRRI Act\u201d),\u2019 61 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4501, et seq.] may otherwise form the basis of denial of eligibility pursuant to the general eligibility requirement that a defendant does not demonstrate \u201ca history of present or past violent behavior,\u201d rendering an offender ineligible? Restated in the context of the specific facts of this case, the precise question presented is: Whether a prior conviction of a felony one burglary, which is not included as a disqualifier in the definition of \u201celigible offender\u201d may nevertheless amount to \u201ca history of present or past violent behavior\u201d such as to exclude a defendant from RRRI [Act] eligibility?",
