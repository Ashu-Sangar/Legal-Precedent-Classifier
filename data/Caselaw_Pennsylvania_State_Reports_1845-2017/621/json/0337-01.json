The issues, as stated by Petitioner are:\n(1) Does the Long-Arm Statute of the State of Pennsylvania, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5322, establish jurisdiction of a Pennsylvania tribunal over a New Jersey corporation which does not conduct business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for an act which was done by an individual who was operating a vehicle owned by the corporation but was not acting within the scope of his employment with the corporation?\n(2) Did the Superior Court err when it used the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1) definition of \u201cemployee\u201d to establish in personam jurisdiction under the Pennsylvania Long-Arm Statute by determining that an employee as defined by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act was the legal equivalent of an \u201cagent\u201d as specified in the Pennsylvania Long-Arm Statute?\nAdditionally, the parties are directed to address in their briefs whether Petitioner waived its objection to personal jurisdiction, and if sp, whether Respondent waived any claim that Petitioner waived the objection.",
