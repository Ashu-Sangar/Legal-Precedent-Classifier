Did the Commonwealth Court err when it held that any-written request for records received by any government agency is to be considered a Right-to-Know Law request even when the request does not meet the Law\u2019s bare minimum requirements for triggering the Law\u2019s application and appeal rights?\n2. Whether the Commonwealth Court erred in its analysis under the rules of Statutory Construction by not applying the Right-to-Know Law\u2019s clear and plain language which resulted in an application of the law contrary to the intent of the General Assembly?",
