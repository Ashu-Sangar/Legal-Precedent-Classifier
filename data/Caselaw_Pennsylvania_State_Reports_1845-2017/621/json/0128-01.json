The issues, as stated by petitioners, with an additional issue required to be addressed by this Court, are as follows:\nDid the Commonwealth Court err in reversing the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Respondent municipality acting through Marcia Taylor disregarded the clear language of Section 4.09 of the pension plan by terminating Officers Gehrmann\u2019s and Palombine\u2019s two percent (2%) cost of living payments before they had equaled ninety percent (90%) of their final average monthly compensation.\nDid the Commonwealth Court err in reversing the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Respondent municipality used its own failure to comply with Act 205 as a defense to its refusal to properly calculate the COLA benefits to which Officers Gehrmann\u2019s and Palombine\u2019s are entitled under the police officers pension plan.\nAdditionally, the parties are directed to address the issue of the possible remedy or range of remedies appropriate under the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act (\u201cAct 205\u201d), 58 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 895.101-895.803, and case law interpreting Act 205, under the factual scenario posed by this case.",
