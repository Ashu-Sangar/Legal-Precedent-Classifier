The jury filed a report, in which after reporting the amount of damages suffered by property owners whose land is taken, they determined the amount of damages to be equal to $4,440, and that the sum of $1,553.24, shall be paid by the city of Philadelphia, and the balance, $2,906.76, shall be paid by property owners for the benefit accruing to them by reason of said opening, in the amount set opposite their names, and a list of such property owners with the amount of .the benefits assessed against each is given. It appears further from the report that a large portion of Orkney street between Ontario street and Westmoreland street had been opened by dedication to the city by the then owners of property and acceptance thereof, long previous to the ordinance of the councils of the city of Philadelphia, approved October 10, 1896, by which the director of the department of public works was authorized and directed to notify the owners <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>of property over and through which the said Orkney street between Ontario and Westmoreland streets will pass. It appeared also that Orkney street as theretofore opened and approved ended in a cul de sac having an opening only on Ontario street and none on Westmoreland street. The grade at Westmoreland street end of Orkney street was about five feet higher than the opened portion, consequently the only access owners and tenants of the houses on Orkney street had was byway of Ontario street. The grade also resulted in water accumulating on Orkney street and forming a pond, which the jury reported rendered several of the houses uninhabitable; and that the street as opened had no sewer, and that the street having been opened and the sewer placed therein substantial benefits accrue to the houses on the theretofore improved portion of the street.</p>
