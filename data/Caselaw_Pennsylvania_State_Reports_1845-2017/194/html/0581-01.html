That embodied the result of all your negotiations? A. Yes, sir; everything we had done prior to that. Q. Do you know whether that paper which was finally executed was submitted to Mr. McMurtrie before it was executed? Yes, sir; Mr. McMurtrie was with Mr. Markle in everything that was done. Q. Do you know whether, in the course of the negotiation, anything was said about the clause giving the right to George B. Markle to dividends at the time? A. 1 think Mr. Markle did say something about a dividend through the transactions, but it was never consented to in any way by me. Q.

There had been a prior paper which reserved to him the dividends? A. Yes, sir. Q. And this clause did not appear in the 189B agreement advisedly ? A. It was advisedly prepared in the shape it is with the approval of Mr. McMurtrie. Q. Was anything said by you or anything attempted by anybody during the negotiations before the paper was signed, to the effect that there should be no sale before 1897 of George B. Markle’s interest?

The alleged variation by parol of this instrument depends almost entirely on the testimony of George B. Markle; what is called a corroboration of it, is the testimony of an unmarried sister, who says, in 1894, when her brother was endeavoring to persuade her sister Ida to stay the sale, he said to her she had agreed she would not sell it unless she was forced to it <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>by creditors ; she seemed to feel very bad, and said she was sorry she had forgotten the agreement. This is the only thing which in any way tended to corroborate the statement of her brother. Both of these parties were flatly contradicted by Ida Hessenbruch and her husband, and to show that this defense was an entire afterthought they produced a letter from George B. Maride of May 24,1894. He was then trying to stop the sale, and, knowing that her husband was adverse to it, instructed his sister as follows : “ Will you make the following statement to Hermann,-if in every material respect you find it correct as you remember the facts ? ‘ On Wednesday last, the 16th instant, I agreed with my brother George to extend his indebtedness to me to September, 1897. I authorized him to draw up new notes and assignment to comply with this agreement made for the extension.’ ”</p>

And most certainly it would be a much more forcible argument if he could have asked his sister to tell her husband that she had agreed at the time the notes were originally executed that they were to be payable not at sixty days, but after four years, and not that that agreement bore date May 16, 1894.</p>

Hessenbruch, in the amount of two notes, aggregating the sum of $110,000, the notes being dated June 23,1893, payable in sixty days, with interest from July 1, 1893. On the same day, as collateral security for the debt, he delivered to his sister an assignment of one moiety of his interest in the partnership of C. B. Markle &amp; Company, miners and shippers of coal in Luzerne county, with power to Mrs. Hessenbruch to sell said interest at public sale if default was made in payment; of the notes at maturity. George B. Markle paid neither principal nor interest on the notes up to November 4, 1893, when in the exercise of the power conferred upon her by the written assignment, after thirty days’ notice of her intention so to do, Mrs. Hessenbruch sold the collateral at public sale, and herself, indirectly, became the purchaser on a bid of $50,000. The other moiety of his interest had been assigned to Clora Markle, another sister, as security for a debt he owed to her. During the existence, previous to the assignment to Mrs. Hessenbruch, of the firm of George B. Markle &amp; Company many dividends, payable to the partners, according to their respective interests, had been declared; that, on the George B. Markle interest had always been paid to him. After the assignment, the declared dividends upon his whole share, from October 7,1894, to July 1,1898, amounted to $107,375. Of this sum, each sister had drawn $10,937.50, leaving unpaid $85,500, one half of which, $42,750, belonged to each. George B. Markle set up, in hostility to his sister, Mrs. Hessenbruch, a claim to this money, and notified the partnership not to pay to her. Clora Markle asserted a right, not only to her own moiety, but to the one claimed by Mrs. Hessenbruch; she relied on cer<a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>tain assignments of his whole interest to to her by the brother, George, made June 5, 1896, and October 25, 1897. To avoid peril of mispayment, the partnership deposited the whole of the balance of the dividend, $85,500, with Drexel &amp; Company, responsible bankers of Philadelphia, to be held by them until the disputed ownership of the dividends on George’s share was settled, either amicably or judicially. Mrs. Hessenbruch then filed this bill against defendants, setting out, more at length, substantially the facts as narrated, and praying that she be declared the owner of a moiety of George’s interest, and as such owner, that her right to receive the dividends on such moiety be judicially declared, and that the holders of the money be directed to pay the same to her.</p>

    <p id="b614-6" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[246,1506,1182,404]]]'>The answer of the firm and remaining partners is, that dividends had been declared out of profits from time to time, and paid over to all the partners except on George B.

Markle, in this case, it is purely a question of law determinable from an inspection of the records in the two causes. In equity, often, perhaps generally, it is a question of fact referable to a master to take testimony and report: but here, nothing dehors the records would shed light on the question. It is not doubted that a plea of lis pendens is a good plea in abatement to a bill in equity, but the authorities are not altogether in accord as to what is requisite to sustain the plea; a clear statement of what must be shown is given in Harrisburg v. Harrisburg City Passenger Ry., 1 Pa. Dist. Rep. 192: “A plea of former suit pending must allege that the case is the same, the parties the same, and the rights asserted and the relief prayed for the same; and where the truth of the plea can be ascertained by an inspection of the record, the court will determine the question without a reference.” This is but a concise summary of the weight of authority on the subject. Let us determine the availability of the plea to these defendants by the test thus laid down. The bill in Luzerne county was filed August 28,1895; the one before us, May 24, 1898; the parties plaintiff in the <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>Luzerne bill are George B. Markle, Alvan Markle and Clora Maride; the defendants, E. P. Wilbur, the executors of William Lilly, deceased, John Markle, Ida Hessenbruch and Herman Hessenbruch. Although not the same plaintiffs and defendants, the same persons are embraced in both bills; we may, therefore, with perhaps some liberality of construction, assume that the parties are the same. But, is the case the same ? This must be ascertained by comparing the averments of the two bills. The first paragraph in the Luzerne bill avers and sets out the articles of copartnership ; the second, the death of William Lilly, and the substitution of his executers as representatives of his interest; the third, that E. P. Wilbur had parted with all his interest, yet continued to act as a partner and meddle with the business at the request of the remaining defendants ; fourth, that Wilbur fraudulently and maliciously conspired with the other defendants to exclude the plaintiffs from any part or lot in the management ; fifth, that John Markle, at the formation of the partnership, as a condition to being appointed manager, agreed he would cease to act if his management did not prove satisfactory to all of the partners, yet in violation of his agreement he persisted, against the protest of plaintiffs, in holding on to his appointment ; sixth, avers in elaborate specifications his dishonesty, extravagance and general mismanagement; seventh, that still greater extravagance is contemplated in the future; eighth, because of valuable continuing leases, not assignable, irreparable loss would result if the partnership were dissolved; ninth, a general averment of conspiracy to exclude plaintiffs from any share in the management. Next, notice the prayers for relief: First, that Wilbur be restrained from taking any part in the management; second and third, that all of defendants be restrained from excluding plaintiffs from taking part in the management, and John Maride from acting as manager to their exclusion; fourth, that defendants and all their employees be restrained from, making new and extravagant improvements; fifth, that they be restained from paying out dividends without consent of plaintiffs. The remaining prayers, from sixth to tenth, inclusive, ask that defendants and the manager be directed to account for cost of improvements, coal sold, expense of mining and salaries; the eleventh and twelfth are for appointment of master and general relief.</p>

      <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>When we consider the averments of Mrs. Hessenbruch’s bill and the answers thereto, heretofore noticed, not one of them touches the subject in controversy in the Luzerne bill; the latter is a complaining and dissatisfied partner’s bill; it is not even hinted that one of defendants, Mrs. Hessenbruch, dishonestly seeks, by a pretended assignment, to'claim the share and dividends of one of her copartners; nor, is there any prayer for relief against such claim. Nor does the answer of Mrs. Hessenbruch raise any question which can move the Luzerne court to inquire into the controversy raised by the issue now before us. True, in the third paragraph of her answer she asserts that George B. Markle has assigned a moiety of his interest to her, but she asserts this, not as a defense, but by way of explanation of her weight of interest in the partnership. Mrs. Iiessenbrueh’s bill raises no question as to the honesty of John Markle, or management of the business. She avers that dividends have been declared, have been set apart and deposited with a stakeholder for the proper owner of George’s share; she asks for no accounting; as to whether too much or too little she makes no suggestion; even George does not aver in his answer that at least this amount of money deposited is not payable to the real owner of his interest; he only avers that he is still the owner. We are of opinion, with the court below, that the cases are not the same; that the rights asserted and the relief prayed for are not the same ; therefore, that the plea of a former action pending is not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[189,1695,1178,652]]]'>The argument of the learned counsel for appellant, that all that passed by the assignment to Mrs. Hessenbruch was a mere right to an account, an intangible thing, which she must assert by bill against the partners for an account, is without merit. Such a plea, if sound, could only be raised by the partnership; if the assignment was good, as the court below has found, George B. Markle has no further interest in the moiety assigned; how his assignee shall enforce her right under the assignment, if the partnership denies it, is no concern of his. The partnership acknowledges it, and is ready to pay the dividends declared upon it to the proper owner; indeed, under the first paragraph of the partnership agreement, they could not well do otherwise.</p>

It contained the usual prayer that respondent might be dismissed with costs.</p>

Maride was a partner in and owner of the two sixteenths of the assets and business of said firm, that the plaintiff had purchased and was the owner, at the time of filing the bill, of one moiety of George B.

Markle, the partnership refused to pay them to her, and that George B.

The prayers for relief are, inter alia: (a) a decree that the plaintiff is entitled to a moiety of all the estate <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>and property of George B.

Markle and Mrs. Hossenbruch as to the ownership of his interest in the firm, and to any dividends declared thereon by the partnership.</p>
