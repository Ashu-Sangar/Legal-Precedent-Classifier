Dixon, the defendant, had been the friend of the family, a7id the agent in renting the properties and collecting the rents. He represented to the plaintiffs, the children of Ü7'. J. Greenawalt, that he could save the property to their family by his buying the title of the planing mill company and advancing the money, if they would secure him by a mortgage of their interests in the houses and lots. He represented that it would take $2,363, for that was the lowest sum the planing 7nill co7npa7iy would take. In order to protect him for the advance, he must have a mortgage from them of $2,000. An article of agreement was drawn up and signed by the plaintiffs and defendant, for that purpose, dated July 26, 1895. It provided that Dixon was to advance, in the nature of a loa77, $2,363, to buy the title and judgment of the planing mill company, the plaintiffs to give their bond and mortgage for the sum of $2,000 as security on account of said loan; that Dixon was to have control of the houses and lots, and collect the rents, until he was paid in full, including interest, and four per cent commission on the rents received; that if paid before the death of Dr. J. Greenawalt, the title of his life estate to be made over <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>to him, and if he died before the loan was paid, he would convoy to plaintiffs, if they paid the balance due him.</p>

In pursuance of that agreement the planing mill company had the sheriff make the deed to Dixon, July 29, 1895, and assigned their judgment to him. The plaintiffs executed and delivered to him their bond and mortgage for the $2,000. The defendant had an arrangement with the planing mill company that if he could sell their interest for $2,363 he was to have $500 as his commission. He gave his check on the bank for $2,363, but immediately got back the $500. He never told the plaintiffs, or gave them any intimation that he was to receive, or had received, any commission from the planing mill company, but represented that he was making the arangement and advancing the money solely as a friendly act for the benefit of Dr. J. Greenawalt. They did not learn the facts until long after the mortgage was given.</p>

He never pretended and never claimed that he was not to be paid for his services by the South Pittsburg Planing Mill Company. They were the owners of the present interest hi this property; he was representing them as their agent. That was his regular and only business — a real estate agent. It was his means of livelihood. It was not material to these complainants how the purchase money for this property was distributed. Nor is there any question of trust or distrust in this case. During the lifetime of decedent the defendant was employed to and did collect the rents for said property. ' He was a rent collector for them and nothing more. At her death his employment ended. Even if defendant had been employed by decedent’s heirs his employment to collect the rents could only have continued until the property was sold by the sheriff and bought by the South Pittsburg Planing Company on July 15, 1895. The defendant was employed by the purchasers of the present interest in this property. He was given a minimum selling price of 12,363 by them, and if he effected a sale of said interest for said price, they agreed to pay him, as compensation for his services, the sum of |500. Defendant was not acting for complainants. He did not expect any pay from complainants, none was offered, asked, promised or received. He went to the. complainants as the most likely prospective buyers of the interest in the property in which they had the remainder. He <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>says in his testimony that he made a plain offer to the complainants. They considered that offer and accepted it. Defendant, then, because complainants could not raise the necessary money to make the purchase, offered to negotiate a loan for them, and failing therein, because of the precarious security, was finally compelled himself to lend the necessary money to complainants on said precarious, unusual and uncertain security and conditions. We contend that there was no fiduciary relation between the parties in this case.</p>
