The defendants who were the contractors with the city denied their liability. They also showed that after the work was completed plaintiff sent a bill to them for $8,990.50. He subsequently called upon W. A. Hurlock, and requested payment of the bill. Mr. Hurlock wrote at the foot of the bill the words “ received payment in full of all demands,” and offered to pay the amount of the bill if plaintiff would sign the receipt, but refused to make payment unless the receipt was signed. Plaintiff at first refused but subsequently accepted the money and signed the receipt, stating, however, as he did so, that he waived no right.</p>

He gave <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>this receipt because the defendants refused to pay any more money without it. He must be assumed to have received the money upon the express condition that it was in full of all demands. He signed it with his eyes open, -without any fraud, artifice, mistake or imposition practiced upon him, and he is consequently bound by it. The assignments of error are all dismissed.</p>
