Defendant’s objections were not sustained, and the evidence was received “ subject to the alleged right of the defendant to show additions or modifications.” In that connection it was admitted by the learned counsel for defendant “ that those papers, as far as they go are correct,” and also that “ the whole defense is simply a parol modification.”</p>

As was well said by this court in Martin v. Berens, <a href="/pa/67/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="67 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1022556" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0459-01">67 Pa. 459</a>, “ where the parties, without any fraud or mistake, have deliberately put their engagements in writing, the law declares the writing not only to be the best, but their only, evidence of their agreement, and we are not disposed to relax the rule.” The principle is firmly settled that all preliminary negotiations, conversations and verbal agreements are merged in and superseded by the subsequent written contract “which is the final outcome and result of the bargaining of the parties ; ” and “ unless fraud, accident or mistake be averred, the writing constitutes the agreement between the parties, and its terms cannot be added to nor subtracted from by parol evidence: Wodock v. Robinson, <a href="/pa/148/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="148 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="981774" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0503-01">148 Pa. 503</a>. Where the evidence is not for the purpose of contradicting or varying the contract, as written, but for the purpose of explaining some ambiguity and thus aiding in the construction of the contract the rule does not apply; but this exception to or apparent modification of the rule has no application to the undisputed facts of this case.</p>

Irvin, <a href="/pa/142/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="142 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="976595" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0271-01">142 Pa. 271</a>: “The principle is too well settled to need the citation of authority that where by fraud, accident or mistake something is omitted from an instrument a chancellor will reform it in accordance with the actual agreement of the parties. But neither fraud, accident nor mistake is alleged in this case. The contention is that the alleged clause stipulating for a divorce was purposely omitted from the paper. It is in direct conflict with the written instrument. The defendant contends that it destroys it in part at least. I know of no decided case and no principle of law which permits <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>air oral contract, made at the same time with a written contract under seal, and purposely omitted therefrom, to be set up, not only to contradict, but to destroy it. The two agreements cannot possibly stand together; one or the other must fall. When parties without fraud or mistake have put their agreements in writing that is not only the best, but the sole, evidence of their agreement. We may well be excused at this late day from entering upon an elaborate discussion of the law in relation to the admission of oral evidence to affect written instruments. It may be received to explain the subject-matter of such papers (Barnhart v. Riddle, <a href="/pa/29/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="29 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="982903" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0092-01">29 Pa. 92</a>) ; to prove a consideration not mentioned in a deed, provided it be not inconsistent with the consideration expressed in it (Lewis v. Brewster, <a href="/pa/57/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="57 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="1010399" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0410-01">57 Pa. 410</a>) ; but not to contradict or vary the terms of the instrument itself.”</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[242,1071,1183,197]]]'>■ Numerous citations recognizing and sustaining the rule as above stated, and explanatory of its application, etc., might be cited, but it is deemed unnecessary to further multiply authorities on the subject.</p>
    <p id="b156-6" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[241,1278,1184,559]]]'>While the papers given in evidence and relied on by the plaintiff company to prove the terms and conditions on which the whisky was from time to time stored during several months are admitted to be correct “ as far as they go,” there is no reference hr any of said papers to the oral agreement set up by the defendant, or to any of its terms; nor was there any evidence introduced or offered for the purpose of explaining the omission, or of showing that it was or was not intentional, or that it was caused by fraud or mistake. Neither of the excluded offers of evidence went any further than to show that the whisky was stored on the faith of the alleged oral agreement.</p>

There appears to be nothing in either of the remaining specifications that requires discussion. The learned trial judge was clearly right in refusing to withdraw the case from the jury by instructing them to find for the defendant. We think he was also right in refusing defendant’s second and third requests for instruction, and <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>in directing tlie jury to render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff company.
