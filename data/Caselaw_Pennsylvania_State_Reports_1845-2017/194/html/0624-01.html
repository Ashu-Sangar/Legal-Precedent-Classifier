Upon the request of Mr. Hamersly, counsel for certain of the children of testator, the accountants submitted an income account, showing some changes in the amount of money in hand.

There were also certain advancements made by the executors, as shown by the income account submitted, since the death of the testator. It was afterwards agreed by all of the parties in interest that the auditor should distribute the moneys, shown by the account as confirmed, leaving for subsequent distribution all questions pertaining to advancements, attachments in execution and judgments against heirs, so that this distribution should not be embarrassed or involved with any question whatever, other than the distribution of the cash balance of $53,411.67, as shown by the account.</p>

So far as the appearance of the original instrument reveals, it was written at the same time as what precedes it. The handwriting and the ink <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>and the pen appear to be uniform with the body of the will. The presumption, in the absence of some circumstance showing the contrary, would be that this addition to the will was written upon the date of the instrument itself. The fact that no date is given to the codicil or addition would imply that it was of the same date as that which precedes it, which is dated. This codicil, so called, may therefore be construed as an addition to the will rather than a codicil, as technically defined and understood. What was the intention of the testator when he added these few lines to what he had already written as lfis last will and testament? The provision he had made for the distribution of his estate was perfectly clear hi terms, and the objects of his bounty were clearly and precisely defined and declared. His first and primary desire was to provide for his widow, and he gave her the meóme of his entire estate. Subject to her comfort, he provides for his children and is careful that there shall be no distinction made between them, but that perfect equality of distribution to them shall be made after his wife’s death. He authorizes advancements to be made by her out of any surplus income that she might have, but such advancements are to be charged against the recipients so as to preserve equality. Under the terms of this will, as he originally makes it, there could be no doubt that his estate vested absolutely in his children upon his death, to be distributed to them in possession upon the death of the widow. Does the addition to this will cut down and destroy the absolute interest already given and change his whole scheme of the division of his estate ? If the view, asserted by the guardian for some of the grandchildren shall prevail, the testator must have changed his mind entirely between the signing of his name at the two places on this last will: and instead of equality of distribution, in accordance with that which we should expect from every parent in providing for children equally meritorious and in accordance with the statute of distribution applying to parent and children, concluded that his estate should be divided in a most unusual and unequal manner. That which was perfectly plain before is changed to something indefinite, uncertain and contradictory. That which was absolutely given and vested is divested. I cannot so interpret this addition to the will. The testator was clearly not a lawyer nor familiar with the terms usually employed by the pro<a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>fession in drawing testaments. It seems to mo that the testator, after he had written liis will, reviewed it, and the thought occurred to him that between his death and the death of his widow, or between the writing of the will and the death of the widow, there was a possibility that some of the children might die, leaving children. His daughter, Mrs. Manning, had a child living when this will was written. He was desirous that the equality of distribution, which he had provided for among his children, should not be destroyed to the disinheritance of a grandchild by the death of its parent, before receiving his or her share. Therefore, he expressed his desire that the grandchildren shall be taken into consideration. A lawyer would have said that the grandchildren shall receive the share of the parent dying before distribution. It is said that he was presumed to know the law — that the children of any of his sons or daughters would take the parent’s share without any provision made to that effect. If such presumption exist, it is a very weak one, and is opposed by the experience of lawyers and judges in construing home-made wills. The same presumption would require him to kuow what words to use to express his intentions clearly when he wrote the addition to the will. He had provided that his widow could advance to any of the children to the extent of one half of their supposed shares. This applied to the principal of the estate as well as to the income. The so-called codicil does not withdraw this power of anticipation. It is scarcely conceivable that he intended to revoke, by implication, this power given, and that if he did so intend he would not have used apt words in so declaring. If we are to hold that this addition to the will revokes all that is gone before, except the life estate in the widow, as we must if a construction be given to his final words, as claimed for, to whom shall the distribution be made ? He says, “ the estate shall be so divided that the grandchildren shall have equal shares.” If we are to take this literally and absolutely then no one can take except the grandchildren. They are the ones to have equal shares — not with the children, but with each other. But to construe the will to effectuate the letter and not the spirit of this direction would result in ignoring the needs of his children for the benefit of their descendants. And unless the estate were to be held in trust until all of the children should have <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>died, so that his grandchildren might be determined' in completeness of number, there would be the greatest inequality among them, between those who might be born at a certain date and those who should be born a day or year thereafter. But the law of this state would not tolerate a construction postponing the’ distribution until the death of all of the children. A trust will not be created when the testator has not declared it. The interests of the legatees and devisees vested either upon the death of the testator or, at the latest, upon the death of Ms widow. And to hold to a construction of this will by giving effect only to his final words would result in the greatest possible inequality. The grandchildren who might be born after the death of the widow or after the death of the testator, whichever might be adopted, as the time for vesting, would receive no share of the testator’s bounty. Such a distribution under all the canons of construction of wills will not be tolerated unless the intent of the testator so to do is absolutely clear and positive so that no other meaning can be given to his words. The same inequality without reason, so far as the will discloses, and so inconsistent with the declared intentions of the testator, as he originally expressed them, arises if it be said that grandchildren shall share with children equally. Assuming that the" time for the vesting of these interests was postponed to the death of the widow, the grandchildren that might be born subsequently would inherit nothing. I, therefore, conclude that when the testator made this addition to his will his only purpose was to provide for grandchildren in the event of their parents having died before distribution should be made. To hold otherwise would be to permit, by reason of indefinite and uncertain words at the end of the will, the revocation of the general scheme of distribution adopted and clearly stated by the testator, the cutting down of absolute gifts to uncertain or indefinite gifts or no gifts at all, and inequality of distribution among children and grandchildren without the slightest reason given therefor."</p>

There were seven children living at the date of the will, at the death of the testator and at the death of the widow. Undoubtedly these seven legatees were to take the whole estate under the literal operation of the will. Evidently it occurred to the testator at some later date that no provision was made for grandchildren in tlie event of the death of any of the children, and he attempted in his own very crude way to provide for that exigency by the codicil. It is too plain for argument that his meaning was to embrace the children of dead children by the terms of the codicil.
