This matter does not appear to have been mentioned in any of the exceptions filed in the court below. The attention of the lower court was not directed to it, nor does it appear to be assigned for error. Under these circumstances it is not necessary to make reply. We ask, however, the attention of this court to the provisions of the Act of May 16,1891, P. L. 75. Ample provision is made for ascertaining whether the “ requisite majority ” “ as required by this act ” have signed:— in other words — whether the petition is a proper one under which to proceed.

Some of the exceptions are so sharply technical that they should not be entertained, others are either contrary to the facts of the case, or so devoid of merit that they were rightly dismissed on one or both of said grounds.</p>
    <p id="b112-5" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[227,837,1183,964]]]'>It must be conceded that the ordinance in question is inartificially and bunglingly drawn. Considered apart from its title and preamble there might be some ground for appellant’s exception that it does not ordain that the work shall be done or the improvements made. But the title and preamble which are parts of an ordinance (as they are of a statute) make plain the purpose of the ordinance in question. In express terms its title declares it to be an ordinance “ authorizing ” the grading, etc., of Beechwood avenue. The preamble recites the petition of property owners, on the line of the proposed improvement, for the enactment of .“ an ordinance for the grading, macadamizing,” etc., and “ therefore ” in the first section of the enacting clause of the ordinance the department of public works is authorized and directed to advertise for proposals, etc., the contract to be let and the costs and expenses to be collected according to law. The question is one of substance and not of form. It plainly appears that the intention was to authorize the work to be done as it was afterwards completed under the contract.</p>

It is true, these latter words do not appear in the title of the ordinance, but it is not required that the title should be a complete index of the contents; it is sufficiently specific if it indicates, (as in this.case) the character of the improvement covered by the ordinance, Aside from that, it comes <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>with bad grace — especially from those who petitioned for “ laying sidewalks ” — to lie by until the improvement is completed and then except on the ground that “sidewalks” were not authorized. Fortunately for the cause of justice, we are not called upon to sustain any such exception after the improvement has been made and those who petitioned for it are enjoying the benefits thereof.</p>
    <p id="b113-3" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[201,739,1179,553]]]'>The exception that Beechwood avenue is a public and nob a local improvement is sufficiently answered by the fact that the report of the viewers is predicated of a finding to the contrary. As to the correctness of that finding we have no doubt. There is nothing in the case to impeach it. It may be that Beechwood avenue was constructed as part of the park system of the city, but it does not follow that it is not also decidedly local, and that property fronting thereon has been “ specially benefited ” in the proper sense of that term to a very large degree. No one conversant with the facts can have any doubt as to that.</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.5",113,[201,1311,1179,707]]]'>It is a grave error to assume that the cost of the improvement should be paid out of the proceeds of the loan created by the city for the purpose of enabling it to meet deficiencies that will arise in cases where property fronting on improvements of the same kind will be but slightly benefited, relatively, and the city will be obliged to pay nearly all, or at least a very considerable part, of the costs and. expenses of such improvements. In providing the fund referred to, it was never intended by the city to relieve from assessments for “special benefits” any property fronting on her newly improved streets, avenues or boulevards that may be actually benefited specially, that is, benefited over and above the general benefit accruing to it in common witli other property in the vicinity of such improvements.</p>
    <p id="b113-5" data-blocks='[["BL_113.6",113,[201,2037,1178,405]]]'>As to appellant’s objection that by the assessment in question his property will be subjected also to taxation on account of the city bonds issued for said loan, and therefore to double taxation, it is sufficient to say that the latter is no ground for immunity from assessment for special benefits accruing from local improvements. Double taxation is not illegal unless it produces inequality as to other property similarly situated. No such allegation is even made in this case.</p>

The objection that a majority in interest and number of the property owners did not sign the petition to councils was not made in the court below, nor is it embraced in any of the specifications of error. It might be well dismissed with the remark that it ismot properly on the record. Treating it as properly before us, however, it is still without merit. The 10th section of the Act of May 16,1891, makes special provision for raisingiihis objection by proceedings on the ordinance, under penalty of estoppel. As to the vital importance of definitively settling such questions in the outset, Mr. Justice Shabswood, in Erie v. Bootz, <a href="/pa/72/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="72 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="434608" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0200-01">72 Pa. 200</a>, said: “It is not only important that this should be settled, but that the question of the numbers should be conclusively determined before the expense of the improvement should be incurred. If it was left open for contest no street could be paved without leading to controversy on the subject.” The question as to whether a majority in interest and number of the property owners signed the petition to councils in this case is set at rest by the act of 1891.</p>
