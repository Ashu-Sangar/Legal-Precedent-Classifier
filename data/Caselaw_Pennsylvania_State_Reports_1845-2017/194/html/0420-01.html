By a memorandum attached to the note, he requested the brother, whom he styled trustee, to pay certain creditors the amounts of their respective claims in a sum total of $45,000. The decedent informed his brother that he had effected the insurance, but he retained the policy in his own custody, and paid the premiums up to the date of his death. He died insolvent. The point contended for at the hearing and overruled by the auditing judge was that this assignment inured, under the act of 1843, to the benefit of the general creditors. It was conceded that the policy of insurance was not a gambling policy, even if the brother had no insurable interest in the life of the assured. A man may do what he pleases with his own money, and if he chooses, out of respect or affection, and with no fraudulent end in view, to pay for a policy whose proceeds shall accrue to another, he may do it as freely as he may make a present gift of the money itself: Scott v. Dickson, <a href="/pa/108/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="108 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="539252" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0006-01">108 Pa. 6</a>. The decedent did this; he reserved to himself no beneficial interest in the policy whatever ; it was not an asset of his estate and, except with the consent of the beneficiary, he could not make it an asset in his lifetime or at his death. The case would have been different, and it is important to notice the distinction, if he had secured insurance on his life in his own name and had then assigned the policy. The assignment would have been a parting with his own property, and it would have been open to the opera<a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>tion of all the principles which determine the validity of assignments. But how can a man by any instrument or set of. instruments assign what he never possessed, and never could have possessed? This is forcibly set out by Green, J., in McCutcheon’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=99%20Pa.%20187" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="99 Pa. 187">99 Pa. 187</a>: “ When the title of the beneficiary exists by force of an original issue in the name or for the benefit of the beneficiary, the title is good, notwithstanding the claims of creditors .... There is no anomaly in this, nor any conflict with the letter or spirit of the statute of Elizabeth, because in such cases the policy would be at no time the property of the assured, and hence no question of fraud in its transfer could arise as to his creditors. It is only in case of the assignment of a policy that once belonged to the assured that the question of fraud can arise.” This was the point in Taylor &amp; Go.’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/75/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="75 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1036649" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0115-01">75 Pa. 115</a>, where the decedent had effected an insurance on his life and had afterwards assigned the policy to a trustee for his children. He never delivered the assignment nor apprised the trustee of its existence ; it was held that the transfer was invalid, and that the proceeds of the policy belonged to the estate of the assured. The distinction we have alluded to is further illustrated in Elliott’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/50/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="50 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="425130" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0075-01">50 Pa. 75</a>.</p>

L. 273, prohibiting preferences in assignments, declares that “all assignments of property in trust which' shall hereinafter be made by debtors to trustees .... to prefer one or more creditors' (except for wages), shall be held and construed to "inure to the benefit of all the creditors.” The only property of the decedent which entered into this transaction was the sum represented by the premiums.. If they were paid by him when he was knowingly insolvent, they might perhaps be recovered from the trustee, because they were taken from the estate to which the general creditors had a right to look for payment; but the creditor’s right ends here. It is beyond dispute that any assignment, however formal or however disguised under another shape, which seeks to create a preference by a failing debtor, comes under the ban of the act. It may be in form a lease, as in Lucas v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/32/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="32 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="986813" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0458-01">32 Pa. 458</a>, or a power of attorney, as in Watson v.

In the subject-matter of this policy, however, the decedent had no ownership whatever. The exceptions are dismissed.</p>
