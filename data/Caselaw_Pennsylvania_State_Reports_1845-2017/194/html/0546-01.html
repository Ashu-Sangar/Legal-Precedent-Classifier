In such a case the denial of the agreement by plaintiff’s agent merely raises an issue to be decided by a jury.</p>

Simon, Esq., representing the plaintiff, dated March 29, 1899, making a demand for the payment for $400 on account of the principal of the mortgage or the whole of it, he called on Mr. Simon and told him that he would arrange upon behalf of Perlson and his wife for a loan from a building association with which to pay off the mortgage, but that the association would not meet until the fourth Monday of April, and .it would be about two weeks later before the title papers would be ready; whereupon the <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>said Simon told petitioner that the arrangement would be satisfactory and that he should go ahead with it.</p>
