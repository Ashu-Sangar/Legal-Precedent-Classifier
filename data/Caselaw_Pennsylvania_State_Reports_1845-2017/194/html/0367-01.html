There are very few cases where the jury ought not to see property of this sort. You simply go out, however, for the purpose of better enabling you to understand the testimony given here, and to weigh the opinion as to values, and to weigh the value of the opinion as to what is necessary in order to put this property in proper shape. You will simply go out there and get information enough upon the ground to accomplish this purpose, not undertaking to try the case there. The testimony will be delivered after you come in. You will hear the testimony and get a fair understanding of the property as it was at the time the improvement was made, and what the nature of the improvement was, and by seeing the property you will then be able to understand the testimony delivered here to-morrow.</p>

If you find it was worth less, then you find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of that diminution in value. If you find, however, that there was an increase in value, then you certify a balance in favor of the city in the amount of that increase. It would be the duty of the court to see that there was no more assessed to him than was necessary <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>to pay Ms share of the improvement. But I might say to you here that it seems to be conceded that you need not go higher in that certificate, if you certify a balance, than about $3,000; that is, although you might find that the benefit was $10,000 or $15,000, you need not go higher than $3,000. Of course if it was less than $3,000 you would certify that less amount.] [6]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="A-O" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[200,652,1181,1705]]]'>[Again it is conceded that there was a considerable rise made in the grade of this street, and that there was filling done there. You are given the amount of that filling, and you are given testimony as to the cost of filling. That is not direct testimony for the purpose of enabling you to determine the damages here; it is only for the purpose of enabling you to test the value of these opinions and to ultimately find out what was the effect of this improvement upon that property. If the filling of the property cost $5,000, and the property was $5,000 better after it was filled, of course, the man was not damaged. If it was $10,000 better after the property was filled, he was not only not damaged, but he was benefited, and you might certify special benefits against him. It is only in some such light as this that this matter of the amount of filling on the lot is relevant. And I should say here, in view of the testimony that has been given, that you should not allow any man to speculate off of the city by recovering damages for expenses that he might put upon property which no reasonable man would put there. There has been a suggestion made as to what further filling it would take to put this property up above the street, as it was before. There has been testimony as to that. I admitted that testimony upon the supposition that some witness, at least, in the case, would suggest that that was the proper thing to do; but not only has no witness suggested that that would be a proper thing to do, that it would be anything but a waste of money, but it appears that although seven or eight years have elapsed, and although, under the circumstances, perhaps the owner could well have done it, the owner has not done that filling. Now, under those circumstances, it is for you to say whether it would be reasonable or sensible for any man to put that expense upon the property; and, of course, you cannot put into a man’s pocket money of the general taxpayers for the purpose of enabling him to make expenditures which no reasonable man would make.] [7]</p>

This is an appeal from the report of the board of viewers. And in determining this case, you must consider that the city has paid the cost of this improvement, and that Mr. Zug, or Mr. Zug’s property, will not have to pay anything whatever for this improvement unless you certify a balance against him. If you find damages in his favor he then gets the street graded and paved for nothing, and gets these damages in addition. If you find simply a verdict for the defendant then he gets no damages, but he gets the property graded and paved and he pays nothing for it. You will understand that, gentlemen, it is sometimes misunderstood by jurors, and therefore I am specific in it, that you should consider the cost of grading and paving having been paid by the city, and you should now determine whether or not the'city shall recover from him some portion of the cost of grading and paving, or whether in addition to having paid that which would otherwise be assessed to him, it shall also pay him damages.' That is the question before you.] [8]</p>
