The plaintiff firm being desirous of raising money on their notes, and wishing to conceal the fact from their own banks that they were selling their notes on the street, gave these notes to Theodore R. Graham, who by their direction and request sold the same to various note brokers or money lenders; the money he received he deposited at the request of the plaintiffs in his bank account in the Central National Bank of Philadelphia. Theodore R. Graham kept but one bank account, and that with the Central National Bank. In it he deposited the monej'S actually belonging to him, as well as all other moneys which came into his possession in any manner, including moneys which came into his hands as executor of his father’s estate, and also including the moneys realized from the sale of the notes of Young, Smyth, Field &amp; Company. The moneys so deposited were necessarily mingled, and there was no way of telling what properly belonged, to himself and what part he was accountable for to others, except his own books of account. The amount of the notes ran from #300,000 to #800,000 per year. The total amount received by Graham as a result of the sale of Young, Smyth, Field &amp; Company notes, and deposited by hinn in the Central National Bank from July 1, 1882, to November 14, 1890, was #1,784,211.89. The total amount deposited by Graham in the same bank, from all sources during the same period, was #1,965,351.65, leaving an amount of #181,139.76 as money deposited by him; that was his own money, or moneys not derived from Young, Smyth, Field &amp; Company. During the same period Graham paid out of this account, to Young, Smyth, Field &amp; Company, #1,729,960, which was all the money received by him from the sale of their notes, except the sum of #54,251.89.</p>

On April 23,1896, the wrongful action of Graham in not returning the whole amount of the money received by him from the sale of the notes was discovered by the plaintiffs, Young, Smyth, Field &amp; Company.

By agreement between the plaintiffs and Graham, the amount received by him was not paid over in full at the time of receipt, but was paid in checks for round sums from time to time, so that the fact of the sale of notes on the street should be further concealed from the firm’s banks. Graham, who was called as a witness by plaintiffs, testified: “If I would just draw out precisely the amount I had deposited, my own bank would have seen what was going on, and firm’s banks, noticing odd amounts, would very easily have known of it, so I drew checks for even amounts.”</p>

The firm was dissolved on March 5, 1893, by the death of Mr. Glendinning. This firm is the defendant.

They credited Graham with the amount paid on the stocks and ioaned him the balance, and charged him with interest thereon. They also charged the regular commission of one eighth of one per cent on the transaction. They did not put the certificates of stock in the name of Graham, but held it in their own name, or in the name it was in when they bought it, with a power of attorney to transfer. On some few occasions the stocks were paid for in full by Graham and the stocks delivered to him.</p>

The interrtion of Graham was to buy the stocks for the purpose of holding them for a rise in the market, and he sold short expecting a decline in the market. The time of his holding was never indicated, and depended entirely upon himself. He was undoubtedly speculating. The broker could never tell what stock Graham would conclude to sell, or when he would do so. Many of the stocks were carried for long periods.</p>

During said period said Graham likewise, from time t» time, made to the said firm certain payments on account of his indebtedness. In nearly every case these payments were made by his own check on the Central National Bank, in which he kept his personal account. On two occasions payments were made in bank notes and bank duebills, and on one occasion in 1890, at the time when said Graham was a member of the firm of Young, Smyth, field &amp; Company, payment was made by check. of the said firm of Young, Smyth, Field &amp; Company. The complainants attempted to earmark and trace to Robert Glendinning &amp; Company certain moneys which they claimed to be theirs by showing that at the time certain checks were drawn by Graham on his own bank account to the order of Robert Glendinning &amp;■ Company, the balance in Graham’s account to his credit was-necessarily made up of the proceeds of their notes deposited in. his account. By this process of reasoning they apparently traced, upwards of $61,000 into the hands of Robert Glendinning &amp; Company between July 1,1882, and November 14,1890. The defendants, applying the same reasoning, traced during this-same period $25,500 of complainants’ moneys hito the hands of L. H. Taylor &amp; Company, another firm of stockbrokers with whom said Graham was doing business, making in all upwards of $86,000 thus apparently traced. But, as during this period the total shortage between Graham and the complainants was-but $54,251.89, the method employed was faulty and the conclusions reached necessarily erroneous and unsatisfactory — out of what balance a check is paid does not depend upon the condition of the bank account at the time the cheek was drawn, but the condition of the account when it is presented. In addition to this I cannot find an authority for holding that money received for the discount or sale of a note or notes deposited in the private bank account of Graham, with the consent of Young, Smyth, Field &amp; Company, and to be paid by him in his own checks at different times, can be earmarked as the money of.

He did not embezzle it, for it was not his duty to return to his employer the checks or proceeds of the sale of notes, but he was to place it <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>to his account and to pay them such amounts from his bank account as the firm’s demands might call for up to the total received. No one can pretend that if his bank had failed he could have been convicted of embezzlement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[231,565,1187,1378]]]'>The act of assembly says: “ If any clerk, servant, or other person in the employ of another shall by virtue of such employment receive and take into his possession any chattel, money, or valuable security which is or may be made the subject of larceny, for, or in the name or on account of his master or employer, and shall fraudulently embezzle the same or any part thereof, every such offender shall be deemed to have feloniously stolen the same from his master or employer, although such chattel, money, or security was not received into the possession of such master or employer otherwise than by the actual possession of his clerk, servant, or other person in his employ, and shall be punished,” etc. “ The chattel, the money, the valuable security ” given to Glendinning &amp; Company was not the same thing he received from the sale of the notes that was deposited in bank to his own account by express authority. This act was intended to cover cases where there was no bailment by reason of the property never having been in the actual possession of the master or employer. A familiar illustration of embezzlement is where a clerk takes the money received by him from the customer and, instead of putting it in the drawer, puts it in his pocket and keeps it. This is embezzlement; If he puts it in the drawer and then abstracts it, it is larceny. I do not think this point needs further elaboration, and I drop it, content in the feeling that this was not stolen money. I might add that the failure to prosecute Graham is some evidence that the learned gentlemen representing the plaintiffs, felt that such action could not succeed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[229,1961,1186,341]]]'>The next question is, was the identical money paid to Glen-dinning &amp; Company the money of .Young, Smyth, Field &amp; Co.? I have no hesitation in answering this question also in the negative. Graham had reduced all the money he received from the notes into his own possession, and I think there is an absolute failure to earmark or identify the money: Linde’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/181/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="181 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="891435" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0061-01">181 Pa. 61</a>.</p>

The remarks above made apply equally to these sums, and Linde’s Appeal, supra, applies. But the failure of the first proposition, to wit: was it stolen money, makes the second unimportant. Throe propositions must be proved by the plaintiffs before they can recover: first, that certain money of theirs was stolen or embezzled by Graham; second, that the same money thus stolen or embezzled was paid by Graham to the defendants; third, that it was paid to the defendants in an illegal gambling transaction. The failure of any of them is fatal. I have already found that the money was not stolen or embezzled money and that it has not been identified ; and I might stop here, but the third and last proposition, I think, must likewise be decided against the plaintiffs.

It seems to me that if the broker buys what he is ordered to buy and sells it when he is told to sell it, he is a broker, and not a gambler. I think the distinction is, was it intended that the stocks should be bought or sold ? If it was, it is not gambling, and the question of delivery to the customer in person has nothing to do with it. A delivery by sale as ordered by him is a legal delivery to him, for it is a delivery to his vendee. If it was not the intention to really buy, or sell, but the understanding, however reached, was that no real purchase was to be made and no sale was to take place, but that the difference in market value was to be settled by the loser paying his loss to the winner, or, to put it in other words, that they were to settle with each other when they did settle as if there had been a purchase and sale, that would be gambling.</p>

No matter what the character of the dealings between Graham and Glendinning &amp; Company, or Huhn &amp; Glendinning, their successors, when the transactions had ended, Graham settled with both firms after their dissolution, respectively on May 15, 1893, and May 15, 1895, paid his indebtedness to their successors, and took up all his stocks. The last settlement was on April 22, 1896, more than eighteen months before this bill was filed. We said in Lex’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/192/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="192 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="908993" data-case-paths="/pa/192/0313-01">192 Pa. 313</a>, opinion by Justice Mitchell, who, after discussing the evidence tending to show it was a gambling transaction : “But apart from this consideration the evidence clearly showed an election by the appellant to treat the last transaction as a purchase (all previous ones being closed), and to settle the account on that basis.
