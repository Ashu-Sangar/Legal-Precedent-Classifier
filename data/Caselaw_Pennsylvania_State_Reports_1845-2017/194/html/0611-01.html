The executors and trustees contend that the income of said principal fund belongs to the said John B. and George TI. as the surviving children of the testator, and that the principal fund must remain intact and be held by the trustees for the benefit of said two surviving children. This controversy arises over the interpretation to bo given to the fifth item of testator’s will. The other portions of the instrument are important only so far as they may throw light upon the testator’s intent and meaning in his use of the language found in the fifth item. This fifth item provides for the disposition of an interest in the real estate in case a son or daughter should die without leaving lawful issue surviving him or her. To what period does the time of survivorship refer? Clearly not to the death of the <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>testator but to the death of the son or daughter. It is true that the period of survivorship is to be taken as the death of the testator unless a contrary intent is apparent. The will gives a life estate in this realty to the sons and daughter. The primary and controlling gift is to the sons and daughter for life and upon the death of any one leaving issue, the remainder is to pass to such issue, but in case of death without leaving issue then certain interests pass to the surviving children. The words, “ Immediately after the death of my son, then as to the said one fifth part of my said real estate to and for the only proper use and benefit of all and every the child and children which my said son may leave,” clearly fix .the time when the issue can take, to wit, the death of the son and the devise to surviving children must refer to the same period, for then only can the contingency on which alone they are to take, be determined. Woelpper’s Estate, <a href="/pa/126/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="126 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="968893" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0562-01">126 Pa. 562</a>. The four children and their issue were the principal objects of the testator’s bounty, and the time he had in mind when the shares should possibly go to any one else, was the death of his children respectively, and it was with reference to that time that he designated the surviving children. Who are included in the words “ unto my surviving child or children,” in the fifth item of the will ?</p>

But such construction can only arise from a clear intention or necessary implication, as where there are not other children than grandchildren or when the term “ children ” is further explained by a limitation over in default of issue. The word “ children ” does not ordinarily, and properly speaking, comprehend grandchildren, or issue generally. Their being included in that term is only permitted in two cases, viz: from utter necessity, which occurs when the will would remain inoperative unless the sense-of the word “children” were extended beyond its natural import, and where the testator has clearly shown by other words that he did not intend to use the term “ children ” in the proper actual meaning, but in a more extended sense: Hunt’s Estate, <a href="/pa/133/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="133 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="812898" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0260-01">133 Pa. 260</a>; Barnitz’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/5/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="953527" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0264-01">5 Pa. 264</a>; Horwitz v.

The petitioner fails to bring his case within <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>either exception to the general rule of construction. There is no necessity to give the extended meaning to the word. There are children living now, and all the children were living when the testator died and the will went into effect. Nor has the testator clearly shown by other words that he uses the word children in its most extensive sense. Throughout the whole will when he uses the word “children” there are modifications and explanatory words which clearly show that by the use of the word he means to designate his three sons and daughter. He speaks of them in the second item, as “ my four children,” “my wife and children or a majority of them,” “my said children.” In the third item as well as in the fourth, he repeats the words, “ my four children,” and “ my said children.” Again in the fourth item when he wishes to designate grandchildren, he uses the word “ children ” in its restricted or general meaning, by calling them the children of his daughter. When in the fifth item he uses the words, “ my surviving child or children” we see no justification for giving the word a more extensive meaning than the testator has given to it, throughout every other part of his will.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b637-5" data-blocks='[["BL_637.4",637,[214,1400,1179,666]]]'>Again, the words, “herein before given for life to my child so dying ” necessarily refer to one of his four children, and the words immediately following “ unto my surviving child or children ” must be confined to the same class. If the words “ my child,” in the antecedent clause, mean son or daughter, as they clearly do, how can we give to the words, “ my surviving children ” in the subsequent clause a wider signification ? It is said that unless the word “ children” is held to include grandchildren, a partial intestacy may follow. This is true, but a testator may fail to contemplate and provide for every contingency that can arise under his scheme of distribution. This fact is no justification for giving words a signification that does not belong to them, in order to avoid intestacy.</p>

"The homestead is given to the longest liver of the four children and his issue, to the exclusion of other grandchildren, should their parents die before the testator or before a sale of the property. The inequality in the dis<a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>position of the residue of the real estate is entirely consistent with the preference given to a surviving son or daughter in the disposition of the homestead.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b638-5" data-blocks='[["BL_638.4",638,[242,507,1180,923]]]'>The fourth and fifth items secure for the grandchildren, if any, the full share set apart for the parent, but when the testator contemplates the death of a son or the daughter without issue and a further disposition of the share so set apart becomes necessary, his mind and thought turn to the first objects of his bounty, — the survivors of his four children. It may be questioned whether his thought passed beyond the survivors of his four children, for to our mind it is not clear that the testator disposed of the corpus of a share where the son dies without leaving issue. The survivors of his four children are to have the income of such share just as they receive the income of the one-fifth set apart to them respectively, but what becomes of it upon the death of the last survivor? It is, however, unnecessary to pass upon this last inquiry, and we do not wish to express an opinion upon the subject, for we are satisfied that for the present the principal fund of §91,692.08 must remain intact in the hands of the executors and trustees to pay the rents, income and interest thereof to the two surviving sons.</p>
