The law has laid down a rule that the measure of damages in a case like this is the difference between the market value of the whole property invaded, for any purpose, as unaffected by and immediately before the construction of the railroad and its market value'for any purpose immediately after, and as affected by such construction. The burden of proof is upon the plaintiffs to show the amount of their damages. This they must do by the preponderance of the evidence, and from the evidence you must determine the amount of damages and make your verdict accordingly. [Then the first question for you to consider is, what was the market value of the property as a whole immediately before, and what it was immediately after, the taking and as affected by it. James T. and Albert Hamilton both testify that its market value was $75,000 before it was taken in August, 1896, and that the whole property after this was not worth more than $45,000, therefore their injuries under the rule of law for the determination of such damages, if they are correct,'are $30,000. They are the only witnesses on part of the plaintiffs who attempt to fix the value, either before or after. A number of other witnesses are called, who state they have no knowledge of the value of such a glass plant, and are unable to give an estimate in that respect, but say they have knowledge of the market value of real estate in the vicinity of this property, and they fix the decrease in value at from twenty to thirty per cent of the market value. You will recollect the several witnesses and their testimony, therefore, I <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>will not name them or repeat their statements. You were upon the ground and have personally examined it, and the buildings thereon; you have heard descriptions of the property, testimony as to the adaptability of the land for the purposes for which it is used. Peculiar adaptability to some particular use is an element which may very materially increase the market value of land, and this fact will be carefully considered, but not so far as any speculative element may appear. You will carefully consider every element in the case which will shed light on the true market value of the land at the time of taking, what circumstances, facts or elements would come into the mind of a person contemplating the purchase of this piece of ground as a whole before the land was taken, and what would he consider after he had knowledge of the appropriation for the purpose of constructing the railroad, after constructed and in operation. He would properly consider the amount of land taken, how and where taken, the disadvantages on account of its being taken, the disadvantages, if any, of the land being cut in two, the risks from fire incident to the lawful operation of the road, and as to this there are two theories upon which the claimant for damages can properly argue, such risk is material evidence in his favor. First, he can claim the danger is so imminent that no man of common prudence would maintain his building in such close proximity to the railroad. In that case he is entitled to the cost of removal of his building and its reconstruction in a safe place. Second, if the danger is not great, either from the fireproof character of the structure or its distance from the railroad, yet it can still be said there is some risk from fire by reason of the lawful operation of the road; he can claim that that fact depreciates the market value of the land entered upon; in the first case it is the loss of the improvement, in the second a disadvantage in the use. Damages in this regard cannot be assessed or recovered in this proceeding as a distinct, separate and independent item of damages that may accrue from fire: it can only be considered in so far as it would detract from or depreciate the market value of the property.

Where there is a dispute as to coal or timber an estimate can be made of the amount of coal taken or timber taken, and a calculation made from the facts, but in this case, gentlemen, you will have to determine very largely from your own judgment and your own opinion, and from the judgment and opinion of witnesses who have testified in the case. These witnesses who testified here are not testifying as to facts, but when they give their estimates they give them upon their judgment, upon acquaintance with the land, upon their knowledge of values in the neighborhood, and upon their knowledge of the value of property and the business for which it is being used. You will notice, gentlemen, that there is a very great difference in opinions of witnesses; we have heard on part of the plaintiff two witnesses who testify that the depreciation of this property is $30,000; we have had a dozen witnesses, perhaps more, who testify that they cannot give to you the real value of this property; that they have not such knowledge of the value of the glass property as will warrant them in making an estimate, but they state from their knowledge of property in the vicinity that they believe it has been depreciated, some say twenty, some say twenty to thirty, and some twenty-five to thirty per cent; you have the difference in opinion, because men differ.] [12]</p>

The law allows us to admit them, but leaves to you the duty of weighing their testimony and considering whether or not the fact that they do not know the value of the property, whether they would in that event be competent to determine how much the depreciation is. Now, gentlemen, take all these <em>things; </em>so far as fire is concerned, you cannot consider that as a separate item of depreciation or separate item of damages ; you can only consider what effect that would have upon a purchaser were he contemplating the purchase of this property as a whole ; what would a reasonably intelligent purchaser who has knowledge of the business and has knowledge of the running of railroad trams reduce the value of the property on account of the engines passing over and along as it passes here ?

We find nothing-in the assignments of error calling for special notice, except those from the tenth to fifteenth inclusive, alleging inadequacy and unfairness in the general charge of the court; and the sixteenth, nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first, alleging error in the admission of incompetent testimony and instruction to the jury on the effect of it.</p>

We concede, as we must do from our judicial observation in very many cases, that generally, there exists, especially against carrying corporations, an unreasoning prejudice which often results in injustice to them, and that it is the duty of trial courts to combat such prejudice and reach judgments uninfluenced by it. The right of eminent <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>domain is in tlxe commonwealth, to be exercised for the public benefit when she so wills; when she does so will, there is no arbitrary usurpation of power, but merely an assertion of an unquestioned light of sovereignty in the interests of tlxe public as a. whole. Every man who buys a foot of land knows or ought to know, that he takes it subject to this dominant right; it may be taken from him any day; the interests of the whole public are superior to his undisturbed enjoyment of his individual ownership. All tlxe owner can ask is compensation; not that he shall be made rich but that he shall be made whole. The owner, too often forgetting this real relation between himself aud the commonwealth of which he is a citizen, feels outraged by what he deems a violation of his right of property when the clear right is oix the other side, and we see at times whole communities sharing in the indignation of the supposed injured owner; imbibing with him prejudice against the commonwealth’s grantee, and willing, not only to make the owner whole, but also glad to puixish the taker by imposing excessive damages for the exercise of an undoubted right. This prejudice, as argued by appellaixt, perhaps existed in this ease, and may have influenced the verdict; but the learned judge of the court below seexns to have fairly tried by proper rulings and iixstructious to counteract it. If it were manifest that he failed in duty in this particular, we would, without hesitation, reverse for that reason alone. The most we caix say is that perhaps in one or two particulars the charge lacks in clearness ; but on the whole it is in substantial accord with the opinion rendered by us on the former appeal. Therefore we do not sustaixx the assignments of error relating to the chaxge.</p>
    <p id="b37-5" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[220,1858,1178,561]],["BL_38.1",38,[235,357,1188,1957]]]'>As to the errors complained'of in the admission of the testimony of Albert Hamilton and tlxe other witnesses, a number of the answers were incompetent and some irrelevant. In several instances they were not in response to the questions asked. The court sustained some objections to answers and overruled others, and struggled to limit the adxnissioixs to that only which was competent. If, as seems to have been claimed by plaintiffs in their testimony, the packing house, by reason of the combustible material, was a tinder box, within six feet of passing locomotives, then their claim for damages should have been strictly limited to the cogt of rendering the building fireproof or to <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>cost of removal. The defendant had a right to insist on plaintiffs disclosing fully and clearly the exact purpose of the offer; if this purpose had been to show that no prudent man would maintain buildings in such peril, then plaintiffs’ damage would have been the expense of rendering them fireproof or relocating them. If the danger was no greater than the ordinary one the risk could only be considered as one which might or might not depreciate the market value of the property. The court had no aid from defendant’s counsel in compelling a specific offer, and consequently some of its rulings on objections appear inconsistent; but when we consider that the testimony for one purpose might not have been admissible for the other, it is not surprising that error is now alleged. But to cure alleged error which the court tried as best it could to prevent, counsel moved to strike out the whole testimony of the witnesses. A favorable ruling on the motion would have carried out with the objectionable answers much testimony that was competent. The court could not without error sustain the motion. It should have embraced and distinctly pointed out those answers which were erroneous. .The evidence then being properly in, some of it competent to sustain one theory of plaintiff, and some the other, the court merely read to the jury that part of the opinion of this court on the former appeal in which we decided what should be the measure of damages if the owners were compelled to change the character of the structure or to remove it, and what the measure if the onlyrisk was that to which buildings are subjected by the ordinary and lawful running of locomotives. Defendant put four distinct points to the court for instructions on the measure of damages by fire, but in not one of them does it ask it to say to the jury, that if the danger to this warehouse was so imminent as to require a change of character of structure, or its removal, then the damage should be limited to the cost of such change or removal, which the testimony of all the witnesses showed would not exceed $200 or $300. The court in general terms announced the correct rule; defendant was entitled on the evidence to more specific instruction in this particular, if it had been asked, but it was not asked, and we will not assume the court erred in omitting it.</p>
