The testimony for the plaintiff tended to show that the fire plug, a telegraph pole and a gas lamp were directly in line with each other, so that the telegraph pole caused a shadow to fall <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>upon the space where the fire plug was situated.

It was placed within four inches of the curb, and was of the ordinary diameter. As fire plugs are a clear public necessity, and cannot be placed in the open highway, and as they must be placed in such a position as to bo easily accessible in case of fire, there is no other position for them but on the sidewalks, and it is the universal practice to locate them there. The municipality is the sole authority to determine this matter, and, of course, as we have frequently held, their discretion is not to be held sub<a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>ject to the verdicts of juries.
