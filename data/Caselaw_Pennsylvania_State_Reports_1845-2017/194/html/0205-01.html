Tyler had renewed his note several times with the defendants. Finally the defendants refused to renew the note, and demanded its payment, and I believe the note was protested. Tyler then went to the plaintiff bank to secure a loan for the purpose of paying the defendants, and offered to the bank the certificates of stock as collateral. The bank, at the time Tyler made the application for a loan, knew that these stocks were in the hands of the defendants, pledged there for what Tyler owed the defendants. Some negotiations were had before March 6, 1897. On March 6, 1897, Tyler was at the bank, and had made arrangements for the bank to discount his note for $3,100, on these stocks being pledged as collateral. He went down to the defendants, and the bookkeeper of the defendants, Allison, came up with him to the plaintiff bank with the two certificates of stock. The bank then ascertained how much was due to the defendants, a calculation was made, and it was ascertained to be $2,983.42. All Mr. Allison, the bookkeeper, said when he went up there was, these are the stocks, and he would not give them up until he got a check for the amount due to the defendants. . . . The loan was made, according to the evidence, directly to Tyler, and on Tyler’s own note given to the bank, and these stocks <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>were simply pledged as collateral, and the balance of the proceeds of the $3,100 note, after the payment to the defendants, was paid over by the bank to Tyler. On that evidence the loan was directly to Tyler, no loan whatever to the defendants, and, according to the evidence, the defendants had nothing whatever to do in securing the loan to Tyler.</p>

They had heard that the corporation charged that certain stocks outstanding were forged certificates of stock, but the evidence shows that the defendants believed they had a claim against the corporation for the value of these stocks, and so notified the cashier of the plaintiff bank after the maturity of this paper, and after the bank called upon the defendants to pay, which they refused to do. The evidence does not show any fraud on the part of the defendants. All they did was simply to receive the amount of money due them for which they held these collaterals. ...</p>

Before the loan matured they learned that the issue of stock was unauthorized, and they refused to renew. Tyler then applied to the bank for a loan of $3,100, and offered this stock, which he told the cashier was held by the defendants as collateral. Having arranged with the bank, he applied to the defendants for the stock, and they sent a clerk with it to the bank. The clerk was asked either what he wanted for the certificates or what amount was due the defendants, and upon his stating the amount of the note with interest and costs of protest he was handed a check for $2,983.42, and he delivered the certificates to the cashier and the note to Tyler. The balance of the loan of $3,100 was paid by the cashier to Tyler. This was the whole transaction. The defendants had no communication, directly or indirectly, with the bank except through their clerk, and that was limited to the mere statement by him of the amount due. The sending of a clerk with the note and certificates was in accordancé with the usual business custom in such matters. There was neither misrepresentation, express or implied, nor active concealment of any fact, and there was no relation of trust or confidence to give rise to a duty.
