      <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>It was contended on the part of the defendant that certain statements which were rendered by Gage to the plaintiff, showing the profits to be divided between Gage and Miller, are to be considered as a construction put upon the contract by the parties themselves, and that the rule that where the contract is ambiguous the construction put upon it by the parties must prevail, applies in this case. But these statements were the statements of Gage, the predecessor of the defendant, Billing-ton, in the contract, and there-is no evidence to show that the defendant ever saw them, or knew of them, until they were offered in evidence in this case by the plaintiff for another purpose. There can, therefore, be no privity between the plaintiff and the defendant so far as these statements made by Gage to the plaintiff are concerned, and the rule cannot apply. There are, beside, serious doubts whether Gage’s statements would have been available for this purpose between himself and the plaintiff. It was not shown that the plaintiff, a woman, had ever had an opportunity of. ascertaining their correctness by examination of the books or otherwise, but, on the contrary, it was developed by the testimony that Gage had included in some, at least, of these statements, under the head of the cost price of articles to be used in the manufacture of the packing, a profit to himself; that is, he purchased the material to be used, added a profit to himself, and then charged the whole as the actual cost of material in his statement. This amounted to fraud upon the part of Gage, and throws discredit upon his statements. Nor can the contract be said to be ambiguous. The language of the covenants is plain and not capable of misconstruction. The agreement itself must, therefore, be consulted in construing the contract between the parties. The agreement provided that the defendant shall “ render quarterly statements to the said Elizabeth W. Miller, and within ten days after rendering said accounts, to pay to the said Elizabeth W. Miller the royalty or half net profits as aforesaid.” This the defendant has failed to do. The plaintiff was entitled to the share of her profits at these dates. The master, therefore, in stating the account, allows rests at every quarter, and interest on the amounts found to be due to the plaintiff for her share of the profits from the dates of each quarter.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b477-6" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[233,726,1179,968]]]'>The language here is that the defendant shall manufacture the packing at his sole cost and expense, and that the profit shall be found by deducting the actual cost of manufacture. In the absence of any special provision for charging interest on capital, employed by the defendant, or for charging rent, the master holds that the allowance of these items in the account of the defendant, must be governed by the general rule which is laid down by McPherson, J., and affirmed by the Supreme Court in Ahl v. Ahl, <a href="/pa/186/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="186 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="989709" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0099-01">186 Pa. 99</a>, in the following language: “ The general rule is well settled, that a partner is not entitled to claim interest upon money advanced for partnership purposes, unless otherwise agreed,” citing Holden v.

Dec. 518</a>, “ and it is merely extending the principle, to deny a partner rent for his real estate used for partnership purposes, unless he can prove an agreement that rent is to be allowed.” The Pennsylvania rule concerning the allowance of interest is found in Gyger’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%2078" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="62 Pa. 78">62 Pa. 78</a>. “The allowance or refusal of interest depends upon the circumstance of each particular case.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b477-7" data-blocks='[["BL_477.5",477,[232,1713,1181,662]]]'>It must be borne in mind that this is not the case of the settlement of an intricate account in the winding up of a partnership, where the parties could not have avoided the necessity of litigation, or at least of calling in friends to arbitrate, as was the case in Gyger’s Appeal, but here the defendant denied the plaintiff’s title, refused to account, and when called to account by the plaintiff, in plain disregard of his covenant, he discontinued the manufacture of the globe packing, and used his efforts to substitute another packing in its place, he is, therefore, entitled to no favors from a court of equity, and cannot now complain if he is held to a rigid and strict accountability. The master, therefore, disallows any items of charges for interest on capital in the defendant’s account.</p>

The master construes the agreement to mean that all these items and others of a similar character, are a part of the defendant’s agreement to manufacture at his sole cost, chargd and expense. Nor are any items of cost of selling, such as commissions, to be allowed as the actual cost of manufacture; such items are provided for, and all costs of sale in the proviso in the agreement which reserves to the defendant after deducting the actual cost of manufacture, seven and one half per centum of the selling price. This seven and one half per centum was evidently to cover the cost of selling, and as the defendant was equally interested in the profit, it was the contemplated profit which was intended to be the defendant’s compensation for the use of his general facilities in conducting the business. In support of his contention that all of these items should be allowed in the settlement of his account, the defendant relied upon several cases cited by him as authority, principally -in the United States courts, but these cases are for infringement of patents, where the measure of damage to the plaintiff was the profit made by the infringer. In these cases the infringer was allowed to 6ffset in his account against the money received by reason of the infringement, items <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>of expense and charge, including many of a character similar to those excluded by the master in the present case. JBut in those cases there were no contracts between the parties; no commissions allowed; no covenant to manufacture at the sole cost, charge and expense of the defendant; no covenant to sell, and no agreement as to how the profits were to be estimated. In those cases the only question to be decided was the profit which had come into the infringer’s possession by reason of the infringement. They do not apply to this case.</p>

This discrepancy, the defendant claimed, was accounted for partly as having been the <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>result of shrinkage in weight, and that the, remainder had been given away in samples and for the purposes of advertising.
