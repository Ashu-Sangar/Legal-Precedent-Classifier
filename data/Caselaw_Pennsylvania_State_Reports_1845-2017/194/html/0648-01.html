The defendant’s water works are located on land outside the borough limits, which it bought for that purpose. The main stream, from which the water is taken, does not run through the borough, but one of its tributaries does. Plaintiff owned a large textile manufactory situated on his land which obtained a part of its power from tlie fall of the creek, amounting to about forty horse-power. The mill was operated by him under the trading name of <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>James Irving &amp; Son. He had no partner. Separate accounts were kept of the manufacturing business, for the purpose of measuring the amount of compensation to his son, William A. Irving. The mill was rented to the manufacturing business by annual leases. He had the right to the use of the waters of the creek as a riparian owner, and he had also devoted the power of the creek to the artificial use of furnishing power to his mill. The defendant borough owned a tract of land on the same creek higher up the stream. In 1872 the borough located a pumping station on this land and commenced to pump water to the inhabitants of the borough for general uses. The riparian land belonging to the borough is outside the borough limits. There was evidence tending to show that the amount of water pumped by the borough in 1872 was comparatively small, and that the consumption increased continuously after that time; also that the borough had recently begun to furnish water for a district outside of the borough, some of which is within the watershed of Ridley creek, and some of it within another watershed. The statute of limitations was pleaded by the defendant.</p>
