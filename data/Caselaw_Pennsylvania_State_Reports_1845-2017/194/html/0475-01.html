On July 6,1895, the plaintiffs replied that they were urging the Carnegie Steel Company for these bills and hoped to send them during the then coming week.

The subject of the contracts was the iron and steel beams, trusses, pillars and plates used in the construction of the buildings erected for the Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, twisted and warped by the heat of the fire which had destroyed them. Before this material could be cut into pieces of six feet length and under, ready for melting, much of it had to be separated from that to which it was attached by unriveting. The defendant company had shears intended to cut the material into the designated lengths, but, owing in great part to their erection upon made ground which yielded under the weight and strain of their working, they broke down several times in the summer of 1895. Both in Chicago and in Pitts-burg there existed shears adequate to the work required in cutting this material.</p>

The market price of the sheared steel scrap or melting stock began to advance in the spring of 1895; by June 1 it was seventy-five cents a ton higher than the price the plaintiffs had agreed to pay the defendant; on July 6 it was $1.50 higher, and gradually advancing from that time it was double the said contract price before the middle of September.

Block at first insisted upon compliance with the terms of the contract; finally he said if it were possible the plaintiffs would take the unsheared, and on his return to Pittsburg he would inform Pollock.</p>

This he did in the afternoon of that day. At the meeting, Levine, the president of the defendant company, told him that the company would not deliver the plaintiffs another pound of the material and that he supposed Block thought him a robber and a thief. The interview lasted some hours; Block represented that such a course was robbing the plaintiffs of from $6,000 to $7,000, and threatened suit. Levine said the Company would wind up as soon as all the structural material was- delivered and he was therefore indifferent to a <em>suit; </em>Block continued to plead and he was put in communication with Harris, one of the directors; Harris said it was useless for him to behave as he was doing; that the plaintiffs’ “ order ” (obviously meaning the February contract) was canceled, and had been since August, when they declined to accept the offer of unshea'red steel scrap. Apparently Block prevailed by his much speaking, for Harris offered 200 tons of sheared, and 900 tons of unsheared scrap as brought to the shears. This Block <em>accepted; </em>he returned to Pittsburg and sought legal advice with respect to the effect of this offer and <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>its acceptance upon the February contract, and, although it is not otherwise in evidence, it was admitted by the attorney who gave it that he advised that there was no consideration for a cancelation of the contract of February, and such cancelation, therefore, would be legally voidable.

Of the 900 tons unsheared 762 tons were delivered between September 16 and November 13. On or about October 21, at the plaintiffs’ request, the carriers to whom delivery in Chicago was to be made was changed to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad cars, Chicago. Between November 15 and 21, the defendant sent eight cars containing 104 tons to Pittsburg and it drew upon the plaintiffs two drafts representing the price of these tons, one for $485.15 and one for $295.64 accompanying them with.bills of lading for the material. The plaintiffs declined to accept either draft, both were protested, and on November 25, 1895, the 104 tons were the subject of proceedings in foreign attachment in Pitts-burg at the suit of the plaintiffs, which proceedings are still pending: thereupon the defendant company declined to forward 34 tons, unshipped part of the 900 tons.</p>

Very much of the testimony, however, has been directed to that point. It is contradictory, as it is with respect to the cost of putting the material in shape for shearing, and the cost of cutting it into the required lengths. A careful consideration and reconsideration of it has developed the following: <em>(a) </em>of the 762 tons of unsheared material about sixty per centum was “ in shape as we bring them to our shears,” about forty per centum, or 304 tons, was not in such shape, and separation by unriveting (or unbuckling as it was more generally called) was necessary before it could be sheared. (5) The cost of separation by unriveting was $1.00 a ton. (c) The cost of shearing was fifty cents a ton. <em>(d) </em>The cost either in Chicago or Pittsburg of hauling to and from shears adequate for the work would be each way fifty cents, or $1.00 a ton.</p>

    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.6",506,[266,428,1184,603]]]'>This suit was begun by foreign attachment, and at the hearing the issue took the form of an action of assumpsit. The cause was sent for trial to E. Hunn Hanson, Esq., as referee, to find facts and apply to them his conclusions of law; in effect, both his findings and conclusions are in favor of plaintiffs, and defendant appeals, alleging he erred in not finding for defendant and certifying a balance in its favor. The findings of fact are so full and so orderly stated by the learned referee, that it would be a useless labor to restate them at length in this opinion. Counsel for appellant accepts as true all the material facts of the referee approved by the court bélow, but he assigns for error the referee’s conclusions from them.</p>
    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.7",506,[267,1048,1185,1275]]]'>Briefly stated, defendant, in February, 1895, contracted to deliver f. o. b. cars at Chicago, for shipment to Pittsburg, 3,000 tons of sheared steel at 17.50 per ton, the deliveries to be completed by June 30 following, to be paid for in plaintiffs’ thirty day drafts when delivered. At the expiration of the time, neither party had performed to the letter, the contract; shipments continued during the summer, but defendant, alleging a breakdown of its machinery for shearing the steel, made no shipments after the 7th of August, and on the 10th of that month notified plaintiffs that it was impossible to ship sheared steel as provided by the contract. By this time the steel had largely advanced in price over the contract figure; had very nearly doubled. It is not improbable, as plaintiffs allege, that defendant sought to evade its contract obligation; and it is too plain for argument that plaintiffs wanted the steel and did not want a suit against defendant for damages; so, on September 11, L. E. Block, a member of the plaintiff partnership, met Levine, president of defendant company in Chicago; much anger was displayed by both, and suits were threatened, but the interview ended in the making of a hew contract, by which the old one was canceled, and the new one, materially modifying and changing the terms of the old, was agreed upon. The terms of the new one are expressly set out in the two letters of the 12th and 13th of September, one and two days after the interview between Block and Levine. _ These are the letters:</p>

    <blockquote id="b507-15" data-blocks='[["BL_507.16",507,[190,1876,1179,200]]]'>“ The letters of September 12-18 exhibit in the clearest way that it was the expressed purpose of the parties to end their rights under the contract of BYbruary 8, 9, 12, and in place of them, to substitute the September agreement.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[259,744,1185,1701]]]'>The opinion of a lawyer, of the learning and ability of the referee, has moved us to a careful revision and consideration of his report; after the most mature deliberation, we are clearly of the opinion he erred in his application of the law to the facts found by him. Assume, as he does, that at the personal interview between Block and Levine on the 11th of September, there was a distinct declaration by the latter that his company would not perform its "contract; still if anything can be clear, it is, that above all things, plaintiffs did not want a lawsuit for damages ; at that stage, their damages were wholly uncertain, depending on the fluctuating price of steel; they did know they wanted the steel; what damages they might want by reason of defendant’s breach, or what they might sustain,' they did not know. In this dilemma, they sought for and obtained a new contract expressly canceling the old. They did not accept a less sum than the money due on a debt certain in amount, a contract which under the authorities would have been without consideration ; they agreed to accept a fixed quantity and quality of merchandise at fixed times and prices, instead of the uncertain event of a lawsuit. ■ It in no way changes the character of the contract of September 11, 1895, that, now, long after the event, the referee, can under the terms of the old contract, to his satisfaction, with approximate certainty, liquidate the damages occasioned by the breach. How did matters stand, then, with the uncertainty of the steel market on that day ? That was the question in contemplation of both parties. In McNish v. Reynolds, <a href="/pa/95/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="95 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="492941" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0483-01">95 Pa. 483</a>, we held, “ that the mutual, unexecuted undertakings of an existing contract are a sufficient consideration for the cancelation of such a contract, and the substitution of a new one with different terms.” It is immaterial, if, for a moment during the interview, there was technically a breach by defendant ; by the new agreement, both treated the old one as an existing contract, and mutually agreed to a rescission of it.</p>

The parties to a contract may at any time rescind it, either in whole or in part, by mutual consent, and the surrender of their mutual rights is sufficient consideration. That is what the parties did in the present case, and their rights must be determined exclusively by the agreement of May, 1892. . . .
