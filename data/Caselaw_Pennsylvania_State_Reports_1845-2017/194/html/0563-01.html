The evidence did not show that the shop was inadequate, or was unduly crowded. The gang of workmen in which the deceased worked was under the direction of the boss of the reamers. The evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs tended to show that the accident was caused by the negligent actions and orders of the boss.</p>
