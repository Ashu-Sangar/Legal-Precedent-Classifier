Wampler formed a copartnership for the purpose of carrying on a general lumber business in McKeesport, Allegheny county, Pennsylvania. There were no written articles of copartnership between the parties relating to the copartnership business. The interest of James Neel therein was a three-fourths interest, and that of Wm. P. Wampler a one-fourth interest. The only money contributed was by James Neel. Mr. Wampler’s interest was to be paid for out of profits of the partnership. Mr. Wampler was the active partner and attended to the business without any interference from Mr. Neel. Mr. Neel was a passive, inactive and quiet partner. On July 24, 1892, Mr. James Neel died, having first made his last will and testament, the plaintiffs in this proceeding being the executors and trustees named in the will. On the day of , 1892,</p>

The weight of the evidence to my mind does not bear out or support this theory of the case. On the contrary, it appears that they urged Mr. Wampler to close up the partnership business as speedily as possible, but so as not to be injurious to the interest of both parties. The business not being closed as requested, the agreement of February 19,1895, was entered into. Under this agreement and within less than a month after it was entered into, the appraisers named therein proceeded to and did appraise the value of the real estate in accordance with its provisions, and the trustees and Mr. Wampler took certain portions of the real estate, and deeds were passed between the parties relative to <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>the real estate taken by the respective parties. Mr. Wampler still continued to carry on the partnership business, buying lumber and material, running the mill, keeping the firm name signs up at the old place of business, buying lumber and other material in the firm name, carrying the firm account in the First National Bank of McKeesport, Pa., in the firm name, signing the firm name to checks, notes and other evidence of debt, and indorsing the firm name on back of notes given the firm.</p>

Several efforts were made by the executors under this bill to force Mr. Wampler to cease the firm business and file an account of his action from the time of Mr. Neel’s death up to said period, without much success until April 13, 1896, when the paper called the “ Stipulation ” was signed in open court, and during the time a hearing was being had by the court in the case.</p>

To have forced the assets of the <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>firm on the market during this business depression would have been ruinous to both parties interested. It was good, wise and prudent judgment on the part of Mr. Wampler, not only to try and carry these assets through these times and until such times as would justify the same being placed on the market in safety, and he did it. To do this, however, he had to have means, and. he had to depend upon his own ingenuity and skill to do this, receiving no help or assistance from the executors or trustees excepting at one time when the firm of Alexander &amp; Company, of Monongahela city, Pennsylvania, of which firm Mr. Joseph A. Herron, oné of the executors and trustees, is a member, discounted the firm’s paper to the extent of some $9,000, and which was subsequently paid out of and from the sale of some of the firm’s real estate. During all this period of time Mr. Wampler was a member of the board of directors of the First National Bank of McKeesport, Pennsylvania. He did all the firm’s business with this bank. It discounted paper in large sums upon the faith and credit of the firm name, largely as indorser upon paper taken in payment of moneys due the firm, the money thus obtained being credited to the firm upon the books of the bank, checked against by Mr. Wampler, for the use of the firm in its business generally, and for the payment of some of the real estate in question, payment on account of mortgages, both principal and interest, repairs to this real estate, taxes, insurances, municipal assessments, etc., all of which was greatly to the benefit of the estate of James Neel, deceased. Some of the officers of the bank testify that this line of discount was given by reason of the fact that they were to some extent led to believe that Mr. Wampler was carrying on the business in pursuance of the authority granted the executors and trustees under Mr. Neel’s will; partly from the fact that the signs and other evidence about the mill and place where the business had been carried on in Mr. Neel’s lifetime were the same; partly from the fact that Mr. Wampler continued doing business just as he had been doing whilst Mr. Neel was living, and partly that they had no notice from the executors and trustees that the partnership had ceased or was dissolved.</p>

These facts and results, taken in connection with the wording of the agreement of February 19,. 1895, and of the stipulation of April 18, 1896, throw around this claim of the bank such equities that the claim should be allowed, and I therefore have allowed it. In allowing this claim I do not for one moment forget or overlook the strict letter of' the law bearing upon partnerships such as this one was, that by the act of God and operation of law, the partnership ceased and ended upon Mr. Neel’s death, and that the plain duty of the surviving partner is to collect the assets of the partnership,, receive and receipt for payments, pay and settle partnership-debts, settle and wind up the partnership business and distribute the net surplus among the parties entitled to it. Nor do I forget that the law is that none of the partners can create any new contracts or obligations binding upon the partnership; none-of them can buy or sell or pledge goods on any account therefor ; none of them can indorse or transfer the partnership securities to third parties, or in anyway make their acts the acts of the partnership. And it is true that the law will not permit-the estate of a deceased partner to become liable for debts contracted after his death, unless distinctly made so by the dear-language of the partnership agreement, or by the will of the deceased. This case differs from the above principles. If the contention in this part of the proceeding under this bill in equity was between the partners, then this rule would prevail, and I would not hesitate a moment to rule that the surviving-partner was controlled by them. The controversies between the partners, so far as the auditor is concerned, have been found and reported to the court. This, however, is a claim by a creditor upon a fund arising out of real estate, largely obtained for and used to protect and preserve, during a period of great financial depression, the estate of the firm, and out of moneys loaned the firm, not upon the firm’s own paper, birt largely upon the paper of other parties taken in payment of the sales of the commodity owned and trafficked in by the firm. Under all these facts and circumstances the claim of the bank is surrounded and protected by such equities, that I feel that the claim should be allowed.</p>

I do not agree with him as to its being absolutely correct. On the contrary, by death, the act of God, and by operation of law, the partnership became dissolved, unless provided for otherwise by the agreement of the copartners, and those dealing with the late firm take notice of such dissolution and must act accordingly; otherwise the legal representatives of the dead partner might find the estate coming into their hands swamped and destroyed, as they might, and in all probability would, or could have no knowledge as to whom the firm dealt with in the lifetime of the deceased partner. They might be in a position not to be able to obtain the knowledge necessary to bring this notice home to all parties, and it would, therefore, be not only a hard, but a harsh and cruel rule, wiping away a man’s estate after his death, by reason of the fact that his legal representative did not bring home notice to one or more persons with whom the firm dealt in the lifetime of the deceased partner.</p>

Notice of the meeting of the auditor for the distribution of this fund was sent to the different holders of these mortgages. None of the mortgagees appeared in person before the auditor, or made claim to be paid out of the fund. Some of the mortgagees notified the auditor personally that they preferred that no interference be made with their security. As the mortgagees are not before the auditor as claimants upon the fund, I have not considered that they or their claims are before me, and do not consider them as claimants upon the fund, and therefore have not made any allowance to them on account of their respective mortgage debt. This leaves the real estate now owned by the trustees and Mr. Wampler just as it was when it was purchased by the different parties, namely, subject to the mortgage debt upon each piece of property, and which they respectively will have to take care of.</p>

    <p id="b307-7" data-blocks='[["BL_307.10",307,[205,986,1188,1069]]]'>This appeal is from a decree confirming the report of an auditor making distribution of moneys in the hands of the receiver of the late firm of Neel &amp; Wampler. The report exhibits great care by the learned auditor in considering and passing upon the matters brought before him; and in awarding a dividend on the claim of the First National Bank of McKeesport he made a proper discrimination between it and ordinary indebtedness which a surviving partner undertakes to incur in the firm’s name after its dissolution by the death of one of its members. The evidence in connection with the bank’s claim is intelligently reviewed and the findings of fact, fully justified, will not be disturbed. Upon the facts so properly found the auditor’s judgment as to the legal status of this claim on the fund before him was correct. No good purpose can be served by our calling attention to the evidence in detail and discussing the legal and equitable rights of the bank, for the learned auditor has done his work so well that we refer the appellants to it, as furnishing all the reasons why the bank’s claim was properly allowed. If we believed it to be needful to give our own, we could not tell them better than in the following words of the auditor:</p>
    <blockquote id="b307-8" data-blocks='[["BL_307.11",307,[208,2074,1184,356]],["BL_308.1",308,[258,368,1188,455]]]'>“ From a most careful and painstaking search of the books of the firm as kept by Mr. Wampler, and from the exhibits taken therefrom and submitted to the court, it is beyond all controversy that all the moneys received by the firm from the bank upon the foregoing notes went into the business and was paid out in connection with it; that the purchase of real estate by Wampler, payment of the purchase money for the same, <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>payment of mortgages, principal and interest, taxes, repairs, insurance, municipal assessments, was for the benefit of the firm, preserved the same to the estate, and has resulted in great benefit and gain, not only to the firm, but to the estate of James Neel, as well as to Mr. Wampler. These facts and results, taken in connection with the wording of the agreement of February 19, 1895, and of the stipulation of April 13, 1896, throw around this claim of the bank such equities that the claim should be allowed, and I, therefore, have allowed it.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b308-5" data-blocks='[["BL_308.4",308,[256,832,1190,923]]]'>“ In allowing this claim I do not for one moment forget or overlook the strict letter of the law bearing upon partnerships such as this one was, that by the act of God and operation of law the partnership ceased and ended upon Mr. Neel’s death, and that the plain duty of the surviving partner is to collect the assets of the partnership, receive and receipt for payments, pay and settle partnership debts, settle and wind up the partnership business and distribute the net surplus among the parties entitled to it. Nor do I forget that the law is, that none of the partners can create any new contracts or obligations binding upon the partnership, none of them can buy or sell or pledge goods on any account therefor, none of them can indorse or transfer the partnership securities to. third parties, or in any way make their acts the acts of the partnership. And it is true that the law will not permit the estate of a deceased partner to become liable for debts contracted after his death unless distinctly made so by the clear language of the partnership agreement or by the will of the deceased.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b308-6" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[257,1763,1189,662]],["BL_309.1",309,[232,358,1181,138]]]'>“ This case differs from the above principies. If the contention in this part of the proceeding under this bill in equity was between the partners, then this rule would prevail, and I would not hesitate a moment to rule that the surviving partner was controlled by them. The controversies between the partners, so far as the auditor is concerned, have been found and reported to the court. This, however, is a claim by a creditor upon a fund arising out of real estate, largely obtained for and used to protect and preserve, during a period of great financial depression, the estate of the firm, and out of moneys loaned the firm, not upon the firm’s own paper, but largely upon the paper of other parties taken in payment of the sales of the commodity owned and trafficked in by the firm. Under all <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>these facts and circumstances the claim of the bank is surrounded and protected by such equities that I feel that the claim should be allowed.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b309-5" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[229,515,1186,508]]]'>The disallowance of the claims made on various mortgages need not be discussed further than to say that they were all properly disallowed. None of the mortgagees appeared as claimants upon the fund, and any allowance upon these claims presented by counsel for the appellee could not be sustained on legal or equitable grounds. The mortgages remained unaffected by anything- done by Wampler or the trustees, and the respective owners of the properties bound by them must make provision for their payment. The assignments of error on this point do not seem to be pressed.</p>
    <p id="b309-6" data-blocks='[["BL_309.5",309,[232,1033,1181,188]]]'>The court below, believing the auditor’s findings of fact and conclusions of law to have been correct, formally confirmed his report, and in overruling all the assignments of error we do so for the same reason.</p>
    <p id="b309-7" data-blocks='[["BL_309.6",309,[230,1241,1182,83]]]'>Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of appellants.</p>
