Palethrop devised to his wife the income of his real estate during widowhood, and gave to each of his children, after his said wife’s death, an equal share of his whole estate for such child’s own sole and separate use. This devise, without more, would under the statute of April 8,1833, section 9, have passed to each child a fee simple in the testator’s real estate, but the generality of the devise is subject to two exceptions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-10" data-blocks='[["BL_433.9",433,[221,1674,1181,767]]]'>The first is contained in the following language: “ With the exception of $20,000 worth of property of each of my children’s share. The said $20,000 they are only to receive the interests and incomes arising from such, as it is my will the principal of said $20,000 shall be entailed on each of my children and their legal heirs.” So far as this exception may refer to real estate of the testator, these words imply a gift of the land for life, a devise of the income of land being a devise of the land itself for so long a time as the profits of the land are given: France’s Est., <a href="/pa/75/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="75 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="1036706" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0220-01">75 Pa. 220</a>. The clear intent of the testator is, therefore, to make a gift of such lands as may be embraced within this exception to his child for life, with remainder to such child’s legal heirs in tail. By virtue of the provisions of the act of April 27, 1855, this was converted into an estate in fee simple in the first taker, the child of testator.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b434-4" data-blocks='[["BL_434.3",434,[236,361,1182,1287]]]'>
      <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>The second exception to the general devise in the will of John H. Palethorp, above referred to, is in the following words: “ And if either of my children die without lawful issue, then his or her share reverts back again to my estate and becomes a part of said estate, and is to be equally divided, the same as the other, amongst all of my surviving children.” The words “ die without lawful issue ” are susceptible of only two relations, they either relate to and provide for the case of the death of the child in the lifetime of the testator, or to an indefinite failure of issue after the decease of the testator. If they were intended to relate to the death of the child during the testator’s lifetime, then, as all of the children survived the testator, the exception has no effect to cut down the fee simple previously devised. If, as in view of the whole instrument is more probable, they were intended to refer to an indefinite failure of issue after the death of the testator, then the clear effect of the words is to cut down the fee simple previously devised to the child into a fee tail, which estate, however, by the provisions of the act of April 27, 1855, already referred to, was enlarged to a fee simple: Robinson’s Estate, <a href="/pa/149/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="149 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="832576" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0418-01">149 Pa. 418</a>.
