Graber is to be held by her absolutely, or whether it is given in trust is a question that depends upon the intention of the testator, which must be gathered from the entire will. We are met, again, with the fact that the testator was an illiterate man, not familiar with legal phrases, but having sufficient confidence in himself to feel that he was able to write a will, which would be expressed in terms setting forth his intentions, and because of his inability or neglect in specifying more particularly just exactly what he did intend, we are put to the trouble of ciphering out from his entire will just what his intentions were.</p>

This fact is clearly set forth in his bequest to Martha Graber of $7,000, afterwards cut down by codicil to $5,000, in which case he provided that his executors should act as guardians for Martha Graber, and in case of her death they were then to pay over this money one half to her brother Henry Graber, and the other one half to his brothers and sisters and the brothers and sisters of his wife. And the testator even went further and provided that in case Henry Graber should die and leave no issue, then he directed that the full amount of the principal should go to the testator’s brothers and sisters and the brothers <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>and sisters of his wife. In his particular bequest there is not a particle of doubt but that the testator intended that the principal of the bequest in case of the death of both Martha Graber and Henry Graber without issue should go to his brothers and sisters and the brothers and sister of his wife. And the testator even went further and distinctly on this point, and has gone to a very great deal of trouble to set forth just exactly how he wanted that bequest disposed of.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[220,778,1180,1030]]]'>And when he comes to the item in which he gives and bequeaths to Emma E. Graber, wife of Dr. J. D. Graber, $5,000, and directs that his executors should be guardians and act just in the same capacity as in Martha Graber’s case, and after her death the principal and interest which the said Emma E. Graber did not use was to go to her children share and share alike, and provides further, that should the said Emma E. Graber die without issue that the said guardians should divide the said sum of $5,000, with interest, if any, among his brothers and sisters and the brothers and sisters of his wife, it would seem to your auditor that the two bequests must be construed practically in the same language, and that although the testator did not in the bequest to Emma E. Graber go to the same trouble in setting forth as fully what should be done, he did nevertheless state that his guardians were to act in just the same capacity as they had been instructed to do in the Martha Graber case, he evidently thinking that — as he had expressed himself there fully and carefully — it was not again necessary to repeat the same language, but that a reference to it in this way would be sufficiently definite and accurate.</p>

If they were to act in the same capacity in the case of the bequest to Emma E. Graber, then it would be necessary for them to invest this money, collect the interest, and in this case pay the same over to Emma E. Graber, and they would be active trustees. Martha Graber was a minor, and he there nominated his executors as her guardians. Emma E. Graber is of full age, and a married woman, and evidently <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>when the testator said they should be guardians he meant it in the sense of trustees, being unfamiliar with legal terms. In the bequest to Emma E. Graber the language is somewhat obscure, and it may mean that she either had the right to use the principal and interest under certain circumstances, or he may have meant that the interest which she did not use, in addition to the principal, was to go to her children share and share alike in case of her death, but it would seem to your auditor that it would make little difference in this case as to which was meant, as it does not follow that because she is given the power of consumption of a part or all of the principal that she would therefore take this as an absolute gift. As stated in the outstart, this would depend upon the intention of the testator, and the manifest purpose of the testator was that in case of the death of Emma E. Graber it should go to her children share and share alike, or in case she should die without issue that then the executors were to divide this money among his own brothers and sisters and the brothers and sisters of his wife. To hold, therefore, that she took an absolute gift would defeat the evident intention and purpose of the testator.</p>

If any part of said stock is remaining at her death or marriage it shall be distributed as is hereinafter provided in relation to my residuary estate.” In a subsequent clause of the will he declared that it was his intention that the housekeeper should have the use and enjoyment of his “house and lot, and everything therein contained, for and during all the time of her life she remains unmarried, and if she deems it necessary, may at any time or times use part or all of the principal of the bank stock for her support and maintenance.” It was held that the legatee was not enti<a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>tied to demand an absolute transfer to herself of all the bank stock; that she was only entitled to the bank stock if it appeared that through a deficiency of income a portion of the principal was necessary for her support and maintenance.</p>

Whatever was necessary for her support he intended she should share. If the income of the estate was sufficient to afford her a suitable maintenance, it was his intention that the principal should go, at her decease, to the children and grandson unimpaired. A construction of the privilege which makes it operate as an absolute gift to the wife of the residue of the estate would defeat the plain purpose of the testator, and take from the children and grandson .... that which he intended they should have at her decease.”</p>
