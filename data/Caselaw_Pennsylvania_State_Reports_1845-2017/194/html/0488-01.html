As the principal of the loan was reduced by the $1,650 payment from $6,050 to $4,400, the plaintiff proposed that he would take $100 of the interest money and add it to the principal, and thus make the whole amount of the loan an even $4,500. To this the secretary assented, and he thereupon gave plaintiff credit in his receipt book for the $100, and paid him the $13.85 in money. After that the principal of the loan was $4,500, and the annual interest at four per cent was $180, and this was paid in semiannual payments of $90.00, for which orders and checks were given as above stated, until May, 1895, when a whole year’s interest was due, for which an order and check were given as before, and the check was paid. In November, 1895, a similar order was given which was paid. The secretary about that time disappeared, and it was claimed that he was an embezzler of money of the defendant. The action is brought to recover the $4,500 of principal and interest from November 4, 1895. In every one of the orders given for payment of interest it was expressly stated in the order that it was for interest.</p>

To this the plaintiff replied that whether the secretary had such authority or not, the defendant did by numerous acts recognize, assent to and acquiesce in, the reception by the secretary, of the moneys loaned by the plaintiff, and was, therefore, bound to repay him the money claimed. In support of this contention it is claimed for the plaintiff that the defendant did receive, according to its own admission, $2,650, which was part of the money loaned, and thereby recognized his authority to receive it from the plaintiff; that it entered on his receipt book, where all his monthly payments on his twenty-five shares <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>of stock in the defendant company were credited, full credits for all of the sums of money loaned, to wit: on November 1,1890, $3,650, on November 10,1890, $2,400, and on May 4,1893, $100, and that these credits must have been seen at the times when his monthly dues were credited, by the officers who received them. Of these, Doerle was president, Knodel was treasurer, and Deutsch and Ziegler were directors, and for two years members of the auditing committee, and, therefore, the entries of the loans in such a book and in such circumstances,were evidence tending to show the assent of the company to the loans; that the minute book of the defendant company shows that during the whole five years orders were regularly directed to be issued by the directors to the appellee for interest due him on the money loaned, and one order for the payment of $1,650, part of the principal; that in actual fact such orders were regularly issued for the payment of sums of interest corresponding precisely with the amounts of interest due at the dates of the orders respectively, and that these orders were regularly signed by the president and secretary, and directed the treasurer to pay the various sums as interest due the'plaintiff, and that thereupon the treasurer did, in his capacity as such, pay to the plaintiff these various sums as interest on the moneys loaned; that the accounts and books of the association were examined and audited at the end of every year by a lawfully appointed auditing committee, and that the accounts showing these interest payments were approved by these auditing committees in each instance. In all these ways it was insisted for the plaintiff that the defendant association had assented to and ratified the acts of the secretary in receiving the wholé amount of the loans, and was therefore legally bound to repay him the entire sum of the loans with interest.</p>

The jury found for the plaintiff and thereby determined that the acts of the secretary were authorized and sanctioned by the defendant. It would have been grave error to have withdrawn the case from the jury. We are constrained to say that we do not see how any other verdict could have been properly rendered under all the evidence in the case. Above all other considerations the regular and constant, payment of interest on <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>tbe entire amount of the loans, which payments originated first in the action of the directors authorizing each payment as one of the regular expenditures of the association, and next, the issuing of the orders signed by the president and secretary and directed to the treasurer requiring him to pay the amount of the order to the plaintiff, and to pay it distinctively as interest, and continuing this course of procedure during a period of five years from the time the loans were made, constituted the very highest and most absolxrte recognition of and acquiescence in the act of the secretary in receiving the money loaned from the plaintiff. It is difficult to understand how the defendant could signify its consent to the fact of the loan and the manner in which it was made, more positively and emphatically than by these payments of interest, made with the knowledge and consent of the directors, the president, the secretary and the treasurer, in fact, all the controlling officials of the association. Moreover, it was inevitable that the plaintiff would be lulled thereby into the most abiding conviction of the acceptance of the loan by the defendant without any question whatever as to its integrity. All the other facts in evidence tended to confirm and to corroborate this conviction, and the plaintiff was therefore practically disabled from taking measures for his own protection, as he might have done had he known that there was the least objection to the validity of the loan. While the case was not tried upon the theory of estoppel, and such questions did not arise, it might well have been contended that the defendant could not be heard in repudiation of its liability in view of all the facts in evidence. The questions of fact involved were submitted to the jury upon the weight of the testimony, and in this there was no error. The assignments of error are all dismissed.</p>
