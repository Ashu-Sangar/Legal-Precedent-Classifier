If you decide under the rules of law which I have given you that the defendants’ account of the accident is correct, and that this little lad started from behind another wagon which he was holding on to, right into the wagon of the defendants, or one of the defendants, then, under the cases as they have been decided by the Supreme Court, the driver was not guilty of negligence, was guilty of no want of care under the circumstances ; if you come to that conclusion your verdict should be for the defendants. Do not misunderstand me ; I do not say your verdict should be for the plaintiff or defendants. I express no opinion about that; but if you believe the story of the defendants, as it was told, if you believe they told the truth, and that the little lad and his companion were hanging on, or had their hands on the tailboard of another wagon and darted from that in such a way against the wagon driven by one of these defendants and owned by the other, then the driver was not guilty of negligence : that is the law, and that is good common sense, for he would have had no opportunity to avoid the accident.] [25]</p>

The question of the defend<a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>ants’ alleged negligence was carefully and correctly submitted to the jury with instructions that the boy could not be held responsible for contributory negligence, and that if they found the defendants guilty of negligence which resulted in the plaintiff’s injury the verdict should be for the plaintiff. There certainly was very contradictory evidence as to the facts and circumstances of the accident, and it was the duty of the jury to decide between the conflicting statements of the witnesses. On this subject also the jury was correctly instructed. They found a verdict for the defendants and thereby necessarily found that the defendants were not guilty of negligence, and by this verdict, the court below and this Court are bound. In this view of the case the rejected questions submitted to the expert witness become entirely immaterial. If there was no negligence of the defendants it does not matter what the condition of the plaintiff ■was. The assignments of error to portions of the charge and to the answers to points are not sustained. The court was not in error in wliat was said in this connection. The assignments of error are all dismissed.</p>
