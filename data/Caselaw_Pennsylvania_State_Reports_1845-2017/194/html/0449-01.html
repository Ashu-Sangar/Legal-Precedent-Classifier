The courts do not grant an injunction when there is a doubt in their mind as to the right to do a certain thing. The defendant has sworn positively that he has no intention of doing that of which the bill complains, and he has stated through his counsel in court that he has no intention of doing it. In addition to that he says that he will give you <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>notice before he makes any attempt to do that of which you complain, sufficient notice for you to apply to the court to have it prevented.

On the hearing of the motion for an injunction considerable testimony was taken corroborative of the averments in the plaintiffs’ bill, but no testimony was presented on the part of the defendant, who rested his defense on bis answer and the oral statements of his counsel in court. The testimony introduced by the plaintiffs tended to show a material depreciation in the value of the property covered by their mortgage, and this depreciation was attributed by the witnesses to the digging of clay <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>and the construction of a brickyard thereon. Of course, excavations and constructions of this nature may materially detract from the security the mortgagee has if the property is located in a neighborhood suited to and intended for residences.</p>
    <p id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[212,590,1183,1329]]]'>In Martin's Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.%20490" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="9 A. 490">9 Atl. Rep. 490</a>, the vendor of the land received from the vendee a purchase money mortgage. The purchaser opened sand and stone quarries on the land, and the vendor filed a bill for an injunction to restrain the waste. The answer denied the quarrying and alleged the owner was grading the land to make it more valuable. The judge of the common pleas said: “ The defendant’s theory for the excavation upon the ground may be correct, but it is speculative, and he is unfortunate in being alone in his view of the improvement of the property thereby. In the eyes of others his excavations are waste. From this the mortgagee is entitled to protection until the defendant, by reducing the amount of the mortgage, or by some other satisfactory arrangement, has sufficiently secured the mortgagee from probable loss by his experiment.” The bill and application for injunction were sustained, and on appeal to this Court the decree Avas affirmed. In Righter v. Hamilton, 10 Pa. C. C. R. 260, the court granted the injunction upon the authority of Martin’s Appeal, supra, and said that “ opening and operating a new mine or clay pit upon property where none existed at the time the mortgage was created is waste as against the mortgagee. Equity Avill, by injunction, enjoin a mortgagor from committing waste on the mortgaged premises, at the suit of the mortgagee. The mortgagee is entitled to all the protection his pledge, unimpaired, gives him. ” The cases cited are referred to because they are, to some extent at least, analogous to the case under consideration.</p>

We are of the opinion, therefore, that the <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>bill should be reinstated, with leave to plaintiff to move for an injunction whenever the defendant disregards his avowed intentions in the premises.</p>
