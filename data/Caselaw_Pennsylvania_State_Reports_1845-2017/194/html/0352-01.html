Flinn to the property and improvements erected by him, and which in said proceeding were declared to be a public nuisance and ordered to be removed by him as such. The question raised and decided in the original proceeding was that the structure as built and used by defendant, under a lease from the city of Pittsburg, was in contravention of public right and illegal, and therefore should be removed; the councils having no authority to vest in him the exclusive right to use and occupy the landing for a term of years. The question now is, has the city the right to maintain this same structure, illegally erected by defendant, under and subject to its own authority as <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>supervisor and controller of tlio public river landings of the city? It is admitted by plaintiffs’ counsel that the case now, so far as the removal of the structure is concerned, is the same as though it had been erected originally by the city, and this is evidently a correct position, for equity will never compel the destruction of property which one owned and had a right to maintain and use in its present condition, simply because some other person who had transferred it to him had been guilty of an unauthorized act in its construction. The question then arises, has the city of Pittsburg authority to erect and maintain such a structure as the one erected by defendant, for the purpose now contemplated by the city ? In other words, is the structure and its proposed use by the city such a use of the public landing as is authorized by law?</p>

After the Supreme Court affirmed the decree of this court, that the structure erected by the defendant should be destroyed and removed, he has relinquished and transferred all his property, right and interest therein to the city of Pitts-burg, and the city, by ordinance approved January 17, 1899, accepted the dock or structure erected by him, for and on behalf of the city, “ to be thereafter held and used as and for a public landing or wharf, subject to the provisions of the ordinance by which the same was accepted, and such further regulations as may from time to time be ordained.” The 2d section of tlio ordinance provides that all persons desiring to use the said dock shall have the right to use the same for loading and unloading goods, wares and merchandise, subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the dock master, with the approval of the director of public works, and fixes rates of tolls. The 3d section provides for the care and management of the dock by creating the office of dock master, to have charge of the operation of the dock, the collecting of tolls fixed by the 2d section, ho being required to furnish at his own cost and expense all labor and machinery necessary or convenient for its operation, and to keep it in repair, etc., as the director of the department of public works shall from time to time direct.

The dedication was manifestly to facilitate commerce and the transfer of goods and merchandise between the river and the shore, and whatever will reasonably conduce to that end would seem to be incident to and inseparable from it. The manner of its use is not to be limited to the methods employed at the time of the dedication. They may and must change with the exigencies of commerce; new methods of transportation render new arrangements necessary to suit them; increased business requires increase of facilities ; unpaved and unwbarfed landings, which would be sufficient for a small trade, would be entirely unsuitable and insufficient for a large one. “ Public landings,” say the Su<a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>preme Court, in Commonwealth v.

St. Louis, 2 Dillon, 70. The question involved in that case was the right of the city of St. Louis to authorize the erection of a grain elevator and appurtenance on the Mississippi wharf, upon ground dedicated to public use for a wharf. Among other things he says : “ The dedication of the property was perpetual and for the benefit of the public. The extent of the dedication, its scope, remains the same, but the mode of using property dedicated for a wharf may change from time to time as the wants of commerce or the public requires, and this the dedicator is presumed to contemplate when he makes the dedication.” And again: “ A wharf is intended to afford conveniences for the landing of vessels, the loading and unloading of their cargoes, and to supply a place on which wares discharged from vessels or awaiting shipment may be laid or deposited, and it would seem that structures or appliances of any kind intended to facilitate the handling and preservation of merchandise arriving at the wharf erected under municipal control would be lawful and within the purpose for which wharf property was acquired or dedicated.” Proceeding then to consider the power of the city under its charter, “ to construct all needful improvements in the harbor, to erect, repair and regulate public docks and wharves, to charge and collect wharfage,” etc, which to make the most of it, confers no broader power than the act of 1836, wlierein it says: <em>“ </em>The said councils shall have full power to make such rules, regulations and laws regulating the use of said public landing as they may think proper and not inconsistent with existing laws,” he says: “ It will be perceived that there is no express legislative authority to the city to erect buildings, or authorize the erection thereof, upon the property known as the public wharf, and here the complainant takes the position <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>that, without direct legislative sanction, it is not competent for the municipal authorities themselves, or under an otherwise unobjectionable ordinance, to authorize the erection of an elevator building upon the wharf, to be used for handling grain arriving at or to be shippéd from it. . . . The argument is that the occupation of it by a permanent structure of any kind is an unauthorized use of the property; in other words, it is insisted that it is a perversion of the use for which the property was acquired or dedicated, to allow the erection thereon of an elevator to facilitate the receipt and shipment of grain in bulk at the wharf, and consequently such a structure would be a public nuisance. This makes it necessary to consider what are the legitimate uses of property dedicated for a public wharf. Clearly it was to make provision that rafts, boats and vessels of all kinds could effect a landing in front of the city and have a place upon which to discharge or from which to receive wares, merchandise and cargoes of all description. This was to be done upon the bank or margin of the river, which, whether improved or not, was compendiously styled the public wharf. .... The city is authorized to regulate the public wharf. Its right to appropriate different parts of the banks, called the wharf, to different uses of a proper character, admits of no doubt.” This case so fully covers the case in hand that further excerption therefrom becomes unnecessary and wearisome. The same question is discussed in Barney v. Keokuk, <a href="/us/94/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="94 U.S. 324" data-case-ids="5647066" data-case-paths="/us/94/0324-01">94 U. S. 324</a>, by the Supreme Court of the United States, and the doctrine expressed by Judge Dillon fully approved. The same conclusion is arrived at in Belcher Sugar Refining Co. v. St. Louis Grain &amp; Elevator Co., <a href="/mo/101/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="101 Mo. 192" data-case-ids="566976" data-case-paths="/mo/101/0192-01">101 Mo. 192</a>, where the opinion of Judge Dillon, in 2 Dillon, 70, is cited and approved.</p>

It will be observed that in the cases above cited the word “ wharf ” is used, while in the act of 1836 the dedication is for a “ public <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>landing,” and it is urged that the term “ landing ” does not comprehend a “wharf,” and that therefore the cases cited do not properly apply to this case. It is undoubtedly true that a landing does not necessarily include a wharf, but the difference is simply that a wharf is an improved landing, and no less a landing because it is a wharf. Were this not so, the improvement of a mere landing, so as to give it the actual character of a wharf, would be prevented and rendered unfit to meet the emergencies of commerce and destroy the very object of its dedication. We are therefore of opinion that the order that defendant destroy and remove the structure called a dock in his answer, should not be enforced against the city of Pittsburg, but that the defendant should pay all the costs of the original bill and also of this proceeding.</p>
