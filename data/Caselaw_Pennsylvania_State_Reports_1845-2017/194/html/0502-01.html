I admit it was a mistake, but I did not mean to do any harm. I innocently sent that notice out to Mr. Stroud and his customers. I thought I had the right to do it, in other words, but I find out now I am mistaken.” Well, what does that amount to? What does that amount to as a defense ? Why, it amounts to this : If you believe that — if you believe Mr. Smith, when he sent out those notices did not know that his patent was run out — believed that his patent was in existence, and did this in good faith, then you can only give Mr. Stroud what he actually lost by reason of Mr. Smith’s conduct. But the plaintiff says that that is not the truth — that Mr. Smith says he sent that notice out by mistake — that is not the truth — and he calls your attention, through his counsel, to a number of things which he says ought to convince you that Mr. Smith did not make any mistake about it; that he did it on purpose; that he knew that he had no right to send that notice out, but he did it for the purpose of stopping Mr. Stroud’s trade, and amongst other Things he calls your attention to the fact that he never contra-<a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>dieted it; that although he says he did, he never did; that he never wrote to them and said he had made a mistake. In other words, he kept on letting the fruit of his bad work grow, and ho kept on letting it work its mischief to Mr. Stroud, and never corrected it; and that is one evidence that he did not make any honest mistake about it. In other words, they ask you to believe that Mr. Smith never did do this honestly, but he did it for the purpose of driving Mr. Stroud out of the market, and those letters, they say, show that to you — his constant threats and the threats of his lawyers — and they show to you that it is further shown by the tags on the table covers.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b527-5" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[200,940,1178,1492]],["BL_528.1",528,[267,386,1179,98]]]'>Now, you will pass upon that, and I think, gentlemen, if you want to dispose of this case scientifically, that is, get at it in the best possible way for yourselves, you will take up that question first, and when you go out you will say, “ Now let us settle this thing. Did Smith do this for the purpose of hurting Stroud, when he knew he had no right to do so ? ” To use a common expression, “Was this a bluff on his part to keep Stroud from manufacturing these table covers, or did he do it out of an honest mistake? Was this a mistake?” Take up that question and examine that first. Examine all the testimony on the subject, all that they did. Look at their letters and everything, and if you come to the conclusion that it was an honest mistake; that he did not do it out of any malice or any contemptible spirit to drive a competitor out of the business, but that he did what he really thought he had a right to do, then the measure of damages, which I will allude to a little further on, in such a case, is only what Mr. Stroud lost. But if you come to the conclusion that it was not a mistake ; that he knew before, and was doing it for the purpose of injuring Mr. Stroud in his business and driving him out of the market as a competitor, and that when he said, “ My patent is still in existence,” he knew it was not; in other words, that it was a malicious, fraudulent thing on his part, then Mr. Stroud is entitled to more than he actually lost, because you would have a right to say, “We will do more than compensate Mr. Stroud. We will punish Mr. Smith for such an outrage as that.” You would have a right to believe, if you think it was done to injure another man in business — you would have a right to add to the actual damage such an amount as would make him smart <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>for such kind of conduct, — what is called smart money; that is, damages to punish him.</p>

After you have settled it one way or the other, you will come to the question of what the measure of damages should be, as I have already alluded to. If you come to punitive damages, there is no measure for them. It is just what you think the circumstances require as a punishment for such a wrongful act. But if you do give punitive damages in any respect, Mr. Stroud would be entitled to what he has lost. Well, what has he lost? Well, he says he has lost a good many items.' But you are not bound by what he says on the subject. You are to take his own judgment on the subject. He says, “I lost sales by reason of the fact that my customers were notified that they would buy a lawsuit if they bought the table covers, and that, therefore, they would not buy them.” Now, is that the reason? He says he did not sell them. Was the notice the reason ? If it was, then that is an element which ought to be considered. If you believe it was the condition of the market, or that the peacock pattern had played out and was not in demand any more, and that that was the reason they were not selling them, or that times were hard and people were not buying them as freely as they had done, then that would be considered by you. If the stuff of which these covers are made — that is the material in its crude state, in its state of yarn and chenille — was especially prepared for these table covers and could not be used in that condition for anything else, but had to be redyed or other money spent on them to put them into condition to use in something else, if that was made necessary by reason of the stories Mr. Smith was circulating about Mr. Stroud, that must be paid for. If the table covers you believe he knew was on hand he would have sold, if it had not been for Mr. Smith, you ought to give him the profit that he would have made on them. You ought not to give him that which has been calculated in one estimate here what all those things cost, because that is giving him the penny and the cake, too, for Mr. Stroud has the table covers, and he must not be paid the whole thing, for the table covers and yet keep the table covers. If he had given the table covers to Smith, or gone out into the market and said, “I had to sell them at auction,” <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>there would have been something to go on in that respect. Therefore, the only thing to be considered is how many more table covers would he have sold if it had not been on account of this notice, and how much profit would have been made on them. How much other yarn, how much other material that he had to spend so much more money on to make it usable in some other way, and even when it was so treated, if it was depreciated in value, that is also to be considered. Take every element of the loss that is directly traceable to the act of Smith, and charge it against him, because he must pay any damage that his act has caused, even if it was an innocent act. I mean by that an act not intended to injure, but if he made a mistake. A man cannot make a mistake and say, “ Oh, well, I made that mistake; 1 beg your pardon. I didn’t mean to break your hat. I just trod on it and mashed it,” and say, “ I beg your pardon,” and call it square. He has got to pay for your hat. And so here, if he has injured Mr. Stroud, he must pay for it.</p>

Well, I do not think that that, gentlemen, relieves Mr. Smith in any way at all. If a man calls me a thief and circulates it around among other people that I am a thief, the fact that I know I am not does not relieve him at all. If he has injxrred mo in the estimation of other people, if other people won’t trust me because he calls me a thief, the fact that I know that I am not a thief does not relieve him of the consequences of what he said. So, if Mr. Smith, when he circulated that report around that Stroud was infringing on his patent, injured Stroud’s business, he must pay the consequences, whether Stroud knew it was true or whether he knew it was not; and even if the customer knew it was not true, it does not make any difference. Even if the customer said, “ I know it is not true, but I don’t intend to take chances of a lawsuit. I <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>am not going to take chances of defending a patent suit, and therefore I will not deal in this thing; ” if the remark of Mr. Smith drove that customer away he must pay all the consequences.</p>

It is admitted that the statement was false, the appellants’ patent having expired at that time; and the jury have found that the /notices were malicious, at least in the legal sense, that the appellants had no reasonable ground to believe them to be true at the time they issued them. Under these circumstances they were clearly liable to punitive damages” if the jury should find, as under the evidence they might, that there was not only legal malice, but an actual malicious intent to injure.</p>
