He gave this receipt because the defendants refused to pay any more money without it. He must be assumed to have received the money upon the express condition that it was in full of all demands. He signed it with his eyes open, -without any fraud, artifice, mistake or imposition practiced upon him, and he is consequently bound by it. The assignments of error are all dismissed.\nJudgment affirmed.",

T., 1899, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1898, No. 180, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nJanuary 29, 1900:\nBefore Green, C. J., McCollum, Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown and Mestrezat, J J.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit for work and labor done.\nAt the trial it appeared tliat plaintiff claimed for work done and materials furnished for the building of six walls at the House of Correction. The defendants who were the contractors with the city denied their liability. They also showed that after the work was completed plaintiff sent a bill to them for $8,990.50. He subsequently called upon W. A. Hurlock, and requested payment of the bill. Mr. Hurlock wrote at the foot of the bill the words \u201c received payment in full of all demands,\u201d and offered to pay the amount of the bill if plaintiff would sign the receipt, but refused to make payment unless the receipt was signed. Plaintiff at first refused but subsequently accepted the money and signed the receipt, stating, however, as he did so, that he waived no right.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was the refusal of the court to take off the nonsuit.\nJoseph R. Embery, with him S. Walter Foulkrod, for appellant.\nFrank P. Prichard, with him James Wilson Bayard and John G. Johnson, for appellees.\nThe receipt was conclusive: Rhoads\u2019s Est., 189 Pa. 460; MacDonald v. Piper, 193 Pa. 312."
