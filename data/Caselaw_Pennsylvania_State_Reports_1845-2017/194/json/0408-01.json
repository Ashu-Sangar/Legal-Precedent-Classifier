T., 1899, by defendants, from decree of C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., June T., 1894, No. 1702, on bill in equity.\nBefore Green, C. J., McCollum, Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown and Mestrezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for partition. McCarthy, J., filed the following opinion:\nEINDINGS OE EACTS.\nThe following facts are clearly established by the bill, answer and proofs, namely:\n1. John II. Palethorp, of the city of Philadelphia, at the time of his decease, was seized in his demesne as of fee of fourteen parcels of real estate situate in the city of Philadelphia and state of Pennsylvania, and of one additional parcel of real estate situate in Bucks county, Pennsylvania, all of which are correctly described in plaintiff\u2019s bill filed in this cause.\n2. John H. Palethorp died in November, 1860, having first made his last will and testament in writing, which was dated July 28, 1858, and was duly proved before the register of wills of Philadelphia county on January 7, 1861, and remains of record in the office of the said register.\n3. The said will of John H. Palethorp, deceased, contains, inter alia, the following provisions:\n\u201c Item: I give, devise and bequeath unto my beloved wife all the bonds and other dividends, incomes of my real and personal estate, so long as she remains my widow, to be applied by her to the support of herself, and the support, maintenance and education of my children during their minority, and whatever she may save out of the same, giving the said children a proper support and education, I give unto her for her sole and separate use and benefit to do with as she chooses. . . .\n\u201c Item : I give and bequeath to each of my children, after my said wife\u2019s death, their entire share of my whole estate for their own sole and separate use with the exception of twenty thousand dollars worth of property of each of my children\u2019s share. The said twenty thousand dollars they are only to receive the interests and incomes arising from such, as it is my will the principal of said twenty thousand shall be entailed on each of my children and their legal heirs, and if either of my children die without lawful issue, then his or her share reverts back again to my estate, and becomes a part of said estate, and is to be equally divided, the same as the other, amongst all of my surviving children.\u201d\n4. The said John H. Palethorp left surviving him a widow, Angelina Palethorp, and seven children, namely: Robert, Angelina W., Caroline A., Edward J., John H., Charles F. and Henry B. Palethorp.\n5. After the decease of the said John II. Palethorp, his widow, the said Angelina Palethorp, became seized in her demesne as of fee of a certain parcel of real estate, situate in Philadelphia county aforesaid, correctly described in paragraph three of the aforesaid bill.\n6. The said Angelina Palethorp died on July 18, 1877, having first made her last will and testament in writing, dated August 80, 1873, which was duly proved before the register of wills of Philadelphia county aforesaid on October 12, 1877, and remains of record in the office of the said register.\n7. The said will of Angelina Palethorp, deceased, contains, inter alia, the following provision:\n\u201c Item: I give and bequeath to each of my children their entire share of all my real estate, city and country, all of my bank stock or stocks of any kinds, dividends on said stocks, mortgages and ground-rents and money on hand, to be equally divided share and share alike for her and his own separate use.\u201d\n8. The said Angelina Palethorp left to survive her seven children, being the same seven persons named in the fourth finding of fact, supra, as the children of John H. Palethorp, deceased.\n9. The said John H. Palethorp (the younger) died December 20, 1884, intestate, unmarried and without issue.\n10. The said Angelina W. Palethorp intermarried with Joseph Hey after the decease of her father, and died April 20, 1892, without issue, leaving to survive her her husband, the said Joseph Hey, having first made her last will and testament in writing, which was dated April 25, 1883, and was duly proved before the register of wills of the county aforesaid on May 3, 1892, and remains on record in the office of the said register.\n11. The said last will of Angelina W. Hey, deceased, contains, inter alia, the following provisions:\n\u201cFourth. I also give and devise unto my husband, Joseph Hey, all my real estate for his own use, benefit and enjoyment during his life, and after my husband\u2019s death I give and devise my said real estate in the manner following, namely: One fourth (!) part thereof to my said sister, Caroline A. Palethorp, her heirs and assigns forever, and the remaining three-fourths (|) parts thereof I give and devise unto my five brothers\u2014 Robert Palethorp, John H. Palethorp, Edward J. Palethorp, Charles F. Palethorp and Henry B. Palethorp, in equal parts and shares, their heirs and assigns forever.\u201d\n12. The said Edward J. Palethorp intermarried with the plaintiff in October, 1892, and died on July 1, 1893, intestate and without issue, leaving to survive him his widow, Harriet Palethorp, the said plaintiff.\n13. The said Charles F. Palethorp died on July 10, 1893, intestate, unmarried and without issue.\n14. The three remaining children of the said John H. and Angelina Palethorp, namely, Robert, Henry B. and Caroline A. Palethorp, are still living.\n15. Since the present proceeding for partition was begun, the brick messuage and lot on the south side of Library street, between Fourth and Fifth streets, described in the bill filed in the cause as No. 4 of the first article, has been conveyed to a purchaser, all the parties, plaintiff and defendant in this action, uniting in the deed of conveyance.\nFINDINGS OF LAW.\n1. By the provisions of his will (see third finding of fact) John H. Palethrop devised to his wife the income of his real estate during widowhood, and gave to each of his children, after his said wife\u2019s death, an equal share of his whole estate for such child\u2019s own sole and separate use. This devise, without more, would under the statute of April 8,1833, section 9, have passed to each child a fee simple in the testator\u2019s real estate, but the generality of the devise is subject to two exceptions.\nThe first is contained in the following language: \u201c With the exception of $20,000 worth of property of each of my children\u2019s share. The said $20,000 they are only to receive the interests and incomes arising from such, as it is my will the principal of said $20,000 shall be entailed on each of my children and their legal heirs.\u201d So far as this exception may refer to real estate of the testator, these words imply a gift of the land for life, a devise of the income of land being a devise of the land itself for so long a time as the profits of the land are given: France\u2019s Est., 75 Pa. 220. The clear intent of the testator is, therefore, to make a gift of such lands as may be embraced within this exception to his child for life, with remainder to such child\u2019s legal heirs in tail. By virtue of the provisions of the act of April 27, 1855, this was converted into an estate in fee simple in the first taker, the child of testator.\nThe second exception to the general devise in the will of John H. Palethorp, above referred to, is in the following words: \u201c And if either of my children die without lawful issue, then his or her share reverts back again to my estate and becomes a part of said estate, and is to be equally divided, the same as the other, amongst all of my surviving children.\u201d The words \u201c die without lawful issue \u201d are susceptible of only two relations, they either relate to and provide for the case of the death of the child in the lifetime of the testator, or to an indefinite failure of issue after the decease of the testator. If they were intended to relate to the death of the child during the testator\u2019s lifetime, then, as all of the children survived the testator, the exception has no effect to cut down the fee simple previously devised. If, as in view of the whole instrument is more probable, they were intended to refer to an indefinite failure of issue after the death of the testator, then the clear effect of the words is to cut down the fee simple previously devised to the child into a fee tail, which estate, however, by the provisions of the act of April 27, 1855, already referred to, was enlarged to a fee simple: Robinson\u2019s Estate, 149 Pa. 418. The necessary conclusion is, that each of the seven children of John H. Palethorp, upon the death of Angelina Palethorp, became seized of a vested interest in fee simple in and to one full equal undivided seventh part of all the real estate of the said John H.-Palethorp, which is the subject of partition in the present proceeding.\n2. Under the provisions of the will of Angelina' Palethorp, and the act of assembly, of April 8, 1833, section 9, relating to wills, each of her children became seized of a vested interest in fee simple, in and to one full, equal, undivided seventh part of the lot and messuage on the north side of Arch street, east of Twentieth street, also the subject of partition in the present proceeding.\n3. Upon the death of John H. Palethorp, his undivided interest in all the real estate, the subject of partition herein, under the provisions of the act of April 8,1833, relating to intestates, descended to and vested in his six surviving brothers and sisters in fee simple in equal shares as tenants in common.\n4.
