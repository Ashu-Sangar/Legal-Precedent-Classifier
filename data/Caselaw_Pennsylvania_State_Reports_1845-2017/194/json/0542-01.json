It was placed within four inches of the curb, and was of the ordinary diameter. As fire plugs are a clear public necessity, and cannot be placed in the open highway, and as they must be placed in such a position as to bo easily accessible in case of fire, there is no other position for them but on the sidewalks, and it is the universal practice to locate them there. The municipality is the sole authority to determine this matter, and, of course, as we have frequently held, their discretion is not to be held subject to the verdicts of juries. The city is under no legal obligation to light its streets, and cannot be held responsible for an alleged insufficiency of light. This whole subject has been so recently considered in the exhaustive opinion of our Brother Dean in the late case of Canavan v. Oil City, 183 Pa. 611, that no further discussion of it is required.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Walter J. Horner and Ella W. Horner, Appellants, v. The City of Philadelphia.\nMunicipalities \u2014 Discretionary power \u2014 Position of fire plug \u2014 Negligence.\nA municipality has the discretionary power to locate a fire plug on a sidewalk, and if, in the exercise of such discretion, it places a plug of ordinary diameter on a sidewalk four inches from the curb, it cannot be made liable for personal injuries to a pedestrian who stumbles over the plug.\nMunicipalities \u2014 Lighting streets \u2014 Negligence.\nA municipality is under no legal obligation to light its streets, and cannot therefore be held responsible for an alleged insufficiency of light.\nArgued Jan. 16, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 215, Jan. T., 1899, by plaintiffs, from order of C. P. No. 2, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1897, No. 919, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Green, C. J., Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown and Mestrezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Pennypacker, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that Mrs. Horner, on the evening of August 27, 1897, fell over a fire plug on the sidewalk of Worrell street in the city of Philadelphia. The plug was situated about four inches from the curb, and was of ordinary diameter. The testimony for the plaintiff tended to show that the fire plug, a telegraph pole and a gas lamp were directly in line with each other, so that the telegraph pole caused a shadow to fall upon the space where the fire plug was situated. There was evidence that several other persons had fallen over the plug.\nFebruary 5, 1900 :\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was the order of the court.\nLincoln L. Eyre, for appellants.\nIt was incumbent upon the city to prove, if it could, not only that the fire plug was a necessary obstruction, as located at that particular place, but also that the dangerous location of the gas lamp was necessary, and that sufficient light had been provided: Carr v.
