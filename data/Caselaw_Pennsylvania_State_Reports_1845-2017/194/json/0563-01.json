Roberts Company.\nNegligence \u2014 Master and servant \u2014 Fellow-servant\u2014Boss.\nThe boss of a gang of reamers in a bridge shop of iron works is a fellow-servant of the workmen, and if one of the workmen be killed by the negligent action or orders of the boss, no recovery can be had against the employers.\nArgued Jan. 18, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 366, Jan. T., 1899, by defendant, from order of C. P. No. 4, Phila. Co., June T., 1898, No. 554, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Green, C. J., Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown and Mestrezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for death of plaintiffs\u2019 son.\nAt the trial it appeared that Robert Duncan, a workman of defendant, twenty years old, lost his life on April 4, 1898, by the fall of a pile of iron pillars and columns in defendant\u2019s bridge shop. The evidence did not show that the shop was inadequate, or was unduly crowded. The gang of workmen in which the deceased worked was under the direction of the boss of the reamers. The evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs tended to show that the accident was caused by the negligent actions and orders of the boss.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nGeorge Thorn Hunsicker, with him Joseph W. Hunsicker and Charles Hunsicker, for appellants.\nFebruary 5, 1900:\nRichard P. White, for appellee."
