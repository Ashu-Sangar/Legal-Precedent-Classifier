        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nThe language of the will is \u201cit is my desire that my daughter Gertie Beilstein shall receive the income of my property .... as long as she lives, but .should she die without leaAdnga family \u201d then over to testator\u2019s brothers and sisters, the appellants.\nThe gift of the income is the gift of the land itself: Drusadow v. Wilde, 63 Pa. 170; Curry v. Patterson, 183 Pa. 238. In the former case it is said by Sharsavood, J.: \u201cThere is no construction of words older and better settled than that a grant or devise of the profits of land passes the land itself, \u2018for what* says Lord Coke, \u2018 is the land but the profits thereof, for thereby vesture, herbage, trees, mines and all Avhatever parcel of the land doth pass.\u2019 Co. Litt. 4, 6.\u201d\nThe devise over in case Gertie should die \u201c Avithout leaving-a family \u201d is an implied devise to her family if she should leave one. It is only if she does not, that the devise over is to take effect, and there is a necessary implication that in the other unexpressed contingency of her leaving a family the estate is-to go to them. This is practically assumed Avithout question in the long line of cases on the subject, which are carefully-reviewed in Seybert v. Hibbert, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 537. The contest in all of them has been whether the devise over was upon a definite or an indefinite failure of issue.\nThe present case, therefore, turns on the meaning to be given to the word family in the testator\u2019s intent. Family is not a technical word, nor can it be given any technical meaning, irrespective of the context and scope in which the testator used it. It is conceded that it includes children, and the appellant\u2019s contention is that it means children only. But it is a broader word than children. In a very common, if not the most usual sense, it includes all the persons of the same blood who are dwelling together in one household, and in many cases even the condition of the same blood is not requisite, and servants and others may be included, as for instance, for the service of process. As already said, it is admitted that the testator by the word family meant to include children. If the devisee had been married, and with children and grandchildren all dwelling with her as part of her household, when the testator wrote his will, there could be no doubt whatever that the testator if he had then used the word family meant to include them all. But on what ground shall we assign it a narrower meaning when used with reference to the indefinite future ? When he wrote his will his daughter was a child of ten years, and he was providing for her in her unknown circumstances after his death. He foresaw that if she lived to grow up she might marry and have children, and he meant to provide for them as well as for her. Even the word children may be construed to include grandchildren if it clearly appears that it was used with that intent: Eichelberger\u2019s Est., 5 Pa. 264. Had the testator used the word children, and his daughter had survived all her children and died leaving grandchildren only, it hardly admits of doubt that the true construction of his intent would have included them. But he used a more comprehensive word than children, a word that would certainly have included grandchildren and remoter descendants if in existence then, and we see no reason to exclude them from his meaning, though children and grandchildren were then all alike only in posse. The natural scope of the word family in this connection is shown by Justice Bell\u2019s use of it in the opinion in Eichelberger\u2019s Est., supra: \u201c It is plain that when preparing his will (the testator) had in his mind\u2019s eye all his family consisting- of his immediate descendants then hving.\u201d\nWe are, therefore, clearly of opinion that by the words \u201cdie without leaving a family \u201d the testator meant die without issue or heirs of her body, and under all our cases this refers to an indefinite failure of issue, which creates a fee tail in the first taker, enlarged to a fee simple by the statute. Judgment, therefore, was properly entered for defendant.\nJudgment affirmed.",

T., 1899, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny County, April T., 1899, No. 661, on case stated.\nBefore Green, McCollum, Mitchell, Fell and Brown, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated in an action of ejectment.\nFrom the case stated it appeared that the property in controversy passed under the will of George P. Beilstein, the material portion of which was as follows :\n\u2022 \u201c It is my desire that my daughter Gertie Beilstein shall receive the income of my property, known as the old Seaton house, situate at No. 34, Diamond square, Pittsburgh, as long as she lives, but should she die without leaving a family, then the property is to fall into the hands of my brothers and sisters or their heirs, and my executors to allow my daughter $25.00 per month until she reaches the age of 21 years.\u201d\nOn January 18, 1899, said Gertie Beilstein died unmarried and without issue, leaving a will by which she devised said property to the defendant, who was her mother. The plaintiffs are the brothers and sisters of the testator, George P. Beilstein, deceased.\nThe defendant refused to deliver possession of the property to the plaintiffs, and, after argument, the court in an opinion by Sharer, J., entered judgment for defendant.\n.Error assigned was the judgment of the court.\nArchibald H. Rowand, with him Harry H. Rowand, for appellants.\nThe testator clearly meant children when he used ihe word \u201cfamily:\u201d Daley v. Koons, 90 Pa. 248.\nThe testator\u2019s daughter, Gertie, died unmarried and without issue, and the question is, who are the persons entitled to the remainder as the right heirs of the testator. His brothers and sisters were the remainder-men, and their right to the remainder was only prevented from being an absolute interest by the possibility of a child of Gertie Beilstein coming into esse and surviving her: Buzby\u2019s App., 61 Pa. 114; Etter\u2019s Estate, 28 Pa. 881; Riehle\u2019s App., 54 Pa. 97; Powell v.

'\nThe courts have seized with avidity on any circumstance, however trivial, denoting an intention to fix the contingency at the time of the death: Seibert v. Butz, 9 Watts, 490; Snyder\u2019s App., 95 Pa. 174; Eiehelberger v. Barnitz, 9 Watts, 447; Miller\u2019s Estate, 145 Pa. 561.\nThe word \u201cfamily,\u201d in \u00e1 will is held prima facie to mean children, and must be so construed unless some reason appears in the context of the will for extending or altering it : Whelan v. Reilly, 3 W. Va. 597; Pigg v. Clarke, L. R. 3 Ch. D. 672; Gregory v. Smith, 41 Eng. Chan. Rep. 708; Raynolds v. Hanna, 55 Fed. Rep. 783.\nUnless the contrary clearly appears from the context of a will, a devise to the family of a person who has children is a devise to such children: Heck v. Clippenger, 5 Pa. 385; Wood v. Wood, 3 Hare, 65; Burt v. Hellyar, L. R. 14 Eq. 160; Gregory v. Smith, 41 Eng. Chan. Rep. 708; Barnes v. Patch, 8 Ves. 604; MacLeroth v. Bacon, 5 Ves. 159; Blackwell v. Bull, 1 Keen, 176.\nJ. W. Kinnear, for appellee.\nBy the gift of the income of lands the corpus of the estate passes: Drusadow v. Wilde, 63 Pa. 170; Wilson v. McKoehan, 53 Pa. 78; Seybert v. Hibbert, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 537; Grimes v. Shirk, 169 Pa. 74.\nThe word \u201cfamily\u201d does not describe children. It is a nomen collectivum; it is not a descriptio personarum; and standing alone, as it does here, it would not be a sufficient description of persons to enable her children to take as purchasers: Findlay v. Riddle, 8 Binn. 189; Yarnall\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 335; Williams v. Williams, 1 Simons (N. S.), 358.\nDecember 30, 1899:\nWhere a devise is of freehold estates the word \u201c family,\u201d it seems, is restricted to mean heirs at law, as in a devise to A. for life, with remainder to his family, A.\u2019s heir at law Avill be entitled under this description: Heck v.
