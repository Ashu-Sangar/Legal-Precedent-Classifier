        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 land through which the city opened streets in 1893 is part of a tract which was sold in 1848, in building lots, according to a plan made and recorded by the owner thereof. In the conveyances the lots were described as bounded by the streets now opened which were \u201claid down on a plan for the accommodation of these and other lots.\u201d In Quicksall v. Philadelphia, 177 Pa. 301, it was held that the sale and conveyance of the lots on this plan in 1848 operated as a dedication of the streets to public use, but that the owners of lots abutting on the streets could recover damages for the opening in 1893, because the limitation of twenty-one years, fixed by the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 173, within which the city could open streets without compensation, had expired.\nAt the trial of this case the city sought to evade the limitation of the act of 1889 by proof that a conveyance of the lots was made in 1880, in which they were described as lots marked on the plan referred to, made and recorded in 1848. This it was claimed was a new dedication, against which the limitation had not run. This claim cannot be sustained. The conveyance in 1880 was by a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale under a judgment against the grantee of the grantee of the person who, in 1848, had made the plan and sold according to it. The reference to the plan for convenience of description, and to the streets as boundaries, does not give rise to an implication of a new dedication of the land for streets. A dedication to the public use must rest on the intention or clear assent of the owner, and must be under such circumstances as to indicate an abandonment to the use of the community: Dovaston v. Payne, 2 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 154. The owner in 1880 had nothing to rededicate. The dedication in 1848 was binding on him, and continued so until the limitation of the act of 1889 relieved the land of the servitude imposed upon it.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

The City of Philadelphia, Appellant.\nRoad law \u2014 Opening streets \u2014 Limitation act \u2014 Act of May 9, 1889 \u2014 Dedication.\nWhere lots have been sold according to a recorded plan, the owner is entitled, under the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 178, to recover damages for the opening of an abutting street after the expiration of twenty-one years from the recording of the plan, and this right is not defeated by the fact that, in a conveyance prior to the expiration of twenty-one years, reference was made to the recorded plan and to the streets thereon, as such reference does not give rise to an implication of a new dedication of the land for streets.\nA dedication to the public use must rest on the intention or clear assent of the owner, and must be under such circumstances as to indicate an abandonment to the use of the community.\nArgued Jan. 4, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 110, Jan. T., 1899, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 8, Phila. Co., Dec. T., 1892, No. 1096, on verdict for plaintiffs.\nBefore Green, C. J., McCollum, Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown and Mestrezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from report of jury assessing damages for the opening of R\u00faan street, in the twenty-third ward.\nIn 1848, the land in question was a portion of the tract which was then laid out in lots and sold according to a plan made and recorded by the owner. In 1880, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors in title took a sheriff\u2019s deed for the land, which deed referred to the plan of 1848 and to the streets as boundaries. At the trial the defendant contended that the recital in the sheriff\u2019s deed gave rise to an implication of a new dedication of the land against which the limitation fixed by the act of May 9, 1889, had not run. The court refused to give binding instructions for defendant.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiffs for $2,900. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in not giving binding instructions for defendant.\nFebruary 5, 1900:\nE. Spencer Miller, assistant city solicitor, with him John L. Kinsey, city solicitor, for appellant,\ncited Quicksall & Lee v. Philadelphia, 177 Pa. 301, and Davis v. Clark, 106 Pa. 377.\nSamuel Wakeling, for appellees."
