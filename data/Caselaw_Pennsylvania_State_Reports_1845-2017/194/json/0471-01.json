        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nBy the contract between the parties, the appellant agreed \u201c to furnish all the labor and material necessary to do the paving on the Allegheny avenue bridge .... now in course of construction according to the city\u2019s specifications,\u201d etc., the appellees \u201cto furnish all blocks necessary for the work,\u201d and the agreement to apply only to the contract which plaintiffs, appellees, \u201c have with Jones, Pollard & Company for block pavement.\u201d\nThe question in dispute is whether the appellant\u2019s part under this contract included laying the foundation of bituminous concrete on which the granite blocks were to he laid. The learned judge at the trial, deeming the question not clear on the writing, left it to the jury.\nBoth parties are engaged in the general business of contracting for work on the city streets, and therefore must be presumed to have used the word \u201c paving,\u201d in its quasi-technical sense, as understood by contractors. The city\u2019s specifications in its contract with Jones, Pollard & Company, referred to by the parties in the contract now in suit, contain under the heading \u201c Paving,\u201d the clause, \u201c the entire steel deck of the driveway is to be prepared for paving by being covered with bituminous concrete, to adapt it to the surface of the street, with such variations in depth as may be necessary,\u201d and under a separate heading of \u201cNew Paving,\u201d the clause, \u201c upon the bituminous concrete, and bedded in fine Portland cement concrete, those portions of the driveway .... over the deck are to be paved with granite blocks,\u201d etc. These provisions make a clear distinction between preparing the driveway of the bridge for paving, by covering it with bituminous concrete, and the paving which was to be done with granite blocks laid upon the concrete. The plaintiffs were to furnish these blocks, and the agreement in suit was expressly limited to apply only to plaintiffs\u2019 contract with Jones & Pollard for the block pavement. Reference to this latter contract shows that it recognizes the two subjects as distinct, for it provides that McKay & Company (plaintiffs) \u201cwillat their own cost and expense construct .... granite block paving on bridge and approaches including the bituminous and cement concrete base,\u201d etc. But when plaintiffs made their agreement with appellant they did not follow the language of their contract with Jones, Pollard & Company, but limited appellant\u2019s work to the \u201cblock pavement\u201d for which they were to furnish the blocks.\nWe do not find, therefore, any serious difficulty in the contract, and it should have been construed-by the court as not including the bituminous concrete base for the block pavement.\nJudgment reversed.",

Before Willson, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the contract was in writing as follows:\n\u201c Philadelphia, August 13, 1895.\n\u201c This agreement made this day between Michael O\u2019Rourke, general contractor of Philadelphia, of the first part, and George McKay & Company, general contractors of the same city, of the second part, witnesseth: The party of the first part agrees to furnish all the labor and material necessary to do the paving on the Allegheny avenue bridge over Sixth street and approaches now in course of construction according to the city\u2019s specification for said bridge, for the sum of three dollars and fifty cents per square yard ($3.50) ; the party of the second part agrees to furnish all the blocks necessary for the work, payment to be made on completion of the work. This agreement applies only to the contract that George McKay & Company have with Jones, Pollard & Company for block pavement.\u201d\nJones, Pollard & Company had a contract with the city for the construction of a bridge at the intersection of Sixth street and Allegheny avenue, over the Richmond branch of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad. This contract, inter alia, provided, in the specification of work to be done, as follows:\n\u201c PAVING.\n\u201c Bituminous concrete. The entire steel deck of the driveway is to be prepared for paving by being covered with bituminous concrete, to adapt it to the surface of the street, with such variations in depth as may be necessary. . . .\n\u201c NEW PAVING.\n\u201cUpon the bituminous concrete,.and bedded in fine Portland cement concrete, those portions of the driveway of Sixth street and Allegheny avenue, occurring over the deck, are to.be paved with granite blocks, having all the joints filled flush with Portland cement grouting; the sidewalks bounding on the same to be paved with granolithic concrete.\u201d\nFebruary 5, 1900:\nJones, Pollard & Company made a contract with plaintiffs for the whole of this work. They in turn made the agreement sued on.\nEvidence was offered by plaintiff that this agreement included by its terms the work specified as \u201c bituminous concrete.\u201d Defendant offered evidence that it excluded this, and that it only applied to the work specified as \u201c new paving.\u201d The difference of cost in these different contentions was $6,000 and upwards. -\nDefendant declined to do this work, and he was sued for the difference which was expended by the plaintiffs.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiffs for $2,841.41. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in not instructing the jury that the clear interpretation of the agreement sued on, and of the specifications of the city for said bridge for the paving thereof, excluded the bituminous concrete or base, and that the verdict should have been for the defendant.\nDavid W. Sellers, for appellant.\nS. K. Louchheim, for appellees."
