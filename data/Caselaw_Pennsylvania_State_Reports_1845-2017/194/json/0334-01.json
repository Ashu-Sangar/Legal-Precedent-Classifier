What he did do was nothing more than the equivalent of such action on his part. The money having gone into his own account was subject to be drawn out upon his personal checks which the bank could not refuse to pay. The question is entirely different from the one which would arise if after the deposit was made it was claimed as money of the trust and the bank was notified of the claim before it was paid, but that is not this case.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Before Collier, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that in 1891, Theodore Doerflinger was administrator of the estate of John Wallace, deceased.\nHe was a depositor in the Diamond National Bank, having an individual account and also one as treasurer of the Modern Building & Loan Association. He had no account as administrator. In July and August, 1891, he received three checks for the estate of John Wallace, deceased, amounting to more than $9,000. The first two were checks made to his order as administrator; the third was indorsed to his order as administrator. He indorsed all three checks as administrator, deposited them in his individual account, and subsequently checked out the proceeds for his private purposes, with other moneys of h\u00eds own. He subsequently filed an account in which he admitted a large balance due by him to the estate. He died without having paid over this b\u00e1\u00a1lance, and the plaintiff was substituted as administrator in Iiis place. Plaintiff contended that the bank was liable for the whole of the proceeds of the checks which had been made payable to Doerflinger as administrator.\nThe court gave binding instructions for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was the instruction of the court.\nWilliam, Kaufman, with him J. B. Braddock, for appellant.\nWhere a party purchases trust property knowing it to be such from a trustee, in violation of the objects of the trust, courts of equity force the trust upon the conscience of the guilty party and compel him to perform it and to hold the property subject to it in the same manner as the trustee himself held it: 2 Story\u2019s Eq.
