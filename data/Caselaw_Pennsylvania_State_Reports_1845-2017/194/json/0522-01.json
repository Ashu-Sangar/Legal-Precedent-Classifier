        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThe plaintiffs declared in trespass for the unlawful entry with force and arms upon their premises and the tearing down of the party wall between their building and that owned by one of the defendants. The proofs utterly failed to sustain the averments of their declaration. They showed that the entry was for the purpose of placing supports under the floors of plaintiffs\u2019 building, and was made without objection by them, and that the removal of the wall was by direction of the building inspectors. There was not the slightest evidence that the work was done in an unskilful or negligent manner; that its completion was unnecessarily delayed, or that any injury or inconvenience was caused the plaintiffs, except such as was the unavoidable consequence of the exercise of a lawful right by the owner of the adjoining property. There was nothing to sustain a recovery on the ground on which the action was brought.\n\u25a0 Whether under this form of action a recovery could be had for the damages to the plaintiffs\u2019 property, which were not the result of negligence, and to what extent the liability of an owner who repairs or removes a party wall without negligence is enlarged by section 9 of the Act of June 8, 1898, P. L. 360, it is unnecessary to consider. The evidence as to the damage to the building was too vague and uncertain to warrant a finding for any amount for the plaintiffs. The witnesses were unable to state what part of the papering and painting of the building and the repairing of the roof afterward done by the plaintiffs was made necessary by the rebuilding of the party wall, or what their cost was.\nThe judgment of nonsuit was properly entered, and it is now affirmed.",

T., 1899, by plaintiffs, from order of C. P. No. 1, Pkila. Co., March T., 1899, No. 276, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Green, C. J., McCollum, Mitchell, Dean, Pell, Blown and Mestrezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for forcible entry and damage to building. Before Biddle, P. J.\nPlaintiffs averred in their statement that Weeks & Michael-sen, two of the defendants, contracted with Nathan Snellenburg, the other defendant, to alter and repair premises owned by him; that defendants, without authority \u201c and with force and arms entered upon plaintiffs\u2019 premises adjoining thereto, made a great noise and disturbance,\u201d tore down a party wall, erected shoring and scaffolding on plaintiffs\u2019 stairways, causing tenants to move out, and hindering the renting to other proposed tenants, which \u201c wrongful actions of the defendants \u201d caused \u201cdamages to the defendants\u201d and were \u201cagainst the peace of the commonwealth.\u201d\nAt the trial it appeared that the party wall had been condemned by the building inspectors; that to tear it down it was necessary to shore up the floors of plaintiffs\u2019 property which was done, and that the stairway being on the side of the party-wall was somewhat obstructed. There was no evidence that the work was unnecessarily delayed, or that it was done unskilfully or negligently, or that any injury or inconvenience was caused by the plaintiffs which could have been reasonably avoided.\nFebruary 5, 1900:\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nE. Cooper Shapley, for appellants.\nUnder the Act of June 8, 1893, sec. 9, P. L. 360, governing the erection of party walls, the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs for any injury they caused in changing the wall, whether negligent or not: Brooks v. Curtis, 50 N. Y. 639; Eno v. Del Yecchio, 6 Duer (N. Y.), 17; Potter v. White, 6 Bosw. (N Y.) 644; Scliile v. Brokhahus, 80 N. Y. 614; Jones on Easements, sec. 711; Bradbee v. Christ\u2019s Hospital, 4 Mann. & G. 741; Bower v. Peate, L. R. 1 Q. B. Div. 321; Percival v. Hughes, L. R. 9 Q. B. Div. 441.\nIt is the well settled law of this state that where there is any evidence in favor of the plaintiff upon which the jury could render a verdict in his favor a nonsuit should not be entered: Hineman v. Matthews, 138 Pa. 204.\nAlex. Simpson, Jr., of Simpson & Brown, for appellees.\nIn the absence of negligence, where no nuisance is created, there can be no damages for the performance of a legal work: Penna. R. Co. v. Lippincott, 116 Pa. 472; Penna. Coal Co. v. Sander-son, 113 Pa. 126.\nPlaintiffs here chose to plant themselves on the mistaken position that they could recover irrespective of negligence or wanton injury, and, erring in this, must bear the burden of that mistake: Strawbridge v. Phila., 2 Penny. 419."
