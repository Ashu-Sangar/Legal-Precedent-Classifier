Thompson and Bessie L. Thompson, his wife.\nWill \u2014 Devise\u2014Intestacy.\nTestator directed as follows: \u201cI further will and direct that my wife have the one-half part of my farm on which I now reside after the legacies are deducted, which amount to twenty-two acres, during her natural life, and at her death this portion shall be inherited by the surviving issue of my niece L., share and share alike. I will and direct that- my \u00f1iece L. have the remainder or residue of my farm on which I now reside, after the legacies above mentioned are deducted, during her natural life, and at her decease this portion shall be inherited by the surviving issue of my said niece L., share and share alike. I further will and direct that at the decease of my niece L., failing issue, my brother\u2019s children shall inherit the part of my farm in which I have given a life interest to my wife and to my niece.\u201d The \u201c legacies \u201d mentioned were three devises of land aggregating twenty-two acres. The whole will manifested a general intent to dispose of the entire estate. Several provisions of the will showed, that testator\u2019s wife and L. were the first objects of his bounty. The widow died before L. Held, that a proper construction of the will gave to L. any estate in the land intervening between the death of the widow, and the death of L., and that there was no intestacy as to such estate.\nArgued Nov. 3, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 190, Oct. T., 1899, by-plaintiff, from decree of O. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co., Dec. T.t 1898, No. 624, dismissing bill in equity.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for partition.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of Collier, J., which was as follows:\nThe bill in this case prays for partition of a tract of land in Mifflin township, Allegheny county, Pennsylvania.\nPlaintiff claims title as one of the heirs at law of Joseph Irwin, who died in 1881, having first made his last will, which after his death was duly proved and recorded. Plaintiff\u2019s title depends upon the construction of this will. He contends that there is an interest in the land, undisposed of, which fell to the heirs at law upon the death of the widow of Joseph Irwin, which occurred in 1898. The clauses of the will upon which this contention is based are as follows:\n\u201c I further will and direct that my wife have the one-half Q-) part of my farm on which I now reside, after the legacies are deducted, which amount to twenty-two (22) acres, during her natural life, and at her death this portion shall be inherited by the surviving issue of my niece Lucinda Woods, share and share alike. I will and direct that my niece Lucinda Woods have the remainder or residue of my farm on which I now reside, after the legacies above mentioned are deducted, during her natural life, and at her decease this portion shall be inherited by the surviving issue of my said niece Lucinda Woods, share and share alike. I further will and direct that at the decease of my niece Lucinda Woods, failing issue, my brother J. H. Irwin\u2019s children shall inherit the part of my farm, in which I have given a life interest to my wife, Susanna Irwin, and my niece Lucinda Woods.\u201d\nLucinda Woods is married to Smith W. Hill, but had not at the time of the widow\u2019s death, and has not now any children.\nIt is evident from the construction of the entire will that the testator did not intend to leave any part or interest in his property undisposed of. It is probable that the testator did not consider the contingency of the death of his wife in the lifetime of Lucinda Woods. But if the language of the will admits of a construction disposing of the entire estate, it should be so construed. Reading the clauses above quoted, we think the disposition of the entire estate is clear. Having given three pieces of the farm to a nephew and two nieces, in all twenty-two acres, he gives to his wife one half of the farm, after deducting these devises, called legacies, during her natural life, and at her death to the surviving issue of Lucinda Woods. In the devise to Lucinda Woods he does not limit her interest to the remaining one half, but gives to her the remainder or residue of his farm, after the legacies above mentioned are deducted. This undoubtedly gives to Lucinda Woods, not merely the residue of the land, but the remainder of the estate undisposed of, as she is given the remainder or residue of the farm; if the legacies mentioned refer to the twenty-two acres only, as contended by tbe learned counsel for plaintiff, it would cut up the entire interest of the widow, because, being the later clause in the will, it must be enforced against any prior inconsistent provision, which certainly the testator did not intend. We think that the proper construction of the words of the will give to Lucinda Woods any estate in the land intervening between the death of the widow and the death of Lucinda Woods. The other provisions of the will strengthen this view. The wife and Lucinda Woods are the first object of the testator\u2019s bounty. In the first clause of the will he gives to them his personal property, and provides for the payment of his debts, etc., by a mortgage of the coal. He gives to them the joint use of the house and barn, and in the last clause gives them the proceeds of the sale of the coal. It would be unreasonable to hold that after the death of his wife the heirs at law should be allowed to occupy the house and outhouses with Lucinda Woods. Such an arrangement would be inconvenient and could not have been contemplated.\nDecember 30, 1899:\nThese views of the case render it unnecessary to consider the effect of the use of the words \u201csurviving issue,\u201d and \u201cfailing issue \u201d upon the ultimate disposition of the property. It is clear that James H. Irwin, the plaintiff, has no present or prospective interest in the land, and cannot therefore maintain this bill for partition. The bill must be dismissed.\nAnd now, September 25, 1899, the bill in this case is dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff.\nError assigned was decree dismissing bill.\nW. B. Rodgers, with him Jno. O. Petty,\nfor appellant, cited Ross v. Drake, 87 Pa. 373.\nJ. McF. Carpenter, for appellees,\ncited Boies\u2019s Est., 177 Pa. 190."
