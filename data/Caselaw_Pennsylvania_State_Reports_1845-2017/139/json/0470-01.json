        "text": "Per Curiam:\nWe think the affidavit of defence was insufficient. Section 1, article X. of the constitution of the defendant corporation provides that a member of six months\u2019 standing shall be entitled to funeral benefits, if he is \u201c not more than three months\u2019 dues in arrears at the time of his death, the money to be paid to his nearest relative.\u201d John Sherry died on August 1, 1887. At that time, arrears were due for May, June, and July. The dues for August were not in arrear until August 2d, and at that time he was dead; 'so that, on August 1st, there were \u201c not more than three months\u2019 dues \u201d in arrears.\nIt was urged, however, that \u00a7 2, of article XIV., of the bylaws is in conflict with this view, in as much as it provides that \u201c any member becoming three months in arrears shall not be entitled to benefits, until eight weeks have expired from the time they settle up in full.\u201d If we concede there is a conflict between the constitution and by-laws, it does not help the matter ; for, in such case, the by-laws must yield to the constitution, which is the fundamental law of the corporation.\nThe further point was made that the plaintiffs\u2019 statement of claim does not show upon its face that they are entitled to recover, in this, that it does not aver that the decedent was unmarried, at the time of his death, and that he did not leave a widow and a child or children surviving him. What they do aver is that \u201cthe plaintiffs are the father and mother of John Sherry, deceased, and his nearest relatives.\u201d This we think sufficient. It makes out a prima facie ease, and the affidavit of defence does not allege that there is a wife or child living.\nJudgment affirmed.",

On August 1st, the date of the member\u2019s death, there were not more than three months\u2019 dues in arrears; and, conceding that the by-law quoted was in conflict with the provision of the constitution, the former must yield to the latter, the constitution' being the fundamental law of the corporation.\n2. The statement of claim, averring that the plaintiffs were the father and mother and nearest relatives of the deceased member, presented a prima facie case; and, in the absence of an averment in the affidavit of defence that the member left a widow, child, or children, it was sufficient for /judgment.\nBefore PaxsoN, C. J., Sterrett, Greeit, Clark, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 332 January Term 1890, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 379 September Term 1889, C. P.

When there are no relatives, the president, financial secretary, and treasurer shall take charge of the funeral.\u2019\n\u201cThe plaintiffs further aver that the said John Sherry, at the time of his death, had been a member of said union over six years, and had paid his dues up to and'ineluding the month of April, 1887; that he died on Monday, August 1, 1887; that Tuesday, August 2, 1887, was the first stated meeting of said union in August at which dues could have been paid, the regular stated meetings being held on Tuesday of each week; that, as appears from the above, the said John Sherry was \u2018not more than three mouths\u2019 dues in arrears at the time of his death,\u2019 \u201d etc., etc.\nThe defendant filed an affidavit of defence averring:\n\u201c That at the time of the death of the said John Sherry, on August 1, 1887, he was non-beneficial, having failed to pay his dues for the months of May, June and July, 1887; that the dues for each month are payable upon the regular stated-meeting nights of that month, said meetings being held, as provided by \u00a7 1, article XV. of the by-laws of defendant corporation, \u2018 on Tuesday evening of each week at 8 o\u2019clock; \u2019 and, having thus failed to pay the dues for the said months of May, June and July, 1887, and having died after the expiration of the said month of July, 1887, he was more than three months\u2019 dues in arrears, and therefore non-beneficial, as is provided by \u00a7 1, article X. of the constitution of the defendant corporation.\n\u201c And deponent also avers and says that, the said decedent having failed to pay his dues upon the last stated-meeting night of the month of July, 1887, for the said months of May, June and July, 1887, after the expiration of the said month of July, 1887, he could not become beneficial until eight weeks would expire from the time he would settle up in full, as provided by \u00a7 2, article XIY. of the by-laws of defendant corporation, viz.: \u2018 Any member becoming three months in arrears shall not be entitled to benefits, until eight weeks have expired from the time they settle up in full.\u2019 \u201d .\nOn February 8, 1890, a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, having been argued, was made absolute, without opinion filed, and judgment was entered for the plaintiffs for $115.50. Thereupon the defendant took this appeal, assigning the order making absolute the rule for judgment, for error.\nMr. Henry A.
