George Kline became dissipated, and, in 1888, his father had judgment entered on the note and an execution issued, upon which certain property, including the horses in dispute, was sold to George Keil. After that sale, George Keil turned the horses over to George Kline who continued in business as before. It did not appear that Karl Kline had anything to do with the arrangement between Keil and George Kline. Later, in 1888, Keil obtained judgment against George Kline, issued execution and caused a levy to be made thereon. Karl Kline paid the amount of Keil’s claim, and George Kline executed to the former a bill of sale of the property, but remained in possession of it as before. On June 1,1889, Karl Kline issued another execution upon his judgment and, on June 3d, the sheriff levied upon <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>the property, including the four horses, and, on June 10th, sold the same to a man named Fox, who was in the employ of Karl Kline and bought the property for him.

There was evidence tending to show, also, that about the same time, Karl Kline stated to the tax assessor, in the presence of Huffnagle, when required to make a return of his taxable property, that there was nothing due to him upon the judgment against his son.

I do not know whether there was any other property or not, but the value of the property is fixed, as far as this case is concerned, by the price paid at the sheriff’s sale. Ordinarily, that has nothing to do with the damages. The party who owns it is entitled to recover the full value of the property without regard to the price at which it was sold by the sheriff. But, in this case, it was bought in by the agent of the plaintiff, and therefore he did not lose his property; he got it all back; but he lost $521, the amount for which it was sold at the sheriff’s sale, and which he was compelled to pay the sheriff in order to get it back. ■So that, as far as this property is concerned, that is the measure <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>of damages, if the property was worth that much money.

After that sale it came back to George Kline from George Keil. He bought it at the sheriff’s sale ; it belonged to him; he had a right to do with it as he pleased, and he gave it to George Kline upon such terms as were satisfactory between them.

Upon that judgment he had a right to issue an execution and levy upon the property of George Kline, and he did so levy, and levied upon this property as the property of George Kline. Upon the next day the defendant, Huffnagle, issued an execution upon his judgment, and levied upon the same property as the property of George Kline, and I have some question in my mind as to whether the defendant is in a position, in view of those circumstances, to question the validity of the judgment of Karl Kline in this proceeding. But, in order that the question may be disposed of, I will say to you that he is, and will proceed to the consideration of the question as if there was no doubt upon that point.</p>

In that he was a trespasser, and is liable in damages to Karl Kline, unless Karl Kline’s judgment was fraudulent and absolutely void. When you come to that part of the case, the burden of proof shifts upon the defendants. (The plaintiff has made out a perfect title to the property, and he has shown a trespass by the levy and sale upon it, which makes out his case.) 3 Then it rests upon the defendants to show to you that that judgment upon which the plaintiff claimed title was a fraudulent one ; and it is not a mere suspicion that will justify you in finding it is fraudulent; judgments are too sacred for that. You must be satisfied, not beyond á reasonable doubt, but the testimony must be clear, satisfactory and convincing, and you must be clearly satisfied before you can find a verdict for the defendants, that the judgment upon which the property was sold to Karl Kline, that is, the plaintiff’s judgment, was fraudulent and void.] 8 Now, was it? Is there evidence to satisfy jmu of that ? If not, your verdict should be for the plaintiff for the amount of damages which he is entitled to receive.</p>

Karl Kline says there was nothing ever paid upon this note except what was made at the sheriff’s sale, and George says the same. There is evidence, on the contrary, tending tó show that this judgment had been paid and that it was kept alive for fraudulent purposes, and that, therefore, the sale was fraudulent and void. I say to you, for the purposes of this case, that if this note had been paid by George and was kept alive merely to use it for the purpose of transferring property, it would be a fraud, and the sale would be void.</p>

I do not remember whether Mr. Huffnagle said there was any special allusion made to the note or not, but he said that <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>was all he owed his father. Suppose he did; that would not conclude Karl Kline, unless he knew of it; it would be no evidence against him unless he knew it. It would affect the testimony of George, here, as to the fact that it was not paid, and that is all. But, even suppose Mr. Huffnagle had said that, or has stated exactly what was said, would it be reasonable for you to conclude that this judgment, which was left unsatisfied, was paid because George, under those circumstances, said it was ? He had reasons, possibly, at that time for making that statement that were not entirely proper.] 4</p>

He says that he said that to Mr. Credge, and that he made his statement under oath. Mr. Kline says that what he said was, that he had nothing to pay on it, because he had debts; that he owed debts more than what was coming to him, and that he thought he was not bound to pay taxes upon moneys that were due him when he was owing to other people. Now, you have a right to take all this explanation and the statements made as testified to by Mr. Huffnagle, which are denied, by both the Klines.] 5 George denies he made any such statement to him, as Mr. Huffnagle testifies to, and Karl Kline denies that there was any statement made about this note being paid. His statement is different from that of Huffnagle, but you take the testimony of Mr. Huffnagle and consider it in connection with the explanations and denials made by the Klines.
