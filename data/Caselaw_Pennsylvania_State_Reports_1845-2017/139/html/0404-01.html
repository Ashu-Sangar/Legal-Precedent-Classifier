M., the plaintiff, a farmer about twenty-eight years of age, started to drive to his home from Hay’s livery stable, Pittsburgh, in a light two-wheel cart, his route lying along Wabash Avenue, traversed by the two tracks of the defendant company. When he started, a horse-car of the defendant was in advance of him, going upon the right-hand track in the same direction. The plaintiff took the left-hand track, and drove along it for nearly 300 yards until he was about abreast of the car, when, seeing another car and a team approaching from the opposite direction upon the track he was pursuing, he attempted to pull over to the right-hand track, in front of the car he was passing, but at that instant the left wheel of his cart struck the end of a rail in the left-hand track, which had become loose and had sprung <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>out of place, described by tbe witnesses as bent up like tbe runner of a sled. The result was, that the plaintiff was pitched out of his cart to the right, falling under the horses attached to the ear on the right-hand track, and that car passed over him, breaking his leg in two places and otherwise injuring him. His cart being caught and held by the end of the rail, the harness upon his horse gave way, releasing the horse. There was testimony for the plaintiff to the effect that the gait at which he was driving was “ not very fast,” while testimony for the defendant tended to show that he was driving at “ a pretty smart trot; pretty fast.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[263,957,1166,848]]]'>The rail causing the accident had been observed during the morning of that day to be sprung out of place, its upturned end being then between two and three feet above the ground. About eleven o’clock an employee of the defendant company came along and spiked it down, but it did not long remain in place. After it again became loose, one or more cars passed over it, the weight of the car pressing it down as the wheels ran along it, and the rail, when released from this pressure, springing up farther than it had been before. A car passed along four or five minutes before the accident. The testimony was conflicting however, as to whether the rail was then in place. At the time the plaintiff approached it, its end was at a height' of between four and five feet above the ground. The plaintiff testified that he was keeping a lookout ahead along the track, but did not see the upturned rail. Other witnesses testified that it could easily be seen twenty-five or more feet away. The thickness of the rail was about half an inch.</p>

It is not sufficient to prove that the defendant company was guilty of negligence. [However gross the negligence of the defendant, in a case of this hind, the plaintiff cannot recover unless he was not guilty of any negligence that contributed to the result.] 4 Negligence is, in a general sense, carelessness. A man driving along a road is bound to look out, bound to keep his eyes and thoughts about him. . . . Counsel for the defendant company asks me to say, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence upon the evidence before us. In certain cases, where it is very manifest and very plain, it becomes the duty of the court to take the question from the jury in a case of this kind. I decline to do that in this case.</p>

I thought it was a case where the jury ought to pass upon that question, and you are to be thoroughly satisfied, gentlemen, that this accident did not occur in consequence of the carelessness of the plaintiff in his driving. You are to be satisfied on that point, because the duty of the plaintiff is, not only to prove negligence on the part of the defendant, but also to prove that he was clear of contributory negligence. That must appear, that he was entirely clear of any carelessness or negligence that contributed to the result. Contributory negligence in this case would be, of course, careless driving, neglecting to look ahead. The witnesses on the part of thq plaintiff testified yesterday that this rail was up from four to five feet high; that is, the end of it; witnesses who looked and saw it from the side. The witness, Day, said this morning that he thought it was about three feet and a half high. Now, if the rail was up from four to five feet high, could not the plaintiff have seen it if he had looked ahead of him ? That is the question. He was bound to look ahead. If he had done so, could he not have seen the rail projecting ? The plaintiff’s counsel suggests that it was projecting in such a way that he would be looking at the end of it, but could he not have seen the rail 50 or 100 feet away before he came to it, if he had been looking? Those rails are sometimes covered with <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>mud, but are generally a little brighter that the ground around; and if that rail had been up four or five feet high, there would have been considerable space along the track where there was no rail, and the side of the rail would have been towards him, not the edge of it, as viewed from the side of the pavement. The plaintiff says he did look ahead. The accident occurred suddenly and he was pitched suddenly under the horses, and the car immediately went over him. But was he ? That is for you to say. Were the circumstances such that if he had been looking he would have seen the rail? Not whether he did see it; that is not the question; but, if he had been looking as he was bound to, to see what was ahead of him, could he not and would he not have seen the rail projecting ? If so, then he is guilty of contributory negligence in not looking, and if that is a fact, he cannot recover at all.] 4 . . . .</p>

    <p class="author" id="AqJV" data-blocks='[["BL_436.6",436,[528,901,463,32]]]'>Mr. Justice Sterrett :</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.7",436,[295,951,1162,754]]]'>It is conceded by the learned counsel for plaintiff that there is nothing in this record on which to base the first and second specifications of error. It does not appear that any objection was made or exception noted in the court below as to either of the matters referred to in these specifications, and hence the questions intended to be raised are. not properly before us. When the relation of the fourth juror to a member of the company defendant was disclosed, the plaintiff might have interposed a challenge for cause, and if the court had refused to sustain it, he could have excepted, and requested the court to seal a bill. In that way the facts could have been brought upon the record, and the question would have been properly presented; but, as the record stands, the first and second specifications must be dismissed without any intimation of opinion as to the merits of the questions intended to be raised.</p>
    <p id="b436-6" data-blocks='[["BL_436.8",436,[296,1713,1162,236]]]'>The prayer for instruction, recited in the third specification, was rightly refused, because it entirety ignores the question of contributory negligence. While the evidence on that subject is very slight, we are not prepared to say that it does not amount to more than a mere scintilla.</p>
    <p id="b436-7" data-blocks='[["BL_436.9",436,[296,1967,1162,501]]]'>In that portion of the charge recited in the fourth specification there is manifest error, especially in what was said by the learned judge in relation to the degree, as well as the burden of proof. Among other things, he instructed the jury that they must “ be thoroughly satisfied that the accident did not occur in consequence of the carelessness of the plaintiff: in his driving. You are to be'satisfied on that point, because the duty of the plaintiff is not only to prove negligence on the part of the defendant, but also to prove that he was clear of contributory negligence,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b437-3" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[173,392,1164,1527]]]'>
      <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>By the expression “thoroughly satisfied,” the jury would doubtless understand the court to mean that it was not only necessary for them to believe the weight of the evidence, on the subject of contributory negligence, was in plaintiff’s favor, but that their belief must be so strong as to exclude every reasonable doubt that plaintiff’s carelessness in driving did not contribute to his injury. The instruction as to the burden of proving absence of contributory negligence is too clear and explicit to admit of any doubt. The charge is so clearly erroneous, in each of these particulars, that -it is unnecessary to refer to any of the authorities establishing the contrary doctrine. In actions such as this, it has been sometimes said that the plaintiff must present a case clear of contributory negligence. The obvious meaning of that and similar forms of expression is, that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that the injury complained of was caused by defendant’s negligence, and if, in so doing, the fact is disclosed that his own negligence contributed to the result, there can be no recovery, because the case as thus presented by the plaintiff is not clear of contributory negligence. It was never intended to mean that the plaintiff, after first proving affirmatively that defendant’s negligence caused the injury, must also prove negatively that he himself was not guilty of any negligence that contributed to the result. No reputable authority can be found anywhere to sustain such a proposition, and much less is there any reason for requiring the high standard of proof specified by the learned judge. Ordinarily, the standard of proof, in civil cases, is preponderance of evidence; not such a degree of proof as will produce “ thorough ” satisfaction in the minds of the jurors, as to the truth of an alleged fact.</p>

In finding for plamtiff, the jury must have reached the conclusion that his injuries were caused by the defendant company’s negligence, and that he himself was not guilty of any negligence contributing thereto. Under these circumstances, he was entitled, as matter of <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>right, to have tbe jury pass fairly on tbe question of damages, and by their verdict award him such sum as, under the evidence, he was entitled to.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[281,541,1160,83]]]'>The fourth, fifth, and sixth specifications of error are sustained.</p>
    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.6",438,[540,645,898,83]]]'>Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>
