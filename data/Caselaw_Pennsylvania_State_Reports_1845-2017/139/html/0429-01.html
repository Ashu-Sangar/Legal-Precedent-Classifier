    <p class="summary" id="b457-4" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[164,767,1167,1626]]]'>The question of possession being constructive notice of the title, and of being notice of the trust, are quite distinct. That it is of the title, is good law: Hottenstein v. Lerch, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20Pa.%20455" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="104 Pa. 455">104 Pa. 455</a>, and Rowe v. Ream, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20Pa.%20548" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="105 Pa. 548">105 Pa. 548</a>; and equity following the law, it is properly so held in this case. But, such notice of title is in reality in derogation of the recording act and not a subject always agreed upon by courts. To hold that possession is notice, also, of a trust, is to go a step farther, and tends to weaken the effect and intention of the recording acts. That the law should cast a trust upon an innocent purchaser, who supposes he is getting a complete title, the record being all right, and pays his money therefor, simply because of laches in not noticing the possession of the land, seems straining the idea of privity which lies at the bottom of a trust. But it is held as late as in Brickell v. Earley, <a href="/pa/115/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="115 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="551799" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0473-01">115 Pa. 473</a>, that as to realty a constructive or resulting trust may arise only in the case of fraud or the payment of the money of another. Such a rule serves to quiet title, but to hold as the plaintiff must ask in this case, is but to disturb title. But, more; the plaintiff was guiltjr of laches in not demanding the legal title from John White, Jr., for so long a time after 1847, and he was guilty of laches in not putting on record within reasonable time bis article of agreement; and again guilty of laches in making no demand for some thirty-three years of James Patterson and his assigns to execute the trust. Does he come into a court of equity with clean hands, such that at his demand the law shall cast upon the defendant a trust because of her laches in buying without noticing his possession ? It does not seem equity. But, supposing Patterson was affected by the trust, is not the plaintiff by all analogy barred from enforcing it after a lapse of thirty-three years? The plaintiff’s true remedy would seem to be a bill quia timet: Bispham’s Eq.,' § 575.</p>

Second, there is nothing in the case, save the recital in the deed and the receipt attached thereto, to show the payment of the purchase money.

It may be termed a trust by equitable construction in the absence of fraud: Hill on Trustees,4th Am. ed., 272, § 171. “Thevendor’s legal estate is held by him on a naked trust for the vendee ; this trust, impressed upon the land, follows it in the hands of the persons who .may succeed to his legal title, his heirs and his grantees, who take with notice of the vendee’s equitable right:” 1 Pomeroy’s Eq. J., § 868. The case of Brickell v. Earley, <a href="/pa/115/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="115 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="551799" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0473-01">115 Pa. 473</a>, cited in support of the theory that a constructive trust in land can arise only when title has been derived through fraud, or through purchase with another’s money, contains that doctrine only in the syllabus, which grossly misrepresents the meaning of the opinion. All that the court <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>decided was, that, under the circumstances of the case, the defendant could not be held liable as a trustee of a resulting trust, unless it were shown that he was guilty of fraud or had bought with the plaintiff’s money. It never was intended to deny the existence of what is perhaps the most common constructive trust now known to our law, namely, that arising from purchase of lands by articles of agreement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b459-4" data-blocks='[["BL_459.5",459,[175,769,1161,247]]]'>Perhaps it is hardly necessary to say, although the circumstances of the case suggest the remark, that where one agrees to convey land for a valuable consideration, which land he does not then own, but afterwards acquires, he will hold it, when acquired, as a trustee for his vendee.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b459-5" data-blocks='[["BL_459.6",459,[177,1025,1167,1312]]]'>Notwithstanding the able and ingenious arguments of the defendant’s counsel, that the plaintiff is precluded, by laches, from relief, the court cannot assent to this view. The plaintiff fully complied with his contract, took possession of the land, and held it undisturbed. No one ever attempted to mine or even prospect under the Patterson title. Indeed, so far as the evidence shows, we do not know that the plaintiff actually had knowledge of the deed to Mr. Patterson. But, even if he had, it would not matter. Under the circumstances, delay in bringing suit was not laches. The authorities cited on this point by the defendant’s counsel, apply to an entirely different class of eases. This case is governed by the rule laid down by Mr. Justice Agnew, in Richards v. El well, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20Pa.%20861" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="48 Pa. 861">48 Pa. 861</a>. In the words of that decision, “ Neither law nor equity impute laches to one in possession.Had the possession been fiduciary, by reason of the non-payment of purchase money, or some unperformed duty; or, had some right of the vendor remained to be protected, which, in equity, required the purchaser to be prompt, eager and active, it might be different. But Dunn owed no duty, while his vendor, for twenty-nine years before suit brought, had owed him a conveyance.” This decision is also important on the question as to the degree of proof required on the part of the vendee, in a case like the one under consideration. In Du Bois v. Baum, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20Pa.%20537" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="40 Pa. 537">40 Pa. 537</a>, Mr. Justice STRONG- says: “His,” the purchaser’s “possession would have been constant action under the contract.”</p>

John White, Jr., before his death, parted with both the legal and equitable titles to the minerals in controversy. The act of February 24, 1834, § 15, gives the Orphans’ Court jurisdiction only where the decedent dies “ seised or possessed ” of the real estate he contracted to convey. On this point, comment is made as follows, in Scott on the Intestate Laws, 1st ed., 434: “ The second condition, necessary to support a petition for a decree under the statute, that the vendor shall have died seised or possessed of <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>tbe estate sold, places tbe act in apparent antagonism to a general custom of tbe country, and is irreconcilable with tbe tenor of the sixteenth century. But, to reconcile what should never have stood apart, the Supreme Court has emphatically held that the language of the statute must be satisfied by a legal or constructive seisin.” I have no knowledge that any court has ever gone further than this, in extending the operation of the statute. Would not Robert White, with the knowledge he now possesses, be guilty of something like perjury, if he were to present in the Orphans’ Court a petition, duly sworn to, alleging that John White, Jr., died either actually or constructively seised of the minerals in dispute ?</p>

      <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.7",460,[298,1598,1164,848]]]'>Turning now to the defendant’s objection, that the plaintiff is in the wrong court, I cannot agree that it is well founded. The plaintiff, being in possession, certainly cannot proceed by action of ejectment in the Common Pleas. The jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court does not attach for two reasons, both-of which will appear by reference to § 15, act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 75: 1. John AVhite, when he died, was neither actually nor constructively seized or possessed of the real estate in controversy. He had parted with both the legal and equitable title. He had neither possession nor right of possession. 2. The statute, conferring jurisdiction on the Orphans’ Court, provides no machinery for enforcing in that tribunal, at the purchaser’s instance, a decedent’s contract for the sale of realty, where he conveys, before his decease, the legal title to a third person. There is no authority for citing any one claiming the legal title, under or through the decedent, save his executors, administrators, heirs or devisees; and without notice, no decree would be binding on a party interested. The jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court, where it exists, is, as the defendant’s counsel suggest in their brief, usually exclusive, but it does not exist in the present case. The plaintiff is entitled to be heard in some court, and I know of none, save this, the door whereof is open to him.</p>

L. 75. It does not extend to lands which he has conveyed to another, and in which, at the time of his death, he has neither a legal nor an equitable estate. In such case, the living holder of the legal title is the trustee of it for the equitable owmer, and to him the latter must look for a conveyance in consummation of the contract. If the trustee decline to execute a deed when requested, the Orphans’ Court cannot intervene to compel him to do so. The fact that his grantor is dead does not subject him to its process. The only remedy of the equitable owner in possession is a bill for a conveyance of the title which is unlawfully withheld from him, and the proceeding is in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
