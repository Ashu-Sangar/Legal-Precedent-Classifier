Among other witnesses called by the plaintiff, Joseph Gilmore, at the time foreman of the defendant company’s foundry, under whom the deceased was employed as a molder, testified that the wheel was set up by carpenters who, in his opinion, were not skilled in the work of setting up emery wheels; that witness did not like the way it ran, and went to examine it; that “ while so doing, the deceased stepped up and began to grind his rammer on it, making the sparks fly all around the machine. I ordered him away from the wheel, waving my arm to emphasize the order, as I was on the opposite side of the machine from him. As he took his rammer down and stepped back, <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>the wheel burst. A portion of it struck him in the lower part of the stomach. The wheel had been just erected, and no one had been told to go near it. I ordered him away, as he had no business there.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_270.7",270,[282,901,1159,794]]]'>Since the evidence was furnished us, we have examined it with care, to see if there is any evidence to show that there was anything improper in the construction or setting of the machine. We are compelled to say there is no such evidence. It was constructed and set up in a proper manner, and in a proper place, and for a proper purpose. Nor is there any evidence to show that there was any defect in the emery wheel, which was known, or ought to have been known by reasonable care and diligence. What caused it to burst, no one knows, at least so far as the evidence is concerned. It appears to have been one of those sad and unfortunate accidents the cause of which is unknown. Unless the plaintiff can establish, either that the machine was improperly constructed or set up, or that there was some defect in the emery wheel, which was known or ought to have been known, there can be no recovery. The motion to take off the nonsuit is refused.</p>
