When a man or a woman is deceived by another man or woman by a lie, spoken or acted, it is the fault of the liar for that time. If they are deceived the second time, it ordinarily ought to be considered the fault of the party deceived, and yet we know that women will, out of affection, allow men to deceive them day after day and year after year.] 4</p>

[If he got this release by deliberately giving her to understand that if she signed it he would certainly marry her as soon as he got through with his other troubles, when he had no intention of doing so, then, though he may not have actually made that promise in words, and yet made the promise he did make with the intention of making her believe that, then it was a fraud on her and she is not bound by the release. It is a question of fact for the jury, but the burden is on her. Prima facie this paper relieves the defendant; but, if it was procured by fraud; and, taking the relations that they occupied with each other and all the circumstances into consideration, we think there is evidence for the jury to say whether or not it was so procured. If it was not, it is conclusive and your verdict must be for the defendant. If it was procured by fraud, it does not bind the plaintiff, and she is entitled to your verdict for the damages which you think she has suffered, with costs and expenses, and a reasonable figure for the humiliation and disgrace of her rejection after it became known that she was engaged and expected to be married, and the injury to her prospects for a married life.] 5 It may be true that the learned counsel for the defendant has put a proper estimate on the value of his client to a woman, but the jury can hardly be allowed to take that estimate. It is the value that the man might have been to the woman in her estimation.

This point was raised by the second assignment, which alleges that the court below refused, at the request of the defendant, to instruct the jury “ that if they find from the evidence that the plaintiff executed the <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>release, dated December 29,1888, then the verdict must be for the defendant.”</p>

After the case was at issue and ready for trial, the defendant prepared a formal release, took it to the plaintiff, and procured her signature thereto. The release was formal enough, and, had it been obtained without fraud, the plaintiff would have been out of court. But she alleges that the defendant induced her to sign the paper by falsehood and fraud. It appeared that the defendant was in trouble with another woman, a Miss Graham, and was under bail. Under these circumstances he called upon the plaintiff, and this is her version of what occurred:</p>
    <blockquote id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.6",246,[260,1044,1166,1008]]]'>“‘Well,’ he said, ‘if you release me until I am not in so much trouble with this Miss Graham, (and a suit of my own with the company, and this suit of yours, makes three suits hanging over me,) then I will do what is right and just by you after that.’ I thought; I considered; I knew he hadn’t done right by me, but I thought I rvould look over everything, on his promise. He said: ‘If I am bound by law to marry you, I will never marry you; but if you will release me, I will do what is right by you.’ I broke down, and he says, ‘ Don’t fret,’ and he took me in his arms and kissed me and says: ‘ You will be all right when I get all right with Miss Graham.’ So he went away, and he came in the evening with this paper, and he laid it down before me, and he says: ‘Now I have this paper here that I want you to sign.’ I had no idea that he would bring a paper to me, and I was all alone. Mrs. Batten wasn’t there, and I got up and made a light, and took him in the parlor, and he says : ‘ I want you to sign this paper.’ I says: ‘ I can’t read all the paper. Can you read it?’ ‘I can’t read it either,’ he said. Well, then he induced me to sign it, and said it would be all right, when I hesitated about signing it.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b246-6" data-blocks='[["BL_246.7",246,[256,2060,1161,337]]]'>The defendant denied having made any such promises as those above stated, in order to procure the release.

They evidently believed her story, and there was much to commend it to their favor. It was corroborated in some respects, and had upon its face an air of probability. With the facts thus found, it is clear the release was obtained by a trick and a fraud. While he did not in so many words say to the plaintiff, “ If you will sign this release, and relieve my hail, I will marry you,” yet such was the only rational conclusion to be drawn from his language. The subject of their conversation was their marriage; he was entangled with another woman; he had a suit with some company, thus making three suits hanging over him. When he said “ I will do what is right by you, if you release me,” he meant marriage, and she under-wood it was to he marriage. Under these circumstances, it was not only fradulent, but mean, to procure the release, throwing out of view the blandishments which he resorted to as make-weights, and which were well calculated to inspire confidence in his sincerity and continued attachment. We are of opinion that the facts fully justified the learned judge in refusing to affirm the defendant’s second point, and the instructions to the jury referred to in the remaining assignments. It is to be further observed that there was no attempt to reform or contradict the release. The paper was admitted, but the allegation was that it had been procured by fraud, which is quite another matter.</p>
