That was a charge of conspiracy, and this is a charge of conspiracy; but different parties were in the former case, not the same parties now that were on trial then. Three of the former ones are parties now, three of them are not. Then we have four other parties now charged with a conspiracy. The conspiracy charged is substantially this: That the defendants confederated or conspired for the purpose of instituting civil suits for penalties and prosecutions for criminal offences, not for the purpose of bringing offenders to justice, but solely for the purpose of personal gain, making money out of these prosecutions by way of compromising them, or settling them contrary to law; that is substantially the charge.</p>

They were convicted in the former case, but that verdict is not conclusive against them here. You will pass upon their guilt, in this case, upon the evidence before you. If you find them guilty you will say so by your verdict. It is not at all likely that the court will sentence parties twice for the same offence. The important question in this case is, are these three aldermen guilty, or any one or two of them ? As for the other defendant, McCall, while there is some evidence against him, I do not think it is sufficient to convict him, and as the attorney for the commonwealth has very properly stated to the jury, he does not ask his conviction. Of course, in a case of this kind the jury may find all the defendants guilty if they believe the evidence is sufficient, or they may find two or more of them guilty; to constitute a conspiracy there must be at least two.</p>

L. 53] , which has been referred to frequently during this trial. In 1855 an act of the legislature was passed entitled, “An Act to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.” .I say that that act has been used in this city, a great many suits brought on it, and money squeezed out of parties on the ground that they were selling on Sunday, when if they were guilty at all they were guilty of selling without license, having no license. I do not think it applies to parties that <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>have no license, but it has been used in that way, and has been used undoubtedly for improper purposes, simply to squeeze out of them the penalty of fifty dollars, and let them go on selling without license, conniving at them. Wherever a case of that kind is before a magistrate, and the suit is for the fifty dollars, and the party is brought in on a warrant, it is for selling without the license presumably, and the magistrate who will settle the fifty dollar case and drop the other is guilty of a great wrong. And that is one main charge in this conspiracy, that the criminal prosecutions were used for the purpose of extorting out of these poor creatures, many of them, the fifty dollars penalty, because in the criminal prosecutions the prosecutor would get nothing, and the magistrate would have no right to try it. A magistrate has no right to try any criminal case, or no right to receive evidence for the defendant in any criminal case; all he has to do is to inquire whether there is sufficient ground to hold that party over to answer in court for the offence. But the main charge is, in many of these cases, that the .criminal prosecution was held over these parties to compel them to pay the fine of fifty dollars for selling on Sunday, and then let it go.</p>

They may be classed under five heads, each of which is plainly unlawful, namely: First, settling a civil suit for the penalty of fifty dollars, under the act of 1855, for less than fifty dollars. Neither the prosecutor nor the magistrate has any right whatever to settle a suit of that kind for less than fifty dollars. Second, settling the civil suit for the penalty, and dropping or abandoning the criminal prosecution for selling without a license ; plainly, palpably wrong and illegal. Third, settling or dropping the criminal prosecution because of money or costs received. Fourth, compelling parties not guilty to pay costs, to stop the prosecutions ; that is extortion. Fifth, commencing prosecutions for some criminal offence for the purpose of frightening suspected parties into paying money or costs to <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>avoid a law suit.

It is not necessary that each conspirator should personally know all the other conspirators, or should have had any consultation, or concerted action with all the others. If three or more are in a conspiracy to carry on an unlawful business, and another knowingly unites with one of them in furtherance of the unlawful acts, within the purpose of the conspiracy, he thereby becomes a conspirator, a co-conspirator’, although he may not know of others being in the conspiracy.</p>

An alderman should not take an information for a criminal offence without inquiring into the facts of the case, and being satisfied that there is a reasonable ground for the prosecution. It is his duty to keep a regular docket in which shall be entered every suit commenced or information made before him, with a full and complete record of all proceedings in the case, and the final disposition thereof, witlr all costs charged or paid in the same, and also any fine imposed and paid, if any, and the names of all witnesses. It is also the duty of the magistrate to proceed without delay to the hearing and final disposition of every ease. The constable or officer having a warrant, process or subpoena to serve, shall serve the same without delay, and make return thereof immediately to the magistrate, with his return indorsed thereon. If the constable or officer fail to make return in a reasonable time, it is the duty of the magistrate to require him to make return, and in default thereof, to issue an alias warrant, process or subpoena, and place it in the hands of another officer who will execute it.</p>

Much more is it improper, and even criminal, for him to permit a prosecutor to drop or settle a case, where he has reasonable ground for believing that money has been or is to be paid to the prosecutor. If the charge turns <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>out to be a very frivolous one, the magistrate ought to dismiss it after hearing the testimony on behalf of the commonwealth. (But my experience in this court is, that that class of cases is not dismissed by aldermen. At the beginning of every term I have been in this court, we have from two to three hundred cases sent up by aldermen and magistrates of the most trifling character imaginable, that never ought to have come to court. Some poor devils were not able to pay the costs before aider-men, and come up, go before the grand jury and come to court for trial, if there is a true bill; they are not able to pay the costs, but the county has to pay the costs; they have an act passed to that effect. Scores and scores of surety of the peace cases that never should have come here at all, are sent here simply to get costs. For years that has been a crying evil of this county, and hence, I say, in these trifling cases aldermen have a right to dismiss them and ought to dismiss them, and the county has to pay the costs then, but unfortunately there are more costs if they send them to court.) d</p>

The settlement of such a case without a hearing, or the defendant appearing, or upon sham evidence, is conclusive evidence of corrupt motive in the prosecutor. When there is a criminal prosecution for selling liquor without license, and also a civil suit for the penalty for selling on Sunday, if the civil suit is settled by the payment of the penalty and costs and the criminal prosecution dropped, the inference is irresistible that the prosecutor was influenced by corrupt motives. So, also, where the civil suit is settled for less than the penalty of fifty dollars, and the magistrate, who-knowingly permits such settlement of cases before him, is a party to the wrongful, illegal act. If an alderman or magistrate acts honestly and in good faith, but commits a wrong, either through a mistake as to his duty or a <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>mistake as to the law, he is not to be held criminally responsible. But if, from the frequency of prosecutions and other circumstances, he has good reason to believe that the prosecutions are instituted for improper purposes, and the prosecutor is simply seeking personal gain, he should not only refuse to aid the prosecutor in his unlawful purpose, but should resolutely •refuse and expose him. And, if the circumstances are such that the jury may reasonably find that the magistrate knew or believed that the prosecutor was acting corruptly and illegally, and he permitted or connived at such acts, he is as criminally guilty as the prosecutor.] 3</p>

Counsel for David Doughty, one of the defendants in case on trial, respectfully requests the court to charge the jury, as to the fourth count in the indictment, that even if the settlement effected in the case of Peter Butterhoff was illegal, yet, if the jury believe that the said David Doughty acted throughout the entire transaction without criminal intent, and in good faith, as a friend of said Peter Butterhoff, they should acquit as to that count.</p>

You will remember that case; that seventy-five dollars were paid by Butterhoff to Alderman Doughty. Now, if it was a suit for the penalty, that was twenty-five dollars too much. They had no right to demand that in a civil suit for the penalty. If it <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>was a criminal prosecution against him for selling without a license, then it was glaringly improper to settle it on the payment of seventy-five dollars, settling a case that ought to have been returned to court; and I say it was glaringly improper for any of the parties to get seventy-five dollars to settle the case that ought to have been returned to court, no difference before whom the information was made, Cassidy or anybody else. But, the evidence is that Alderman Doughty went to Alderman Cassidy’s office to get him to settle it, and it is for the jury to say. If he received nothing of the money, that act alone, gentlemen, would not be sufficient to convict him of this conspiracy, but you are to take it in connection with other evidence, and if he received any of that money it would be very strong evidence against him.4</p>

In assigning this reason, counsel has no intention of attributing any knowledge of the fact to the district attorney or the court, or any intention to do injury to defendant, but believes that it was unforeseen and unexpected, yet its injurious effects justify the assignment as a reason for a new trial and in arrest of judgment.®</p>

      <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>From tbe evidence, there can be no doubt that J. D. Bauder and the men employed by him in his business, to wit, J. Doyle, L. J. Bender, J. A. Dougherty, W. Nagle and F. B. Stoner, were engaged in a conspiracy to extort money by means of criminal prosecutions. They were all found guilty at No. 752 of this term. The question on this trial was, whether the three aldermen, Maneese, Callen and Doughty, were engaged in the conspiracy. I think the evidence justified a verdict against all of them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b418-4" data-blocks='[["BL_418.5",418,[263,843,1164,452]]]'>What occurred, incidentally, during the trial, when Mrs. Clifford was called up for sentence, was a surprise to the court, and no doubt to all parties concerned. But Alderman Doughty was given full opportunity to contradict what she said, as he did most emphatically. This seemed to be entirely satisfactory to himself and his counsel, for no objection was made to going on with the trial, and no request made to have the case continued. It is too late now to complain' of it. It is not at all likely it had any influence upon the verdict of the jury.</p>

The indictment charged a conspiracy with them. If they had not been defendants in this trial, all evidence proving the original conspiracy and connecting any of the other defendants with it, would have been admissible. The indictment charges a conspiracy of Maneese, Callen, Doughty, Bau-der, Doyle, Dougherty, McCall, “together with divers other wicked and evil disposed persons.” And, in the bill of particulars furnished by the commonwealth at request of defendants, it is expressly stated that the defendants conspired with L. J. Bender, W. Nagle and F. B. Stoner, in conjunction with those named in the indictment. Also, the case of Peter But-terhoff was stated as one of the cases embraced in the conspiracy. Thus, Alderman Doughty had specific notice that Bender was charged as one of the conspirators.</p>

It was sufficient also to justify them in finding that Alderman Doughty was the chief instrument in illegally settling the Butterhoff case, received from Butterhoff <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>seventy-five dollars for that purpose, and retained twenty-five dollars for himself.

Several of the defendants have appealed, and have furnished us with separate paper-books ; others of the defendants have not appealed, and their cases are not before us.</p>
    <p id="b420-13" data-blocks='[["BL_420.15",420,[282,1875,1165,389]]]'>The first assignment of error appears to have been filed under the impression that Maggie Raymond, the witness referred to, was not included in the bill of particulars. An examination of the bill, as printed on page 46 of appellant’s paper-book, shows that she was included. Error is not perceived in the admission of the evidence referred to in the second assignment. Indeed, this was practically abandoned upon the argument at bar.</p>
    <p id="b420-14" data-blocks='[["BL_420.16",420,[284,2283,1164,147]],["BL_421.1",421,[182,382,1171,352]]]'>The most serious assignment is the third, which contains a lengthy extract from the charge of the court below. There are some matters in this part of the charge which might well <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>have been omitted, yet we cannot say there was positive error, or that the court interfered with the province of the jury. The reference to the prior conviction of Bauder, Doyle, and Dougherty appears to have been rendered necessary by the defendant’s second point, which prayed for an instruction upon the effect of such prior conviction. Aside from this, there is no appeal by either of the three men referred to.</p>
    <p id="b421-4" data-blocks='[["BL_421.5",421,[185,743,1171,454]]]'>The defendant’s fourth point was affirmed with a qualification that was justified by the facts in the case. If Doughty acted, in the settlement of the Peter Butterhoff ease, in entire good faith, merely to oblige a friend and without a criminal intent, he ought not to have been convicted, and so the learned judge instructed the jury; but if Doughty received twenty-five dollars for procuring such settlement, the case presented an entirely different aspect. This matter was fairly submitted to the jury.</p>

The statement of Mrs. Clifford, made in another case in the presence of the jury, was an accident, for which neither the court below, the district attorney, nor any one else was responsible. If any harm was done, it was legally cured by allowing Doughty to go upon the stand to contradict her, which he did very thoroughly.</p>

We cannot say this charge was so.</p>

Three of the defendants in this case testified in that case, and the testimony was admitted only so far as it affected them. The court below held that it was “ admissible, as admissions on their part, so far as it tends to prove a conspiracy, and their participation in it.” Their admissions or declarations would be evidence against <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>them to show their share in a conspiracy; and, if so, why not their testimony under oath ?

The fourth assignment alleges that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the plea of autrefois convict filed by Bauder, Doyle, and Dougherty. What defendant Callen had to do with this has not been made to appear. The defendants, who put in this plea, do not complain of the action of the court, and Callen has no standing to do so.</p>

It is begging the question to assume that this indictment was laid under said section 128. As before observed, it contains four counts, in one of which it is averred that the defendants falsely and maliciously conspired to charge certain persons with a violation of the criminal laws. This ’offence is punishable by the 127th section of the act of 1860 by three years’ imprisonment. Even if we are mistaken in this, the defendants were convicted generally, i. e., upon each count of the indictment, and might thus have been sentenced upon each count.
