By the delay of the grading, the contract therefor being made under an ordinance of September 25, 1888, bids were invited by the director <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>of public works so that the paving could not be reasonably done before December 1st, and a provision was inserted compelling the completion of the work before December 31st, under a daily penalty for non-completion.

No authority exists to charge the defendant’s property with the cost of granite paving. Before the consolidation of the city of Philadelphia with the incorporated districts and townships which occupied the residue of Philadelphia county, all public work on highways, within the area of the old city, was done at the expense of the fund arising from general tax<a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>ation ; while, in the districts, the paving of streets was done by special and local taxation, the ground fronting on the streets being charged at a fixed rate. The proceedings to collect such charges for paving were founded on §§ 9, 10, act of April 16, 1840, P. L. 412. Although that act does not mention the kind of paving, the only kind in use for more than fifty years prior to 1854 was of cobble stones, and the consolidation act of February 2, 1854, P. L. 48, expressly recognized this kind of paving, by providing, in § 40, that paving might be done at the expense of lot-owners, and liens therefor filed by the city, “ as is now practiced and allowed by law; ” and the first supplement thereto, the act of April 21,1855, P. L. 266, impliedly does so, by limiting the charge for paving to $1 per square yard, the price of cobble stones. So general was the rule to use paving stones only, that by the act of April 5, 1859, P. L. 360, a “ measurer of paving stones ” was created. Subsequent legislation recognized the general rule that the city cannot compel property owners to pay for more expensive kinds of paving: Act of April 18, 1867, P. L. 1303; and see Hammett v. Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20Pa.%20157" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="65 Pa. 157">65 Pa. 157</a>.</p>

The paving of the middle of a street with different material from that adopted for the sides, will not justify charging the excess of the cost against abutting properties; having once adopted a certain kind of paving for a street, the city has exercised its discretion and cannot make a change, except on petition of a majority of the property owners, under the act of April 18, 1867, P. L. 1303: Wistar v. Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20Pa.%20512" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="80 Pa. 512">80 Pa. 512</a> ; Slocum v. Philadelphia, 11 W. N. 167. But the cost of paving the middle of Girard Avenue cannot be charged against the property owners at all, for the reason that the act of March 26, 1859, P. L. 241, has imposed it upon a street-railway company, as is set forth in the affidavit of defence. Although the primary duty to pave and repair is in the city, the street-railway company is responsible for the cost of the paving: Philadelphia v. Weller, 4 Brewst. 25; Frankford etc. Ry. Co. v. Philadelphia; 17 W. N. 245; Harrisburg v. Railway Co., 1 Pears. 298; Ex necessitate rei, then, the abutting ground must be relieved, as double payment is a thing unknown to the law. The ordinance of April 1,1859, which it was agreed might be considered by the court, is wholly irrelevant. The burden imposed upon <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>tbe railway company by the act of 1859 cannot be removed from it except by a later statute: Ridge Ave. Ry.

The words, “ as now practiced and allowed by law,” in the consolidation act of 1854, clearly refer only to the manner of filing liens. The act of April 21, 1855, P.

By an ordinance, enacted June 12, 1868, the price for cubical-block paving was fixed at not more than $3 per square yard. The act of April 18, 1867, P. L. 1303, was passed at a time when the BeLgian-block paving had not come into general use, and before councils had authorized it and fixed a price for it. The whole legislation on the subject of street paving in Philadelphia is now contained in § 40, act of February 2, 1854, P. L. 43, the act of 1866, and the ordinance of 1868, already referred to.</p>

The portion paved was the centre of the street, formerly reserved for market purposes. The sides of said street are now, and have been for many years, paved with cobble stones.

It is doubtless true that at the time of consolidation in 1854, and prior thereto, the cobble-stone pavement was the only one used in the districts of Penn and the Northern Liberties, and that no owner of property had been charged with any other kind of paving. It by no means follows, however, that because this particular kind of pavement was the only one in use for many years, that the municipal authorities are restricted to it for the future. The cobble stones answered very well in their day. It was a cheap pavement, and was a great improvement over muddy streets. But the city has grown since then in wealth, population, and business, and the pavements of forty years ago may be wholly unsuited to the present growth and wants of the city. This we may fairly infer from the action of the city authorities in ordering a more durable and expensive pavement. The kind of pavement to be laid down upon a particular street must necessarily be left to the discretion of city councils, unless we find some legislative restriction imposed upon it. Such restriction is certainly not to be found in § 40 of the act of February 2,1854, P. L. 43, (consolidation act,) which provides that “ it may be prescribed by ordinance that paving of streets, except at the intersections thereof, and of footways and laying of water-pipes within the limits of the city, shall be done at the expense of the owners in front whereof such work shall be done, and liens may be filed by said city <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>for the same, as is now practiced and allowed by law.” We think it very clear that this language does not apply to the kind of paving; the matter that is permitted to be done, as “ now practiced and allowed by law,” is the filing of the lien. We find nothing in the acts of assembly or elsewhere, which, in express terms or by necessary implication, restricts the city to the antiquated and unsatisfactory cobble pavements of our fathers.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[266,726,1166,1056]]]'>Nor are we able to see much force in the further objection that, inasmuch as the city has paved the centre of the street with a more expensive pavement than that established at the sides, the excess of such cost cannot be charged against the ground. It is to be observed that Girard Avenue is a wide street, the centre of which has now been paved for the first time. The sides, as before observed, were paved many years ago with cobble stones. This portion of it has been paid for by the owners of property abutting thereon. We are unable to see how the fact that they have paid for the work done upon this portion of the street, can exempt them from the payment of what, is now necessary to be done upon the remainder,, or middle portion. Their property was originally liable to be assessed for the paving of the street for its entire width; that it has hitherto been enforced against them only as to part, has done them no harm. And the fact that a cobblestone pavement was regarded as sufficient many years ago for the sides of the street, is no reason why a granite pavement should not now be laid in the middle, if, in the discretion of councils, such pavement is required: See Slocum v. Philadelphia, 11 W. N. 167; Alcorn v.

There would be much force iu this position, if it is true in the broad sense claimed for it. Where a city passenger-railway company is required by its charter to pave the street upon which its road is laid, it may be that such duty would be shifted from the abutting property owner to such company. But I do not understand that any such duty is to be found in the charter of the company which occupies this street. By the act of March 26,1859, P. L. 241, incorporating the Richmond &amp; Schuylkill Passenger Railway Company, it was made subject “ to the provisions of all ordinances hereto<a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>fore, or that may be hereafter passed, by the councils of the city regulating city passenger railways.” It is unnecessary to review at length the various ordinances of city councils affecting such railways. A brief reference to them is sufficient. The third section of the ordinance of July 7, 1857, provides “that all railroad companies shall be at the entire cost and expense of maintaining, paving, repairing, and re-paving that may be necessary upon any road, street, avenue, or alley occupied by them.” The ordinance of April 1,1859, provided some additional regulations for this class of corporations, and § 1 thereof declared “ that all streets or highways which are unpaved at the time of laying the rails shall be kept in good traveling order by the railroad company, until the same shall be paved by the owners of property thereon ; after which they shall be repaired, re-paved, and kept in good order at the proper cost of the railroad company; ” and by § 6, “ that so much of the third section of the ordinance approved July 7, 1857, to which this is a supplement, as provides that the railroad companies shall pave any street that has not heretofore been paved, be and the same is hereby repealed.”</p>

The act of 1859, as before observed, makes the company subject to the provisions of the ordinances of the city regulating such roads; not only subject to such ordinances as were then in existence, but also to those “ that may be hereafter passed,- ” and we have seen that the third section of the ordinance of July 7, 1857, which would seem to impose such original paving upon the railway company, has been repealed. The duty which the act of 1859 imposed upon the company was a shifting not a fixed one. It was to be regulated by councils from time to time, and the authority which imposed the duty could, take it away. It had no more of permanency about it than the license fees for running the cars. Had the legislature imposed this duty upon the company as a condition of its charter, it would have been beyond the control of city councils, and we might then have had the question properly before us, whether <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>tbe imposition of such duty upon the company relieved the property owner from the burden or cost of paving.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[283,480,1158,895]]]'>The fourth ground of defence is, that the price charged for the paving was too high. The act of April 19,1843, P. L. 342, permits this defence to be taken, and had the affidavit of de-fence contained this averment, without more, we might have been compelled to send the case to a jury. But the affidavit appears to have been prepared, with great candor on the part of the learned counsel for the defendant, so as to develop the whole case; and from it we learn, not that the price was too high fqr the time of year that the paving was done, but that an unsuitable time, to wit, the winter season, had been selected by the director of public works in which to lay down the pavement. We do not, of course, know what public exigency required that this pavement should be put down at such an unusual season for such work. It is east7 to see that it would not only increase the expense, but possibly impair tbe quality of the paving. We do hot find anything, however, to interfere with the discretion of the municipal authorities in this matter, and we cannot assume that it was done without cause.</p>
