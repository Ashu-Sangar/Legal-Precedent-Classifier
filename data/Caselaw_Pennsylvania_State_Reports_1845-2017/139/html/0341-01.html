Beardsley and his assigns obtained an exclusive right to bore for gas and oil on the plaintiff’s farm, for a period of twenty years from th# date of the lease. The consideration was the agreement to develop the land for oil, etc., and to pay the royalty on oil produced. The lessee had six months in which to complete a test well without any payment to the lessor. If such well was not completed at the end of six months, the lessee had at his option a right to continue the delay, by paying to the lessor “ for such delay, the sum of $231 per annum, within three months after the time for <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>completing such well.” And, by paying this annual sum, he would continue his right to bore to the end of his term.</p>

The clause of forfeiture, in case of. a failure to put down a wrell or to pay the yearly payment within the time stipulated, being for the benefit of the lessor, the defendant cannot take advantage of his own default and try to claim a forfeiture of the contract: Wills v. Natural Gas Co., <a href="/pa/130/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="130 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="568992" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0222-01">130 Pa. 222</a>.

    <p class="summary" id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.6",367,[181,1057,1165,863]]]'>The defendant, who took an assignment of the lease on January 24, 1887, took an assignment of the lease after the six months stipulated for the putting down of the well had expired, but before any rent for the after delay was due. This he admits, but he asserts that he has not entered into possession of the farm. This is not necessary to make him liable. He is not entitled to possession except for the purpose of boring for oil, and this he declines to do. He is liable for all the breaches of the covenant by his assignor, which occurred subsequent to his acceptance of the assignment. If the payment of the first $231 yearly payment is for breach of the covenant to put down the well in six months, then the assignee is not liable for that payment. If it is, as we interpret it to be, an alternate and optional covenant to pay for further delay at the end of three months for the year ensuing the six months, he is liable. The rent had not accrued nor was there a breach of the covenant to pay the annual payment for delay until after the assignment.</p>

Had the rule then been established which is laid down and so well supported by reason and authority in Wills v.

The defendant contends, however, that, as assignee of the lessee,'he is not liable; that the suit should have been brought against his assignor. But the covenant was in the nature of a covenant to pay rent, and runs with the land. It is settled law that covenants to pay rent or royalty run with the land, and that the assignee of the lease is liable for the payment of all rents or royalties which accrued while he held the assignment of the lease: Borland’s App., <a href="/pa/66/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="66 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="432498" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0470-01">66 Pa. 470</a>; Negley v.
