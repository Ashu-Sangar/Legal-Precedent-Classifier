There appears to have been no fraudo^ concealment practiced by the plaintiff upon the company, arSB we are not willing to believe that the latter took his premium without giving any insurance as regards his eyesight. The loss of one eye to him, was precisely the same as the loss of <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>both eyes to an ordinary man. It is total blindness in either case. There is no provision in the policy for the loss of one eye, as there is for the loss of one arm or one leg. The reason is plain. The loss of one eye does not produce a “ total and permanent loss of sight.” For all practical purposes a man with one eye can still follow his occupation and gain his living, while the loss of an arm or leg is a disability which seriously interferes with his ability to earn his bread. Hence it was that the policy provided, or rather defined, the loss of sight as the loss of both eyes. It was the loss of sight which was insured against, and this was just as complete in the plaintiff’s case as though both eyes had been lost during the life of the policy.</p>

Is it reasonable that the parties did not intend the policy to cover the matter of eyesight at all ? Yet, this is the conclusion we must come to, if we sustain the defendant’s contention. Where the terms of a policy are susceptible, without violence, of two interpretations, that construction which is most favorable to the insured, in order to indemnify him against loss sustained, should be adopted: Teutonia Ins. Co. v. Mund, <a href="/pa/102/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="102 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="502750" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0089-01">102 Pa. 89</a>; Burkhard v. Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/102/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="102 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="502711" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0262-01">102 Pa. 262</a>. And, in Hoffman v. Insurance Co., <a href="/ny/82/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="82 N.Y. 405" data-case-ids="2177134" data-case-paths="/ny/82/0405-01">82 N. Y. 405</a>, it was held that no rule in the interpretation of a policy is more fully <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>established, or more imperative and controlling, than that which declares that in all cases it must be liberally construed in favor of the insured, so as not to defeat, without a plain necessity, his claim to the indemnity which, in making the insurance, it was his object to secure. When the words are, without violence, susceptible of two interpretations, that which will sustain his claim, and cover the loss, must in preference be adopted.</p>
