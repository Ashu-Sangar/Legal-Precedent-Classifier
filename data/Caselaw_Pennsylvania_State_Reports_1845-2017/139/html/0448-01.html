The main pipe from Saltsburg was originally a six-inch one, but some time since the company laid an additional eight-inch main pipe, between the wells and the brick works of the plaintiff, for a distance of about six miles. After a careful reading of all the affidavits presented by the defendant company, we can find no averment that the supply of gas at its wells is so short that it cannot supply the plaintiff’s works, or that tfie supply of gas in the main at the plaintiff’s works is so short that he cannot be there supplied: . . . . but it is averred that he must be shut off, so that the company can supply its other customers and consumers at Indiana, or other points, beyond plaintiff’s works.</p>

The court below, there, on page 106, expressly decided “ that no mandato^ injunction can issue except upon final hearing.” The present Chief Justice ruled just to the contrary. So, the power to issue such an order is now res judicata. There being no difficulty about the law, the question always arises when a mandatory order is asked, do the facts of the particular case authorize it? We think under all the circumstances the mandatory order in this case was properly issued.</p>

It is quite true, these averments are not accompanied with the statement that the company cannot supply the plaintiff’s works. Still, the averment of such a material decrease of pressure and supply, presents a question we cannot fail to consider, in connection with the feature of the contract of June 25,1889, which authorized shutting off for “ want of supply.” The expression in the contract, “ want of supply,” in the connection we find it, is not entirely clear. If we would seek to define “ want,” we find it means, deficiency, lack, failure, scarcity; and the familiar word “ supply ” is defined, “ sufficiency of things for use or want.” With such meaning to this very plain expression, it is somewhat confusing to know what was in the contemplation of the contracting parties when they used it. And in this connection, we cannot fail to consider the defendant’s averments about the diminishing supply at its wells.</p>

It is quite true, the plaintiff has filed a variety of affidavits in reply. We shall forbear in the view we now take of the case to discuss them. This court still adheres to the view heretofore expressed that the contract between these parties did not and does not authorize the company to turn off the gas from the plaintiff’s works because it could not supply him and at the same time some other consumers on another part of the line; or, in other words, that it cannot turn off from one consumer merely to supply another; but the averments of the answer, we have mentioned, supported by affidavits, raise some new and different questions from those ■ originally presented, and make us hesitate about continuing the mandatory order heretofore issued.</p>

Says Judge KING, in Waring v.

There is much force, we confess, in the objection that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law in an action for damages. In the opinion of this court, filed heretofore in this case, we briefly adverted to the complaint of the plaintiff, that the necessary tardy proceedings of an action at law for damages, if he could maintain <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>it, would be an inadequate remedy. We were impressed with such facts as his fitting up his works at considerable expense to use the gas; his adoption of it and abandonment of other fuel; his contracts with distant firms to supply them with brick; his brick there in the kilns, but partly burned; the gas about to be turned off, leaving him in such situation and causing such injury and damage for which no action at law would supply an adequate remedy. That an action at law, if the gas was improperly turned off, would lie, we had no doubt. Our doubt was, however, about its supplying an adequate remedy in the measure of damages for such an injury. We thought it our duty, therefore, to preserve the status quo, so that the plaintiff could proceed with his kilns, instead of pursuing the uncertain remedy of an action at law. Recent utterances, however, of the Supreme Court have changed somewhat our opinion of the equity jurisdiction of this case. Not being entirely clear, however, that equity does not have jurisdiction here, we shall forbear further discussion in this behalf, and await the development of final hearing. It may be that, such a case of irreparable injury will be developed as will relieve all doubt on the question of jurisdiction.</p>
