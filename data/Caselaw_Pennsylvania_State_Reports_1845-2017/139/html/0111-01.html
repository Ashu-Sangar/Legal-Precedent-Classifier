On June 7,1887, the defendant, engaged in the business of producing and supplying natural gas, entered into a written contract with C. J. Hummel, by which Hummel agreed to drill a well for natural gas upon property in the borough of Glenfield, known as the Mueller farm, and on a “location” distant 125 to 150 feet from the plaintiff’s water well. The contract provided that Hummel should case said gas well with eight and one fourth inch easing to the depth of 700 feet and deep enough to shut off all fresh water; below that with six inch casing, to shut off any water or caving rock found just above the gas rock; and should warrant the well absolutely free from water, and do all work to the satisfaction of the defendant’s superintendent; all tools and gas and water connections to be furnished by Hum-mel, and all casing required for the well to be furnished by the defendant. The contract contained, also, the following clause: “All springs to be fully protected from damage, and drillings to be carried from the wells to such point as will do the least damage to property possible.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[266,1524,1163,651]]]'>The well thus contracted for was begun sometime in June, and finished in August, 1887. While drilling, it passed through two veins of fresh water, one of which supplied the plaintiff’s well. The witnesses differed as to the depth, the highest estimate being 125 and 145 feet respectively, and the lowest 50 and 75 feet. Salt water was encountered in lower strata, there being some difference between the witnesses as to the depth at which the first salt water was reached. The well was cased so as to shut out of it both the fresh and the salt water, but no effort was made to prevent the salt water from rising on the outside of the casing and mingling with the fresh water. Such mingling occurred, and it resulted in rendering the water in the plaintiff’s well utterly unfit for domestic purposes.</p>

When the contract was made, the defendant company knew that; it would probably strike fresh water in its gas well near the surface, and salt water lower down, and knew that unless some preventive measures were taken, the salt water would be likely ¡.&lt;&gt; rise in the hole, and mingle with the fresh water at higher levels. The testimony. tended to show that the waters encountered in drilling deep wells are not usually in the form of streams, but percolate through strata of porous rock or gravel, without any well defined course, except as variations in the density of the rock, and crevices therein, may cause them to seek the more open parts of the strata; that by reason of the lack of uniformity of the structure, it is a matter of more or less uncertainty, be-' forehand, whether a given well will encounter water in any particular stratum or not, and that it is impossible to tell except by inference from such facts as the effect produced in this instance upon the plaintiff’s well, where the subterranean waters come from or where they go to.</p>

Q. You knew if you allowed the salt water to mingle with the fresh that it would destroy these wells ? A. Certainly I knew that; I’ve had that occur often. Q. That occurred often? A. Yes, sir. Q. I understand that you made no effort to separate it. A. No, sir. Q. You could have separated it, could you not, Mr. Hummel? A. Well, it could be done by giving instructions in the first place to separate this water by drilling a larger hole and putting in another addition of pipe, about 150 or 155 feet. Q. And that would have saved the fresh water in these wells ? A. Yes, sir. Q.

Q. Well, then, you didn’t know what streams of water supplied the wells of Mrs. Collins and Mrs. Osbon ? A. I simply say from the elevation, as I said before, where I got the water, naturally would look as though it supplied these wells, for the elevation tallies up with it from where we got the water and the elevation of the wells that are spoiled. That is the way I go by it exactly. That is all that I can tell you.Q. Well now, Mr. Hum-mel, when you struck this fresh water did you know at the time what stream supplied the wells of the plaintiffs? A. No, I did not know what stream. Q. Could you tell at all what streams supplied their wells ? A. No, I couldn’t tell that. Q. Couldn’t tell anything about it? A. No, I just simply know we struck that water at that depth in the bowels of the earth where the level of these wells are or pretty near so, and consequently that same body of water that I got at that depth would naturally seem as though it was feeding these wells.Q. Could you tell which way this subterranean stream would flow, whether toward the wells or from them ? A. No ; I couldn’t tell that. Q. Is not a good deal of your knowledge from the fact that they were affected by this salt water? A. I know this much, that when you intermingle salt water with fresh it is going to spoil the whole neighborhood. Q. Isn’t your knowledge derived largely from the fact that they were affected by this salt water? A. Yes, I think the salt water did it altogether. Q. So, your after knowledge was more than your fore knowledge ? A. No, not from this well. I had dug too many wells previous to this well not to know that the salt water has risen to the surface water and spoiled it. Q. I mean as to the water supply<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>ing these wells.

That arrangement was in common use for such purpose, although it was not customary to resort to it to guard against injury to neighboring water wells, or, except when it was to the advantage of the oil or gas operator.

If it did, then you come to the next question. It does not follow, if you find that the wells were destroyed by boring this well, that the defendant is responsible for it. There are two maxims of law that seem to be in conflict here.. One is that “ the owner of land owns it from the centre of the earth up to the heavens, and he can do what he pleases with it.” That is the general rule. But there is another maxim that comes in and modifies that, and it is especially so where people live in thickly populated communities: “ So use your own that you will not injure your neighbor.” Now, you have a right to use your own, but if you are likely to injure your neighbor in using it, and you can reasonably prevent that injury, then you are bound to use the reasonable precaution. The defendants in this case, for the time being, are to be treated as the owners of the land on which •■•Wr hpred, and had a right to bore for gas or oil. It is a legiti-mad industry, and they had a right to do it.

[If the defendants had reasonable ground for believing that the drilling of their well would bring' the salt-water veins up to mix with the fresh water, and thus pollute the neighboring wells, they were bound to exercise reasonable care to prevent the injury.] 6 In drilling near the wells of the plaintiffs, they were bound to make the inquiries that would naturally he made from the known circumstances as to probable injury. And if they had the means of knowing, without knowing, that is, if they had the means of knowing that were palpable, and that were open to all, and acted without inquiry, it is just the same for the purposes of this case as though they had known. If they had known accurately, absolutely and positively, and continued to drill in the way they did, it might be considered malicious, but there is no such element in this case. Now the witnesses differ very greatly in regard to this;.</p>

If they, should and could have foreseen the consequences to be fairly and reasonably anticipated from their neglect to have the salt water and the fresh water cased off, then they would be responsible.

When this case was here before, this court accepted the facts as stated by the learned judge of the court below, in his charge to the jury and in his opinion refusing a new trial. But the facts were stated much more strongly for the plaintiff, we think, than the evidence warranted ; and, in our opinion, the case was decided by this court upon a false assumption. There was no evidence of the existence of a stratum of clear water, or of its flow into wells and springs of the vicinity, or that such was known or could have been known to the defendant. There may have been evidence that the defendant knew, or might "Have known, that it would probably encounter some <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>fresh water within a few hundred feet of the surface, and some salt water at a greater depth, and that these waters might mix, unless appliances were used to keep them separate; but there was no way of ascertaining where the waters in the plaintiff’s well came from, or whether the water that might be struck in drilling would reach it or not. After the injury, it was inferred that the plaintiff’s well must have been supplied by a stream or filiations through the defendant’s land, but there were no means of ascertaining this beforehand.</p>

A proprietor should not be exposed to the hazard of fruitlessly incurring heavy expenditures, without at least a reasonable certainty beforehand that they are necessary to avoid injury to neighboring owners.

In the prosecution of this business it secured a lease, for gas purposes, of the Mueller farm, and drilled one or more wells upon it. The stratum in which gas is looked for in that region is about two thousand feet below the surface of the upland, and three to four hundred feet less, in the narrow valley of Kilbuck run. The borough of Glenfield is situated in this valley, and the well complained of was within the borough limits, and within a short distance of the dwellings of several of the inhabitants. The evidence shows that the geological formation in that neighborhood is sufficiently uniform so that veins of fresh water are encountered at about the same relative depth from the surface, and veins of salt water at a <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>tolerably uniform distance below the fresh water. These veins of water are ordinarily found in a stratum of gravel or loose rock lying on a stratum of clay, slate, or other hard substance impervious to water, which-forms abed or floor over which the water spreads in its stratum of gravel or rock until it finds its way to the surface. In places where a crevice or channel exists in the rock, the water naturally gathers into it, and thus an occasional subterranean stream may be formed; but, ordinarily, the water is found diffused through the loose material overlying the floor of the water vein or stratum, and when this is penetrated by the drill the water gathers in the opening thus made.</p>
    <p id="b146-4" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[245,994,1168,849]]]'>To facilitate the work of drilling, it is desirable to prevent the water from flowing into the well. This is done, as soon as the fresh-water veins have beeii passed by the drill, by inserting an iron casing extending from the surface to a point a few feet below the lowest vein. This allows the water to move in its bed just as freely as before the well was drilled, without the least interference with its volume, direction, or quality. When the fresh water is thus shut off, the work of drilling is continued until the salt-water veins are passed, when a similar method is resorted to for shutting that out of the well. After this is done, the oil- or gas-bearing rock is penetrated and the well completed. ‘ If the well is successful the product can be secured at once, undisturbed by either the salt water or the fresh, as both are effectually cased out. If this process is properly conducted, the veins of water, both salt and fresh, are left to move, percolate, or flow as before, neither interfering with the well nor with each other.</p>
    <p id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.6",146,[240,1862,1168,551]],["BL_147.1",147,[139,373,1163,501]]]'>The defendant began the work of drilling the well complained of, with full knowledge of the general geological formation, and with ample practical experience in the management of the water veins ; but, while the company shut the water out of its own well, it did not separate the salt from the fresh, but left it to mingle with the fresh, and to flow through the freshwater veins into the wells in the neighborhood, and destroy them. Mr. Hummel, the contractor, testified that the salt water could be kept from the fresh by casing at an expense of about two hundred and fifty dollars per well, and by the use of a device called a packer at a much less cost. He also said, <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>what it is very evident must be so, that when the salt water is allowed to mingle with the fresh, it will “spoil the whole neighborhood.” The wells of these plaintiffs were so near the gas wells that their danger was evident. Hummel was asked, “ you knew if you allowed the salt water to mingle with the fresh that it would destroy these wells ? ” and he answered: “ Certainly, I know that. I’ve had that occur often.” When asked why he did not shut the salt water off from the fresh, he replied, “ Well, because I was not instructed to do so. My contract did not read that way.”</p>
    <p id="b147-4" data-blocks='[["BL_147.5",147,[142,883,1166,998]]]'>Now, upon the facts of this case, it is evident that our question does not relate to the right of an owner of land to use it or to develop its resources in a lawful and proper manner. Such right may as a general proposition be conceded. If the owner or lessee of the Mueller farm had dug a well upon it, and the water percolating the soil had collected in it, leaving some neighboring well or wells dry, the owner, being in the exercise of a legal right in the usual and proper manner, would not be liable to his neighbor for the loss of his well. If the farm was underlaid with coal or other mineral, and, as a consequence of mining in the usual and proper manner, the movement of the water in the soil or gravel should be arrested so that it should find its way into the mine, to the injury of the owners of wells and springs in the neighborhood, no action would lie against the owner of the mine : Wheatley v. Baugh, <a href="/pa/25/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="25 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="975872" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0528-01">25 Pa. 528</a>; Haldeman v.

The defendant had a right to drill in search of natural gas, but it was bound to exercise this right in a reasonable manner, and with due regard to the rights of others. In its search for gas it had to drill through nearly two thousand feet of the earth’s crust, with its successive layers or strata of rock, gravel, slate, and other substances, and their veins of water, fresh and salt. In the ordinary course of drilling, these veins of water had to be cased out of the well, and the jury have found on abundant evidence that at a small ad<a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>ditional expense, by a process well known and easily applied, and in more or less frequent use throughout the oil and gas districts of Pennsylvania, they might have been kept from mingling, and the wells in the neighborhood saved thereby. If so, then the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non lsedas applies, and the defendant is liable, not because it has necessarily injured the plaintiffs in the exercise of its own legal right, but because it has injured them unnecessarily by the neglect of such reasonable precautions as might and should have been taken to protect them. According to the testimony, this gas well was drilled with the knowledge of the fact that salt water was to be encountered; that it could be confined to its own bed; that, if it was not, the “ whole neighborhood would be spoiled,” and that there were many wells near by in the borough of Glenfield to be affected by their care or want of it in this particular. Yet no effort whatever was made to shut off the salt water, or to avoid the destruction of the wells which it was practicable to save. The ground of the defendant’s liability is negligence, the want of reasonable care, under the circumstances, for the rights of others.</p>

We then said, if the injury was plainly to be anticipated, and was easily prevented by the exercise of reasonable care at a reasonable cost, the plaintiff was within the exception recognized in all the cases from Wheatley v.
