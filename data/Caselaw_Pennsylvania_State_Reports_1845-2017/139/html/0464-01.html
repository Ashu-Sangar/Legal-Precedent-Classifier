The car had just left Frankford station, on its trip to Cumberland street station, where the passengers change to go farther down town. The plaintiff found the rear platform crowded, passed through the car, also full of passengers, and got upon the front platform, taking a position with one foot upon the step of the car and leaning back against the dasher, opposite a companion in the same position with respect to the platform but leaning against the front of the car. The brakeman and conductor testified that they directed the boys to go into the car, but they refused; the boys, however, denied that they had been so di<a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>rected. When the car neared the Cumberland street station, the brakeman got off to turn the switch, and, before the car stopped, the closed door to the front platform opened and the passengers, eager to catch the first car down town, rushed out upon the platform and down therefrom, pushing the plaintiff in such a way that he was thrown under the wheels and his leg crushed.</p>
