The learned counsel for defendant does not impeach the constitutionality of the act, but contends that it does not cover the acts of defendant in this case; that the provision of the thirty-third section of the act, that in all cases of “ the violation of each or any of the foregoing sections of this act, the possession of the game.or birds, .provided for or so mentioned, shall be prima facie evidence of the violation of said act,” shows that it was not intended to make the possession of the game during the prohibited period an offence.</p>

But the defendant has not brought himself within any of these exceptions.

If it is lawful to kill the quail, how can it be unlawful to have those identical quail in one’s possession? The provision in § 33 of the act of 1878, that the possession of the game, fishes, birds, etc., mentioned, “ shall be prima facie evidence of the violation of said act,” assumes and recognizes that a person may lawfully receive, possess, expose for sale, and even kill quail, etc., out of season, notwithstanding § 9. Therefore, by the terms of the act, there can be a defence, even if a person does kill, or expose for sale, or have in his possession quail between December 15th and the first day of November next following; and what more competent or logical defence than that the game was killed and sold in another state, where its killing and sale were lawful?</p>

The act itself provides for him an independent defence, and declares him not guilty at all; provides a defence that would absolutely protect him if § 33 had never been enacted. We suggest, also, that to construe the act in accordance with the commonwealth’s claim, would be to impinge upon the inter-state commerce laws, in effect prohibiting the importation of game during the time specified, thus violating § 8, article I. of the constitution of the United States: Bowman v.

The argument that, because in fourteen places the operations of the act are limited to this state, therefore § 9 should be limited to quail killed within the state, is clearly fallacious. Nor is the position that § 33 would be insensible unless the act were held to apply only to game killed within the state, borne out by a careful reading of it. In various sections exceptions are made of game, etc., killed for certain purposes or in certain places.. It is to these cases that § 33 applies, rendering possession prima facie evidence of guilt, but allowing the defendant to overcome this prima facie case by evidence bringing him within one or other of the exceptions.</p>

Such a regulation, on the contrary, is clearly within the police powers of the state, which may give or withhold such privileges in regard to game as may seem proper, and is constitutional.

The jury found specially that he had in his possession for sale, and exposed for sale, in the city of Pittsburgh, on January 8, 1890, twenty quail; but they also found “ that said quail were not killed in the state of Pennsylvania, but were ordered by telegraph, by the defendant, from a firm in St. Louis, Mo., where it was at the time lawful to kill and sell said quail; that said quail were so ordered on December 28, 1889, and were delivered by the Adams Express Company and paid for December 30,1889, by defendant.” Upon this state of facts, the court below entered judgment for the commonwealth upon the verdict, and sentenced the defendant to pay a fine of $200 to the commonwealth, or, in default thereof, to undergo an imprisonment for 200 days.</p>

L. 161, which, as amended by §1, act of April 25, 1889, P. L. 53, enacts that “ No person shall kill or expose for sale, or have in his or her possession after the same has been killed, any quail or Virginia partridge, between the fifteenth day of December in any year and the first day of November next following, under a penalty of ten dollars for each <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>bird so killed, exposed for sale, or had in possession.” By the thirty-third section of said act it is provided: “ In all cases of arrests made for the violation of each or any of the foregoing sections of this act, the possession of the game, fishes, birds, animals, fowls, nets, or other devices provided for or so mentioned, shall be prima facie evidence of the violation of said act.”</p>
    <p id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[211,763,1168,1307]]]'>The manifest object of this act was the preservation of game within this commonwealth. We cannot assume that it was intended 'to preserve game elsewhere, and it would be a forced construction to hold that it was intended to exclude from our markets quail and other game killed in other states, where by the laws of those states the killing of them was lawful. A careful reading of the language of the act shows that it applies only to game killed in this state out of season. “No person shall kill.any quail.” This means that no person shall kill quail within this commonwealth, except during the period allowed by law. The law was not intended to have any extra-territorial effect, and, if it was, it would be nugatory. After prohibiting the killing of quail, the act further declares : “ Or have in his or her possession after the same has been killed,” etc. What does the word “same’’here refer to? Clearly the antecedent game, the killing of which had already been prohibited. The meaning of the act, as we view it, is that no quail shall be killed, in this state, between the dates specified, and no person shall have in his possession or offer for sale any quail so killed in this state. The construction claimed for the act, by the commonwealth, would render any one a criminal who lawfully killed quail in another state, and brought them here for his own use. It would be prima facie evidence of a violation of the act, and if he could not show as a defence that he killed them outside the commonwealth, he would have no defence at all.</p>
