There was no direct evidence that the conductor saw the boy on the car, but the negligence alleged against the defendant company, was in permitting' the dangerous obstruction to remain upon the street, in such close proximity to its roadbed, and in allowing the plaintiff, a child of tender years, .to remain in such a dangerous position.</p>
