What the parties wanted and practically obtained was an inter-pleader, by which each of the parties were so put upon the record and made parties to the suit as that their several claims might be heard and determined in one suit. The evidence taken by the referee shows that such was the purpose of the trial before him, at least while Mr. Bigham represented Mr. Patrick’s interest. In the absence of the papers containing the agreement entered into by the parties, we must resort to presumptions, and assume, till the contrary appears, that the actual agreement was regular, such as under the evidence, taken without objection, would be consistent with it, and such as the referee says in his report it was.</p>
