Bunting against Robert Hog,sett, to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by negligence. On the same day, a summons in a like action, brought by Phcebe J. Bunting, wife of H. C. Bunting, against the same defendant, was served. Issue having been joined in each of these cases, they were tried together on October 21, 1889, when the following facts were shown:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b388-6" data-blocks='[["BL_388.7",388,[275,1041,1159,1056]]]'>On October 13,1883, Mr. and Mrs. Bunting were passengers upon a train proceeding upon the Southwest Pennsylvania railroad toward Uniontown. That railroad was crossed, at two points, near Lemont furnace, in Fayette county, by a private coke railroad, owned and operated by the defendant. After making the first crossing, the coke road described a semicircle and then re-crossed the track of the railroad company, the two intersections being 646 feet apart. When the train in which the plaintiffs were traveling approached the first crossing, a “ dinkey engine ” of the defendant, pushing a coke ear, was upon the semicircular part of the defendant’s track, backing toward the same crossing. The engineer of the dinkey engine was inexperienced, and had no watch or time card. The passenger train was hidden from his view by a heap of slag and cinder, dumped upon the defendant’s property, until it arrived at the crossing, and until then the defendant’s engineer was ignorant of its approach. The engineer of the passenger train did not see the dinkey engine until the same time. The testimony was conflicting as to whether the whistle of the passenger engine was sounded before it reached the crossing, aud also as to whether the defendant’s engineer whistled.</p>

There was testimony tending to show that this collision caused the rear truck of the coach to leave the rails, though this fact was in dispute. It was undisputed, <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>however, that this track was on the rails when the train was afterwards stopped. When the collision occurred, a brakeman on the passenger train pulled the cord operating the air brakes of the train, and the engineer put on the air from the engine. The result was to bring the train to a full stop, on the second crossing of the defendant’s road. There was testimony tending to show that the use of the automatic cord rendered the release of the train from the brakes a matter of greater difficulty, requiring more time than if the engineer alone had operated the brakes.</p>

The throttle of that engine became re-opened, presumably as the result of the jarring incident to the collision, and the engine started back along the semicircular piece of track toward the second crossing. The defendant’s engineer, being unable to get upon his engine again, motioned to the engineer of the passenger train, which had stopped and was standing upon that crossing, to pull away from it; but this the latter was unable to do in time, and the dinkey engine, running round the arc formed by defendant’s track, struck the middle coach of the passenger train in which the plaintiffs were sitting.

Bunting had produced a permanent diminution in his earning power, and showing his expectancy of life according to the tables of mortality, the defendant put in evidence the testimony of two physicians who had examined him. One of the witnesses, Dr. Walker, testified that he had come to the conclusion, as the result of an examination made in October, 1883, that Mr. Bunting was suffering from “kidney trouble,” although the witness at that time made no test of his urine; that a few days before the trial the witness made such a test, and it disclosed the presence of albumen, showing the <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>existence of Brigbt’s disease. The other witness, Dr. Ewing, testified that, having made an examination of his urine, the witness believed Mr. Bunting to be suffering from Bright’s disease. On cross-examination Dr. Ewing testified as follows:</p>

What portion of the spine might be injured, to produce the symptoms that appear now ? A. The lower part. The lumbar vertebrae; that is, the lower part of the back. Q. Are the symptoms of disease, which appear in Henry Bunting now, apparently of long standing? A. Some of the symptoms may have continued for a long time, and some may not.

[But, if it was his negligence that caused the accident at the first crossing, if he did not act in a proper way, if he did not use proper care and his <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>negligence caused the accident, then it was not right for him to jump, although he was in danger; but his jumping from it would have no effect one way or the other.

From the nature of the ground, the fact that the railroad company was upon its own track, the conformation o,f the ground being well known to defendant’s employees, and, under all the circumstances, I do not think that that principle applies. [The principles embodied in the points submitted by defendant’s counsel, that the dinkey engineer could not reasonably be supposed to know the consequences of his act, and the stopping of the passenger train on the second crossing being an extraordinary matter, I do not think arise in these cases, and I so instruct you. If you find, as alleged by the plaintiffs, that the defendant’s employee was guilty of negligence, under the facts proven, in running into the train at the upper crossing, and that he jumped from the engine, and somehow or other it got reversed and went down the track and struck the train again at the second crossing, then I say to you that the defendant is liable in damages.] 7</p>

My impression of the evidence is that both of these crossings are remarkably dangerous places. That, however, is a matter entirely for you, and my impression does not bind you. If you believe it was the fault of the railroad employees, in not whistling where they should have whistled, and that that caused the accident at the first crossing, and that in that view of the case the engineer jumped from the dinkey and it happened, the defendant is not liable at all. But, as I said before, if the engineer of the dinkey was guilty of negligence, if he did not do his duty under the circumstances, and caused the accident at the first crossing and then jumped from <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>bis engine, which became reversed and ran down and injured these people at the second crossing, they are entitled to recover. It depends upon that, in my view of this case, and here I have no opinion to offer you. You heard the testimony on both sides.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[246,639,1170,744]]]'>Now, the next question is that of damages. If you find for the defendant, you say, we find for the defendant. But, if you should take the view that there was negligence on the part of the defendant, through his employees, at this time, which caused the accident to these people, then the last question would be, What is the rule of damages ? The rule has been stated correctly by the learned counsel, but I will give it to you again. In the case of the lady, Mrs. Bunting, the rule is very well laid down by a point put to the court, and I cannot do better than read it to you: . “ If the jury find for the plaintiff under the instructions of the court, the measure of damages is such sum as shall in their sound discretion com■pensate her for her pain and suffering and ill health, so far as the same has resulted from the injuries sustained in the collision.” That is the correct rule.</p>

In his case, if you believe his evidence, he has paid some five hundred dollars for expenses, for medicine, and for medicinal attention, etc. He is entitled to that; that is compensation. [He is entitled to a reasonable sum, as is his wife, as compensation for the pain and suffering endured, but not by way of punishment; that belongs to another court. He is also entitled to compensation for the loss of earning power during the expectancy of his life. That is one of the most difficult things to determine, but you have to use simply your good judgment, for the reason that you cannot tell how long a man may live, you cannot tell whether he will live the full expectancy of his life. No one can tell that. While he was injured by the accident, he still might have had a disease that would shorten his life anyhow, and if there is proof of that, as there is proof in this ease that he had Bright’s disease, and that was not occasioned or hardly could be occasioned by this accident, you will take that into consideration, and consider whether, by reason of that, his expectancy of life is not shortened very much from what the tables that have been <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>given, in evidence show. It is alleged that his expectancy of life could not be as shown in the tables, because physicians certify he has Bright’s disease. Your experience in life will tell you that that is a very dangerous disease, and if it was not caused by this accident, — and it is not pretended it was, — you will take that into consideration in determining the loss of his earning power during the time which he may be expected to live'.] a I cannot help you upon that point any more than to thus direct your sound judgment and good sense to these matters.</p>

It appears that a railroad track was used in connection with the furnace, and that what is called a dinkey engine was operated thereon, in furnishing supplies of stock, ore, and coke to the furnace. The furnace track, in running out from the furnace to the coke ovens, forms, as it were, the arc of a circle, and the railroad track, crossing the furnace track twice, subtends the arc as a chord.</p>

It is unnecessary, therefore, to refer to the evidence bearing upon that question. The appellant’s contention is, however, that, as the plaintiff’s injuries were not received in that collision, but <em>in </em>the collision which subsequently occurred at the other extremity of the chord, the negligence of the engineer, under the circumstances, cannot be regarded as the proximate, but as the remobe cause of the injury. Ordinarily, the question* of proximate cause is for the jury; but, where the facts are not in dispute, the determination of that question is for the court: West Mahanoy Tp. v.

      <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>It is conceded that in the first collision, although no one was injured, the rear truck of the rear coach of the passenger train was derailed. The brakeman pulled the automatic cord which operates the air brakes. The engineer put on the air from the engine, and, the truck having regained the track, the train, which consisted of three cars, came to a full stop, with the middle car standing upon the second crossing. The engineer of the dinkey says that, about the time of, or immediately before the collision, he reversed his engine, shut off the steam, and fearing that they would be crushed, both the engineer and the fireman jumped from it to the ground. By some means, however, presumably by the jar of the collision, the throttle was re-opened, and the dinkey at once started with some speed around the arc to the second crossing, where it came in collision with. the middle coach, in which the plaintiff was riding. The injuries complained of were received in this second collision. The appellant’s contention is that the throttle having been closed before Leehan, the engineer, left the dinkejq the second collision, under all the circumstances, could not have been foreseen by him, as the natural and probable consequence of his conduct, and that, being in fear of his life, he had a right to quit the engine for a place of safety. It may be, perhaps, that the engineer and fireman, being under actual apprehension of great bodily harm, were, in any criminal aspect of the case., justified in leaping from the engine to save themselves, even if in so doing they should put in jeopardy the lives of others. But, assuming this to be so, it must be remembered that it was their own negligence which put them in fear of their lives, and constrained them to leap from the engine and submit it, without control, to the consequences of the collision. They will be justified, perhaps, as we have said, in saving themselves, but it does not follow that either they, or their employer, would not be held for the negligent act which not only put them in peril but resulted in personal injury to the plaintiff.</p>

We do not know that the throttle was opened by the jar of the collision, only from the fact that it was liable to be so, and the engineer will be presumed to have foreseen what was liable to occur.

The authorities in England, and the great current of authority in this country, are against it. The cases are collected in Dean v. Railroad Co., supra.

What was there said was given as an individual opinion, merely, and was, to some extent, perhaps, obiter dictum, but we are now unanimously of opinion that the views, there expressed somewhat in advance, contain a proper exposition of the law. The identification of the passenger with the negligent driver, or the owner, or with the carrier, as the case may be, without his co-operation or encouragement, is a gratuitous assumption. As Mr. Justice Field said, in Little v. Hackett, <a href="/us/116/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="116 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="3516269" data-case-paths="/us/116/0366-01">116 U. S. 366</a>, “ There is no such identity. The parties are not in the same position. The owner of a public conveyance is a carrier, and the driver, or the person managing it, is <em>Ms </em>servant; neither of them is the servant of the passenger, and his asserted identity with them is contradicted by the daily experience of the world.” The rationale of the rule of Thorogood v. Bryan is expressly disavowed in our own case of Lockhart v. Lich-tenthaler, and it is now rejected as untenable, and wholly indefensible.</p>

If a person is injured by the concurrent and contributory negligence of two persons, one of them being at the time the common carrier of his person, there is no reason, founded in public policy or otherwise, which should release one of them and hold the other. It is true, the carrier may be subjected to a higher degree of care than his co-tortfeasor, but this affords no reason why either or both of them should not be held to that degree of care, respectively, which the law imposes upon them, and to be answerable in damages accordingly. The general rule undoubtedly is, if a person suffers injury from the joint negligence of two parties, and both are negligent in a manner which contributes to the <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>injury, they are liable jointly and severally, and it would seem in principle to be a matter of no consequence that one of them is a common carrier.
