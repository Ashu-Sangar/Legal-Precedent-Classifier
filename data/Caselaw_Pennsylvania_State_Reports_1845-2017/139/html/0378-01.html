Drew’s line can be located, but another line “ to be fixed ” with said frontage to make two acres, shows that the line was not then determined upon; and the agreement gives no means of determining where it shall start or how long it shall be, so as to include the two acres.

In the construction of contracts equity follows the law; and, therefore, this agreement will have in this case, as it would have in a court of law, a fair reading, and not a strained one. It is not necessary that the description of the land should be so full as to be completely known by a mere reading of the language: Pomeroy on Specif. Perf., § <em>152; </em>Waterman on Specif. Perf., § 144. Certainty to a common intent is sufficient: 2 Lead. Cas. Eq., 1030. And the court will look at the spirit of the contract to determine its meaning: Herdic’s App., <a href="/pa/58/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="58 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="1013175" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0211-01">58 Pa. 211</a>. Our position is, that the words “ another line to be fixed,” mean nothing more nor less than a survey of its location on the ground, and a calculation of its length, so that with the other lines mentioned it may bound the two acres. There <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>was a contract completed, except the ascertainment of the location of one line and the calculation of the length of the side lines. Therefore, if the court has the means at hand to ascertain the location, the maxim, Id certum est quod certum reddi potest, applies, and specific performance should be decreed : Bispham’s Eq., § 377; Fry on Specif. Perf., § 207; Herdic’s App., <a href="/pa/58/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="58 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="1013175" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0211-01">58 Pa. 211</a>. If the court had given this writing to any surveyor, he would not have had a particle of difficulty in locating the two acres agreed to be surveyed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b405-4" data-blocks='[["BL_405.5",405,[204,847,1164,1258]]]'>2. But, assuming the correctness of the defendant’s view, that the contract as signed was not a complete one, still, if what was left to be done can be done by the court, consistently with the contract, specific performance will not be refused: Yandoren v. Bobinson, 1 Green N. J. Eq. 256; Milnes v. Gery, 14 Yes. 401. In those cases, it was held that a contract to sell “ at a fair price ” could be specifically enforced. The only difference between them and the case in hand is, that there the price was to be fixed and here a line is to be fixed. Therefore, there would have been nothing inconsistent with either the letter or the spirit of this agreement, had the court sent a surveyor out to fix the location, or adopted any means suited for that purpose. But, if we assume that something material to a completed contract was postponed for future settlement, it was the duty of the defendant to meet the plaintiff for that purpose, which it is admitted he refused to do. So far as appears, he has no objection to the line fixed by the plaintiff, but if he have any, our offer to accept any other line fixed by him removes all reason for a strict application of the statute of frauds: Story’s Eq. J., § 770; and makes it the fault of the defendant himself if any uncertainty or indefiniteness remain in the agreement, and such indefiniteness he cannot set up to defeat specific performance: Fry on Specif. Perf., § 207; Bispham’s Eq., § 377; Pritchard v. Ovey, 1 J. &amp; W. 396.</p>

If he is right as to his facts, his conclusion is accurate. The description is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b406-4" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[245,537,1172,505]]]'>“A piece of ground situate in Mifflin township, county of Allegheny, and state of Pennsylvania, having a front of four hundred feet on West’s run township road; starting at the corner of land now belonging to Frederick Drew, thence running along said township road towards the Pittsburgh, Virginia &amp; Charleston railroad, said distance of four hundred feet, and extending back along line of said Drew and another line to be fixed, sufficient, with said frontage, to make two acres of land; being a part of a larger tract of land now belonging to D. K. Calhoon, Esq.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.6",406,[246,1052,1169,806]]]'>The object of the description is to identify the land with certainty. The learned judge was of opinion that, because one line remained to be fixed, it was impossible to identify it. If, however, the contract contains the means by which the lines can be run and marked out, the difficulty disappears. Id cer-tum est quod certum reddi potest. The plain meaning of the contract is this: The lot is to have a front of four hundred feet on West’s run township road. It is then to run back, of that width, along Frederick Drew’s land, to a depth sufficient to make two acres. How far it must go to make two acres, can be ascertained with mathematical precision. A competent surveyor could run the lines, and locate the unfixed line, in an hour. It is evident that when the parties drew the agreement they did not know how deep the lot must be to give the two acres; that was left to be fixed by a survey. The case is too plain to require elaboration.</p>
    <p id="b406-6" data-blocks='[["BL_406.7",406,[508,1868,905,195]]]'>The decree sustaining the demurrer is reversed, at the cost of the appellee; the bill is reinstated ; and it is now ordered that a decree be entered for the plaintiff upon the demurrer.</p>
