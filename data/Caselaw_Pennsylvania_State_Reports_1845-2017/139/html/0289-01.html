The second count charged that the defendant company, “through the said general superintendent, Elliott Holbrook,” on December 20,1887, and January 9,1888, respectively, caused to be published in a newspaper called the Pittsburgh Times certain libelous articles the substance whereof was that the plaintiff, and other employees of - said company, had been guilty of dishonest conduct, robbing the company and appropriating the money to their own use.

That department, and the names of the persons constituting it, had regularly been called to the attention of the public, by advertisments, posters, etc., relating to the sale of tickets. In the month stated, Holbrook was specially authorized by the company to institute an investigation of the passenger-ticket department, and to take such steps as might be necessaiy for that purpose; and on December 19,1887, he began proceedings by suspending all the officers and employees, composing that department, and put their offices, accounts and papers in the charge of persons employed to conduct the investigation. On the day last mentioned, the city editor of the Pittsburgh Times detailed H. C. Green, a reporter for that newspaper, to interview Holbrook in regard to this matter, communicating to Green some information upon the subject, without naming the source from which it had come. Green called upon Holbrook, introduced himself as a reporter from the Times, repeated some of the information received from the citjr editor, and proceeded to question him about it. Holbrook was guarded and reluctant to talk, but gave Green information as to the status of the affair, the substance of which was that no one was accused of defrauding the company as yet, but that the business of the passenger-ticket department was to be investigated, to ascertain whether there had been any irregularities therein. On the following morning, the Times published an article which in-<a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>eluded the substance of Green’s interview with Holbrook, but went further and intimated the existence of delinquencies in the passenger-ticket department, mentioning that the plaintiff and other officials in that department had been suspended.</p>

Reed, the reporter who wrote that article, testified that Holbrook took exception, after its publication, to the correctness of certain parts of it purporting to give statements made by him, but that it accurately set forth the substance of the language used by him, in the interview, and that the facts therein communicated to the wit-ness were given in response to a request for them, made by him on behalf of the Times.</p>

As to the first count of the statement of claim, we contend that a railroad 'company has no right publicly to suspend, pending an investigation, without afterwards either announcing the innocence of the party suspended or sustaining the charge; that, having suspended in such manner as to lead to the belief that the suspension was the result of charges of dishonest conduct, it has no right to discharge without explanation and in such a manner as to lead the public to believe that the discharge is the result of the investigation conducted during the suspension; and that it cannot suspend maliciously, unnecessarily and with<a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>out probable cause, and in such an injurious, harsh and oppressive manner as to cause it to be inferred that the suspension was the result of charges of dishonest conduct; and the demurrer admits that this was done in the present cas.e.

The inquiry, then, narrows itself down to the question whether the act of the servant was done by the authority of the corporation, and the evidence is insufficient to establish either an express or an implied authority to Holbrook from the company to make the publications. In all the cases in which corporations have been held for libel, the publication has been by order of either the board of directors or of an official having express authority to make it. But, it is submitted that the proof was not sufficient to connect Holbrook with the publication of the articles in question by showing that he ever “requested, procured, or commanded ” the publication of either of them. The utmost that was shown was the communication of corrections of unfounded information which the newspaper reporters already had.</p>

It was further alleged that the said Elliott Holbrook was the highest officer of the company in <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>Pittsburgh, and had general authority to give the public whatever information he saw fit, in reference to the affairs of the road; to decide what information was proper to be so given, and to speak for the company generally in reference to the affairs of the road coming within his department; and that he personally conducted and controlled the investigation aforesaid.</p>
    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[234,708,1162,911]]]'>It appeared that the plaintiff was in the employ of the defendant company, as traveling passenger-agent, in the passenger-ticket department. By reason of alleged irregularities in this department, the general superintendent, in the year 1887, suspended all the employees therein, pending an investigation. The right to do this was not, and could not well be disputed, without a greater shock to ■ the relations of employer and employee than we are disposed to sanction. A railroad corporation, or an individual, may discharge an employee with or without cause, at pleasure, unless restrained by some contract; so that I do not see that the questions of malice and want of probable cause have anything to do with the case. If an employer, in discharging a clerk or other employee, casts an unjust imputation upon his character, that is quite another matter, for which he might be held responsible. In this case, no aspersion appears to have been cast upon plaintiff’s character, except such as might be inferred from his suspension. No charge was made against him.</p>
    <p id="b321-5" data-blocks='[["BL_321.6",321,[238,1626,1162,805]],["BL_322.1",322,[245,400,1159,400]]]'>The other charge, that the railroad company was responsible for-a libel published by its general superintendent, is yet more novel. It would certainly be carrying the doctrine of respondeat superior to an extreme length. The doctrine is hard enough as it is, and we are not disposed to push it further. There was not a scintilla of testimony to show that the company published a libel, authorized any one else to do so, dr knew that it had been done. It appears that when it became known that irregularities were supposed to exist in the ticket department of the company, a number of reporters, with the irrepressible enterprise for which they are somewhat celebrated, proceeded, in their own way, to investigate the matter and lay the fruits thereof before the public through the Pittsburgh newspapers. But there was no evidence that these articles were dictated or even inspired by the company, or by Mr. Hol-brook. That he was beset by the reporters for information is <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>certain; that he gave very little, and that very reluctantly, is equally certain. And even if he furnished all the information which the plaintiff imputes to him, it would not make him responsible for a libel, unless he went one step further, and procured its publication. Of this there was no evidence. The proprietors of the respective newspapers may or may not.be responsible in damages for the publication; the defendant company and Mr. Holbrook clearly aré not.</p>
