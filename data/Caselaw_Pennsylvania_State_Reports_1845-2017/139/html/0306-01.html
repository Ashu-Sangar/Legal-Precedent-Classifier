Harper and George Shiras, Jr., executors of the estate of William Morrison, deceased, showing a balance due the estate of 1125,095.88, was called for audit. At the hearing, it was made to appear that William Morrison died leaving a will dated February 5, 1887, duly admitted to probate on February 3, 1890, containing a paragraph bequeathing legacies to nephews and nieces “ living in different parts of the country,” whose names and residences he was not able to state, -with certain alternative dispositions.

    <blockquote id="b331-10" data-blocks='[["BL_331.12",331,[193,1973,1161,451]],["BL_332.1",332,[257,383,1160,300]]]'>“ I have a number of nephews and nieces living in different parts of the country, and whose names and places of residence I am not able to state accurately.

    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[259,690,1159,395]]]'>When the will was executed, twenty-six of testator’s nephews and nieces were living. Three others, one of whom was the mother of appellants, had previously died, leaving children. The only question was, whether, under the provisions of the paragraph above quoted, appellants were entitled to participate in the distribution. The Orphans’ Court was of the opinion that they were not, and hence their claim as distributees was rejected.</p>
    <p id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[260,1092,1159,393]]]'>The only error assigned is the refusal of the court to distribute to appellants the sum of 110,000. There is no apparent reason why the testator should discriminate in favor of the children of such nephews and nieces as were living at the date of his will, and against the children of those who died <em>before; </em>nor is it necessary that any reason should he shown. If it clearly appears that such was his intention, further inquiry is unwarranted.</p>
    <p id="b332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_332.7",332,[261,1501,1165,906]],["BL_333.1",333,[197,402,1163,646]]]'>The language employed by the testator is plain and unambiguous, and cannot, by any recognized rule of construction, be made to embrace either the appellants or their deceased mother. In the first place, he says he has “a number of nephews and nieces living in different parts of the country,” whose names and places of residence he is “ not able to state accurately.” In making that declaration, he manifestly had in mind nephews and nieces then living. No reference whatever is made to deceased nephews or nieces, or their surviving children. The language is so plain, and so entirely free from anything like ambiguity, that we are forced to the conclusion that he meant nephews and nieces then in esse. They, and they alone, appear to be primarily the objects of his intended bounty in the clause under consideration. To each of them he bequeaths the sum of $10,000; and then, in the same line of thought, it occurs to him that some of those beneficiaries may pre-decease him, and, to provide for that contingency, the substitutionary bequest to their children is made. In case any of the said <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>nephews and nieces die leaving no children, then the legacy is to go equally to the remaining nephews and nieces. Again; in specifying the contingency in which “ such legacy or legacies shall lapse,” and in directing his executors “ to make all reasonable efforts to communicate with all my said nephews and nieces,” etc., he must have meant, exclusively, nephews and nieces living at the time the will was executed. In every reference to the objects of his bounty, and in every provision contained in the paragraph under consideration, that thought is clearly and prominently presented. If he had intended to provide for the surviving children of nephews or nieces who died before the will was made, he would doubtless have done so in language that could not be misunderstood.</p>
    <p id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[196,1065,1163,135]]]'>Any other conclusion than that reached by the court below would have been contrary to the well-settled rules of construction.</p>
