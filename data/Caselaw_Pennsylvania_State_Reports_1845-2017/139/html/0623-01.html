But the defendant is not the city. He could not of his own will, and according to his caprice, abandon, postpone or prosecute, upon plans not approved by his principal. His second advertisement was a manifest attempt to deprive the plaintiffs of the benefit of their bid under the first advertisement, without any cause. The variation in the specifications effected no real change, the first specifications having provided that “ the estimated quantities may be increased or decreased,” and having bound the contractor “ to adopt any change of plans that may be deemed advisable.” His excuse that, by opening the sealed bids and giving others the benefit of the unsealing, a saving was effected, is not a legal justification. And the illegal act of the defendant was the act of himself as an individual officer, not authorized by the city, and the liability is his alone.

If he had accepted any one of the first bids, he was bound by law to give the contract to the “ lowest responsible bidder,” and a court of equity would have enjoined him from doing otherwise. But if, upon opening these bids, he believed them to be extravagant in amount, or the work, upon the basis of the specifications, to be unwise and against the public interest, it was his right to refuse them <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>all, and to invite other proposals, upon the same and other specifications, which would give the city the option to award the contract according to the public interest. In the honest, and judicious exercise of this discretion, we cannot see upon what principle of the law he could render himself individually liable to the lowest or to any other bidder, for no one is legally entitled to the contract until it is legally awarded to him : Commonwealth v. Mitchell, <a href="/pa/82/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="82 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1047925" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0343-01">82 Pa. 343</a>. The submission of a sealed bid or proposal to the city for the furnishing of labor or materials, under the statute, is in all respects similar in its legal effect to a bid at an auction sale, where the seller is bound by law to sell to the highest and best bidder. The bid is a mere offer to buy at the price named, and may be retracted at any time before it is accepted; and it follows, of course, that the vendor has the same right to reject the offer and withdraw the article from sale, that the bidder has to withdraw his bid. But it must be rejected before acceptance, and not afterwards. In this case, the director of public works expressly reserved the right, and, without having previously accepted any of them, he rejected all.</p>

No matter that the bidding disclosed the financial inability of the municipality to complete the work; no matter that a proper economy, in view of the amount of money required, demanded a modification of the contract, or a postponement, or even the entire abandonment of the scheme, if the appellant’s contention is correct the work must go on, the lowest bidder being legally entitled under his offer. If the law were so declared, then, indeed, $vould the city be in a helpless state ; for, if bidders should come to an understanding beforehand, it might be obliged to pay for labor and materials the most extravagant and enormous amounts, thus providing a fund, for distribution among themselves, far in excess of any reasonable profit.</p>

But, in Commonwealth v. Mitchell, <a href="/pa/82/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="82 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1047925" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0343-01">supra,</a> a writ of mandamus was refused to the lowest bidder, upon the ground that the act imposes duties that are deliberative and discretionary, and that, as this discretion appeared to have been exercised according to the best judgment of the officer in whom this function was lodged, a writ of mandamus could not be granted. To the same effect are the cases of Findley v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20Pa.%20851" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="82 Pa. 851">82 Pa. 851</a>; Douglass v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/108/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="108 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="539254" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0559-01">108 Pa. 559</a>; Yealy v. Fink, <a href="/pa/43/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="43 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="483173" data-case-paths="/pa/43/0212-01">43 Pa. 212</a>; and Burton v.

    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.6",655,[207,1661,1170,555]]]'>The director of public works had an undoubted right, in the exercise of his judgment and discretion, and acting in good faith in the interest of the city, to refuse to accept any of the bids tendered on May 31, 1887. Having done so, he had a right at another time to solicit other bids upon the same and upon different specifications, and to accept the lowest of all the bids, by a responsible bidder, under the specifications which he should regard as most favorable to the public interest. His judgment could not be coerced by mandamus, nor was his discretion to be exercised under the fear of individual responsibility for the prospective profits of disappointed bidders.</p>
    <p id="b655-6" data-blocks='[["BL_655.7",655,[852,2221,481,45]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
