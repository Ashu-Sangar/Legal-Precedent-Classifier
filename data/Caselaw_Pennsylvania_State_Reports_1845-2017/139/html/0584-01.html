The garnishee having admitted the possession of income, held under the trust created by Mrs. Smith, to an amount greater than the plaintiff’s judgment, no recourse was attempted to be had against either the corpus of that trust-estate, or the moneys coming from the trust under the will of Mrs. Cather-wood, and the sole question now presented is the liability to attachment of the income of the property conveyed to the garnishee by Mrs. Smith before her4 marriage. The decision of the court below is not based upon any construction of the language of the trust deed, but, on the contrary, overrides and subverts its intention, and can be sustained only upon the ground that the trust is invalid, as in contravention of public policy or in violation of the statute 18 Eliz., c. 5. As has often been held, the statute of Elizabeth was really declaratory of the law, and therefore there is but one question presented, to wit: whether it is contrary to the policy of the law that a young girl, on attaining majority but without immediate contemplation of marriage, should be able to settle her patrimony so that the income shall not be subject to her husband’s control, or her own anticipation, or to his or her debts.</p>

It will be most unfortunate, in many respects, if such <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>settlements be declared invalid. Experience has shown their necessity, to preserve for the wife and her children the income of her estate in all vicissitudes of fortune, and that it is vrise for young ladies to make such provisions, before contracting marriage engagements, when the consent of the future husband is not required. Although the law may be otherwise in England, it is well settled in Pennsylvania that such settlements may be made for the beneficiary, male or female, by a donor or devisor, and no other class of trusts is so favored by our courts : Fisher v. Taylor, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%2035" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 R. 35">2 R. 35</a>; Eberly’s App., <a href="/pa/110/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="110 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="543765" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0095-01">110 Pa. 95</a>; Phila.

It cannot be doubted that the young girl’s father might have so settled her estate, and it probably would not seriously be disputed that, after betrothal, she and her intended husband might safely have so limited it by a marriage settlement.

A theory has been advanced, and is sought to be supported by the English cases and Mackason’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Pa.%20880" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="42 Pa. 880">42 Pa. 880</a>, to the effect that “ a man cannot so settle his estate, that he shall have the benefit of the income thereof during his life and the disposal thereof after his death, and yet so that it shall not be liable to his creditors.” We contend that this doctrine, as thus broadly stated is not law in Pennsylvania. The English rule is even broader, and goes to the extent that a trust cannot be created by which the beneficiary shall enjoy the income during life, with a power of disposition after death, which shall keep the property beyond the reach of creditors : Brandon v. Robinson, 18 Ves. 429; Adams’ Eq., *42; Bispham’s Eq., § 62; Perry on Trusts, 555; and this certainly is not law with us, our books being full of spendthrift trusts carefully upheld and protected. The distinction between trusts created by ancestors, and those created by the man himself, for himself and his family, is without authority, either here or in England. Its only basis is certain obiter dicta in Mackason’s App., supra. The rights of creditors, referred to by Mr. Justice Shabsavood, in Ashhurst’s App., <a href="/pa/77/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="77 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="436277" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0464-01">77 Pa. 464</a>, which cannot be affected by a <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>deed of trust, must be taken to mean rights of creditors existing at the time of its execution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b613-4" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[177,482,1164,1165]]]'>4. But a careful examination of the facts in Mackason’s App., supra, will show that the decision, whether law or not, has no application to the case at bar. It was placed, to some extent, on the ground that an unlimited power to appoint in fee renders the estate assets for the payment of the appointor’s debts, following the English rule on that subject. But that rule .has since been expressly repudiated in Swaby’s App., 14 W. N. 553. Our case is distinguishable from Maekason’s Appeal on several grounds: <em>(a) </em>The deed, in that case, appears to have contained no provision making it irrevocable, and therefore the settlor had power to revoke the trust: Russell’s App., <a href="/pa/75/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="75 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1036625" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0269-01">75 Pa. 269</a>; (6) the remainder was limited substantially to the heirs of the settlor, who thus practically had the entire beneficial interest and full control of the legal title during his life; <em>(e) </em>the attack was made by creditors in that case after the death of the beneficiary, when the purpose of the trust had been fully accomplished; (d) the settlement was made by a man, and not, as in the present case, by a woman, whose natural future was the marriage state, and not the struggle for life in business pursuits, and any considerations of public policy that might exist in the case of a man have no application here. Settlements of this kind were highly commended by Mr. Justice Sharswood, in Ashhurst’s App., <a href="/pa/77/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="77 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="436277" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0464-01">77 Pa. 464</a>.</p>

The appellant’s counsel have not cited, nor can they find, a single ease deciding that the grantor can settle his own property upon himself, so that it will not be liable for his debts. The contrary was expressly decided by this court in Mackason’s App., supra,, and by the lower courts in Lewis v. Miller, 21 W. N. 94; Andress v. Lewis, 17 W. N. 270. It is true that a settlor may make a gift of his property, where a present' interest passes, which is irrevocable as against himself, and valid as to creditors not existing at the time and not intended to be defrauded: Harlan v. Maglaughlin, <a href="/pa/90/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="90 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1065649" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0293-01">90 Pa. 293</a>; Kimble v.

But the income which she never gave away, but retained for herself, does not fall within that rule. It is therefore unnecessary to discuss the question, whether the provision making the deed irrevocable would be sufficient to distinguish the case from Maekason’s Appeal. To say that she may keep her property, or any part of it, and still not have it liable for her debts, is in the teeth of both reason and authority. Her sex should make no difference in this respect.</p>

As to the latter, it was admitted that the provisions of the will protected it from attachment, and there was no contention whatever on that point. The court below entered judgment for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim, out of the income in the garnishees’ hands under the deed of trust, and it is this judgment which is appealed from. The question presented for the consideration of the court is solely as to the liability of the income of the pro-, perty, held by the garnishees under the deed of trust, to attachment for the debts of Mrs. Smith.</p>

No such question arises, and it is not necessary for us to consider the effect of the deed, if the grantor at the time had in contemplation the marriage relation which was afterwards formed.

It is as well settled in Pennsylvania, that it is a lawful purpose, upon part of a father, to protect his bounty to a spendthrift son, both principal and interest, not only against his son’s improvidence, but also against his creditors: Fisher v.

But it has never been held by this court that a person sui juris could settle his entire estate upon himself, free from liability for debts. Indeed, the very contrary has been ruled in Mackason’s App., <a href="/pa/42/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="42 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="481525" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0330-01">42 Pa. 330</a>. In that case, the trustees were to hold the estate of the settlor, free and clear of his debts; to pay the net income, without anticipation, during his life to himself; after his death to his appointee by will, and, in default of an appointment, to his heirs; and it was held that property so settled was assets in the hands of the trustees for the payment of debts, whether contracted prior or subsequent to the execution of the deed of trust, and that the devisees or appointees under the will of the settlor were postponed to his creditors. After stating the facts, this court, in the opinion filed, says :</p>
    <blockquote id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[233,1806,1166,500]]]'>“ This statement brings us to the simple inquiry, can the owner of property so dispose of it for his own use, benefit, and support as to put it beyond the reach of liability for his future debts, he being and continuing sui juris, and there appearing to be no reason therefor, excepting to withdraw it from such liability and thus retain the temporal ownership with its incidents? This would be a startling proposition to affirm. It would revolutionize the credit system entirely, destroy all faith in the apparent ownership of property, and repeal all our statutes and decisions against frauds.”</blockquote>

The power of disposition at death is, in this case, subject to some restriction; but, as this restriction is self-imposed in the deed, it is difficult to see how any distinction can be drawn which will affect the general principle involved. In both cases, not only the purpose, but the only purpose, was that the grantor should enjoy the property, and that it should not be subject to the grantor’s debts. The difference most strongly urged is that the grantor in Mackason’s Appeal was a man, whilst here the grantor is an unmarried woman; but we think no principle or present policy of the law requires any distinction, in this respect, between the sexes. It may be that, if the rights of creditors had not intervened, the trust would be deemed irrevocable, and would be upheld even as against the grantor herself, but as against creditors, either prior or subsequent, the terms of the trust would not avail. In Ashhurst’s App., <a href="/pa/77/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="77 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="436277" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0464-01">77 Pa. 464</a>, a trust was created by Virginia Eyre, an unmarried <em>woman; </em>the incomes of her estate payable to herself as the beneficiary for life but not by way of anticipation, free from the debts, engagements, and liabilities of any husband she might have, and at her death the corpus of the estate to her appointee by will, with an ultimate disposition, in default of an appointment, to the persons entitled under the intestate law, as if the said Virginia had died intestate seised thereof. A bill was filed by the grantor herself, setting forth the terms of the trust, her subsequent marriage, and the death of her husband, averring that the trust was no longer active, and praying for a re-conveyance. . It was held, however, that, as the rights of creditors were not brought in question, the trust was irrevocable, that the grantor was not entitled to a reconveyance, but that the trust must be continued.</p>
