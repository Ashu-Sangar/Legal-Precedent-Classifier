    <p id="b597-4" data-blocks='[["BL_597.5",597,[155,600,1160,402]]]'>We are of opinion that, under this agreement, the sum of five hundred dollars per year was the minimum royalty which Stein was in any event to pay; that his liability therefor did not depend upon the number of jacks sold; that the provision for a surrender of the license was intended for the benefit of the licensors, who might at their option demand its enforcement, while Stein could relieve himself at the end of any current year, by surrendering the license.</p>
    <p id="b597-5" data-blocks='[["BL_597.6",597,[157,1007,1162,503]]]'>This suit was to recover the minimum amount of license for one year, as stipulated for. It is no defence to such demand that Stein, the defendant, had not manufactured and sold any of the jacks, nor that he found he could not do so at a profit. It may not have been a wise thing to bind himself to pay a royalty of five hundred dollars a year for a thing for which he could not find a market. That was a matter which he should have considered before the contract was made. It cannot avail him as a defence to this action. It follows from what has been said that none of the assignments of error can be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b597-6" data-blocks='[["BL_597.7",597,[919,1518,355,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
