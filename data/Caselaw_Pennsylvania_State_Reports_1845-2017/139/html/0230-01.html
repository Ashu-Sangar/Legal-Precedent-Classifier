The gas company, by filing a bond in court on May 14, 1889, had appropriated for its said pipe line, a strip of ground ten feet wide, part of which was underlaid with coal.

In May, 1889, the gas company laid its pipe line, thirty inches in diameter, at a depth of about six feet below the surface. The coal was at an average depth of 23 feet below the pipe line, the greatest depth being 38.1 feet, the crop line being crossed by the pipe on each side of the coal field.

Counsel for the plaintiff offered evidence bearing on that question and presented certain points for the court to instruct you upon. It is the duty of counsel to present any question they think involved in a case, and the duty of the court to answer. It is the duty of the jury to take the law as laid down by the court, and they are bound by it. If I am wrong, counsel can correct me in a higher court. The defendant company has filed a stipulation in this case, releasing the plaintiffs, and their heirs and assigns, from all possible claim for damages in consequence of taking out this coal. It may be true, to a certain extent, that where a pipe line is laid over a man’s farm underlaid with coal, the pipe line company is entitled to some support for their pipe. So it is with a public road passing through a man’s farm. The owner could not excavate the coal, and destroy the public road or make it dangerous to the public; and yet we hardly imagine that the owner of the land is bound to leave several rods in width for an ordinary public road. There would be some accommodation, no doubt, in cases of that kind, because, where there are two different rights in the same matter, the courts will generally find some way of giving effect to both rights. The plaintiffs, in this case, their heirs, assigns or vendees, have a right to take out all the coal under this pipe line, without regard to how it may affect the pipe line. The pipe line has relinquished all claim to any support for their pipe. It is suggested that there majr be leaks and danger in taking out the coal. The company, by relinquishing that right, must make that right effective, and if the coal was being taken out, and there was danger of the pipe line breaking, and resulting in a leakage, the owner of the coal could come into this court, under this act of assembly, which gives the court power in such a case, and upon his request, this court would require the pipe line company to do whatever was necessary to guard against accidents. That is one of the special provisions of the act. Hence, I have excluded all this evidence, on the ground that the company must make their re<a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>lease effective, must do what is necessary to enable the owners of the coal to take it out; and, further than that, they are liable, under this act of assembly, for all damages that may result from their negligence. If they negligently permit their pipes to leak and injure the crops of the farmer, or to injure any person in any way, they are liable in a special action. That is why that cannot be taken into account in this proceeding for the right of way, because the jury would have to guess at it.] 6.</p>

Those were all cases of appropriation and actual occupation of the surface, producing an immediate injury to the landowner. The underlying coal was necessary to the support of the railroad, and human life would have been risked by its removal. In our case, the coal is entirely unnecessary to our easement, was not intended to be taken for support, and was not designated in our bond.

The grantee of the commonwealth may insist on the full measure of support which the law gives him, but it does not follow that he must do so because he can. He must pay for what he takes, but he ought not to be compelled to take and pay for what he does not need, nor to inflict an injury on the owner of the land merely because he has the power to do so. He may, on the contrary, and a proper regard for the rights of others requires that he should, consider and determine, in view of the nature and uses of the structure he is about to put on the lands of the owner, what support he really needs, and release the owner from so much of the burden which his entry imposes as is not necessary for the security of his undertaking.. If he does not do this, he ought to pay, not the value of the coal in place, for the title to the coal does not pass to him, but the depreciation in price of the property by reason of the servitude imposed upon it. If he does release the right of support from the coal or other mineral underlying the surface, then the owner may mine- and remove it as freely and fully as though no entry had been made upon the surface, and for that reason it should not be taken into consideration in adjusting the damages due to the landowner. This was decided in the recent case of Penn Coal Co. v. Gas Co., <a href="/pa/131/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="131 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="810263" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0522-01">131 Pa. 522</a>.</p>

An estoppel ordinarily arises where one person has done or said that which has influenced another in such way as to make it inequitable to change or recall what was so said or done. The evidence does not show that the ap<a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>pellant was misled to his barm by the delay in filing the release. Its only effect, so far as we can discover, was to narrow the contest before the jury to the damages sustained upon the surface. The appellant, assuming that the company desired the support of the surface by the coal, which was from twenty to thirty feet below it, claimed that the coal should be taken into the account. The company replied to this part of the demand with the release of the coal from the servitude. This left the appellant as free to mine his coal as though the surface had not been entered upon, and extinguished all claim for damages growing out of the assumed purpose to require subjacent support. There was no error, therefore, in permitting the release to be filed at the trial.</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[235,1049,1165,1365]],["BL_263.1",263,[199,383,1166,454]]]'>It is now contended, however, that, if the release was properly filed, the danger of the subsidence of the surface after the removal of the coal, the breakage of the pipe line thereby, and the escape of an explosive gas into the mine, is so great as greatly to diminish the value of the coal, and that this is a proper subject of compensation in the assessment of damages. But this overlooks two provisions of the act of May 29, 1885; one, in the tenth section, which makes gas companies liable for all damages arising from negligence in the construction or maintenance of their lines; and another in the twelfth section, which gives the courts power to decide all disputes “as to the manner of laying the pipes, and the character thereof with respect to safety,” upon the petition of any party affected, and provides for the enforcement of the order or decree by injunction. When the owner of the coal desires to remove any considerable portion of that which is under the line, he may apply to the court for such order as may be necessary to provide for the support of the line. After a full hearing, the court may “ define, by its decree, what precautions, if any, shall be taken in the laying of pipes ” for the safety of those then for the first time in a position to be affected. Natural gas can be transported only when the pressure at the wells is so great as to propel it through the lines by which it is delivered to the consumer. It must furnish its own motive power. It is a well-known fact that the pressure of most, if not all producing wells is steadily diminishing. Some pipe lines have already been taken up, because of the failure of gas in the wells that sup <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>plied them. Other lines must soon follow for the same reason, and it is not improbable that the Equitable Gas Company may have no gas to transport by the time the owner will be ready to remove the coal that is now under the line.
