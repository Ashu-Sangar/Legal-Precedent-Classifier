In order to market the coal, there had been constructed a coal railroad from the pit mouth to the river. When Ormsby’s heirs came to make partition of his land, a number of them saw fit to take the coal as tenants in common. With it they took the coal railroad and the twenty-feet strip in the middle of Railroad street on which it was built. By agreement preceding the decree, they required those who did not take the coal with them, as well as themselves for their respective shares, to agree that in addition to the existing coal road they might also have branch roads from, on Carson street, Sidney, Clifton and Wharton streets, which ran at right angles to Railroad street, and on Brown, Oliver, Caroline, Phillips, Page and John streets, which ran parallel with Railroad street, to the river.

As it is admitted that the trustees do not propose to construct the branch for any such purpose, this is begging the question. The master has found, and it really is not denied, that the coal has all substantially been taken out. Mr. Keeling says that he took out most of the coal; that there was a little he did not want to take; and that little has been undisturbed for more than fifteen years. Mr. Patterson says that the coal is worked out. But, even if some small quantity of coal remains which may some day or another be mined, equity would not interfere to aid these trustees in building a railroad on the land of the complainants for a purpose wholly foreign to the removal of that coal, nor would it compel the complainants to remove its tracks and buildings on its own property to enable the trustees to build a branch, in the absence of evidence that there was some reasonable necessity for the occupation of Wharton street in the removal of this coal.</p>

The land allotted to the appellants’ predecessors in title was coal land with an open mine upon it, and a. narrow-gauge railroad on which to convey the coal from the pit mouth to the river. The provisions in the decree which relate to this railroad, and the right to build branch railroads from it, are the source of this contention. The appellants claim that they may, under the branching powers contained in the decree, construct a standard-gauge railroad on Wharton street for general railroad purposes; while the appellees maintain that it was the intention of the parties to the partition to allow the allottees of the coal land to use the railroad then in existence upon it, and to build branches therefrom for the purpose of removing the coal from the tract. It is forty-eight years since the partition was made, and the coal was all mined and removed from the tract twenty years ago. No effort was made to construct a branch railroad until 1887, when the appellants entered upon Wharton street and attempted to build a branch railroad thereon for general purposes. It is not alleged by them that the proposed road is necessary or to be used as an appurtenance to the land allotted to the parties from whom they derive title, but they aver that their branching powers are not appurtenant to that land, nor limited to its needs and uses. It seems clear to us, from the facts found by the learned master, that the purpose of the parties to the partition was to allow the owners of the coal lot facilities for removing and marketing the coal upon it, and that the provisions in the decree relating to railroads were inserted with this object'in view, and are inoperative when it is accomplished. The character of the road then in use, and the number and location of the branches authorized, are in harmony with this conclusion, and in clear conflict with the theory now for the first time advanced <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>by the appellants. A partition of the lands they had inherited from their ancestor was the subject before the parties, and the decree was moulded by their agreement, so as to provide for the convenient and profitable use of the purparts by their respective owners. For nearly fifty years the parties and their successors in title have occupied and used the property in conformity with this construction of the decree. It is a construction which gives effect to the obvious intention of the parties, and is consistent with the terms of the grant when read in the light of the circumstances and conditions affecting the subject of it. We think the learned master has fully vindicated his conclusions by the reasoning and authorities on which his report rests.</p>
