If the claim was a valid claim, then the garnishees have in their hands no funds of Fisher Beatty subject to the execution attachment, and the judgment, therefore, would have been for the defendants. The judgment, however, was against the garnishees, and in disregard of the claim of Beatty. The way to correct the error of the alderman, if error had been committed, would have been by an appeal from the judgment rendered. But no appeal was taken, and no subsequent claim of the exemption was made. On June 6, 1890, or more than a month after the notice of the exemption claim was served, the Knoxville Land Improvement Company issued an execution on their judgment against the garnishees.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b384-8" data-blocks='[["BL_384.9",384,[252,1748,1156,488]]]'>Two reasons seem to be sufficient to settle the rights of the parties: First, the waiver of the exemption in the judgment of the Knoxville land company would preclude the defendant Beatty from setting up the claim to the benefit of the exemption laws in that case. And it follows, as a matter of law, that he could not set it up in the attachment execution issued on the original judgment; second, that the claim was not made on the execution, but upon the judgment, because the execution was not issued till long after the notice had been given to the alderman.</p>

If the contract upon which the recovery is had contains a waiver, it will control the execution, if made to appear, and it may be made to appear either in the judgment or by proofs aliunde.</p>

The language is very broad: “ And the said lessee expressly waives the benefit of all laws or usages exempting any property from distress or execution for rent.” This is a waiver as to the debt, not merely the property liable to distress. In this respect, the case differs from Mitchell v. Coates, <a href="/pa/47/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="47 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="485555" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0202-01">47 Pa. 202</a>, in which this court said: “It is true the' language is somewhat general, but it is plainly intended to be applied, and therefore must be restricted to what was the subject of the covenant, to wit, personal property liable to distress for rent in arrear. He did not say, waiving all exemption laws, or laws exempting property from execution, or use any expressions which might seem to extend the waiver to the debt, but he closed up the covenant simply by waving all laws exempting personal property from levy and sale for arrears of rent.” This exemption, as will be seen, is of “ all laws or usages,” and applies to any property, whether seized upon a landlord’s warrant, or levied upon by an execution for rent. It would be difficult to frame a broader exemption.</p>
    <p id="b386-4" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[262,1298,1155,185]]]'>The fact that the magistrate recited the waiver in his judgment is not material. The waiver was in the lease, and need not necessarily appear on the justice’s docket. That it.was there does no harm.</p>
    <p id="b386-5" data-blocks='[["BL_386.6",386,[264,1501,1157,450]]]'>The only remaining question is whether the justice had jurisdiction in case of rent. This point does not appear to have been made in the court below; at least, the learned judge does not refer to it in his opinion. Without stopping to discuss the various acts of assembly referred to in the argument of the appellant, it is sufficient to say that the act of March 22, 1814, P. L. 190, expressly conferred this jurisdiction upon justices of the peace to the extent of $100, while the act of May 29,1879, P. L. 194, enlarged their jurisdiction to $300.</p>
