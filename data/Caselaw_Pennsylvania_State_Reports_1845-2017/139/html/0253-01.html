The breach of the agreement complained of, is, that it is alleged that Munhall surrendered the leases to the owners of the land, and took new leases on the same land in his own name, and has assigned the same to other parties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b279-9" data-blocks='[["BL_279.10",279,[204,2114,1169,349]]]'>How has this affected the plaintiff ? He retained no lien on the land, or the oil, as security for the conditional payments. His claim is a personal one on Munhall. The old leases could have been assigned to third parties, as the record stood, without any liability to Smith, the plaintiff. His claim for payment can be enforced only when oil is found on the land in paying quantities.</p>

We can see no reason to doubt that if, at any time during the period for which the leases run, any person find oil in paying quantities on the land, the plaintiff can recover the stipulated conditional payment from Munhall. The condition will then have been fulfilled; but, until that time has arrived, his suit is premature. The law is with the defendant.</p>
