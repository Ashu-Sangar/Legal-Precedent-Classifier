Co. v. Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; R. 411, it was held that, where land was taken by a railroad under the right of eminent domain, the mortgagee need not' be made a party. This case has never been overruled, but the same principle has been announced in subsequent cases: Reese v. Addams, 16 S. &amp; R. 40; Deckert’s App., <a href="/watts-serg/5/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 342" data-case-ids="477628" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0342-01">5 W. &amp; S. 342</a>; Upper Dublin Tp.

Under these decisions, it would [seem clear that Michaels, Roehling &amp; Co. could release damages done to the property as against the mortgagee. The railroad could have condemned the property for its own use, without being required to deliver freight at the glass works and take it away from the packing room, and have paid the damages assessed to Michaels, Roehling &amp; Co., unless the mortgagee had taken some steps to have the money paid into court.] 5 If thejr could thus release the railroad from all damage, to the great injury perhaps of the mortgagee, [it is very clear they could make an agreement that would bind the property, when the agreement was of great benefit to the mortgagees.] 6</p>

The property was levied on as a tract of land on which was this Y; it was sold in the same way, and the purchaser bought a certain tract of land on which was a Y. Whether the Y was a benefit or a burden to the property, the purchaser got just what he bought. It seems perfectly clear that the Y was a great benefit to the property; but, even if it was a damage, under the ruling in Oliver v.
