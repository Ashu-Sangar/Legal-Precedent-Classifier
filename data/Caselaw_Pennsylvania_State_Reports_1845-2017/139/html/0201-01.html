If that were not the case, written contracts would go for nothing. We would write contracts in the most solemn form, negotiate and settle all the terms, and then the moment they were written the controversy would commence about what they meant; or some collateral suggestion, or some other thing that had nothing directly to do with the contract itself, would be set up as a defence, and the result would be that instead of contracts reduced to writing being thereby made certain, they would introduce a great deal more confusion than there would be if there were no writing.</p>

There seems to be no difficulty about the principle of law. The question for the jury is, has that allegation on the part of the plaintiff been sufficiently established by the testimony? Before it should be, .in fact or in substance, incorporated into this agreement, the evidence should be clear, satisfactory and conclusive. If it does amount to that, in the minds of the jury, then any delay occasioned by the failure to have the switch there in time, should accrue to the benefit of the plaintiff; and every day he was delayed in finishing this work should be credited to the time fixed in the contract for its performance.] 8 . . . .</p>
