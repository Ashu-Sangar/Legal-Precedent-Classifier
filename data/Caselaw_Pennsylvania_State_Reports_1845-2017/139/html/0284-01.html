    <p class="summary" id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[262,490,1166,553]]]'>As to these pots being injured so as to become worthless, in consequence of the negligence of the railroad company, the mere fact that the pots were discovered to be injured when the car was opened at Phillipsburg, would not of itself make the company liable; because, to get clear of the release by the plaintiffs they must show that it was an injury resulting from something not properly embraced within the release. In other words they must show it was through the actual negligence of the company. The burden of proof is on the plaintiffs to show that these pots were injured and destroyed by the negligence of the company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[260,1051,1166,857]]]'>On that point, we have no direct testimony as to how they were injured. No witness testifies to the time and manner of the injury. It is a matter that will have to be ascertained by the jury from the evidence. We have the testimony of the man who shipped these pots at South Pittsburgh. He testifies that he superintended the shipping of them; had his gang of men describe how they were put in the car, and how they were protected by hay when put in the car, but he testified from his general habit. He said he could not remember anything in particular about these four pots, or this identical shipment. He testified that it was his custom in all cases to ship them carefully, in the manner he testified to, and that these must have been shipped in that way, because he invariably was careful in shipment and guarding against accidents in the way he described. He testified that for years they had been shipping pots in the same way, and that all had gone safely down to Phillipsburg.</p>

The testimony is that the pots were put in straight, one right before the other, a certain distance apart, with hay between them. The testimony is that when they were down at Phillipsburg they were, not in that condition, but seemed to have been shifted; and, as one of the witnesses said, the front pots were <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>kind of angling across the cars, showing that they were not in the same position they were when shipped, if you believe the witnesses. The question is, how came they to be shifted? One of the witnesses intimated that if the hay had been of a slippery character, in the shaking of - the car they might have shifted and come in contact with each other. Another theory, and that is the theory on the part of the plaintiffs, is that there must have been some sudden jar of the caí; by stopping or starting suddenly, or something of that kind, that caused the displacement of these pots. It is for you to say whether there was any negligence on the part of the railroad company.</p>

    <p id="b312-10" data-blocks='[["BL_312.12",312,[281,1289,1165,401]]]'>There was no error in refusing to charge, as requested in defendant’s first point, “ that, under all the evidence, the verdict must be for defendant.” In affirming defendant’s third point, “ that no presumption of negligence on the part of the carrier arises from the condition of the clay pots at the place of delivery,” etc., the learned judge went to the very verge of propriety, if not beyond it; but of course the defendant does not complain of that.</p>
    <p id="b312-11" data-blocks='[["BL_312.13",312,[283,1697,1164,757]]]'>The case was clearly a proper one for the consideration of the jury on all the&gt; evidence before them. Considering the damaged condition of the pots, at the place of delivery, in connection with the evidence as to their soundness when shipped, and the careful manner in which they were packed in the ear, and the further fact that similar pots, packed in like manner, had uniformly reached their destination in good condition, it cannot be successfully contended that, under all the evidence, the jury were not warranted in finding that the destruction of the pots was the result of actual negligence on the part of the carrier. If they believed, as they might well do, from the evidence before them, that the pots were so carefully and securely packed in the car that nothing short of positive carelessness, in course of transportation, could have injured them, it was their duty to find as they did.</p>

In the absence of proof to the contrary, the fair inference is that the death of the former is due to natural causes; but not so in the latter case. If the pots were carefully and securely packed, when delivered to the carrier, and, when they reached their destination, were found in the badly damaged condition described by the witnesses, the only reasonable inference was that they were not transported with ordinary care. These questions of fact and inferences were for the jury, and' it would have been error to have withdrawn them from their consideration.</p>

The plaintiff was not restricted to proof of such gross negligence as would result in either collision or derailment of the cars. The point as presented might have been refused, but it was adequately answered by saying: “ There is no proof of collision, or of the cars being thrown from the track; but, whether there was negligence is a question of fact for the jury.”</p>
