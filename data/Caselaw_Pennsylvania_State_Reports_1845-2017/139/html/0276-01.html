But the words used in the fifth paragraph of the will do not express an intention to exempt the interest from liability for past indebtedness. There is no apparent reason why he should exempt it from liability for future and not for past debts, and there is a strong presumption that he intended to protect the interest from liability for all indebtedness of the cestui que trust. But, if the lantruage of the will be plain, we are not at liberty to conjecture as to his intention, but must follow it. The'question' in -expounding a will is, not what the testator meant,- but what is the 'meaning of his words: Hancock App., <a href="/pa/112/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="112 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="546641" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0532-01">112 Pa. 532</a>; Ellis’s App., 22 W.

It is evident the will was^prepared with care; apt words have been used, and theyieSirald receive their usual and ordinary interpretation. In the preceding paragraphs, the devises are exempt from liability for debts of the devisees, without any <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>qualification; and, if the testator intended to so exempt the interest of this fund, he should have used similar language; and as he has not expressed his intention to so exempt it, it follows that the interest is liable for the past indebtedness of the cestui que trust.</p>

There is no appar<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>ent reason why the testator should exempt the income from liability for future, and not for past debts, contracts, or engagements of his son. On the contrary, there is a strong presumption that he intended to protect his bounty from liability for any debt, contract, or engagement, whether made before or after the trust went into operation. It is difficult to consider the several provisions of the will without coming to the conclusion that such was testator’s intention; in other words, that he intended, in each and every case, to create a special trust that would protect his bounty against past as well as future acts of the respective beneficiaries. But, whether that be the proper construction of the trust or not, it cannot be doubted that the income accruing therefrom is protected from liability for or by reason of any future act, debt, or engagement of the cestui que trust. If that be so, the decree, which is founded on the order, was unwarranted and erroneous, because the order, if it have any efficacy at all, is in the nature of a contract or engagement made since the trust became operative. It was only by virtue of the order on the trustee, that the petitioner claimed the right to have the income appropriated to the payment of his judgment. The execution of the decree, if permitted, would operate, substantially, as a specific enforcement of the order.</p>
    <p id="b307-5" data-blocks='[["BL_307.5",307,[191,1558,1170,440]]]'>The alternative provision, to pay the interest to such person or persons as the cestui que trust shall authorize to receive the same, was intended merely as a recognition of his right to appoint an agent to receive the income to his use, and not to enable him to transfer his right thereto to another, or otherwise dispose of the income in anticipation of payment to himself. To hold that he could do that, would be to expose the testator’s bounty to any debt or engagement the cestui que trust may see fit to make.</p>
