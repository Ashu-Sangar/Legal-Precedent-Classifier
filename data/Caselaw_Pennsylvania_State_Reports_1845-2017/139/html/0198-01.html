Jennings, one of the original defendants. This evidence was followed, on the present trial, by the record of the distribution by an auditor, to levari facias No. 107 November Term 1866, of the proceeds of sale of the mortgaged premises, showing that in said distribution $2,775.12 of the proceeds had been awarded and paid to Mrs. Julia C. Jones, late Julia C. Schumacher, administratrix; followed by evidence tending to show that a portion of the sum so received, at least §950, was invested by her in real estate, the title to which, on her death in 1880, passed to the plaintiffs in this case in fee. It was made to appear, however, that at the time of the sheriff’s sale on the mortgage before referred to, Mrs. Spencer, one of the plaintiffs herein, was but seventeen years of age, and that William Schu-macher, the father of two of the plaintiffs, was but nineteen. Mrs. Spencer was married in 1869, when about nineteen, and had remained a feme-covert. The two children of William Schumach.er were still minors.</p>

Jennings, <a href="/pa/123/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="123 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="967126" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0184-01">123 Pa. 184</a>, that the mortgage under which the premises in controversy were sold was void, for the reason that the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny county had no jurisdiction to authorize it. From this the conclusion logically follows that the plaintiffs are not bound or affected by the proceedings under that mortgage, and their title to the real estate is not divested. It is now claimed that they cannot recover in this ejectment for the reasons, <em>(a) </em>that they have been guilty of laches, and (5) that they have received or participated in the enjoyment of the purchase money. It may be conceded that, had they knowingly received the pur-<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>cbase money, they would be estopped from recovering the land, for equity would not permit them to have both the land and its price. Just here the defendants’ case fails. The learned judge below correctly held that there was not sufficient evidence to submit to the jury, that the plaintiffs knowingly received any money or property, the proceeds of the mortgage on the subsequent sale on it. The defence of the plaintiffs’ laches is untenable. They were minors at the time of the transaction, and no laches can be imputed to them until after them arrival at age. After that period they had twenty-one years in which to assert their rights.</p>
