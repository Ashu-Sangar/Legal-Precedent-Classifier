This last mentioned policy was also made a part of the verdict. The renewal policy was effected as follows: In pursuance of the by-laws, the company’s secretary gave notice to the defendant, by letter mailed from the office of the company in Boston, of <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>the approaching expiration of the first or original policy, wherein it was stated that his said first or original policy would be renewed, unless defendant should signify his desire to the contrary.

The defendant their drew his check for an amount including the premium under the renewal policy, for the purpose of paying said premium, to the order of a person in Providence, R. I., and caused that check to be forwarded by mail from Philadelphia to that person, who duly received it, and thereupon paid the premium, upon behalf of the defendant, to the said insurance company. In order to obtain the original policy, it was requisite that certain precautions against fire and contrivances to decrease the hazard should be taken, provided, and maintained by the defendant, and this was done by him at an expense of about $6,000. The said insurance company is an incorporation created by the laws of Massachusetts, and was not authorized to transact business under any statute of Pennsylvania providing for such authorization within Pennsylvania; and the said James C. Biddle had not obtained any license to procure said insurance, or made any application for a license under the act of April 26,1887 [P. L. 61] .</p>

L. 20, “to establish an insurance department,” and its title sets out that it is an act “ providing for the further regulation of foreign insurance companies, and relating to agents and others doing business with unauthorized insurance companies,” etc. It is, in fact, an amendment and enlargement of a single section, § 14, of the previous act. That section provided that “ Any person or persons or corporation receiving premiums, or forwarding applications, or in any other way transacting business for any insurance company, not of this state, .... shall forfeit and pay to the commonwealth <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>the sum of five hundred dollars for each month, or fraction thereof, during which such illegal business was <em>transacted; </em>and any company, not of this state, doing business without authority, shall forfeit a like sum,” etc. This section was limited by its express terms to the foreign corporations, and those doing an insurance business for them, “receiving premiums, or forwarding applications, or in any other way transacting business <em>for </em>any insurance company,” etc. But it is common knowledge that there is a very large line of insurance business, by brokers, solicitors and others, which cannot be said to be done for any particular company or class of companies, inasmuch as the broker is employed by and represents not the insurer, but the person seeking insurance. This kind of insurance business was left untouched by the act of 1873. The act of 1887 amends the section quoted so as to read, “ any insurance company, not of this state, doing business without authority, .shall forfeit,” etc.; and “ any person or persons, or any agent, officer, or member of any corporation, paying or receiving or forwarding any premiums, applications for insurance, or in any manner securing, helping, or aiding in the placing of any insurance, or effecting any contracts of insurance, .... directly or indirectly, with any insurance company not of this state, and which has not been authorized,” etc.</p>

Prominence is thus given to the intent to exclude the foreign companies, unless they come under the regulations of the law; and they are first mentioned, and then the other persons intended to be included in the act. These are “ any person or persons, or any agent, officer, or member of any corporation,” — words certainly of very general scope; but, when we look at the prohibitions, we find they are from paying or receiving, forwarding, securing, helping, or aiding in placing insurance, or effecting any corn tracts, etc., and the prohibited acts themselves are all expressed in the plural, — premiums, applications, contracts. These phrases are not applicable to an owner making a single contract of insurance on his own property. They apply to agents, brokers, and others doing an insurance business. Nor were they carelessly or inadvertently used. The act is a carefully-<a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>drawn supplement to the prior act of 1873, which was itself an elaborate and well-considered statute, covering the whole ground of a very important subject. The new act is to be read as a .section of the prior one; and their object was the same, to control and regulate the business of insurance. As already seen, the first act covered the case of agents and others doing business for foreign companies, but did not cover the case of brokers and others doing business with them for other parties. The plain intent of the later act was to reach such persons, and the language used is apt for that purpose. It was put in the most general terms; but read with reference to the subject matter and the context, it was clearly intended to apply only to the business of insurance. Every one in the line of that business, whether as ageirt or solicitor for a foreign company, or as broker or agent for parties seeking insurance, was included ; but there is nothing to indicate that the legislature meant to go further than that. This would be the natural and appropriate meaning of the act, read, as it must be, in its place as the amended fourteenth section of the act of 1873, upon general principles of construction. And certainly, when we are asked to say that the legislature meant so unusual and extreme an interference with the rights of citizens in the management of their own private affairs, we may demand that such intent shall be shown in clear and unambiguous words.</p>
