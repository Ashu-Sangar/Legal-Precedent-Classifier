Penn township is one of the original townships of Allegheny <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>county. Plum township was formed from it. Plum creek was and is tbe dividing line of the townships. An act of assembly approved April 9, 1870, P. L. 1116, prohibits the granting of licenses for tbe sale of liquors in Penn township. An act of assembly approved May 10, 1871, erected the borough of Verona, in part out of the territory of Penn, and in part of Plum township. In population that portion taken out of Penn township is much the larger. By proceedings had in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Allegheny county, at No. 60 September Term 1886, the borough of Oakmont was created out of the territory of Verona borough, so as to leave Oakmont’s territory that lying east of Plum creek, Plum township, and Verona’s territory west of Plum creek, formerly Penn township.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[275,1047,1162,600]]]'>There is an allegation, with testimony, that the course of Plum creek had been changed, many years ago, perhaps about 1854, by a private landowner, so as to artificially throw a small portion of land to the west side that was formerly on the east side. It is very certain that Plum creek, as it existed up to 1871, was recognized as the dividing line of the two townships. There is no question that Verona borough, as it now exists, is as to all but an insignificant plot of ground practically unoccupied, a part of what was Penn township when the prohibitory act of 1870 was passed. That act operated on the territory contained in Penn township, not specially on the quasi corporation of the township.</p>

Certainly, there is no express repeal thereof, and no legislation that has been pointed out to us is inconsistent therewith. The creation of the borough was but the organization of a new municipality, the government' of which has never had anything to do with the granting of licenses to sell liquor.
