Upon reaching the easternmost rail of the defendant’s tracks, which ran along that street, the plaintiff stepped into a depression in the paving of the street beneath the rail, tripped on the rail and fell to the ground, receiving very severe injuries.

The testimony of some of the plaintiff’s witnesses tended tó show that the alterations spoken of were made at a time when the street was “ all torn up,” in connection with the putting in of telegraph or telephone wires. There was no testimony for the plaintiff to show when or by whom the depression was made, though one of her witnessess said that it looked as if produced by the sinking of the cobble stones through the action of water. It was claimed by the defendant’s counsel that a photograph of the locality, put in evidence by the plaintiff, showed that the depression, situated about five feet above a foot crossing, extended from the defendant’s tracks toward the side of the street. The photograph was not reproduced in the paper-books. One of the plaintiff’s witnesses testified that a number of accidents, similar to that of the plaintiff, had occurred at the same place and from the same cause.

Several officials of the highway department testified that they considered the drain safe and in proper repair at the time of the plaintiff’s accident. On cross-examination, some of defendr ant’s witnesses admitted that arrangements could have been made to guard against accidents by covering the depression with a metal frame work, laid at the level of the paving on each side thereof. There was testimony for the defendant tending to show, further, that the cleaning of accumulations of mud out of the drain was performed at regular intervals, and that, on the evening when the plaintiff was injured, Front street was well lighted with both gas and electric lights.</p>

It was necessary that there should be a gutter, an elevation of the rail and an opening thereunder, and the testimony of the plaintiff, as well as her statement of claim, shows that it was by reason of the existence óf that opening that she tripped and fell.

Assuming .that the trial judge was right in charging the jury as strongly as he did in favor of the defence set up, that the depression was a lawful drain, he was also right in submitting the case to the jury, on the question whether the drain was out of repair, and whether the want of repair caused the accident. The testimony on this point was abundant. What <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>caused tbe plaintiff to stumble or trip, and finally to catch her foot against the stringer? Was it a loose stone, or the deceptive mud and water in the hole, or the unnecessary depth or width, caused by lack of proper repair ? Was it not the duty of the defendant, in any event, to place a metal cover or guard of some sort over the drain, if drain it was ? Were not these all questions for the jury ? The authorities cited for the appellant have little force as applying to this case. “ When material facts are disputed, or inferences of fact are to be drawn from the testimony, it is the exclusive province of the jury to determine what they are: ” Penna.

On the status of the so-called drain, however, we submit that the credibility of the defendant’s witnesses was for the jury, irrespective of the question of repair. The defendant ■admits its obligation to keep this highway in a safe condition ■for public use. Giving, then, the fullest force to the testimony of its witnesses, no defence is presented thereby. The defendant shows no statute, municipal ordinance, city plan, or order, either written or verbal, given to the defendant by the proper authorities, requiring or authorizing the existence of the depression for purposes of drainage. But, even if the testimony of defendant’s witness did present a defence, no presumption of law would arise therefrom, but a question of fact. In neither case could the court, have taken the issue from the jury. The only contributory negligence charged against the plaintiff is, that she did not use the regular crossing. In view of the circumstances stated in her testimony as constituting her reasons for leaving it, and the evidence there was in the case as to that crossing’s being dangerous and out of repair, the standard of duty was a shifting one, and the question was for the jury: Born v. Plankroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=101%20Pa.%20336" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="101 Pa. 336">101 Pa. 336</a>. It is well established that citizens may use all parts of the highway, subject to- the duty of more or less care according to the circumstances, and the crossing of a street elsewhere than at an established foot-crossing, is not of itself negligence: Monongahela City v. <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>Fischer, <a href="/pa/111/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="111 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="545444" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0009-01">111 Pa. 9</a>; Oakland Ry.

The last point submitted by defendant’s, counsel asked the court to instruct the jury that there was not such evidence, and that their verdict ought to be for the defendant. The refusal of this point raises the only question that it is important now to consider.'</p>
    <p id="b555-6" data-blocks='[["BL_555.8",555,[156,1165,1172,914]]]'>There was very little conflict in the evidence, and the facts were not in controversy. The plaintiff was passing up Front street, in the city of Philadelphia, on the 20th of April, 1889, at a little after 8 o’clock in the evening. As she came to the intersection of Front and Dauphin streets, she left the foot-walk, and started to cross diagonally over the intersection to the other side of Front street. When nearly over, she stepped into a depression in the pavement about five inches in depth, across which one track of defendant’s road passed. Her foot caught in an opening under the rail in this depression, and she fell and received the injuries for which she is now seeking to recover. Under the ordinances of the city, it was the duty of the defendant to keep the pavement along its road in good repair, and the theory on which the plaintiff sought to hold the defendant for the injury she had received, was that this duty had been neglected, and the depression in the pavement and the opening under the rail were due to the want of care of the-company over the pavements at this point.</p>
    <p id="b555-7" data-blocks='[["BL_555.9",555,[152,2087,1166,349]],["BL_556.1",556,[280,398,1166,1012]]]'>The plaintiff gave a circumstantial account of the manner in which she was hurt. She stated that she fell because she “ went into that hole ” in the pavement, and her feet went under the track of the defendant’s road so that she was “tripped up ” and fell forward. Several witnesses testified to the existence and depth of the depression, and to the fact that there was an open space between the bottom of the depression and <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>the bottom of the rail. This made the plaintiff’s case. The defendant did not deny any of the facts shown, bat proved clearly that the depression in the pavement and the opening under the rail were made under the direction of the city, to serve as a surface drain or outlet for water coming down the street, and to conduct it into the sewer. The depression and the opening were thus shown to be due, not to the negligence of the company, but to the system of surface drainage maintained by the city. This was a complete answer to the plaintiff’s case, and the learned judge so regarded it, for he said to the jury: “I am compelled to say, in this case, there is no evidence to show that the defendants constructed this drain, or toot control over it ... . If, therefore, the injury to the plaintiff was caused by the drain alone, the plaintiff cannot recover.” This was clearly right, but he went on to say further : “ It was the duty of the defendants to keep it (the drain) in good repair, and if, in consequence of its being out of repair, the plaintiff was injured, the defendants were negligent.” He then submitted the question to the jury, whether or not the defendant company had kept the drain in repair.</p>
    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[277,1417,1167,1011]],["BL_557.1",557,[174,400,1162,495]]]'>We have looked through the evidence, but we have been unable to find a particle of testimony to justify the submission of this question. The evidence showed that the drain was kept in the condition the city required, and because it was in that condition, with the opening under the rail for the water to escape, the accident had happened. On the motion for a new trial, the attention of the learned judge was again called to this subject, and, in his opinion dismissing the motion, he collects the circumstances which he considers sufficient to justify the submission, and states them thus: “ There was evidence that the stringer under the rail had rotted away, and evidence of the condition of the drain itself, such as its length, breadth, and depth, and of the loose cobble stones in it, and its subsequent repair by the defendants, which reduced its size in every respect, and also of several accidents like the plaintiff’s.” But the evidence showed, and the learned judge so instructed the jury, that the opening under the rail, the depression in the pavement, its length, breadth, and depth, were fixed and directed by the city, and maintained in the condition required by the city. The repairs by which it was reduced in size were rendered neces<a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>sary by its being torn up for the purpose of setting a lamp-post which encroached upon the space which the drain had previously occupied. This also was done by the city, or under its direction. The fact that other accidents had happened at this drain, tended to show that the city maintained a dangerous system of surface drainage, but threw no light on the state of repair in which the drain was kept by the company. Not one of the circumstances referred to, therefore, justified the submission of the question to the jury, or gives the least support to the verdict rendered.</p>
    <p id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[171,913,1164,758]]]'>As there was no evidence that tended to show negligence on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff had no case, and the last point, which asked a direction to find in favor of the defendant, should have been affirmed. To submit a question to a jury, in a case like the present, when there is not evidence enough to support a verdict, is to open the door for a verdict that is prompted by sympathy, and that rests rather on the necessities of the plaintiff and the ability of the defendant than on an impartial examination of the testimony. Jurors have a right to conclude, when a question is thus left to their determination, that, in the opinion of the court, there is sufficient proof of the fact to justify them in finding it, and it is not to be wondered at that the presence of suffering and poverty should lead them to act upon such conclusion, without waiting to investigate for themselves.</p>
