Contemporaneously with the delivery of the deed, John B. Okie, one of the trustees, received from the defendant, on account of the consideration, bonds to the amount of $402,000, and interest on the whole $420,000 from January 1, to July 1,1872, and executed an agreement, dated July 24, 1872, purporting to be between the defendant company, party of the first part, and Messrs. Richardson, Okie and Webster, <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>executors and trustees, as parties of tbe second part. This agreement recited the contract of January 19, 1872 ; stated that by the provisions thereof the rents and profits of the lands from January 1, 1872, were to be paid and belong to the coal and iron company, and interest on the consideration price, at seven per cent, from the same date, was to be paid to the trustees; recited the payment of such interest to July 1, 1872, and the non-payment to the coal and iron company of the rents of said land for the months of January to June inclusive, amounting to $17,308.69, “ which said amount is due by the said executors to the said Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company.” It then stipulated that the defendant should retain eighteen of the bonds, for $1,000 each, as security for the payment of said rents to it, by the executors, the company agreeing to endeavor to collect the rents from the tenants under the advice of the counsel of the executors and trustees. Okie's co-trustees never joined in executing this agreement of July 24, 1872. The rents therein referred to were never paid by Lucas &amp; Co., the tenants, and the trustees never paid the amount of them to the defendant. The defendant, claiming the light to do so, still retained the eighteen bonds, which were the subject of this bill, as security for the payment of said rents to it.</p>

In enforcement of this contention, it was insisted that Lucas &amp; Co. remained the tenants of the vendors until delivery of the deed, and that the vendee could not compel payment from the tenants before such delivery, unless, perhaps, by invocation of equity, to require action by or in the names of the vendors, a course which the agreement, it was argued, did not indicate as in contemplation, and which the parties could not have intended.</p>

Although the agreement was <em>to </em>convey and <em>to </em>purchase, so that the deed was to be delivered and the consideration paid in the future, yet it was expressly made to bear date as of the first day of January, 1872, “so that all the rents and profits of the said land shall be paid and belong to the said party of the second part (defendant), and interest on the said consideration price from said time shall be allowed to the said party of the first part ” (plaintiffs). As it seems to me, this meant that when the deed, though to be made in the future, should be delivered, it would take effect as of January 1, 1872, and that accordingly, because of defendant’s ownership of the tract as as of that date, the rents would issue thereout to it and belong and be payable to it as landlord, just as “ from said time ” interest on the consideration, because of the same circumstance, would be allowable to the vendors. The rights of neither of the parties were made dependent upon anything to occur in the future, but were fixed as of a past date. As of that date, the rents belonged to the vendee, and I perceive no ground for holding, that the vendors guaranteed that they would be paid. Other provisions of the agreement also tend <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>to support the view that the purchase and sale were to be treated as consummated upon January 1, 1872. The bonds in which the price was to be paid were to run from that date. The vendee assumed the Dundas mortgage from that date, and expressly agreed to take subject to then subsisting leases; the only lease being, so far as appears, this lease to Lucas &amp; Co.</p>

It is, however, asserted, upon behalf of the plaintiff, that this document is not a valid and binding agreement, because it was executed by only one of the trustees. This point, considered apart from and without reference to any of the circumstances alleged by the defendant, and claimed upon its behalf to make this case an exception from the general rule, must, in my opinion, be sustained. Whether or not the fact that the agreement is expressly stated to be that of three persons, only one of whom executed it, would be conclusive against its validity as the contract of any of them, need not be decided. I base the opinion I have expressed upon the principle that “ when the administration of a trust is vested in co-trustees, they all form but one collective trustee. They must, therefore, execute the duties of the office in their joint eapacfiy, .... in all cases depending on the discretion and judgment of the trustees: ” Vandever’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20409" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 409">8 W. &amp; S. 409</a>. Having already reached the conclusion that the agreement of January was such that the supplementary writing of July cannot be considered as merely confirmatory of it, the instrument of later date must be taken to involve the exercise of discretion and judgment, and therefore its execution by all the trustees was requisite to render it binding upon the trust-estate, unless, as I have said, there are some circumstances to make the general rule inapplicable to it.

I am of opinion, with respect to this contention, that if acquiescence or consent to the contract by all the trustees, coupled with an exercise of their own judgment therein, has been shown, it is valid, if no sufficient ground other than its non-execution by two of the trustees exists for holding it to be invalid.

[ — After discussing the testimony:] I think it incumbent upon’ me to conclude that the allegation of agreement upon their part has not been established; and, accordingly, I find as a fact that the two then trustees who did not execute the writing of July 24,1872, or either of them, had previously assented to or authorized its execution, or had agreed, by parol, that the bonds should be retained as security for the unpaid royalties.</p>

Did Mr. Richardson and Mr. Webster subsequently ratify the writing of July 24, 1872? Upon full consideration of the evidence, especially the testimony of Mr. Okie, of Mr. Webster, and of Mr. Richardson, I believe that both Mr. Richardson and Mr. Webster knew of the writing which Mr. Okie had signed, and its purport, a few days after its date. Certainly, if they did not, in fact, know it, their position as joint trustees with Mr. Okie required, in view of facts which they certainly did know, that they should have made prompt inquiry, which, if made, must have resulted in their immediately acquiring the information. But knowledge is one thing, ratification another. There is no evidence whatever of the latter, and it cannot, in <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>my opinion, be inferred from the former. The subject was one calling for the exercise of judgment and discretion; and it is, I think, impossible to find that Mr. Richardson or Mr. Webster, in the exercise of these, gave tlieir assent and approval to the writing in question. Proof of such ratification on their part should, to avail the defendant, be, I think, clear and satisfactory. It is not enough that they knew, or should have known, what Mr. Okie had done, and did not notify to the defendant their dissent therefrom. The right set up by the defendant depends for its maintenance upon the agreement, in some form, of all the trustees, and this has not been shown.</p>

The only thing in the nature of consideration which is suggested by the writing itself, is the recital that 117,308.69 of rents was “due by the said executors,” which was not true; the statement that such rent was so due being based upon a construction of the first agreement which was not correct, and to which Mr. Richardson and Mr. Webster have both testified they never assented.

Borie so plainly appears, that it would be superfluous to refer to the evidence of it in detail. They were assigned as collateral security for notes of the trustees. It is equally beyond question that the defendant knew this; and there is not any evidence which would support a finding that the trustees assented or agreed that the transfer from C. &amp; H.

    <p id="b567-6" data-blocks='[["BL_567.7",567,[163,627,1163,1521]]]'>The complainants’ claim to relief rests upon the single ground of the insufficiency of an agreement of one of three trustees, though it be in writing and under seal, to bind the estate. It is conceded that if the three parties had not been trustees, but had been acting in their individual rights, they would have been bound. The master finds that the two who did not sign the agreement had immediate knowledge of it, acquiesced in it, and accepted the benefits of the payment of cash made upon it. No writing was required. If all three of the trustees' had been present, and had agreed, had delivered the deed, accepted the four hundred and two bonds and the check for interest, as a present settlement in full, leaving the other eighteen bonds in the hands of the' coal company as security for the uncollected rents, or if, not being present, they had subsequently ratified or approved the settlement, then the estate admittedly would have been bound. The master finds such knowledge, acquiescence, and ratification as would have bound the parties in their individual capacities, but he finds as matter of law that this was not enough to bind them when acting as trustees. He says: “ I believe that both Mr. Richardson and Mr. Webster knew of the writing which Mr. Okie had signed, and its purport, a few days after its date. But knowledge is one thing, ratification another. There is no evidence whatever of the latter, and it cannot, in my opinion, be inferred from the former. The subject was one calling for the exercise of judgment and discretion; and it is impossible to find that Mr. Richardson or Mr. Webster, in the exercise of these, gave their assent and approval to the writing in question. Proof of such ratification on their part should, to avail the defendant, be, I think, clear and satisfactory.”</p>

It may be conceded that as an element of a valid legal contract the <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>joint exercise of judgment by all the trustees is essential. The learned master has correctly stated the law in that respect. But it does not follow that a court of equity will necessarily afford relief where such joint action is not clearly shown. The trustees may go into a court of law and enforce their legal rights, and nothing but a strict joint agreement of all will be a defence. But when they aslc a chancellor to help them, he will look into all the circumstances to see if equity requires him to do so. In the present case, the trustees executed the agreement of sale on January 19th, and it was to be operative as of January 1st, but the deed was not delivered until July 24th. The cause of the delay is not shown and is not material, but it has a bearing on the actions of the parties, in this, that the item of rents had in the meantime reached a sum of importance. The trustees were in urgent need of money. It is admitted that they had a large number of notes out, and were indebted to Messrs. Borie in such an amount that they almost immediately transferred the whole four hundred and odd thousand dollars of bonds to them as security. Under these circumstances, the trustees appointed (that is the word Okie uses), one of their number to make the settlement, and he thereupon delivered the deed, received a check for eighteen thousand and odd dollars, the four hundred and two bonds, and signed and sealed a formal agreement that the remaining eighteen bonds should be held by the company as security for the uncollected rent. The cash received by check for interest was rather more than the face value of the eighteen bonds, and the testimony is undisputed that, without the agreement as to the retention of these bonds, this money would not have been paid. The counsel of the trustees was present at the settlement, and the two absent trustees knew of it immediately afterwards. They not only made no objection, but they participated in the disposition and benefit of the cash, with knowledge of the terms upon which it had been obtained; joined in a formal transfer of all the bonds to Borie &amp; Co., and knew that Borie &amp; Co. re-transferred the eighteen bonds in question to the coal and iron company, to be retained under the agreement of July 24th. The circumstances were such as would absolutely bar parties acting in their own right, and though they might not, as matter of law, constitute a contract binding on trustees, they do <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>show such a want of equity that a chancellor should not give them affirmative aid.</p>
    <p id="b569-5" data-blocks='[["BL_569.5",569,[166,496,1167,1877]],["BL_570.1",570,[271,395,1157,92]]]'>So far we have considered the case without reference to the question of delay. The facts with regard to the original trustees have already been stated. They took place in July, 1872. The complainants, the’ present trustees, were appointed in November of the same year. They came into the responsible management of a large estate, heavily indebted, and whose previous trustees had been discharged because unable to agree or to get along together. The complainants, therefore, had more than usual reason to look carefully into the condition of the assets, and, in addition to this, Webster says he called their attention especially to these bonds detained by the coa.1 and iron company. Yet they made no move until 1877, when a suit was brought which was subsequently abandoned, and this bill was not filed until 1886. For this delay of more than thirteen years no excuse has been shown. During all this time the-trustees had knowledge of all the facts and circumstances now in their possession, and with such knowledge acquiesced in the action of the coal and iron company. No concealment on the part of the company or ignorance on their own part is alleged in the bill, and the jurisdiction in equity, as the complainants have stated their own case, must rest on the narrow basis afforded by the averment in the fifth paragraph of the bill, that the bonds have a peculiar value and are not readily obtainable in the market. The learned master saw and stated this very clearly in his report. The bill would therefore have been demurrable on the ground that it presented a case for which the law provided a natural and adequate remedy, had this paragraph not been inserted; and, with it, the fact still remains that it states a cause of action in trover, which would have been barred in a court of law by less than one half the delay shown here. It would be a strange anomaly if laches that would conclude a plaintiff, at law, would be disregarded in equity, without the slightest explanation or excuse being offered for the consideration of a chancellor.
