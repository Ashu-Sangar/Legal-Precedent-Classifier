The mortgage, as appears from the evidence, was placed upon the property by Mr. Elton in whose name at least the title to the property stood, in this sum of $20,000, to clear off two other encumbrances which aggregated this sum. It seems that there was a prior mortgage and ground-rent, and that the prior mortgage and ground-rent together amounted to about or just the sum of $20,000. It became necessary to clear off those two encumbrances, and, therefore this present mortgage of $20,000 was put upon the property. The money was borrowed from Miss Borland by Mr. Elton, who held the title to the property, and it remained in that way. The mortgage was accompanied by the bond, as is usually the case.</p>

Of course, getting her money, she had no further control of the judgment except that she could have declined originally to have marked it to use. A plaintiff is not bound, when the money is tendered upon a judgment, to mark that judgment to the use of any person; but if she does mark it to use, or her attorney, acting for her, acting within the scope of his lawful authority, does mark it to use, then her power is entirely gone, because her claim is satisfied, she has got the money, and by the act of her attorney, all her rights ceased against the property as if that money had been paid to her, and passed over to the party to whose use the judgment stands.</p>

He had four daughters, one of whom is the wife of Mr. Stokes. In the will, he makes certain provisions in. regard to this property, treating the mortgage against this property as a valid claim against it, as a subsisting claim against it. Under that will, the wife of Mr. Stokes takes an interest in the estate of Mr. Elton. It seems, according to the testimony in the cause, that even after Mr. Elton’s death when the question came up as to distribution of property among these four heirs, under the will of Mr. Elton, there was still <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>contention in regard to the distribution of that estate, and then, according to the evidence in the cause, the parties came together and made what was called a family settlement, in which family settlement Mr. Stokes and his wife and the other three daughters of Mr. Elton all came to an agreement, touching this Broad street property, and there was an agreement that the other three heirs of Mr. Elton should convey their interest in this property to Mrs. Stokes, subject tó the mortgage which then existed upon it. By that agreement they all treated that as a valid, live, subsisting mortgage and judgment binding that property upon North Broad street, in regard to which this contention is now waged, and the wife of Mr. Stokes had conveyed to her all the interests of the three sisters in the property, charged with this mortgage and judgment-debt of $20,000, taking up any settlement of the interest of Mr. Stokes’ wife or Mr. Stokes through his wife, in this estate of Mr. Elton, at least so far as this property is concerned.</p>

In two separate accounts passed on by Judge Penrose this same question practically came before him, when he decided that family settlement was a valid and binding contract between the parties, and that Mrs. Stokes could not escape from the payment of the mortgage which existed upon the property as due to the estate of Mr. Elton, because she had not seen the benefit and advantage which enured to her by taking to herself the conveyance of the interest of the three other sisters <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>of that property. ' If that had not been done, three fourths of the interest in this property would have belonged to the other three sisters, and one fourth to Mrs. Stokes; but the whole of the interest in the property was conveyed to Mrs. Stokes, and that is the consideration, as set forth upon that paper, as found in the adjudication of Judge Penrose, for the settlement of matters of controversy between Mrs. Stokes, represented by her husband, and Mr. Meurer, representing the interests of the estate of Mr. Elton, and also as binding other individual claims on that estate; that is, the other three daughters.</p>

    <p id="b544-8" data-blocks='[["BL_544.10",544,[272,1093,1170,552]]]'>It is not disputed that Elton borrowed the money from Bor-land for the relief of the mortgaged premises by the payment of encumbrances prior to the deed to him. The legal title was in Elton, but appellants were in actual occupation, and claimed to be the beneficial owners. Conceding this claim, the property was certainly the primary debtor for the mortgage in suit. In 1884, Borland entered up the bond and issued execution against Elton’s personal property. To relieve this, Meurer raised the money, paid the amount to Borland’s attorney, and had the judgment marked to his use. Subsequently he brought the present suit.</p>
    <p id="b544-9" data-blocks='[["BL_544.11",544,[271,1655,1166,187]]]'>The only contested fact was the nature of the payment to Borland, and as to that the evidence was so entirely one-sided that it cannot be said to have been contested at all, except in the merest technical sense.</p>

The money that paid Borland was the money of Meurer, even though he raised it partly by the aid of securities belonging to Elton. But this is not material; for, even if Elton had paid Borland out of his own funds, for the relief of his other property, be would have had the same rights that Meurer now has. By appellants’ own version, as already said, Elton held the title only as trustee for them, and if, as such trustee, Elton was forced to pay the debt primarily due by the trust property, he was entitled to be subrogated to the creditor’s remedies for his reimbursement. To avoid any technical question, the transaction was carried <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>through by Meurer’s aid, and in his name, and the marking to his use of the judgment on the bond, gave him not only the control of that judgment, but also the right to an assignment of the mortgage. Borland had no longer any interest in the mortgage, but it was not extinguished. It had passed in equity to Meurer, and carried with it the right to sue in Borland’s name. Her failure to authorize the suit, or even her objection to it, was of no moment. She had no right to object.</p>
    <p id="b545-4" data-blocks='[["BL_545.5",545,[169,791,1167,648]]]'>So far, we have considered the case without reference to the family agreement. But, even if appellants had had any standing before, that agreement and their acceptance of the title under it would have put an end to every vestige of claim on their part. Further insistanee that the mortgage was paid, was not only unfounded, but impudent. The learned judge left the question to the jury in a clear and comprehensive charge, of which appellants certainly have no cause to complain. He might well have refused to allow the jury to guess at the purpose of the payment to Borland, in the face of the evidence as to what took place on the occasion, and of appellants’ undisputed recognition of the validity of the mortgage in the family settlement.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.6",545,[168,1459,1164,453]]]'>The errors assigned may be briefly disposed of. The right to sue on the mortgage, as already shown, was in Meurer, but, as there had been no actual assignment, he was obliged to sue in the name of the mortgagee. He was entitled, therefore, to show his interest in the suit in that form. The surprise which would have entitled the appellants to a continuance had no existence in fact. The real controversy had been fully developed in the other court, on the motion to strike off the marking of the judgment to use of Meurer.</p>
    <p id="b545-6" data-blocks='[["BL_545.7",545,[166,1920,1164,504]]]'>The last assignment of error is not in compliance with our rules, as it groups the refusal of six different points into one assignment. None of the points, however, could have been affirmed. They are all based on the view that an extinguishment or merger of the mortgage had taken place, but there was no merger in law, as Meurer, and not Elton, was the party actually making the payment, and even without this technical protection, as Elton would only have been paying what Stokes or his property ought to have paid, equity would not have permitted an extinguishment against Elton’s interest.</p>
    <p id="b545-7" data-blocks='[["BL_545.8",545,[926,2433,357,42]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
