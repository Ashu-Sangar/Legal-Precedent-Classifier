Nevertheless, the said defendant, well knowing the premises, but contriving and maliciously intending to vilify and asperse the reputation and character of the said plaintiff, and to bring her into very great infamy and disgrace, and subject her, the said plaintiff, to prosecution and punishment for fornication, on the 31sb day of October, A. D. 1890, at Allentown, in said county, did wickedly and maliciously, make, write, and publish, and send through the United States mails, at Allentown, directed to the residence of the said plaintiff, No. -, Hamilton street, Allentown, in said county, a certain malicious, false and scandalous writing and libel, of and concerning the said plaintiff, said writing and libel being contained in a letter written and published and addressed to the said plaintiff, as aforesaid, by the said defendant, and containing amongst other things certain false, malicious and scandalous matters, according to the terms following, to wit: “ Mrs. Annie E.

Heckman, of Allentown, Pennsylvania,) thus meaning and intending that the said plaintiff had been criminally intimate with the said Henry A. Heckman, and had committed fornication with him, and that plaintiff should commit the crime of fornicatio'n with the said Henry A. Heckman. The said Annie E. Seip in fact saith that she is nowise guilty of fornication, and that she is not insane, but of good sound mind, and that the said William H. Deshler, the defendant, well knew said charges to be false when he made them. By reason of the making and publishing of which said malicious, false and scandalous libel, so as aforesaid published by the said defendant, she, the said plaintiff, is very much injured and damaged in her reputation, and has suffered in character and feelings.

The defendant asks you to find from what he has shown in this reference that Mr. Heck-man was in Columbia county on the 31st of October, 1890, and also on the 1st of November following. Upon that question there is evidence on both sides.

All that bears upon this question you will consider, and regard the weight of the evidence, and if it is proved that there was publication in the way the plaintiff asserts, that is, that Mr. Heckman saw the letter before it came to Mrs. Seip’s hands, then you will say there was publication, and then that requisite of the plaintiff’s case to entitle her to recover is made out.</p>

Malice is popularly understood to mean ill will or spite. As the term is used in law, at least as applicable to this case, it means something more. Spite and ill will are what might be termed positive malice. Malice in contemplation of law is where a person does a wrongful act intentionally. If the letter in suit is what is recognized in law as a libel — and concerning that I will give you instruction presently — then the intentional making and publication of it would be a wrongful act, and if done intentionally —and there is no pretense here that if the defendant did what is charged that he did not do it intentionally — then such intentional doing of the wrongful act is malicious as applicable to a civil action for libel. Is the letter malicious; is the letter actionable ; is it. a libel ? Not every writing which in its terms is uncomplimentary of another, or even abusive of another, even <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>if it is published, amounts to a libel. The law cannot take notice of every writing of that description so as to give an action for damages. According to certain rules it is ascertained what writings are libelous and what are not libelous.</p>

The law after all is nothing more than a rule which the people have made for their own government.</p>

The only allusion that is claimed to be of that nature is in the postscript, and, in the opinion of the court, in order to make out that charge there would have to be added or brought into the letter a word after that last word ‘ extra ’ in place of that dash, which would imply sexual intercourse, and for a court or jury to say that the line means that, would be hunting for a meaning. If the conclusion claimed for by the plaintiff were reached it would be finding a bad meaning where the writing itself does not naturally lead to that conclusion. Therefore we give you positive instruction that so far as the elaim on plaintiff’s part that there is a charge of sexual commerce is concerned in this letter — fornication—it does not exist and that is out of the case.</p>

There are two allusions in the letter of that nature, that is, which the plaintiff claims are of that nature. They are ambiguous, uncertain and of dubious meaning.

Therefore it is referred to you to say, gentlemen, whether these words, which in the opinion of the court are dubious, that is, the words from which the plaintiff alleges that you can find that insanity is charged, actually do mean that, and that Mrs. Seip is the one meant. In short, does the letter, according to the meaning of words as they are usually accepted by people, mean that the writer of the letter asserted or charged that Mrs. Seip, the plaintiff, was insane. If that is established, then we say to you that the letter is libelous, and if it was made by the defendant and was published, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover. .

The words of the letter set out in the statement, so far at least as they relate to insanity, are clearly defamatory and actionable.</p>
    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[264,697,1169,240]]]'>The whole of the letter referred to and those of August 9th, 1889, and March 22,1890, received in evidence under exception, were not improper for the consideration of the jury on the questions of malice and damages. The fifth, sixth and seventh speccifications are therefore not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b366-6" data-blocks='[["BL_366.6",366,[262,954,1169,298]]]'>The case was fairly submitted to the jury with substantially correct and adequate instructions as to the law applicable to the facts which the testimony tended to establish. When the charge is considered as a whole, in connection with the testimony before the jury, there appears to be no error in the portions thereof that are complained of.</p>
    <p id="b366-7" data-blocks='[["BL_366.7",366,[264,1260,1166,84]]]'>There is nothing in any of the specifications that requires extended comment. Neither of them is sustained.</p>
    <p id="b366-8" data-blocks='[["BL_366.8",366,[308,1361,358,42]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
