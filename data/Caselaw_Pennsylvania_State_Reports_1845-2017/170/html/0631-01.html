    <p class="summary" id="b656-6" data-blocks='[["BL_656.7",656,[269,1289,1166,1102]]]'>“ ‘ In all cases where no payment, claim or demand shall have been made on account of, or for any ground-rent, annuity or other charge upon real estate, for twenty-one years, or no declaration or acknowledgment of the existence thereof shall have been made within that period, by the owner of the premises, subject to such ground-rent, annuity or charge, a release or extinguishment thereof shall be presumed, and such ground-rent, annuity or charge shall thereafter be irrecoverable.’ It is contended by counsel for B.

      <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>“ In deciding whether this act bars the claim against the 57 acre piece we must bear in mind the situation of the parties. F. A. Fessenden, by accepting the legacy of the two pieces of land, assumed and substantially agreed to perform the conditions annexed to the gift. He became personally and primarily liable for the support of Samuel, and the support of Samuel is charged upon these two pieces of land by the will. And Samuel may resort to the laud when Frederick Fessenden fails to discharge the personal liability resting upon him. It is an undisputed fact in the case that Frederick has supported Samuel from the death of Asa Fessenden, the testator, in 1864, until October 28, 1889. Up to this time there was no occasion for Samuel to resort to the land and no power in him to do so, for Frederick was performing the conditions of the devise, and to that extent exonerating the land. Undet such circumstances can it be said that no payment has been made on account of this charge upon real estate for 21 years, or that no acknowledgment of the existence of it has been made within that period by the owner of the premises ? True it may be said that Tyler was the owner under an absolute conveyance from March 7,1868, to the filing of this petition on January 21,1890, and that during that time no claim had been made upon Tyler, neither did Tyler make any acknowledgment of its existence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b657-4" data-blocks='[["BL_657.5",657,[190,1556,1171,907]]]'>“ The word ‘ owner ’ in this act of assembly we think means in this case the devisee and his grantees. The act was never intended to bar a claim or a charge while it was being performed by the person primarily liable. If it could be made to-apply under such circumstances, then one who has accepted a legacy conditioned for the support of another can sell the land upon which the legacy may be charged, faithfully perform his liability for 21 years and free the land from the charge. That the statute does not run while the condition is being performed is held in Brown’s Petition, 9 Phila. B. 548. Of course there is no pretense for invoking this act to relieve the 18 acre piece, for Frederick Fessenden was in possession of it down to the-time of the sheriff sale on the 22d of April, 1874, and, according to the report of the auditor, down to 1890. Under this act it may well be contended that the charge upon the land for Lora E. Fessenden is barred, if nothing has been done for her for the-period of 21 years, but Samuel’s claim we think is not barred, and he may resort to the land.</p>

      <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>u The next question raised here is to the order in which these pieces of land must contribute to his support. It is claimed that the land first sold by Frederick Fessenden must be looked to last, and that the lands sold last by him should be resorted to first. If Frederick Fessenden sold the 18 acre piece first, and kept the 57 acre piece, as between him and the grantee of the 18 acre piece, we should certainly require the 57 acre piece to be exhausted first. And Frederick Fessenden could not sell the 57 acre piece so as to put the purchaser in-any better position than he was himself, (for the purchaser would sit in the seat of the grantor): Cowden’s Estate, <a href="/pa/1/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Pa. 267" data-case-ids="949926" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0267-01">1 Pa. 267</a>; Nailer v. Stanley, 10 S. &amp; R. 453. Under the authority of Cowden’s Estate, the title of Searle to the 18 acres piece relates back to the entry of his judgment in 1867, about a year prior to the purchase by Tyler. The legacy for the support of Samuel is a charge upon both pieces of land, but we will exhaust the 57 acre piece before we go upon the 18 acre piece. Searle’s judgment was a lien upon both pieces. When he attempted to make the money on his judgment by the sale of the real estate in 1874, he found that the 57 acre piece had been conveyed to Tyler, and under the rule that the real estate must be sold in the inverse order of its alienation, was compelled to sell the 18 acre piece first. And this sale satisfying the judgment, left Tyler in the undisturbed possession of his purchase. We are now applying the same rule with regard to the order of the sale of pieces of land aliened at different times, which was probably applied to Searle in 1874. It may seem a hardship to require the 57 acre piece to contribute to the support of Samuel N. Fessenden, but when Tyler purchased in 1868 he must have inquired how it was that Frederick, one of three children, could convey the whole title.

Is is an important finding because upon it is based so much of the decree appealed from as requires that the fifty-seven acre lot purchased by Moses S. Tyler on the 12th of March, 1868, “shall be exhausted in payment of the sum due the estate of Samuel N. Fessenden ” before resorting to the eighteen acres for the payment of any portion of the same. The general rule is that the finding of an auditor approved by the court will be sustained on appeal, if there is any evidence which warranted it, but his finding of a material fact without evidence or palpably against it constitutes ground for reversal. In the case before us it seems to be conceded by the learned counsel for the appellee that no evidence was submitted to the auditor on the hearing by either of the litigants showing when the judgment on which the eighteen acre lot was sold on the 22d of April, 1874, was <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>entered. As the purchaser of this lot acquired his title to it more than seven years after Tyler purchased the fifty-seven acre lot, it was incumbent on the former to prove the existence of facts which gave him as against the latter the position and rights of a first purchaser. These lots prior to the sale of either of them were alike subject to the charge laid upon them by the will of Asa Fessenden, in favor of his sou Samuel. Prima facie, Tyler by his purchase acquired the right, in equity, to have the eighteen acre lot sold in satisfaction of this charge before resorting to his lot for payment of it. If his grantor still owned the eighteen acre lot, or had subsequent to his purchase of the fifty-seven acres sold and conveyed it to the present owner of it, there can be no doubt that this equity could be enforced. We think it is equally clear that it could be enforced if the lot was sold on a judgment entered after the Tyler purchase. B ut the learned court below appeared to think it was sold on a judgment entered before this purchase and that, therefore, the present owner of it must be regarded as the first purchaser of a portion of the property charged with the support of Samuel. Whether the conclusion is warranted by the premises is a question which was <em>not </em>discussed or raised in the paper-books, or on the argument at bar, and we express no opinion in regard to it. To do so intelligently we ought to know when the judgment was entered and when it was revived, because, if it was entered before the Tyler purchase, a timely revival was necessary to continue the lien of it beyond the 12th of March, 1873. It is claimed by the appellant that the lien of the Read, Watrous &amp; Foster judgment was lost before the sale in 1874, and that the Meacliam judgment was entered on the 6th of April, 1870, and to show the good faith of his contention in this respect, his counsel exhibited on the argument at bar an exemplification of the record which appeared to sustain it. We may add that the registry of the acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed shows that the lot was sold on the Meacham judgment.</p>

L. 369, or by the supplement thereto of Feb. 2,1869, P. L. 3. The reasons given for this conclusion are quite sufficient to sustain it. There was no default on the part of the person primarily liable for Samuel’s support prior to 1890 and Tyler kuew there was none. From 1864 to 1890 Samuel was maintained by his brother Frederick in accordance with the provisions of his father’s will and to that extent the burden on the lands on which his support was charged was lightened. Frederick’s support of him during this period was in relief of his vendees, who were advised by the will of his father of the terms on which he might dispose of the lands devised to him, but it cannot be construed as an extinguishment of the charge upon them.</p>
