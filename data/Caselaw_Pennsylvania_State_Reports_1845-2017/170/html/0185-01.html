If the decedent owed money to the appellant the form of the proceeding would not be objectionable. But if no money is owing by the decedent to the appellant, neither law nor equity could tolerate the decree sought for. The basis of the contention is that the decedent, being the administrator of the estate of the appellant’s father, had in his hands at the settlement of his account as administrator, a sum of money belonging to the appellant, who was then an infant, and that this money or any part of it was never; paid by the decedent to the appellant. The amount of the fund was $1,094.86. If the decedent had been the guardian of the appellant he would have been liable to file an account of his trust,' and upon the settlement of the account the question would have been whether he had paid out the money in such a way as the law would recognize as proper, and for the benefit and advantage of the ward. If he had he certainly would have been entitled to credit for such payments, and in that event, if the payments exhausted the fund in the guardian’s hands, no recovery .could be had for the moneys so paid. That is what would have been the result if he had been regularly appointed as guardian, had accepted the trust and had fully executed it. Is any different rule to be applied to the case if he was not so appointed, and yet had acted as such in point of fact, and had faithfully performed his trust ? If so the ward obtains a right to have money which she could not have had, if the decedent had held a regular appointment. Such a result is not reasonable and we can see no just cause for reaching it. Now in point, of fact the payments made by the decedent during the minority of the appellant, amounted to- considerably more than the whole sum of the money which came into his hands, with lawful interest added, and they were of the most humane and beneficent character, such as ought to have been made if he had been regularly appointed as guardian, and such as any <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>orphans’ court having jurisdiction would have authorized him to make, and would in all probability have required him to make, if he had not done so voluntarily. The appellant was born a deaf mute. She could neither speak nor hear. Her condition was most pitiable, and her mother was most anxious that she should receive such education as is given to persons so afflicted. Her grandfather, the decedent, took pity upon her, and yielding to the earnest solicitations of the appellant’s mother, and to his own instincts of natural affection, he did have her educated with such excellent results that she was enabled to overcome the frightful afflictions of her birth, and is now able to speak and practically to hear, and her life which otherwise would have been one of dumb misery and sorrow is made tolerable and happy. The question is what was the decedent’s position with reference to the appellant, and to what credits would he be entitled upon the adjudication of an account?</p>

Rep.), 64, the father of the ward without any appointment as guardian received a sum of money belonging to his infant daughter and also appropriated the services of a female slave belonging to her. After attaining her majority upon a bill filed against her father’s executor, the estate was held liable to account upon the theory that he could be held accountable as a guardian legally appointed. The chancellor delivering th e opinion said, “ Although as the mere guardian by nature, he had no right to receive the money due on the bond, or to receive the services of the slave, yet this court will hold him liable to the same extent as if he had been the legally constituted guardian, so far as he has had the benefit of the infant’s property. A mere stranger or wrongdoer who takes possession of the property of an infant, and receives the rents and profits thereof, may in equity be considered as the guardian, and may be compelled to account as such. 1 West, 265; 2 P.

If he receives the money of the infant, and uses it, he is estopped from denying that he received it as guardian.”</p>

The proposition that because an administrator or executor cannot be appointed guardian of a minor interested in the estate of which he has charge, he, therefore, cannot be treated as a guardian in fact, is altogether untenable. Treating an administrator who has acted as a guardian of such a minor, as if he were actually appointed as such, means only holding him to such liability as he would have incurred if he had been really appointed. This judicial treatment of such a person is the most favorable to the interests of the ward, but it certainly does not follow that if such a person makes payments out of the funds whicli belong to the ward, for.the best interests of the ward, such as any court having jurisdiction would allow or direct him to make, he is to be denied all credit for such payments.</p>

Evidence was given of some loose declarations of the decedent indicative of such a purpose, but other and much more satisfactory evidence was given showing that he did not have such an intent. Amongst other things he kept a precise account on his books showing the date and amount of every such payment made by him, and also the amount he held in his hands of money belonging to her. The heading of this account on his books shows the intent with which he regarded his own position with reference to this subject. It is as follows:</p>

His declarations to A. H.

This contention was made in the court below, and there a special finding was made, as follows: “We therefore find as a fact that the education was not a gift, and that the guardian is entitled to a credit for the expenses thereof.” We treat this finding as we would the verdict -of a jury, and we also think it was a correct finding upon the. testimony.</p>

It is a salutary jealousy with which the law regards the conduct of guardians; but where they have advanced moneys to educate their wards — to pay off incumbrances, or to repair and improve their estate, and where the advancements have not been imprudently made and are not disproportioned to the value of the estates, natural justice demands that they should be reasonably compensated.”</p>

If she marries, she and her children will take the whole estate of the decedent in due time, and if she remains single she will have the whole income of the estate for life upon the death of her mother.
