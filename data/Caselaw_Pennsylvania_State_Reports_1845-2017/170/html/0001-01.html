That the general statutes of New York do not and cannot operate to control the distribution of the property of a New York corporation, not situate in that state, is conceded. This being so, we must construe the statute as intended to operate onty in respect to property subjected to the control of the New York authorities. Or, if the language does not admit of such construction, so much of the law as is beyond the power of the legislature to enforce and which undertakes to deal with matters over which it has no jurisdiction is void. A mere brutum fulmen is not a law. It may be that the statute operates upon the corporation and not merely upon its property; but it so operates only in respect to the property subject to New York control. The precise language of the statute is not before us. And we are not advised that it imposes any penalties upon the corporation. We assume that it merely avoids preferences given in violation of its provisions. The cases cited by the counsel for the East Side Bank seem conclusive of this question unless we can distinguish them, as the learned and able counsel for the Chautauqua National Bank attempts to do, by saying that in those cases the preference was given by the corporation itself, acting within the foreign state, while in the case before us it is given by an agent of the corporation, whose authority was conferred by an act of the directors done in the state where the corporation was seated and in violation of the laws of that state. But such a distinction cannot be made. It is not in the power of any corporation to enter a foreign sovereignty, or to exist there. A corporation exists only in contemplation of law, and by virtue of the law, and can no more subsist where the laws by which it was created do not operate than an animal with lungs can live where there is no air. A corporation, as was said by Chief Justice Taney, in Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Peters, 588, “must dwell in the place of its creation ; and cannot migrate to another sovereignty.” Yet, although like a bedridden merchant it must remain at home, its agents may traverse the globe and by the <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>comity of states and nations do business in its name everywhere. It follows that whosoever assumes to act for a foreign corporation by whatever name he may be called, must act in the capacity of agent, and his authority, if any he has, be traceable to the act of the corporation at the place where it is seated. If special authority to prefer a creditor in Pennsylvania is void because given in New York, then any general authority which included that would be void also, pro tanto, whether exercised by a board of directors or otherwise. We think, therefore, that the learned auditor was right in his conclusions upon this question.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b25-3" data-blocks='[["BL_25.4",25,[213,971,1165,1164]]]'>“ The exceptions which complain that the auditor did not make distribution of the proceeds of the personal estate pro rata among all of the creditors raise a question of the very greatest importance to the business world. The claim of the exceptants rests upon the doctrine announced by Judge Sla.g-1/e, of the common pleas of Allegheny Co., in McKee v. McKee’s Rocks Oil Co., 41 P. L. J. 59. The substance of this decision is, that where the personal property of an insolvent corporation which is necessary to the carrying on of its business is sold upon execution, the proceeds are to be distributed as upon the insolvency of an individual, viz: first, to liens existing prior to the issuing of the process by Avhich the fund is raised; and second, pro rata among the general creditors. The argument is, that the execution given by the act of 1870 is in lieu of the sequestration proceedings provided by the act of 1836, and the proceeds of the sale under such a writ are to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of that act. And it seems to be held that Avhere property, essential to the transaction of the business for which the corporation is organized, is taken in execution, and the corporation is in fact insolvent, the fund is to be treated as if raised by sale under the special process provided by the act of 1870, even if the actual execution be an ordinary fi. fa.</p>

And it seems logical to say that the proceeds should be distributed as if the proper writ had been used to produce them. But the act of 1836 authorizes proceedings against corporations by a fi. fa. commanding the sheriff to “ levy the sum recovered together with the costs of suit, of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements,” of the corporation defendant: Pamph. Laws 774, section 72. And sequestration was only awarded after such a writ had been returned nulla bona.</p>

It seems to be assumed that a corporation may own property not properly falling within either of the classes of ‘goods,’ ‘ chattels,’ ‘lands’ or ‘tenements.’ And that roads, canals and bridges, at least, are such property. The precise provisions of this act were suggested by Chief Justice Tilghman, in Ammant v. The Turnpike Road, 13 S. &amp; R. 210, in which it was decided that the turnpike road was neither lands, tenements, goods nor chattels, within the meaning of the statutes relating to executions, but was inseparably connected with the franchises of the company and could not be sold upon execution.

In the case last cited Chief Justice Thompson classifies corporations, other than municipal, into ‘ public,’ which are those which act as agents of the public directly, such as bridge, turnpike and railroad companies; and ‘ private ’ which affect the public only indirectly — simply business corporations. He applies the principles announced in Ammant v. The Turnpike Co., and Susquehanna Canal Co. v.

That such of its property, real or personal, as is necessary to the exercise of some public franchise, is to be regarded as forming a part of that franchise and is not subject to execution in the ordinary way, but can only be taken in the lump under the special writ provided by the act of 1870, and sold together to a purchaser or purchasers, whom the law now at least authorizes to exercise the franchises possessed by the corporation. The purpose appears to be to subserve the public convenience by preventing the extinguishment of a public franchise; which was the reason why the process of sequestration was given instead of the ordinary execution, in the act of 1836. That the franchises of a company are not identical with its property, the act itself indicates; for it authorizes the seizure without limit of the coin of a banking company to pay a single debt, although it may not leave in its vaults sufficient to enable the bank to transact business. The act itself therefore precludes the view that property necessary to the transaction of the business for which the corporation was formed must have been sequestered under the act of 1836, or must now be sold under special writ given by the act of 1870.</p>

There is some looseness in the popular idea of a franchise. Whether exercised by individuals or by corporations, franchises are such rights, privileges and powers as are specially granted by the sovereignty and exercisable only by virtue of such grant: Anderson’s Law Dictionary, ‘ Franchise; ’ 8 American &amp; English Encyclopsedia of Law, 585. Unless the right of perpetual succession be such, a private business corporation possesses no franchises whatever. Certainly the public had no interest in the continuance of its business, nor is there any good reason why any of its property may not be taken upon execution, as it certainly may be taxed or subjected to liens. In Prouty v. Prouty, <a href="/pa/155/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="155 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="983246" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0112-01">155 Pa. 112</a>, the property of a corporation insolvent in fact was sold upon ordinary executions and distributed to the creditors in the ordinary manner.

McKee’s Rocks Oil Co., do not in our opinion sustain the conclusions there reached. Bayard’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/72/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="72 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="434617" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0453-01">72 Pa. 453</a>, the first of these, was a case in which all the property and franchises of a public corporation were sold. Whether the execution was an ordinary fi. fa. or the special writ provided under the act of 1870 in fact, it was treated in the opinion of the court as being the latter. And the only point decided is that in such a case the writ created no lien, and that all the creditors were entitled to participate in the distribution. Nothing bearing upon the question was decided in Fairmount Coal Co.’s Appeal, 14 Weekly Notes, 214. Hopkins’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/90/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="90 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="1065570" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0069-01">90 Pa. 69</a>, is the first case which gives any color to the doctrine contended for by the exceptants. This case arose upon the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the property of a private corporation, upon an ordinary fi. fa. Between the parties it was agreed that it should be disposed of as if upon a bill in equity filed by creditors of the corporation against the first lien creditors, alleg<a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>ing fraud in their executions. It was held that the first liens were fraudulent in law, being preferences given by the officers controlling the corporation to themselves. Treating the case as a proceeding in equity, in accordance with the stipulation, the court permitted other creditors to intervene, and setting aside the fraudulent writs distributed the money (the corporation being insolvent) first, to a landlord’s claim for rent; second, to the executions not tainted with fraud ; and third, to the general creditors. This decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court, and it seems to us directly against the position taken by the exceptants and held by the learned court of common pleas of Allegheny county. For the liens not fraudulent were recognized in the distribution, although it was upon these executions that the fund was raised; and the distribution to the general creditors was only of what remained after satisfying the liens, and was distinctly made upon the assumption that the court was acting as a court of equity, and distributing assets of an insolvent corporation. If there is anything in the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Mercur inconsistent with this decree, and with the uniform current of authority prior to this case, we think we ought to attend rather to the points decided by the entire court than the views expressed in the opinion, especially as there appears to have been no discussion of the question here involved in that case. It seems too much to say that because Justice Mercur, whose statement of the law is perfectly sound as applied to sales of franchises and appurtenant property under the act of 1870, overlooked the distinction between such cases and sales of property not connected with public franchises upon ordinary executions, (the point not being suggested in the argument before him,) that therefore the distinction so well established by the cases has been abolished by the Supreme Court. Nor is the remark in the per curiam opinion in Bank v. The Coke Co., <a href="/citations/?q=187%20Pa.%20601" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="187 Pa. 601">187 Pa. 601</a>, to be taken as the deliberate opinion even of the judge by whom it was written, much less of the court before whom the question was not raised.</p>

The consideration of equity and justice suggested in the able opinion of Judge Slagle may be worthy the attention of the legislature.

Whether solvent or insolvent their property is subject to seizure for the satisfaction of the creditor by whom it is seized, by the express provisions of the act of 1836. If the course of distribution is to be changed by the mere fact that a company is insolvent without aiy regard to public interests, the change should come from the legislature and not from the court.</p>
