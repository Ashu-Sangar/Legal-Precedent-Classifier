That opinion practically affirms that of the learned judge of the court below in this case both as to the decree and the reasons therefor. But, subsequently to the first decree in Krecker v. Shirey, supra, we on further reflection concluded it should be modified so far as to impose the costs of the suit upon the church corporation. <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>This case is the same as Krecker v. Shirey. The master here finds as a fact that these defendants, the officers of St. John’s Church, and a majority of the congregation adhered to Mr. Schultz as pastor and made defense to the suit in good faith. This being the fact the costs are in the sound discretion of the court, and we are of opinion they should be imposed on thé corporation. We therefore modify the seventh clause of final decree, and order and direct that St. John’s German Church of the Evangelical Association at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, pay the record costs of this appeal; this not to include witness fees.</p>

This part of the decree is therefore modified so as to affect not such voluntarjr payments made by defendants to Mr. Schultz as pastor’s salary from March, 1891; but as to contributions and collections for general purposes of the church corporation, such as missionary, educational funds, etc., no modification is made. As by the decision in Krecker v. Shirey, supra, the St. John’s German Church of the Evangelical Association at Bethlehem is composed of those who adhered to the General Conference which met at Indianapolis in 1891, the plaintiffs are the legal church organization ; they alone áre entitled to moneys contributed for general church purposes.</p>
