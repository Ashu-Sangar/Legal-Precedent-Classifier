Therefore it is plain that the real purpose of this bill is to put the defendant out of possession and restore the plaintiff to the possession that she lost by proceedings at law. This, we think, appears very plainly by reading the bill. The judgmentin ejectment had accomplished its purpose long before the bill was filed. It is well settled that the execution of the writ, for proper reasons, might have been restrained in equity, but it is too late to do that after the writ has been fully exe<a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>cuted by the sheriff and returned into court, which was the situation in this case when the bill was filed.</p>

If the title was bad it is remarkable that in all this elaborate bill, not one defect is pointed out. If the defendant did say, in substance, what she avers in paragraph 8, we think it a proper construction that he meant to say that he would execute no other or better title than he had agreed to do by their contract.

The general rule is that to render the adjudication of a court of law conclusive in a court of equity the jurisdiction of the former must be broad enough to cover the whole ground and leave no essential point untouched. When this is the case, especially in courts which administer equity in common law proceedings, there seems to be no substantial reason why the judgment should not be final. If a court of equity takes jurisdiction it is simply to retry the same case on the same grounds, and it necessarily delays the course of justice.</p>

McManes, supra, is in harmony with the doctrine that a purely equitable defense, which could not be considered in a legal forum, although made and overruled at law, is ground for an injunction, but it overlooks the fact that in this state a court of law can consider every equity set up. Referring to this decision the learned editors of Leading Cases in Equity in the notes to the Earl of Oxford’s Case, vol. 2, part 2, p. 1364, say: “ The decision is more significant because the courts of Pennsylvania exercise an equitable jurisdiction under the forms of law, and may afford relief against a judgment for any cause that would be available before a chancellor.” In Mitchell on Motions and Rules at Common Law, p. 78, it is said: “The rule to open judgment and let the defendant into a defense is peculiar to Pennsylvania practice, and is a clear example of our system of administering equity under common law forms.” The learned author, in referring to Wistar v. McManes and the act of 1877 giving the right to appeal from the refusal to open a judgment, says : “ The effect of this statutory extension of the remedy by rule on the question of barring a subsequent bill in equity for the same matter and consequently on the practice, cannot perhaps be safely predicted.” In 1879, the same year in which this was written, Gordinier’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/89/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="89 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="1063212" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0528-01">89 Pa. 528</a>, was decided, in which <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>it was held that after the discharge of a rule to show cause why a habere facias possessionem should not be set aside it was too late to apply for an injunction.</p>

In the opinion reversing the decree both Wis-tar v. McManes and Gordinier’s Appeal are discussed, and it is said: “ If we adhere to the last decision of the court it is fatal to the bill. Why should we not so adhere ? Under our system of jurisprudence the courts of common law have full equity powers. Many of them may be invoked either by motion and rule or by bill. In those cases where it is optional for a party to elect in which manner he will apply for the exercise of those equitable powers and he does so elect, and the court with full power to grant the desired relief after full hearing refuses it, why should not such a decision be conclusive? ”</p>
