The question in such a case is one for the determination of the jury under all the evidence, and the credibility they may attach to testimony of the respective witnesses.</p>

Of course the greater opportunity for observation, and the greater knowledge and experience, the better is the witness qualified to testify, but the weight to be given to the testimony is largely dependent upon the credibility of the witnesses, and what credit shall be given to their evidence is for the jury. So that I cannot say to you, as a matter of law, that greater weight is to be given to the testimony of those who have knowledge and observation of several of such sales, than of a witness who has knowledge of but one such sale.
