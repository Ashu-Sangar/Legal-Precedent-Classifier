At and previous to the sale, Edwin Sassaman, Esq., was the attorney for Solomon Schweitzer and his coexec.utors.. When they met to arrange for the sale of this property, Solomon expressed a desire to have the property. Adam, his coexecutor, said it had always been understood that Solomon was to-have the property if he could get it. Subsequently, Solomon consulted Mr. Sassaman as to what arrangements could be-made about getting the money to buy the farm, stating that,, from conversations with parties in the neighborhood, he thought it would bring about $20,000. His attorney saw parties in Philadelphia who promised to raise from 40 to 60 per cent of the price on first mortgage, and Solomon was thereupon informed of this fact previous to the sale. All of the executors were-informed and understood that an executor had no right to bid himself at the sale; that thereupon Solomon Schweitzer engaged Louis Moyer to bid for him, and his bidding was to be regulated by Mr. Sassaman, the attorney. The instructions to Mr. Moyer were to bid until he was told to stop. Mr. Moyer appeared at the sale. When tract No. 1 was bid up to $167, Solomon, the executor, requested the attorney, Mr. Sassaman, <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>to stop the auctioneer until the matter could be talked over with his sisters. He had previously considered $150 per acre as the highest limit to which he would go in his bids, although he never informed his coexecutors or sisters or Louis Moyer of this fact. He instructed Mr. Sassaman that it was nearly high enough for him. In the presence of the coexecutors and sisters the matters were talked over. Solomon desired to have the property, and the sisters were willing that he should have it. The three sisters agreed that he should go ahead, that they would leave their money remain in the place if he bought the farm. Adam Schweitzer also agreed to help him, without mentioning to what extent. Neither the terms nor conditions npr the time for which the sisters would permit their money to remain in the farm were spoken of, suggested or agreed upon. Thereupon Solomon Schweitzer instructed Mr. Sassaman to tell Moyer to go slow, and the bidding proceeded. When the bid reached $205 per acre, Solomon requested Mr. Sassaman to stop Mr. Moyer from bidding for him, but Mr. Sassaman could not get through the crowd to where Moyer was standing — the bidding being spirited and the crowd large — and when Mr. Sassaman succeeded in reaching Mr. Moyer, Moyer’s bid was $217. Abraham Schweitzer bid $217.50, and there being no other bidding the property was struck down to him. Louis Moyer was also a bidder on tract No. 2, and this also was knocked down to Abraham Schweitzer for $108.25 per acre, amounting in the aggregate to $1,075.73. None of the sisters or the coexecutors knew of the amounts of Moyer’s bids or how much Solomon desired to have bid for the property. Nor did any of the executors, or Solomon or the sisters, know that Abraham Schweitzer was bidding for Mr. Rigg or the Traction Company. The coexecutors knew that Moyer was bidding for Solomon. [The executors and heirs knew that Solomon was anxious to have the place and was endeavoring to obtain it. Moyer was employed by Solomon alone; none of the other executors authorized any one to bid or puff the sale, and Solomon employed Moyer to bid and buy the place for- him, and not with any intent to puff or enhance the price of the property against bidders.] [3] [All the bids made by Louis Moyer were made at the request of Solomon with the bona fide intention on the part of Solomon, through Louis Moyer, to buy the <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>property.

Bouvier’s Diet., vol. 2, 394, or as is pithily set forth in Doolubdass v. Ramloll, 3 Law and Eq. Rep. 39-47, ‘ a puffer is not a real bidder; by an arrangement between him and the vendor his bid is to go for nothing; but as to the-competing bidders, it appears to be what it is not, a real bidding, and the vendor by authorizing it is guilty of a fraud on them, and cannot profit by it.’' [The sale is, therefore, not. voidable for the employment of a puffer; Moyer was employed' not to enhance the price by bidding against others, but to bid and buy bona fide.] [16]</p>

One cannot conceive of an individual owner bidding at his own sale secretly, there being no necessity for buying in his own property. Such action on his part necessarily and at once sets the seal to the imputation of fraud. The reservation of an open bid may be necessary to prevent a sacrifice, but the bid being open, no one can be deceived or defrauded. It would be in the interest of sound public policy were the law declared to be that no trustee, executor or administrator should be permitted to bid at any sale held by him unless the right to bid appears definitely in the conditions of sale. It would effectually remove temptation and banish the suspicion of fraud. But I do not find the authorities go to this extent.</p>

The employment of and the bidding by Moyer were bona fide and for the single purpose of securing the property for his principal. He was not a puffer engaged by the vendors to force up the price against the public, and there was no actual fraud in the transaction. The plaintiff was represented at the sale by his agent who was authorized to bid for him, but the fact that he was so represented, or that he intended to purchase the property, was unknown to the defendants. In bidding upon it his agent followed his instructions to the letter. Schweitzer was one of the executors by whom the property was sold under a power in the will of their ancestor who died seized of it, and he was therefore virtually a bidder at his own sale.
