From these cases it appears that appellant at one time held a policy in the American Life Insurance Company on the life of Henry G. Leisenring for $6,000. From 1876 to 1889, the whereabouts of Leisenring was unknown, and in April, 1889, appellant arranged with the officers of the American Life Insurance Company to surrender the $6,000 policy and to take in substitution therefor a $2,500 full-paid policy, and this arrangement was consummated by the surrender and cancellation of the $6,000 policy and the delivery by the company in lieu thereof of said full-paid policy of $2,500. Leisen<a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>ring had died about ten days before this exchange of policies was effected, but neither of the parties knew of his death at the time of the exchange. The appellant learned of his death a short time subsequent to the surrender and cancellation of the $6,000 policy and acceptance by'her in lieu thereof of said $2,500 full-paid policy, and then made a demand on the company to take back the $2,500 policy and to reinstate the $6,000 canceled policy, and on the company refusing so to do, on October 4, 1889, she filed a bill in equity praying the reinstatement of said $6,000 policjq and for a decree praying that the American Life Insurance Company be required to pay the appellant the full amount of said policy. On demurrer the bill was dismissed. On appeal to the Supreme. Court the decree was reversed in April, 1891, and the case sent back for a rehearing: <a href="/citations/?q=140%20Pa.%20201" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="140 Pa. 201">140 Pa. 201</a>. The corporation had meanwhile become insolvent and was dissolved by the decree of the Dauphin county court on May 18,, 1890, and The Real Estate Title Insurance and Trust Company was appointed receiver. While the cause was before a master appointed by the said court to report whether the appellant should claim on the $6,000 policy or the $.2,500 policy, the auditors appointed to distribute the fund on the first account of the receiver were taking proofs of claims, and when they were about to close their proofs and make report, the appellant came before them, and the question was presented whether she should proceed with her proofs before the auditors de novo, or whether she would let her proofs stand over to the second account, and in the meanwhile reach a final decree iii the forum she had selected. The agreement of counsel representing a majority of policy holders, as appears in the first report of the auditors, is as follows:</p>
