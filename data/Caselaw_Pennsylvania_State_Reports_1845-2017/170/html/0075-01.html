They do agree to so much of it as covers the barn and the other buildings, you will find on the policy when it is presented to you, each of which was insured; two were insured for $400 and the contents, as they say, for $400. The other portion they deny having insured in those buildings. And they say the smoke house, which was insured at $5.00, and, as they say, the contents at $500, was not burnt; and, therefore, they say they are not entitled to pay, not bound to pay for this meat and sausage, burnt in the other room where Mr. Graybill says he told Mr. Hershey it was to be placed after being smoked in the smoke house.] [2] There being then some difficulty with reference to the understanding and construction and the terms of this agreement they have brought it here.</p>

Were the meat and sausage, which the plaintiff claims were destroyed, covered by this policy of insurance here presented or not? The testimony of Mr. Gray bill is, he made application for this insurance, and told the president of the company, who took the application, where the meat was to be put after it was smoked. He contends that under this policy it was insured; this company contends it was not; and as you find whether it was or was not, from the evidence under this policy, your verdict will be increased or remain firm at $800.] [3] It cannot be less than that.</p>

They differ. The plaintiff and defendant differ; and the court must-not use its discretion to modify conditions or provisions of the contract entered into by the parties in order to effect what it might consider a more equitable arrangement than that resulting from the enforcement of the strict terms of the policy; but in the construction of an insurance policy it is to be observed, the language of the policy is not in all cases conclusively binding or effective. Grounds may sometimes exist for relief in equity. Thus, in a clear case of mutual mistake, where it plainly appears by the evidence outside of the contract that the real agreement of the parties is not correctly evidenced by the policy; or where there is a mistake on one side, or fraud in introducing it on the other, a written contract may be reformed to correspond with the real agreement. If the language of the policy is ambiguous and fairly open to doubt, oral evidence is admissible to explain the real meaning of the parties. Contracts of insurance having been framed by the insurers in their interest, and the insured being obliged to accept the form offered in order to secure insurance, any ambiguity as to the intent or meaning of its terms, what property it is intended to cover, or where situated will be construed in favor of the insured, and the contract will be sustained if possible and liberally construed to insure in<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>demnity.

In this case Mr. Jacob Hershey, who was then president of the insurance company, visited the place where the insurance was to be effected and took the application himself from Mr. Graybill, who desired to be insured, and saw the premises. Mr. Graybill was asked — at the time he got the policy, at the time the policy was delivered to him from Mr. Jacob Hershey, who went home as you remember and wrote out the policy and brought it back — whether Mr. Hershey informed him the meat, he was testifying to here, was insured in this policy, and his answer was : ‘ Yes, sir; Mr. Hershey told me. I told him this meat I want insured, not the smoke house, because it would not hold that much. I had a separate room for smoking and would move it in there. That’s the way I alwaj's did.’ Then was asked the question : ‘ Please state whether or not he told you that was insured at the time he gave you the policy? A. Yes, sir; he said that is all right.’ This Mr. Hershey denies. [You will have to judge between them, which is most likely to be telling the truth, which is most likely to recollect. Both are interested; one on the part of the company, the other on his own part. That is about the only point in the case. If you believe from the evidence that Mr. Graybill told Mr. Hershey at the time he was there inspecting the premises to be insured where these contents were to be, and that was understood by Mr. Hershey, and when he came back he told Mr. Graybill upon inquiry it was insured, that covered it, then that would bind the company.

The question presented on this appeal is whether the smoked meats in the storage room, which were taken there as fast as they were cured in the smoke house, were contents of the smoke house within the meaning of the policy and were to be paid for by the company as part of the loss for which it was liable. Words must be understood in the sense in which they are commonly used in the business to which the contract in which they are found relates. This contract was to insure the buildings, machinery and stock of a butcher. The' president of the company proposing to insure was on the ground. The buildings and the property were examined by him. The evidence shows that in the barn and butcher shops there were a steam engine and boiler with conveniences for handling dressed cattle, machinery for chopping or grinding meat, and for making bologna and other sausages. These as the plaintiff alleges constitute the contents of the barn and butcher shop that were insured for four hundred dollars. The smoke house and storage room were also pointed out to him and it was explained to him, as the plaintiff testifies, that the smoke house could hold but a small amount of meat at one time while the process of smoking was going on, but the hams, s.ausage, bacon, or other meat was removed from the smoke house when cured and stored in the storage room, and that what was wanted was insurance on the smoked goods. The plaintiff says that the president stated that the smoked meat would be properly insured as contents of the smoke house, and these words were written in the application and policy with that understanding, viz: that they would include and cover the smoked meats taken out of the smoke house for storage in the room used for that purpose. The learned judge of the court below left this evidence to the jury for their consideration, telling them if they were satisfied by it the word “ contents ” .used in connection with the smoke house was understood a.nd intended by both insurer and insured to cover the smoked meats in store, whether actually in the smoke house or not, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover to the extent of five <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>hundred dollars for his loss on these goods. This is assigned as error, and the contention of the appellant is that it permitted an alteration to be made in a written instrument upon the uncorroborated testimony of the plaintiff. But the word “ contents ” is not a certain and definite description of any particular class of goods. Its meaning must be ascertained by considering the context, the nature and methods of the business for which the building whose contents are to be insured is to be used, and the understanding and intentions of the parties as expressed at the time the insurance was contracted for. Thus we learn from the evidence in this case that the contents of the butcher shop were not made up of slaughtered cattle, but of a steam engine and various pieces of machinery; while the contents of the smoke house included hams, bacon, bologna sausages, and other forms of smoked meat. This is, in the absence of a detailed description of the articles in the body of the policy, the only way in which the character and value of the contents of a building can be shown. But the defendant alleges that as the building was not burned its contents could not be. This is a non sequitur. The contents might be destroj-ed while outside the building, and when that happens the question of the plaintiff’s right to recover must depend on whether the purpose of the removal was such as to detach the goods permanently from the building and create a new or an increased hazard not contemplated when the contract for insurance was made. The investigation of this question is not an attempt to reform the contract but to determine its meaning and extent. The rule in equity governing the reformation of contracts is not applicable therefore, but the jury is at liberty to determine the question presented to them in this case by the preponderance of the evidence. The evidence showing the capacity of the smoke house, the necessity for the removal of the smoked meat as soon as it was properly cured to some place near by for storage, while a fresh supply of meat for smoking was put in its place, the location of the storage room and quantity of smoked meats kept in store ready for sale, was relevant to the inquiry in this case and was properly admitted. So was the evidence tending to show that the attention of the insurer was called to the manner in which the smoke house was used and the smoked meats stored, that he was informed that <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>the smoked meats were what were to be insured in connection with the smoke house ; and that with full knowledge of all the facts he selected the word “ contents ” as a proper and sufficiently descriptive word to cover the smoked meats whether in the smoke house undergoing the process of smoking, or in the store room after its completion. The facts and circumstances thus brought to the attention of the court and jury were helps to a correct exposition of the words the parties had employed. They tended to corroborate the plaintiff’s version of the contract and to sustain his claim. They were persuasive in their character and, as we infer from their verdict, satisfied the jury that the words “ contents of the smoke house ” were understood and intended by both parties to cover the smoked meats passing through the smoke house to the room near by in which they we're stored till needed for the supply of customers. We see no error in the rulings complained of and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
