L. 238, which is as follows:\n\u201c And provided further, That the provisions of this section shall not apply to the taxation of the capital stock of corporations, limited partnerships and joint-stock associations, organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes and actually carrying on manufacturing within the state, excepting companies engaged in the brewing or distilling of spirits or malt liquors and such as enjoy and exercise the right of eminent domain.\u201d\nThe court directed a verdict for plaintiff subject to the question of law reserved whether the company was exempt from taxation.
