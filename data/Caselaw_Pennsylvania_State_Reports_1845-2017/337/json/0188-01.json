        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nPlaintiff brought an action in trespass against defendant to recover damages for the death of her husband, Clarence J. Douville, who was fatally injured when he fell into an open elevator shaft on defendant\u2019s premises. The jury returned a verdict for $7,017.00 in favor of the plaintiff, and defendant thereupon filed motions for judgment n. o. v. and for a new trial, which were refused, and judgment was entered on the verdict. Defendant appealed.\nDouville was employed as a customs warehouse storekeeper by the United States Treasury Department, and for a year prior to the accident he had been stationed at defendant\u2019s warehouse. His duties consisted of supervising the placing and removal of material in the bonded section of the warehouse, which section was located on the second floor and was kept locked. Douville was in possession of the keys to it. Whenever materials were put in or taken out of bond it was necessary to use the elevators, but Douville never operated them.\nOn the first floor of the warehouse there were two sections known as A and B. They were divided by a fire wall and access between them was by means of a fire door leading through the wall. The A section of the warehouse was occupied by defendant and the B section by a tenant, Hemphill & Co. Shortly before 5 o\u2019clock on August 13, 1937, Douville was supervising the moving of certain bales of wool from a portion of the first floor of the premises occupied by Hemphill 6 Co., up to the bonded section of the warehouse. Two men were assigned to do the actual moving under Douville\u2019s supervision. At the end of the dividing wall there was a freight elevator, to which access could be had from either section. Just as the two workmen were approaching the freight elevator from the B section, they saw Douville walk into the elevator shaft from the A section side and make his fatal plunge to the cellar floor below. The safety gate on the A side was open, although the elevator was at a different floor. Appellant does not contest the jury\u2019s finding that this condition was due to the negligence of its servants. Its only claim is that Douville was guilty of contributory negligence and that the court below should so have declared as a matter of law. Both the presumption and the jury\u2019s finding are, of course, in his favor. It is only in a clear case where the evidence is such that reasonably minded men can unite in the conclusion that a victim of an accident was negligent, that a court is justified in declaring him so. See McCracken v. Curwensville Borough, 309 Pa. 98, 114, 115, 163 A. 217, and Rowland v. Canuso et al., 329 Pa. 72, 196 A. 823.\nAs to whether or not Douville was negligent depends on the condition as to light near the elevator shaft as he approached it. If an elevator shaft is properly lighted, a person who approaches it is charged with the duty of seeing whether or not the elevator door is open when the elevator is not at that floor. Dangers which are apparent to ordinary observation must be avoided by those who approach them. See Cracraft v. Bessemer Limestone Co., 210 Pa. 15, 59 A. 432, and Gallagher v. Snellenburg, 210 Pa. 642, 60 A. 307. On the other hand, a person who approaches an elevator or an elevator shaft in a place so dark that scarcely anything is visible does so at his own risk and if, while thus enveloped in darkness, he is injured by colliding with an object or falling into a hole, he will be adjudged guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Hoffner et ux. v. Bergdoll, 309 Pa. 558, 164 A. 607.\nThe third class of cases is where a person walks in a dim light and has reason to think that an elevator is at the floor when in fact it is not and he uses his best judgment as he proceeds and then meets with an accident. In such a case the question of his contributory negligence is for the jury: Murphy v. Bernheim & Sons, Inc., 327 Pa. 285, 194 A. 194. In that ease we said: \u201cThe fact that elevator shafts are no longer places of probable danger is a fact which individuals carry in their subconscious minds when they approach them and therefore they do not normally approach them with the utmost degree of caution. When one becomes accustomed after long experience to finding elevator shafts safeguarded, he naturally takes it for granted that all elevator shafts are safeguarded. This does not excuse him from taking care but it decreases the degree of care the law imposes on one who would escape the imputation of negligence.\u201d See also Dively v. Penn-Pittsburgh Corp., 332 Pa. 65.\nAs to the condition of illumination near defendant\u2019s elevator shaft at the time of the fatal accident to plaintiff\u2019s decedent, the evidence is that there were no windows to admit daylight, that there were a number of 40-watt electric lights in the ceiling, the nearest one of which to the elevator shaft was 20 feet away from it. There was also a 40-watt \u201cdrop light\u201d in front of the elevator shaft but at the time of the accident this was turned off. It was also testified that \u201cthe light in front of the shaft on the B side\u201d was lighted, that the ceiling in the A section was \u201c12 or 13 feet high,\u201d that there was \u201cmore or less merchandise stored on the floor, that keeps coming in and going out, ... in the neighborhood of a thousand bags of malt,\u201d that the merchandise was piled high, forming \u201caisles,\u201d and that there was a \u201cclearing about 9 or 10 feet square\u201d in front of the No. 1 elevator where Douville fell. On the B side of the warehouse bales were piled up \u201cpretty near to the ceiling,\u201d and there were also 7 bales of wool, \u201c2 feet wide\u201d and \u201c4' or 5' tall,\u201d the nearest bale being about \u201c4 feet from the elevator shaft,\u201d which were to be placed in the bonded section of the warehouse.\nThe fact that the 40-watt light described as \u201cright in front of the elevator shaft\u201d was out at the time of the accident supports the inference that the illumination at that place at that time was considerably less than the illumination found there normally. The fact that there were \u201cbags of malt\u201d piled up \u201c12 or 13 feet high\u201d in the A section (as described by a witness) supports an inference that these piles affected the illumination from the ceiling lights, the nearest one of which was 20 feet away from the elevator shaft, and would cause shadows to be cast on the narrow aisle Douville had to traverse to reach the shaft. It is a matter of common knowledge that nothing is more confusing to the vision than alternate lights and shadows, whether these are found on the highway where one is motoring or in a room where one is walking. One witness described the light that was 20 feet away from the elevator shaft as being on \u201ca drop cord.\u201d He added: \u201cAll the lights were on drop cords.\u201d If such was the fact (and the jury could so find) and bags of malt were piled up \u201c12 or 13 feet high,\u201d these lights would not deliver effective lighting at the entrance to the elevator shaft.\nUnder our decisions the case was for the jury and we agree with the statement made by the court below in refusing to enter judgment n. o. v.: \u201cThe jury was justified in concluding that the entrance to the freight elevator was in shadow, or in a very dim light.\u201d\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
