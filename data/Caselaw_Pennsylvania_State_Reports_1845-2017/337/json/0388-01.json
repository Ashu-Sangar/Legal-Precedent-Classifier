        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThe appeal is from judgment sustaining a statutory demurrer to the statement of claim. The statement is very meager and avers that, \u201cas one of the executors\u201d of testator, on October 3, 1930, he delivered $10,000 to defendant pursuant to the terms of a receipt attached to his statement and on October 4, 1937, demanded the return of that sum and that defendant declined to repay it. The bank acknowledges receiving the money \u201cto be held in trust under the following . . . conditions:\n\u201c(1) To pay the net income therefrom to Mrs. Sol Heller e/o Ben Cohen, 86 Riverside Drive, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in quarterly installments.\n\u201c(2) This trust may be terminated and the fund withdrawn at any time upon reasonable notice by Ben Cohen, Executor.\u201d\nThe learned court below held the obligation' of the bank was to account for the trust property, not to return the sum of $10,000 (compare Osterling\u2019s Estate, 324 Pa. 167, 170, 188 A. 180), and gave leave to amend; no amendment being filed, the court entered judgment. While we affirm the judgment on the ground that, no cause of action is stated, the affirmance is not to be taken as approval of the conduct of the executor, apparently one of two or-more executors (paragraph 3 statement of claim), or of the suit without the joinder of all the executors, or the delegation of the power to invest testator\u2019s property. These and similar questions are left until, if ever, it becomes necessary to deal with them on a more complete record.\nJudgment affirmed.\n; Mr. Justice Schaffer took no part in the decision of this case.",
