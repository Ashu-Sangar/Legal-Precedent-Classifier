L. 1199, which cover, inter alia, the subject of taxation here involved and in themselves provide adequate methods whereby the taxpayer may have any assessment made against him reviewed by the Board of Revision of Taxes of Philadelphia County and may appeal from that Board to the Court of Common Pleas and from there to the appellate courts. This statute confirms our conclusion that due process of law is afforded to plaintiff and to all taxpayers.",
