If it is, the fund for distribution not being sufficient to pay both claims in full, the right of the Commonwealth to invoke the statute against the city’s claim under the rule that when the fund is not sufficient to pay all, each creditor has a right to oppose any other claimant by showing payment of the debt or that it is barred by the statute of limitations, is beyond question: <em>Claghorn’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/181/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="181 Pa. 600" data-case-ids="891434" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0600-01">181 Pa. 600</a>, 607; <em>In Re Margaret McCanna, </em><a href="/pa-super/77/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="77 Pa.
