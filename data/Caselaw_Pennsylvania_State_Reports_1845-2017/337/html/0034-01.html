It made a return in Philadelphia on which the tax collecting authorities made a demand for the 4 mill tax on the total value returned. It also made a return in Montgomery County where the taxing authorities demanded a tax in the proportion that the number of trustees in Montgomery County bore to the whole number, in accord with the amendment of 1939. Each county intervened in the proceeding in the other <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>county and in Philadelphia the common pleas sustained the tax collecting authorities and held that the entire tax was collectible there.

They contend that they are not in default within the statutory meaning of that term, and that the counties should not be permitted to invoke the penalty provision if the taxes are paid immediately upon return of these records to the courts below.</p>

      <em> </em>the state imposed a tax on certain personal property “annually, for county purposes, and, in cities coextensive with counties for city and county purposes, at the rate of four mills on each dollar of the value thereof, and no failure to assess or return the same shall discharge such owner or holder thereof from liability therefor.” Section 2 dealt with the mechanics of collection and required the board of revision of taxes or the county commissioners to furnish and distribute blanks for the returns by the proper party of the “personal property made taxable by the first sec<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>tion of this act. ...” Section 16 provided that the tax should be collected as other taxes for county purposes are collected.

(2d) 693</a>, it was necessary to determine in which county a return should be made and tax paid by two trustees, one located in Philadelphia and the other in Montgomery County, the trust property being kept and administered in Philadelphia. It was held that the statute required the returns to be made and the tax to be paid in Philadelphia. Thereafter the Act of 1913 was amended by the Act of June 19, 1939, P. L. 413, providing that in the case of co-trustees “residents of the Commonwealth, but not all of which are domiciled in the same county, return of such personal property shall be made in each county of this Commonwealth where any of the same are domiciled, and there shall be paid in each such county that portion of the tax imposed upon such personal property so held, owned, or possessed, as the number of such trustees, agents, or attorneys-in-fact domiciled therein bears to the total number thereof, notwithstanding the residence of any beneficiary or the place where such personal property is kept.” It is the legislative power to make this provision that Philadelphia County denies.</p>
    <p id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[283,1677,1150,587]]]'>We may repeat that the tax is imposed by the state on specified property and for county purposes. The statute does not authorize the counties to levy taxes on property to be designated by them and at rates to be fixed by them. They do not act as an independent taxing district. The history<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> of the personal property tax shows that originally the state received all of the tax and that the counties were mere collection agencies for the state. Later, part of the tax was returned by the state to the counties in which it had been collected. Finally, they were allowed to retain it all.</p>

      <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>In the Philadelphia case, the power of the state to direct the distribution of this tax, as provided in the amendment, was said to violate Article IX, section 1, of the constitution, providing “All taxes shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws ...” The learned court below said the validity of the amendment “depends on whether or not the Legislature may authorize the imposition of a tax on the personal property of a trust estate located, managed, and administered in one county by a corporate trustee there located, by another county because of the incident that an individual co-trustee of the state is a resident of the latter county.” The court also said, “The Legislature has undertaken, by means of the statute under consideration, to grant to a county where the trust property involved is not located or administered, the right to assess taxes thereon in a certain proportion because of the incident that one of the trustees charged with the administration of the trust happens to live there.” These quotations indicate the error in the position taken below. The legislature has not authorized the imposition of a tax by one county on property in another; on the contrary, the legislature itself has imposed the tax at the rate of 4 mills on property designated in the statute. It has provided that the tax so levied shall be collected by county authorities who originally were the state’s collection agencies. The taxing statute is effective throughout the commonwealth. It cannot be said that the tax is not uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax. The collection is provided for by general law. The cases cited by the learned court below dealing with taxation by one taxing authority of property located in the territory of another taxing authority are therefore not in point.</p>

      <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>The real question is whether the legislature may declare, with respect to property taxed by the state for the benefit of all the counties in the state, that co-trustees residing in different counties shall return this intangible property and pay the tax to the counties in which each is domiciled and in proportion to their number. Or, in other words, whether the state may say that the domicile of the holders of the legal title shall determine where this tax on intangibles shall be paid and in what proportions. We have been referred to no. constitutional provision prohibiting it: For the purpose of distributing the proceeds of such a tax among the counties for whose benefit the state imposed the tax, their classification according to the respective residences of co-trustees is not unreasonable. The court may not require the legislature, in making such classification, to disregard the legal protection afforded by a county to a resident co-trustee who is part holder of the legal title of the subject of taxation: see <em>People </em>v. <em>Feitner, </em><a href="/ny/168/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="168 N.Y. 360" data-case-ids="2299636" data-case-paths="/ny/168/0360-01">168 N.

This is not only just but it is essential. <em>To any extent that one man is compelled to pay in order to relieve others of a public burden properly resting upon them, his property is taken for private purposes as plainly and as palpably as it would be if appropriated to the payment of the debts or the discharge of obligations which the person thus relieved by his payments might owe to private partiesH </em>(Italics added.)</p>

The court said: “It seems to us that this law is an attempt on the part of the legislature to tax one community for the benefit of another, and is therefore void, from the fact that all taxation must be public and local, and for objects in which those who pay the tax have, in a legal sense, some interest, and from which they may receive some benefit.”</p>

The trust property in Philadelphia receives no benefit from the local government of Montgomery County, and to distribute the tax as the legislature here proposes, amounts to confiscation; it is in effect a taking of property for a private purpose just as surely as if it were applied to defraying the <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>private debts of the citizens of Montgomery County. They are relieved of so much of their share of the costs of their local government at the expense of property in another county. This cannot be justified on the coincidence that a single trustee resides in that county, for the tax is not upon him but upon the property, and whatever benefit he receives he receives not as trustee but as .an individual, for which he should pay a personal tax. . Nor may it be justified because the trust property is within the taxing jurisdiction of the State and unquestionably subject to taxes for State purposes. Although the tax is levied by the State, it is collected by the counties, and it is levied exclusively for the benefit of the counties in which it is collected. The State clearly would have no power to authorize Montgomery County to tax personal property within Philadelphia County; yet. here it is accomplishing that result. The legislature cannot by indirection do what it could not do directly.</p>

In the first, third and fourth situations, the property tax is collected and paid in. Philadelphia County. In the second only, is the property which is taxed apportioned among the several counties in which the trustees reside. If there is any reasonable basis for classification in the fact of the trustees’ residence, then the tax in the first situation should go to Montgomery County; but the Act deals only with multiple trustees. If the protection ■ afforded by the place of the trustees’ residence is the basis of the classification, then in the fourth situation a proportionate share of the trust property should not be taxed, as one trustee is a non-resident. It seems to me that this exemplifies the artificiality of the classification, for if the legislature intended that the property of trusts administered by multiple trustees should have its situs for taxation at their several residences, it should have provided that, where one of the trustees resides beyond the borders of Pennsylvania, his proportionate share of the trust property would not be taxed in this State. Yet this was not done.' Clearly, this distinction as to residence affords no proper basis for separately classifying these trusts for the purposes of a property tax. In one case the long-forsaken doctrine of <em>mohilia sequuntur personam </em>is used in determining the taxable situs of the property, and in the others it is not. Classification, to be valid, must be. based upon a sound distinction between the classes and not upon an arbitrary distinction which has no refer-, ence to the purpose to be effected by the legislation. Since the classification attempted by this amendment lacks this essential requirement, the legislation clearly violates the uniformity provision of our Constitution.</p>
