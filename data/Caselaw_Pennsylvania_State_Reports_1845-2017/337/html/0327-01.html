Testatrix made other gifts in trust for other charitable purposes, among them, a gift for the benefit of the J. Lewis Crozer Home for Incurables and Homeopathic Hospital. Concerning the park, she provided that the board <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>of trustees should be composed of two executors named in her will and three additional persons designated by office or description, two of them common pleas court judges at the time of her death, and the fifth, the burgess of Upland. When she died William B. Broomall was one of the judges answering the description. Judge Broomall’s name appeared as a subscribing witness on the will and codicils. This fact led to inquiries whether he was a disinterested<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> witness under section 6 of the Wills Act with respect to (1) the exercise of the power of appointment of the land, and (2) with respect to the gift to the J.

In the Superior Court, the proceeding was dismissed on the ground that the land, at the time, was not being used for public purposes and therefore was not exempt from taxation: <em>Johnson et al. v.

No appeal was taken in that action. Later, in another proceeding, the legacies to the J. Lewis Crozer Home for Incurables wore challenged at the termination of a prior life estate and the gifts held invalid: <em>Crozer’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/296/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="296 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1116604" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0048-01">296 Pa. 48</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.%20697" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="145 A. 697">145 A. 697</a>.</p>

Howard Roop, who died April 5, 1933, leaving a will on which letters testamentary were granted to Kingsley Montgomery. He died in 1937. Montgomery’s executors, on behalf of their testator, as executor of Roop, surviving trustee, then filed an account of the trust (the account now before the court) showing the investment of the sum awarded and paid to the board of trustees in 1921 and that, after payment of expenses, there was a balance in securities and cash of $32,827.12, no part of it having been applied to the charitable purpose declared by the testatrix. Montgomery’s executors also filed a petition setting forth that Roop was the last survivor of the trustees and asking that trustees be appointed to succeed them. Successors were appointed. A stipulation signed by counsel for appellant and appellees states that the substituted trustees “are ready and willing, when, as and if such moneys are awarded to them, to devote the same to a proper and authorized charitable use.” Compare <em>Wincey’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/337/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="337 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1197285" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0129-01">337 Pa. 129</a>. Montgomery’s executors also filed a petition for distribution informing the court that the residuary legatees of Mary S. Crozer, deceased, also claimed this fund, and stating that “The questions for the court are therefore whether the bequest as above referred to is void and if void, to whom the funds should be distributed.”</p>

The contention is that the adjudication then made was wrong because Judge Broomall was not a disinterested witness as respects the gift of $25,00.0. It is agreed there was no fraud of any kind, but it. is said that, as the validity of the exercise of the power of appointment of the land was successfully challenged in the litigation referred to, and the validity of ;the gift to the J. Lewis Crozer Home for Incurables, etc. in another suit on the ground that Judge Broomall was not a disinterested witness, appellant- may now say that if, at the audit of the account in 1921, the next of kin had challenged the validity of this gift it would also have been set aside. But the court is not now permitted to make the inferences suggested. It may be noted, in passing, that the parties to the tax litigation and to the ejectment and to the challenge of the gift to' the Crozer Home, were different parties, and the inquiry concerned different subjects. The opinion in <em>Crozer’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/296/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="296 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1116604" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0048-01">296 Pa. 48</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.%20697" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="145 A. 697">145 A. 697</a>, shows that there was evidence of Judge Broomall’s active connection and interest in the J. Lewis Crozer Home. We are not advised of the evidence in the other two suits. There was no hearing on the subject as respects the gift now challenged. Judge Broomall and the other members of the board are dead and the court cannot know what their testimony might have been if the challenge had come in time and when their testimony was available. These matters are recited only to show the importance of the application of section 48 of the Fiduciaries Act as construed in the decisions referred to above.</p>
