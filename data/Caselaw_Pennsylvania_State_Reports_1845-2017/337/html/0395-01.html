    <p id="b471-3" data-blocks='[["BL_471.6",471,[132,416,1153,483]]]'>This appeal is from an order made in tbe course of tbe audit of a partial account — tbe fourth in number— of the Secretary of Banking in charge of Lansdowne Bank and Trust Company. The Secretary took possession December 18, 1931. The appellee, the township of Lower Chichester, at that time was a depositor with a credit of $23,182.76, holding as security for the repayment of its deposit, a bond and mortgage in the sum óf $16,800 owned by the bank.</p>
    <p id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.7",471,[132,910,1154,1142]]]'>The first, second and third accounts were filed December 15, 1932, July 24, 1934, and December 28, 1934, and on each the township received a dividend, in all, 27%, amounting to $6,259.34. These dividends were calculated and paid on the face of the deposit; no credit was then taken by the receiver for the value of the security held by the depositor. During the period in which the Secretary was administering the affairs of the bank, the township foreclosed its mortgage and took title to the property for one dollar. As this foreclosure occurred during the receivership, the bid is not conclusive of value between the parties: <em>Beaver County B. &amp; L. Ass’n v.

The learned judge denied the right to readjust the prior distribution, being of opinion that prior accounts were closed beyond such revision; he did, however, hold that in this and any subsequent accounting the township should receive its dividend only on the amount of its deposit, less the value of the security, in accord with the rule applied in the <em>United Security Trust Company Case, </em>supra. The Secretary, in this appeal, renews his contention which was rejected below.</p>

L. 762, and in 1931, P. L. 193. While this legislation was supplanted by the Act of 1933, P. L. 565, 71 PS section 733-1 et seq., passed while the bank’s property was being administered by the Secretary, the record is neverthéless governed by the earlier legislation except as to procedural changes made in the later statute.

But we also think that as the proceeding is in equity,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the court may require any claimant, as a condition of sharing in any subsequent fund brought in for distribution with other creditors of the same class, to do equity by crediting on the amount of dividends subsequently distributable the amount of prior overpayment resulting from the failure, in earlier accounts, to credit the value of the security held by the claimant, as in this case. What was originally done when this <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>claim was presented was of course done in good faith,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> but equality of treatment among creditors of the same class requires an adjustment in subsequent distributions in order that proper effect may be given to the legislation provided for the equal benefit of all creditors. The words of the statute, that confirmation of a partial account shall be conclusive, are fully satisfied by holding that a creditor need not pay back any money received in distribution; at the same time the equitable nature of- the proceeding will be satisfied by withholding further distribution on the revised amount of the claim until all the other creditors have shared to the same extent.

    <p id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[308,1227,1151,911]]]'>In the brief filed on behalf of the township, it is contended that the rule requiring the depositor to credit the value of his security should not be applied to a municipal deposit. The argument is that as various statutes require municipal deposits to be secured by depository bonds or other security sufficient to indemnify against loss resulting from the bank’s default, the legislature intended that “depositors of public monies shall be treated differently than ordinary depositors” and shall not have applied to them the rule in question. We must reject the argument and apply the statute fixing the order in which depositors shall be paid; it makes no distinction giving such preferential treatment to municipal .depositors: See Act of 1907, P. L. 192, section 1, as amended, 1913, P. L. 354. Whether or not a case can be made out for a decree that a constructive trust exists is not now before us.</p>
