    <p id="Aep" data-blocks='[["BL_326.6",326,[286,412,1150,750]]]'>Agnes P. R. Groome pledged a money donation to the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania, a corporation of the first class, not for profit. At her death this obligation had not been entirely discharged and, upon its face, it was barred by the statute of limitations. At the audit of her executors’ account, however, the college sought to toll the statute by testimony of two members of the Board of Corporators of the college. The auditing judge ruled that these witnesses were disqualified under the Evidence Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, sec. 5(e),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and dismissed the claim. Upon exceptions to the adjudication, the majority of the judges of the Orphans’ Court sustained the ruling of the auditing judge. This appeal followed.</p>

The dissenting judges confined themselves to a discussion of the first point raised by the auditing judge, reaching an opposite conclusion.</p>

In this light the powers given to them must be construed. Although they may ‘transact all and every business ... as fully, amply and effectually as any person or persons . . . have the right and power to manage their own concerns,’ it is expressly declared that all this shall be done for ‘the proper use, benefit and support of the said school,’ and that they must ‘hold, enjoy and exercise all such powers, authorities, jurisdictions and privileges . . . to carry the object of the school into effect.’ ” See also, <em>Sorg v.

This is so whether they be called members of a Board of Trustees, a Board of Corporators, or a Board of Directors. Furthermore, they have none of the attributes of a shareholder, especially in view of the fact that in the case of dissolution of the corporation, “. . . property devoted to . . . educational or charitable uses shall not be diverted from the objects for which it was donated, granted, bequeathed or devised.”: Nonprofit Corporation Law of May 5, 1933, P.

      <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>As to the argument that claimant’s witnesses were not specifically authorized to collect this pledge from Mrs. Groome. and, therefore, were not authorized to receive communications concerning it on behalf of the corporation, the record reveals that the Board of Corporators as a whole engaged in a campaign to raise money for the purpose of constructing a new building. It was within the power of each member to solicit contributions and pledges. Consequently, each was impliedly authorized to receive communications concerning such matters on behalf of the corporation. The pledge here in question was made during this campaign, at a time when claimant’s witnesses were, as now, members of the Board of Corporators. As such members of the corporation, they were the recipients of Mrs. Groome’s frequent promises, made after the expiration of the statute of limitations, to pay the full amount of her pledge.</p>

      <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>In interpreting the word “adverse,” it must be remembered that the Act of 1887 was an enabling statute and that persons competent to testify before its enactment remained such and were unaffected by its provisions: <em>Dickson v. McGrow Bros., </em><a href="/pa/151/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="151 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="836696" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0098-01">151 Pa. 98</a>, 100. Accordingly, if claimant’s witnesses could have qualified before the passage of this act, their testimony should have been admitted at the audit. In this connection, the following description of a disqualifying interest was given in the case of <em>Braine v. Spalding, </em><a href="/pa/52/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="52 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1002267" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0247-01">52 Pa. 247</a>, 248 (1866) : “It is only a fixed vested interest, that disqualifies. The true test of the interest of a witness is that he will either gain or lose, as the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment, or that the record will be legal evidence for or against him in some other action. It must be a present, certain and vested interest; and not an interest uncertain, remote or contingent: Greenleaf’s Ev., vol. i. §390.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The case of . <em>Philadelphia Ins.

And the case of <em>Sorg v. First German Congregation, </em><a href="/pa/63/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="63 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1019153" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0156-01">supra, at p. 162</a>, held that “. . . the trustees of charitable or religious societies, having no personal and private interest in the property holden by the corporation, áre competent witnesses in any action in which the corporation is a party: 1 Greenl. on Ev. §333.” In view of the holdings of these cases, it cannot be said that claimant’s witnesses were “adverse’.’ within the meaning of the Act of 1887.</p>

Then (p. 323), we say: ‘The words “disinterested witnesses,” used in this act, must be read and understood in connection with the subject-matter of the statute, the evils to be avoided, the requirements intended to safeguard the rights and property of persons approaching death, and the remedy to be provided in such cases’ ”: <em>Channon’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/266/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="266 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1056077" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0417-01">266 Pa. 417</a>, 422.
