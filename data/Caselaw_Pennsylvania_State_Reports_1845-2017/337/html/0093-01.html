McGraw was authorized by his will to invest in common stocks. The auditing judge concluded that such investments were improperly made and surcharged the trustee with the amount of them, directing that they should be replaced by cash. On exceptions, a majority of the court came to the contrary view and decided that the investments in common stocks were proper under the terms of the will and set aside the surcharge, holding that <em>Wood’s Est., </em><a href="/pa-super/130/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="130 Pa.

Superior Ct. 397</a>, the right of the trustee to invest funds of the trust estate in common stocks was challenged. In the course of the opinion, it is said (p. 401) : “In common parlance, in the financial world and technically, common stock is a <em>security </em>and an investment. . . . The term ‘securities’ has frequently been held to include stock of a corporation,” citing cases from other jurisdictions. Section 227 of the Restatement, Trusts, Clause U, states: “A provision in the terms of the trust authorizing the trustee to invest in ‘securities’ is ordinarily interpreted as broad enough to include not merely secured obligations but also other investments such as shares of stock or debentures.”</p>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[305,1138,1152,1187]]]'>There is nothing in the will to indicate that testator used the word “securities” in other than its generally accepted sense. Words in a will, “must be taken in their ordinary signification in the absence of some reason appearing in the will for considering them in any extraordinary sense:” <em>Wanamaker’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/312/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="312 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1150663" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0362-01">312 Pa. 362</a>, 368, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.%20592" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="167 A. 592">167 A. 592</a>. See to the same effect: <em>Hogg’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/329/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="329 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1181494" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0163-01">329 Pa. 163</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.%20503" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="196 A. 503">196 A. 503</a>; <em>Hirsh’s Trust Est., </em><a href="/pa/334/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="334 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1190741" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0172-01">334 Pa. 172</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20160" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="5 A.2d 160">5 A. 2d 160</a>. Generally speaking we conclude that under the term “securities” fiduciaries are authorized to invest in common stocks, subject, of course, to the rules covering the propriety of all investments by trustees. We do not regard the circumstance that the testator at the time of his death possessed no common stocks of importance in the interpretation of the clause of his will we are considering, but think the fact that he authorized his trustee to take part in reorganizations of companies whose securities may be held, and to exchange them for other securities issued in such reorganizations, in which in many instances common stocks must be issued and received, shows that he did not intend to ban such holdings.</p>
