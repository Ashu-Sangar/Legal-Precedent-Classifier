She died December 10, 1937. The trustee then filed its account. From the audit statement it appeared that appellant had assigned his interest in the corpus — a sum in the neighborhood of $25,000 — and that the assignees were entitled under the assignment. No exceptions were filed to the account but before the amount for distribution had become payable to appellant’s assignees, the appellants on March 22, 1938, filed a petition for a citation, directed, inter alia, to appellees, to show cause why the audit “should not be reopened and your petitioner admitted to a defense against the claim of the . . . assignees, so that the proper amount to which said Trustees are entitled may be determined.” A responsive answer was filed. The case came on for hearing November 30, 1938, when evidence of witnesses was received. In addition to that evidence the parties filed a stipulation of facts. The learned court below, after hearing, dismissed the petition and confirmed the decree of distribution. This appeal is from that decree.</p>

Appellees contend (1) that the $2,000 payment to Rhoads was a valid brokerage fee and in the absence of prior agreement to pay part of it to the bank, the voluntary payment by Rhoads was irrelevant in this proceeding; (2) that, if regarded as a payment to the bank, it was a valid underwriter’s commission; (3) that, even if the two items were usurious, they were “paid” and not “reserved” by the bank under the federal act, and hence can be recovered only in a separate suit; (4) that in any event the bonds were negotiable; (5) and that therefore the defense of usury is not available against Lessig, a holder in due course.</p>

S. section 5197, 12 USCA section 85, provides: “Any association may take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan or discount made, or upon any notes, bills of exchange, or other evidences of debt, interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the State . . . where the bank is located, . . . and no more. ...” The legal rate in Pennsylvania is 6%.

    <p id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[137,602,1151,1193]]]'>We may note, in passing, that on this question of usury the appellant has changed his ground, or has increased his claim over what he claimed in the petition for the citation. In the sixth paragraph, he had asserted that the trustees were “not entitled to any amount in distribution of this estate greater than the amount actually paid to your petitioner, together with such amount as may properly and reasonably have been paid for the purchase of an annuity which would provide for regular payments of interest upon his bonds, and less interest, from the time they withheld the same, on the amounts they unlawfully withheld from your petitioner.” His argument now is that the payment for the annuity was a reservation within the first of the two categories quoted from <em>Barnet v. National Bank, </em><a href="/us/98/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="98 U.S. 555" data-case-ids="11302" data-case-paths="/us/98/0555-01">98 U. S. 555</a>, and that the payment of $2,000 to Rhoads was in the same class. Both amounts, it is said, were “reserved” by the bank from the loan to appellant with the result that the bank in fact only loaned the difference between $20,000 and the total of the two sums (slightly less than $12,000) which the appellant paid to the insurance company and to Rhoads.</p>
    <p id="b191-6" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[133,1807,1154,647]],["BL_192.1",192,[289,375,1151,1404]]]'>We shall deal first with the sums expended for the annuity. By the bond, appellant agreed to pay principal and interest as stated in it. The bond referred to the deed of trust providing security and for its enforcement ; it particularly provided that the interest payable was also secured by an annuity policy. The agreement of facts states that provision for the annuity was made in the Chatham Discount Company’s letter of August 17th, nearly a month before the bank was applied to, and that on August 20th, appellant agreed to provide the annuity. The cost of the annuity, $9,913.68, was paid by the appellant to the insurance company with part of <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>the money he had borrowed from the bank; but that was not a reservation by the bank. The situation is not, as appears to have been suggested in the argument, like the discount by a bank, of a note at the legal rate plus a commission, in which case the bank on its books credits the borrower with the amount of the note less the interest and the commission, thus paying him only the difference, thereby, in fact, reserving part of the principal of the note; in such case, as Gibson, C. J., said, in the case referred to in the brief, <em>Oyster v. </em>Longnecker, <a href="/pa/16/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="16 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="410222" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0269-01">16 Pa. 269</a>, 274, “A return of part of the sum on which interest is reserved, reduces the contract essentially to a loan of the residue.” Here the bank retained no part of the cost of the annuity. Appellant, as he had agreed to do, paid the insurance company to secure the payment of the interest; in other words, he went into the market and purchased an interest-payer. We agree with what had apparently been appellant’s view when he drafted the petition for the citation, that the amount paid by him to the insurance company cannot be regarded as a reservation within the Act of Congress. This element of the transaction is therefore not within the first category stated by the Supreme Court; we need not now decide whether it is within the second, because the question is not before us, for, as the cases cited hold, the Act of Congress provides the sole remedy.</p>

National Bank, </em><a href="/us/98/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="98 U.S. 555" data-case-ids="11302" data-case-paths="/us/98/0555-01">98 U. S. 555</a>. The point is not free from difficulty because the evidence is meager. Rhoads was dead at the time of the trial. One of the conditions under which the bank made the loan was that Rhoads should receive $2,000 for the purpose specified. The bank’s vice presi<a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>dent testified: “Q. You have said that you think Mr. Queal engaged Mr. Rhoads.

Mr. Lessig also stated that he had bought bonds from the bank for “a good many years”; at the time of the purchase he had no interest in the bank but was “a competitor.” He was asked in cross-examination, “Q. When did you first have a talk with Mr. Storb about these bonds? A. The chances are about a day prior; that is the way we generally bought aud sold bonds; if he would tell me he had something good one day, why, the chances are I would go into the bank the following day, if I cared to buy the bonds, and buy them. Q. Did you know at that time that he was getting the bonds that day? A. He offered the bonds to me — sold them to me; I took it for granted he had the bonds, which apparently he did have, because I never buy a bond and give a check for them unless that bond is delivered to me, at the time I give my check.”</p>

Section 52, 56 PS section 132, provides that to be negotiable it must appear that the instrument “is complete and regular upon its face”. Appellant makes two’ points in support of his contention of non-negotiability. The first is made by reconstructing the context of the 4th paragraph, quoted above, providing maturity September 1, 1956, “except as otherwise provided herein and in the deed of trust securing this issue of bonds. It shall mature and become due prior to September 1st, 1956, on the next interest payment date succeeding a period of thirty (30) days after the death of Caroline Gerber, the mother of the obligor.” We think, the intention was to provide that the bonds should be matured by the death of appellant’s mother prior to September 1, 1956, and that the intention is expressed in the language quoted. Appellant would reach a different conclusion by suggesting that it pro<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>vides three maturity dates, the first, September 1, 1956; the second, determined by the death of appellant’s mother and third, by lifting from its context the words “and in the deed of trust securing this issue of bonds”, an undeterminable date. We must reject that interpretation; we think the words providing for maturity by the death of appellant’s mother were intended to be explanatory of the words “and in the deed of trust securing this issue of bonds” and that they were not intended to suggest a third maturity date. The ambiguity, such as there is, must be determined, as was said in one of the cases referred to above, by a “construction most favorable to the bondholder.”</p>

We think that, properly understood, the provision related to the identification of the security and was intended to enable the prospective purchaser to ascertain by examining the bond whether the trustee had certified that it was one of the bonds entitled to the security.

It would never occur to him that, when November 1, 1941, arrived, because of something contained in the mortgage he might be unable to collect the amount due him. He would interpret the statement that the bonds were secured by, and entitled to the benefits and subject to the provisions of, the mortgage, as meaning that a foreclosure or other relief might be had thereunder only subject to its provisions. He would see that reference to it is also made to determine the terms and conditions under which the bonds are issued and secured. Again, it would mean to him, as it means to us, that only by turning to the mortgage might he discover the precise nature of the lien he is to obtain. He would see that the bonds were to be issued, not only upon the general credit of the corporation, but upon the faith of some collateral mortgage.

The same conclusion was reached in <em>Paepcke v.

It is this feature of the bonds in the case at bar, as well as in those just referred to, which distinguishes this case from those relied on by appellant in his argument. The case most stressed is <em>King Cattle Co. v. Joseph, </em><a href="/minn/158/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="158 Minn. 481" data-case-ids="156511" data-case-paths="/minn/158/0481-01">158 Minn. 481</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20N.W.%20798" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="198 N.W. 798">198 N.

In that case the bond contained a clause stating that all the bonds “are to be issued, under and in pursuance of, and are all equally secured by, and are subject to an indenture of mortgage or deed of trust, dated September fifteenth, 1920, duly executed by the company to said Yellowstone Bank and Trust Company, of Sidney, Montana, as trustee, under which indenture all of the property of the company, real, personal and mixed, now owned or hereafter acquired, has been transferred and mortgaged to said trustee and hereby reference is made to said indenture and the same made a part hereof, with the same effect as if herein fully set forth.” It will be noticed that the deed of trust was made a part of the bond, a fact not present in the bonds before us, or in the other cases referred to above. The court distinguished the cases generally arising under section 3 of the Negotiable Instruments Acts, 56 PS section 3, providing that “A statement of the transaction which gives rise to the instrument” does not qualify an otherwise unqualified promise, by saying: “We see no escape from the conclusion that the language of these bonds goes far beyond a mere reference to the underlying security. The parties evidently intended to incorporate and include the provisions of the trust deed in the bonds. They wrote into them a notice to an intending purchaser that, in determining the nature of the obligation of the maker, he could not stop with a reading of the bonds, but must also read the trust deed, for the conditions of the trust deed were impressed upon them. In one sense the bonds were incomplete, not because they were <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>unfilled blanks or omissions to be supplied, for there were none, but because on their face the bonds carried notice that the entire contract of the parties was not expressed. It was necessary to look to a separate instrument to be certain as to when and how the maker of the bonds could be compelled to pay them.” Another case relied on hy appellant is <em>Fayetteville B. &amp; L. v. Crouch, </em><a href="/w-va/115/0651-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="115 W. Va. 651" data-case-ids="8638315" data-case-paths="/w-va/115/0651-01">115 W.

In this ease, again, it was necessary to examine other instruments to ascertain the extent of the primary obligation. The third case, <em>People v. Gould, </em><a href="/ill/347/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="347 Ill. 298" data-case-ids="5270585" data-case-paths="/ill/347/0298-01">347 Ill. 298</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20N.E.%20848" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="179 N.E. 848">179 N. E. 848</a> (1932), arose on the sufficiency of an indictment. We see no support for appellant’s argument in that case. The law of Illinois on the point with which we must deal appears very clearly in the subsequently decided case, already quoted from, <em>Sturgis National Bank v. Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em><a href="/ill/351/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="351 Ill. 465" data-case-ids="5298872" data-case-paths="/ill/351/0465-01">351 Ill. 465</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20N.E.%20589" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="184 N.E. 589">184 N.

I met Mr. Rhoads, and there were several others present. They put before me a paper addressed to Mr. Rhoads, covering the two thousand dollars for brokerage fees. I was told to sign this paper, which I did and <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>returned it to them. They then put before me a check for $20,000.00, payable to my order, from the National Iron Bank of Pottstown. I was told to endorse those, which I did and passed it back to them. They handed this cheek to Mr. Storb. Next they put before me six checks covering the expenses of defraying the loan. I was told to sign those checks, which I did, and returned them to them. I was then given a check for the balance, which was my share, and I was ready to go home. They asked me if I would accompany one of' their representatives to the insurance office to secure a policy. It being near closing time we hurriedly took a taxi and went to the insurance office where the representative gave them my check for $9,913.00, and I signed a receipt. The policy was turned over to the representative, and I started home with my check.”</p>
