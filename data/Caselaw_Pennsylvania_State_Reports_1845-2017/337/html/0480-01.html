With the exception of the <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>sum of $200 paid on account, the mortgagor has made no further'payment of interest since that time, and no part of the principal debt has been paid.</p>

The Reading Bank thereafter became insolvent, and on October 27, 1934, a receiver was appointed whose successor is the present defendant.</p>
    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[286,958,1151,858]]]'>The plaintiffs, who hold some of the mortgage bonds as trustees under the will of. Conrad Klein,, filed this bill in equity, asking for the appointment of a • substituted trustee to succeed the Reading Bank as trustee under the mortgage. Defendant’s answer made no objection to the appointment of the substituted trustee. However, under the heading of new matter defendant included a “First and Final Account” of the administration of the trust by the Reading Bank, in which a credit was taken for the $5,880 advanced to the bondholders. For this amount the defendant claimed to be entitled to reimbursement by the substituted trustee, “from the first available funds in its hands,” and asked that the overdraft be decreed a lien upon the mortgaged premises, which are now under the management of trustees for a majority of the bondholders. ¡</p>

As we said in <em>Media-69th Street Tr. Co.'s Tr. Mtge.

If the particular interest advanced cannot be collected, the transaction remains open, and any loss arising therefrom must be borne by the trustee who volunteered the payment.” See also: <em>Klein’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/326/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="326 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="1174490" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0393-01">326 Pa. 393</a>; <em>Nauman’s Est., </em><a href="/pa-super/110/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="110 Pa.

    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[121,1683,1155,415]]]'>In the case of the Media-69th Street Trust Company, the trustee had already collected approximately $7,300, which admittedly represented “the particular interest advanced,” and as to that amount .we indicated that there was a right of recoupment. Nevertheless, we held that the claim was prematurely made, inasmuch as the final account of the substituted trustee had not yet been filed.</p>
    <p id="b557-6" data-blocks='[["BL_557.7",557,[121,2120,1153,312]],["BL_558.1",558,[290,368,1149,578]]]'>It does not follow from the fact that advancements for- delinquent interest have been made to bondholders under the circumstances here present that such advances must be reimbursed, from the first moneys paid upon the mortgage, or that the payments so received shall be treated arbitrarily as repayment of the “particular in<a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>terest advanced.” It must be remembered that these advancements were made without any indication to the bondholders that the mortgagor had defaulted, and that they were kept in ignorance of the impairment of their investment for a period of two years thereafter. Had they known the true situation, they could have immediately instituted foreclosure proceedings, or taken other appropriate action to protect their rights. Instead they were lulled into a false sense of security by acts of the trustee Bank amounting to a representation that there had been no default.</p>
    <p id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[292,966,1150,803]]]'>In view of these circumstances, it would be inequitable to permit the trustee Bank to assert that the interest payments for which the advances were made were not in fact paid by the mortgagor, if the assertion would work prejudice to the bondholders: <em>Paine v. Bank, </em><a href="/pa/194/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="194 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="912423" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0403-01">194 Pa. 403</a>. See also <em>Fedas v. Ins.

The present defendant as receiver would be similarly estopped since he stands in the shoes of the insolvent trustee Bank: See <em>Cameron v.

Nor are plaintiffs required to show specifically the extent to which they have been injured by reliance upon the trustee Bank’s representation, for it is sufficient that they were deprived of an opportunity to assert their rights promptly against the mortgagor. See <em>Paine v. Bank, </em><a href="/pa/194/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="194 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="912423" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0403-01">supra,</a> (p. 407).</p>
    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[294,1779,1152,643]]]'>We must, therefore, in determining the status of defendant’s claim, treat the payments so advanced by the Beading Bank as having been paid by the mortgage debtor. Prom this it follows that all future payments of interest to the substituted trustee must be deemed to be for amounts accruing upon the mortgage subsequent to the advancements, rather than for “the particular interest advanced” by the trustee Bank, except where there shall be an overplus remaining after the claims of the bondholders have been discharged in full. Defendant’s right , of recoupment must be limited strictly to such overplus.</p>

A. 6th), the facts closely resemble those of the present case, and the court reached the same result, saying (p. 248): “Equity requires that the bank and its receiver be subordinated to the certificate holders as to the specific security of underlying mortgages on which interest was paid in advance of collection. This salutary rule will remove the strong temptation to trustees to act for their own advantage to the detriment of the cestuis que trustent.”</p>
    <p id="b559-3" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[126,913,1152,743]]]'>In volunteering these advancements without disclosure of the default, the Reading Bank violated its duty as a fiduciary to inform the céstuis fully of all matters affecting their interest, and accordingly it must be held to have assumed the risk that the particular installments of interest advanced might never be repaid. In <em>Commonwealth Trust Co. </em>Case, <a href="/pa/331/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="331 Pa. 569" data-case-ids="1184355" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0569-01">331 Pa. 569</a>, where advancements by the trustee had been rendered necessary through improper use of certain trust funds, we said (jp. 580): “Under the circumstances, the Trustee cannot claim a priority in order to recoup itself for loans made necessary by its own misconduct. This claim can be asserted only after the bondholders have been paid in full.”</p>
    <p id="b559-4" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[125,1678,1152,638]]]'>Defendant’s contention that the voluntary payments were beyond the statutory powers of a national bank to make, in that they amounted to a gift of the fund, and that therefore they are recoverable by the receiver, cannot be sustained. As we have said, the making of the advancements gave rise to a limited right of reimbursement from subsequent receipts, and it is clear that recoupment was contemplated when the payments were made. Moreover, it is conceivable that the Reading Bank may have expected to benefit by protecting its reputation with regard to the securities which it had sold and sponsored.</p>
