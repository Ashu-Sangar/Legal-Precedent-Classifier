Moore died, leaving her two children, Harriet Dinsmore Moore (now Linder) and William Card Moore, to survive her; Testator’s son Henry Stone Card died in 1913 without issue but survived by his widow, Grace (who by remarriage has become Grace Card Porter). Testator’s daughter Ruth Card Briggs died in 1926, leaving three daughters, Dorothy Briggs Klappert, Nancy Briggs Beiser, and Barbara Briggs, a minor, of whose estate <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>John B.

    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[282,743,1150,1407]]]'>The death of the son William Dinsmore Card raises the issue involved in the present appeals. Since his death the trustee has regularly paid one-half of the income which William Dinsmore Card had received during his lifetime to the two children of Nellie C. Moore, and the other half to the three children of Ruth Card Briggs, and when it -filed the present, its first, account, the trustee requested that distribution of income oh hand should be made in the same way. The orphans’ court, however, adjudged that such payments were improper and that all the income formerly payable to William Dinsmore Card was payable, after his death, to the two Moore children. The court therefore decreed that the trustee should reserve the amount of such improper payments from the future income of the Briggs children payable from the part of the corpus of the estate accruing to them after the death of their mother. The court further decreed that an advancement made by the trustee to Dorothy Briggs Klappert of $8,000 from the corpus of the estate should be returned, holding that none of the Briggs children was entitled to any present distribution of principal. The court also directed that the entire corpus of the trust estate should be retained by the trustee in order to insure the continuance of sufficient funds to pay the annuities of Grace Card Porter and Sadie Tracy Card.</p>
    <p id="b148-6" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[284,2163,1149,263]],["BL_149.1",149,[100,362,1153,651]]]'>Appellants challenge the correctness of each and every part of this decree. They contend that one-half of the portion of the corpus “otherwise intended for the issue” of William Dinsmore Card became vested in them upon his death without issue, and, therefore, <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>that the income previously paid to him belonged, after his death, one-half to them and one-half to the Moore children; that the annuity of Sadie Tracy Card should be charged, not against the general income of the estate, but only against the income previously paid to her husband; that the trustee should retain in its hands sufficient of the corpus of the estate to assure the payment of the annuity to Grace Card Porter, but that, subject to such retention, the one-third of the corpus which vested in them upon the death of their mother, Ruth Card Briggs, (and from which they are how receiving the income) should be distributed to them.</p>
    <p id="b149-5" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[103,1024,1154,1356]]]'>The problem of construction of the will arises from the poor phrasing of its fifth paragraph. Appellees, the two Moore children, take the position that,- according to its literal wording, the death, without issue, of any of the six beneficiaries named therein was to result in an increase of income of those of the remaining five who should survive such decedent, and, since appellees are the only two such survivors of William Dinsmore Card, all income previously payable to him should now be paid to them during their lives, while the Briggs children, not being expressly named in the paragraph, are not entitled to any increase of income as the result of their uncle William’s death. In our opinion this point of view represents a misconception of what testator quite evidently intended. If such a literal interpretation were to be adopted it might mean that if Henry had survived the death of his brother William he would have been entitled, in addition to his fixed annuity, to a share of the income previously payable to William; or, if Nellie C. Moore had so survived, her two children would have shared in such income with her. Such possible results were obviously not within the intent of testator. The paragraph must be examined from a broader point of view and its controlling purpose ascertained.</p>

      <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>For reasons best known to himself,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> testator made a special provision for his son Henry, cutting him off with a comparatively small annuity,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> but to each of his other three children, Nellie, William and Ruth, he gave an equal one-third of the net income of the estate (subject to a provision for his widow and to the annuities for Henry and Henry’s wife); he also provided that upon the death of each of these three children one-third of the corpus of the estate should vest absolutely in such child’s children or lawful issue, per stirpes, the only modification being that, in the case of his daughter Nellie, he provided that after her death the income previously paid to her should be paid to her children, Harriet Dinsmore Moore and William Card Moore for their lives, and upon their death one-third of the corpus of the estate was to vest absolutely in all the children of Nellie<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and their lawful issue, per stirpes. The reason for this special arrangement apparently was that Nellie’s two children were the only grandchildren of testator who had then been born and he desired to protect them by trusteeing their share of the estate just as he had done in the case of his own children; to have made similar provision for a vesting of corpus after the death of then unborn grandchildren might have involved the rule against perpetuities. Be this as it may, the will indicates that it was the general intent of testator that, although the two Moore children were to receive their inheritance by way of income whereas other grandchildren would receive the corpus outright, each stirpital <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>line was to enjoy an equal portion of the estate. Nor is there anything in the phraseology of the fifth paragraph inconsistent with this fundamental purpose. On the contrary it is there expressly stated that, upon the death, without issue, of any of the named beneficiaries, the portion of the corpus otherwise intended for the issue of such decedent should -continue to be held upon the <em>same trust </em>as thereinbefore mentioned, which is equivalent to saying that the portion of the corpus theretofore allocated to the issue of such decedent should be distributed between the two other branches of the family in the manner provided in the fourth paragraph of the will for the trust estate generally. Passing to each of such other branches, an accretion thus resulting would take the different forms provided in the case of the original trust; thus the portion due to the Moore branch would pass by way of life estates to the two named Moore children and by way of corpus to their issue, whereas, in the case of the Briggs branch, the children of Ruth Card Briggs would succeed immediately to the corpus upon the death of their mother just as they did in the case of the one-third of the corpus of the estate originally given to them. It is to be noted that the fifth paragraph of the will does not dispose specially of the income previously paid to a decedent child but of the complete share of such child, the surviving income-beneficiaries having their incomes proportionately increased and the surviving corpus-beneficiaries having their shares of the corpus proportionately increased. Among the latter are the Briggs children, they being “issue who may be living at the time of. the death of any one of said beneficiaries,” and, therefore, at the same time that appellees became entitled to a proportionate increase of income from the Moore share of William Dinsmore Card’s part of the estate appellants became entitled to a proportionate increase of corpus as the Briggs share thereof. This interpretation <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>is one that not only makes for stirpital equality but is in harmony with the general framework of the will.</p>
    <p id="b152-5" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[312,471,1148,588]]]'>It follows from what has been said that, just as when Ruth Card Briggs died there was immediately vested in appellants, her children, one-third of the corpus of the estate, so when William Dinsmore Card died there was immediately vested in them one-half of the share in the corpus of the estate that would have vested in his issue had there been any. Appellants’ interest was thus increased to one-half of the entire corpus, and accordingly they were entitled thenceforth to receive the income from that proportionate part of the estate, subject, of course, to the prior charges thereon provided for in the will.</p>

They admit that, before any distribution can properly be made, enough of the corpus must be retained in the hands of the trustee to insure payment of the annuity to Grace Card Porter, Henry’s widow, since this annuity is given by the will a status of priority over the interests of Nellie C. Moore, William Dinsmore Card and Ruth Card Briggs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> It is well established that the court may reserve a sufficient amount of principal to meet the requirements of annuity payments without withholding all the rest of a large estate from distribution: <em>Harbin v.

Hardy, </em><a href="/mass/120/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="120 Mass. 524" data-case-ids="738941" data-case-paths="/mass/120/0524-01">120 Mass. 524</a>, 541, 542; <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v.

In the case of the annuity for Sadie Tracy Card the will does not provide for any priority, and it would seem fair to conclude that this annuity was to come from the share of <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>the estate from which the income had been payable to her husband, William Dinsmore Card; any other.interpretation would give this daughter-in-law a status ahead of that of testator’s own children, and indeed, if the income from the entire, estate dropped to less than $15,000 per annum, a status superior to that which her husband himself would have enjoyed had his life continued; it is not conceivable that testator could have so intended. Accordingly, the share of the corpus of the estate which was intended for the issue of William Dinsmore Card, had there been any, or such portion of it as is fairly necessary for the purpose, must be retained in the hands of the trustee for the assurance of the payment of the annuity to Sadie Tracy Card in addition to the obligation of such portion, in common with the rest of the estate, to support the annuity in favor of Grace Card Porter.</p>
    <p id="b153-5" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[109,1288,1153,802]],["BL_154.1",154,[308,360,1154,1781]]]'>Subject, as thus stated, to the reservation of corpus to the extent necessary to protect the two annuitants, are appellants entitled to a present distribution of the share of the corpus vested in them, or must the entire principal of the trust estate remain intact in the hands of the trustee because of the fact that appellees are entitled, during their lives, to one-third of the net income of the estate? Appellees argue that in a well-known line of cases<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> it has been held that “where there is a gift of a fractional share of income from an entire estate for a definite period of time, the whole principal must be presented intact for the payment of that share of income so long as the limitation is to last, since it cannot be said that a share of income from the entire estate is not more valuable than the income from a <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>proportional share of the principal” <em>(Lockhart’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/306/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="306 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1136884" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0394-01">306 Pa. 394</a>, 405). An examination of those cases, however, reveals that in each of them the time for distribution of corpus fixed by the will or other instrument in question had not arrived, and that if an immediate distribution of principal had been ordered by the court it would have been contrary to the expressed intention of the testator, which, of course, is always the controlling guide. In the present case there is no express provision in regard to distribution of corpus, nor does there appear to have been any desire on the part of testator that the trust should continue until the death of all the income-beneficiaries. On the contrary, he provides that, as each of the life tenants dies, a corresponding share of the corpus of the trust should thereupon “vest <em>absolutely" </em>in the children or lawful issue of such decedent —a phrase which was apparently intended to denote a vesting in possession as well as in interest. Moreover, the general plan of the will indicates that the issue in each branch of the family were to be entitled to receive their proportionate share of the corpus of the trust estate at the conclusion of the life interest or interests provided for that particular branch. It would seem, therefore, to be wholly consistent with the terms of the will, and carrying out testator’s implied intention, to permit the present distribution to appellants of the portion of the corpus of the trust estate to which they are entitled, the trustee, however, to retain thereout what, in the opinion of the court below, is reasonably necessary (together with a similar proportional retention from the part of the corpus allocated to the Moore branch of the family) to insure payment of the annuities as hereinbefore discussed.</p>
