Cunningham was sheriff of Philadelphia County from the first Monday of January, 1928; to the date of his death August 13, 1931. His executors appeal from a decree<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> requiring them to account for money<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> “representing costs paid by persons dealing” with him “while . . . sheriff . . . and ... in his hands at the time of his death . . .'and which are subject to the Act of April 8,1937, P. L. 284”, and money “of like character” coming into their hands subsequently. The total is composed of small balances of money deposited as indemnity by execution plaintiffs in. circumstances described by the learned chancellor, as follows: “A sheriff is not required to render services in civil, proceedings until he receives indemnity for, or prepayment of, his fees, costs and expenses, and, asi the exact amount of his expenses cannot be determined in advance, it has always been the custom of sheriffs, in lieu of demanding indemnity from litigants, to require them to deposit a sum slightly in excess of the <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>estimated total costs and expenses of the service to he performed, and to refund any balance remaining after it is rendered and the actual expenses are known. These balances are small in amount, averaging less than $10.00 in each case. . . . The custom which produces this result is of such antiquity and has been so universally followed by sheriffs that its validity is not open to question, and there is nothing about the transaction to justify the allegations of the Bill that Sheriff Cunningham acted fraudulently in following the custom; especially since the Act of July 11, 1901, P. L. 663, as amended by the Act of May 23, 1923, P. L. 347,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> recognizes the practice, and expressly provides that ‘any money advanced for his [the sheriff’s] charges, and not earned or expended by him, shall be refunded to the payer thereof.’ ”</p>

As between the executors, who hold it, and parties respectively entitled, the executors may discharge their testator’s obligations by paying the parties entitled. Assumpsit, in which an accounting can be obtained if necessary, now affords an adequate remedy for one entitled to a refund, for, in the course of the proceeding, the court may order production of the sheriff’s accounts of the transactions. But even if such a plaintiff receive judgment in his suit he will still be required to present it in the orphans’ Court which now has jurisdiction of the administration of Cunningham’s estate ; that court also has ample power to order the sheriff’s records brought in and to adjudicate claims presented there and to order payment.</p>

It is said that the Act of 1937 provides a step in escheat; that (in the words of the brief) “Such moneys are to be turned over to the County Treasurer for safekeeping in a separate fund, and if they remain unclaimed for 7 years, they are to be escheated to the Commonwealth for the use of the County.” The commonwealth’s power to escheat is not challenged. Procedure for the safekeeping of escheatable funds is available in the orphans’ court: see Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, section 1314, 72 PS section 1314; <em>Link’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/319/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="319 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="1162316" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0513-01">319 Pa. 513</a>, 515, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.%201" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="180 A. 1">180 A. 1</a>;. and no reason has been suggested in this case why the commonwealth (or perhaps the court on its own motion, section 1314) should not proceed under that Act. If the lapse of time can be pleaded by the executors against the demand of one entitled to refund, that fact will not <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>prevent the declaration of an escheat: <em>Holmes v.

Article I, section 10, of the constitution of Pennsylvania, provides: “. . . nor shall private property be taken or applied to public use, without authority of law and without just compensation being first made or secured.” Article I, section 17, prohibits impairment of contracts. Article III, section 7, prohibits the enactment of a special law “providing or changing methods for the collection of debts”.</p>

An examination of the Act in its operation on the appellants will show that they are not within the rule invoked by appellee. Before the Act was passed the sheriff could be required to refund at the suit of a depositor. If the Act is invalid, the sheriff, of course, remains subject to suit as before. We then inquire whether the act has effectively changed this. Section 1 requires the sheriff to pay the remaining deposits to the county treasurer and adds that “The receipt issued by the county treasurer . . . shall fully discharge the county officer or person making such payment and his surety from all liability whatever for the payment of such moneys to the person or persons legally entitled thereto.” It is on this provision that appellee depends for the proposition that appellants cannot question the validity of the statute, It is said that the sheriff is released by <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>Ms payment to the treasurer. If, however, the Act is invalid and the sheriff is not released but remains liable to pay to the depositor it will be no answer to the depositor’s demand that the sheriff has paid his depositor’s money to one not legally authorized to receive it. He would therefore be required to pay the depositor. If he has complied with the Act he will also have paid the county treasurer. The sheriff would be required to pay twice. The addition, by the statute, of a liability to make a payment to the county treasurer which will not discharge the liability to the depositor is a plain violation of the constitutional provision against taking property without due process. The appellants are thus directly affected.</p>

Section 2 provides that if one, entitled to a refund, “claim the same, the moneys shall be repaid from the county treasury on warrant of the county controller after proof of claim to the satisfaction of the county controller.” No right of appeal is granted; compare section 504 of the Act of 1929, P. L. 343, 72 PS section 504. Does that provision of the Act of 1937 furnish an adequate substitute for the right of action theretofore existing? The substitute provided deprives a claimant of a judicial trial, and, instead, requires him to satisfy the controller. By what rules shall the controller be satisfied? Suppose he denies a claim and says that he is not satisfied with the proof, what then? Or, if in allowing prior claims, the controller has been mistaken and has exhausted the deposited funds, leaving nothing to pay a valid claim; from what shall the refund be made, the county not being required to supply money for that purpose? The right of the depositor to sue for the refund in some form of action is a property right. Compare <em>Com, ex rel. v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa/327/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="327 Pa. 136" data-case-ids="1176703" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0136-01">327 Pa. 136</a>, 142, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.%20258" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="193 A. 258">193 </a><a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a><a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.%20258" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="193 A. 258">A. 258</a>. That right is taken away by the Act. While due process would be satisfied if an adequate substitute for the,destroyed right were provided, the Act provides none. It contains no provision for appeal to a court from the controller’s denial of the claim. If such a claim were presented to him for allowance, it would be his duty to act judicially; his function would not be ministerial; mandamus would not lie to control his judgment given or to be given in a judicial capacity: <em>Dechert, Controller, v.

The contract, it is to be noted, was made by the board of education for a matter clearly within their department. They issued a warrant for payment which was returned to them unsigned by the controller and thereupon destroyed, supposing it to be functus officio. On the reopening of the subject by this litigation the board promptly issued a new warrant, made return of the facts, and submitted the case without objection to the claim. Had the board of education at any time indicated that there was any defense to this claim, it is clear that there could be no remedy by mandamus, but only by suit prosecuted to judgment in the ordinary course of law. But they have not done so. The only contest comes from the controller, and his grounds of objection, set out at length in his answer, show that none of them was founded on matters within his discretion. Had any of them been valid the court would not review his decision in regard to the facts, but when admitting all the facts none of the reasons <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>is sufficient, the courts and not the official must determine the rights of the parties.

Due process was satisfied by the substitution of a right of action against the state for the withdrawn right to sue the bank. As the Act of 1937 takes away the payer’s right to sue the sheriff and substitutes only a demand on the controller, without judicial review, the statute denies to the depositor the due process guaranteed by the constitution; the Act is therefore not available against appellants because payment by them to the county controller would not be a good payment.</p>

As the obligation was composed of elements both of fiduciary nature and of the debtor-creditor relation it was enforcible by action of assumpsit; for present purposes it is immaterial to consider the extent that, if at all, equity might take jurisdiction to decree a refund, especially in view of the comprehensive procedure provided by the Practice Act of 1915, P.

The Act of 1937 takes away all remedies theretofore applicable to the enforcement of the obligation whether of fiduciary character or in the debtor-creditor relation and substituted a limited trial before the controller without judicial review.

But the learned chancellor, in disposing of preliminary objections to the bill, was of opinion that the Act did not deal with the collection of <em>debts; </em>that, as he said, “Its real object is to conserve apparently abandoned property for the benefit of the Commonwealth and the owner until the escheat occurs”; in that connection, he relied on <em>Com. v. Dollar Savings Bank, </em><a href="/pa/259/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="259 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1038281" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0138-01">259 Pa. 138</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20A.%20569" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="102 A. 569">102 A. 569</a>, considered earlier in this opinion. Examining the Act in the light suggested, it is to be noted that section 1 provides that the money to be paid to the county treasurer is “moneys . . . which do not belong to such county officer ... if no claim . . . shall be <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>made by the party legally entitled thereto within a period of one year after the same shall have been paid to the county officer, or before the expiration of the term of office of such county officer, regardless of the time the same shall have come into his possession ...” It applies, therefore, to money deposited — say, within the last month of the sheriff’s term. Can there be any valid reason to abolish a recognized right of action against a limited class of debtors for money due for such a short period on the ground that it is proposed “to conserve apparently abandoned property for the benefit of the commonwealth and the owner until the escheat occurs” and allow other creditors the usual remedies? We cannot agree that indemnity so recently deposited can be regarded as “apparently abandoned”, with the result that the owner must satisfy the county controller of the validity of his claim. The learned chancellor said, “In this respect it is identical in purpose with the Act of April 17, 1072, P. L. 62, which deals with unclaimed savings bank deposits in a manner closely analogous to that of the present act and which was held to be constitutional in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Dollar Savings Bank, </em><a href="/pa/259/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="259 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1038281" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0138-01">259 Pa. 138</a> ...” The Act of 1872 related to deposits neither increased nor diminished for 30 years. But, instead of limiting a depositor’s right of recovery to satisfying a single non-judicial officer, the Act gave a remedy to the owner by suit against the commonwealth to whom the bank was required to turn over the deposits. The escheat provisions in the Fiscal Code, sec. 504 of the Act of 1929, P. L. 343, 370, 72 PS section 504, also provide for recourse against the state: see <em>Link's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/319/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="319 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="1162316" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0513-01">319 Pa. 513</a>, 516, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.%201" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="180 A. 1">180 A. 1</a>. The Act of 1937 applies to deposits made “before the expiration of the term of office”, that is, all deposits, however recent, without substituting a lawful remedy.

Ordinary prudence would require the controller to insist upon proper identification of the claimant, and he would exercise such elementary precaution in the issuance of any warrant. Appellants, as fiduciaries, could not themselves pay out any of the moneys now in their possession without requiring the same identification of a claimant, and it is required by every banking institution in paying out the funds of a depositor.

In attempting to distinguish the case of <em>Com. v. Dollar Savings Bank, </em>supra, in which we sustained the constitutionality of the Act of April 17, 1872, P. L. 62, requiring savings banks to turn over to the State Treasurer deposits unclaimed after thirty years, the majority point out that there the depositors were not deprived of their property without due process because they were <em>expressly </em>given an action of assumpsit against the Commonwealth for their funds. A moment’s reflection will make it abundantly clear that the grant of express authority to sue the Commonwealth was essential there because the sovereign cannot be sued in its own courts without its consent.</p>

Yet <em>the Act of 1923 </em>itself, <em>which requires the deposit to he made, does not confer that remedy. </em>If, as the majority suggest, moneys could not be recovered in assumpsit from a public officer to whom they were entrusted for safekeeping unless the right were created by statute, these claimants would have no present remedy against the sheriff or his representatives.

An examination of the case of <em>Com. v. Dollar Savings Bank, </em>supra, in the light of the foregoing conclusion, reveals its close analogy to the present case. The statute there invoked, like the Act of 1937, did not provide for escheat, but for the protection of escheatable property for both the state and the owner. In one respect the Act of 1872 went further than the Act of 1937; it transferred <em>title </em>to the property from the owner to the state. Here the county treasurer merely has custody of the funds for <em>safekeeping. </em>And the same reasoning upon which we held that the Act of 1872 was not violative of the constitutional prohibition against the taking of property without due process of law applies therefore with even greater force to the Act here challenged.</p>

At present, the owners have an action of assumpsit against private individuals, which may be barred, according to the majority opinion, by the running of the six-year period of the statute of limitations. If such an action should be prosecuted to judgment, it must be presented as a claim in the orphans’ court having jurisdiction over the deceased sheriff’s estate, within the time allotted by law for such claims. If the funds have been dissipated or misapplied, the owners must look to the executors personally. If by the decree of the orphans’ court distribution of these funds is made to the heirs or legatees of the sheriff, as may occur if the owners do not appear and present their claims, they will thereafter be remediless.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> And the sheriff’s records, upon which the proof of their <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>claims primarily depends, have been removed from the sheriff’s office by the executors and are now retained in their close custody.

It is extremely difficult to see in what manner this offends the constitutional provision. The Act of 1872, already mentioned, requiring savings banks to turn over unclaimed funds to the state treasurer and discharging them from their debts to depositors is, in this respect also, similar to the present Act, yet in <em>Com. v.

The mere fact that assumpsit will lie to compel the sheriff to refund these moneys does not necessarily stamp the relationship as one of “debtor-creditor.” Assumpsit is an action embracing many forms of obligation which are not, in the strict sense, debts. In its essential characteristics the relation between the sheriff and the depositor of these funds is one of the most elementary forms of a trust. The money is entrusted to the sheriff, as a public officer, for a specific purpose. The depositor retains a special interest in the funds; he does not part with all rights therein in exchange for the personal obligation of the sheriff. As we said in <em>Vosburgh’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/279/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="279 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="1083388" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0329-01">279 Pa. 329</a>, 332; “. . . every person who receives money to be paid to another or to be applied to a particular purpose is a trustee, if so applied as well as when not so applied.” Again, in <em>Trestrail v. Johnson, </em>supra, we pointed out that although one who has received funds in an official capacity may be personally liable for their loss even without negligence because of his duty to keep them safely, he <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>is nevertheless a fiduciary. We said, (p. 396) : “. . . the relation established was not that of a mere debtor, but an express trust relation,” adding that, if the sheriff mingled the funds with his private property, they could be traced as trust funds. Finally, we held that when a sheriff dies in office his successor, and not his personal representatives, is entitled to the moneys received by him in his official capacity.
