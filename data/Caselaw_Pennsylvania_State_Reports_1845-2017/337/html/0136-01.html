At City Hall station he alighted and walked south along the platform, with the standing train to his right. For some unexplained reason he slipped from the platform into the pathway of the train, <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>which meanwhile had started, but he fell at a point so immediately in front of it as not to be within the motorman’s range of vision. The train came to an automatic stop caused by some object — presumably plaintiff — coming in contact with the “tripper,” a mechanical device extending down behind the front wheel on the left side of the car at a distance of six inches outside the line of the wheels and to within two inches of the level of the rails, its function being to cause the emergency brakes to set whenever it struck anything in its path. The distance the train moved after plaintiff fell was about three-fourths of a car length.</p>
    <p id="b212-4" data-blocks='[["BL_212.4",212,[287,1017,1149,527]]]'>A man named Rodgers, who had been riding in the same car as plaintiff and had also alighted at this station, testified at the trial that he saw plaintiff fall, that he thereupon stepped to the side of the train where the conductor was looking out of the rear window of the first car, and that the conductor remarked to him: “Somebody must be trying the emergency brakes,” but Rodgers said: “No, there is a man down under there.” The conductor, in his testimony, denied there was any such conversation.</p>

The motorman testified: “I . . . took my flashlight with me and examined the front of the train and went up along the right side and looked under each motor and under the train and proceeded back down again and crossed over in front and looked at the front again and crawled along the third rail and went up that way and then come back again and I put my hand on the platform and looked and saw no one and got back in my train and proceeded.” The conductor, also, made some investigation of a more cursory nature. Rodgers’ version was that the motorman and conductor “with a searchlight, looked under the front trucks of the train. . . . They looked under the train. And I had walked up the, platform to about where the front of the train <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>was, and was looking down over the side. They immediately, without any more searching, climbed back into the train and proceeded south, toward the Walnut Street Locust station.” The entire train passed over plaintiff’s body. As a result of the accident, plaintiff Was horribly injured, his right foot being cut off at the ankle and his left leg between the knee and hip joint.</p>

Most of the decided cases have been concerned with the question whether the trespasser was <em>seen </em>by the person sought to be charged with negligence. The eye, however, is only one of the sensory organs which bring information to the brain, and is not the sole means by which knowledge, in a legal sense, may be acquired. Notification may also come from an apparently trustworthy person who is himself an eyewitness. Indeed, there is authority to the effect that even where the circumstances are such that the <em>likely </em>presence of a trespasser is foreseeable, the duty of care to avoid injury to him arises: <em>Francis v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/247/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="247 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1009635" data-case-paths="/pa/247/0425-01">247 Pa. 425</a>, 428, 429; <em>Fitzpatrick v.

As applied to the type of cases of which the present is an example, it is <em>not </em>wanton negligence to fail to use care to discover the presence of an unanticipated trespasser, but it <em>is </em>wanton negligence, within the meaning of the law, to fail to use ordinary and reasonable care to avoid injury to a trespasser after his presence has been ascertained: <em>Enright v.

The automatic stop brought to the attention of the train crew the fact that some object had come in contact with the tripper. If Rodgers’ testimony was believed by the jury it meant that a person who could have had no self-interest or improper motive and was therefore presumably credible told the conductor, “There is a man down under there.” The emergency stop and the information given by Rodgers cumulatively constituted, as the jury evidently found, impressive warning as to the situation. What, thereupon, became the duty of defendant’s employees? Obviously, to make every reasonable effort to locate the man and remove him before re-starting the train. (See Restatement, Torts, section 336, comment (b).) The circumstances were somewhat the same as if a huntsman were to see what appeared to be a human being moving about in a clump of bushes, or were informed that there was a trespasser there, and then, without first ascertaining the latter’s exact position, shot indiscriminately into the bushes and wounded him. The motorman knew that the train had proceeded three-quarters of a car length after the emergency brake first went on, from which it could have been readily inferred that the object, whatever it was, which had come in contact with the tripper, was probably to be found in the vicinity of the rear trucks of the front car. Why did the motorman not see plaintiff lying there? Did he make as thorough a search as he testified that he did? According to the testimony produced at the trial only four minutes elapsed from the time the train first started to <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>move until the accident had occurred, the search had been made, and the train finally left the station, and plaintiff contends that the motorman could not in that time have conducted as intensive an investigation as he claims to have made. This was all for the jury. If that tribunal concluded that defendant was sufficiently notified of plaintiff’s presence under the train to fasten upon defendant the duty of thereafter exercising due care for his safety, it was for them also to determine whether the actual search made by the motorman was as exhaustive as it should have been in the light of the obviously terrible injuries to which a person under the train was likely to be subjected. It follows that the court below erred in entering judgment for defendant n. o. v.</p>
    <p id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[303,1178,1150,426]]]'>The question of proximate causation, discussed to some extent by the court below, does not arise under the facts of the present case. Of course, defendant can be held responsible only for such of plaintiff’s injuries as resulted from the <em>second </em>starting of the train. These must be individuated, not necessarily with absolute precision, but with reasonable approximation: <em>McAllister v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/324/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="324 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1171393" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0065-01">324 </a></em><a href="/pa/324/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="324 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1171393" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0065-01">Pa. 65</a>.</p>

Such additional charge of ordinary negligence was unnecessary because included in the more comprehensive allegation of reckless and wanton action. The change in the averment as to the injury to the right foot conformed to the testimony given at the trial; whether this testimony was objected to when offered does not appear in the printed record; had it been so objected to, the statement of claim could then have been amended, subject to a plea of surprise. It <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>was not a fatal obstacle to the granting of the amendment, under such circumstances, that it was sought after the rendition of the verdict: <em>Theisen v.
