The suit is on a mortgage extension agreement made by the legal plaintiff and the defendant, and assigned by the legal to the use-plaintiff; it is part of the statement of claim and recites that the legal plaintiff held a mortgage on premises owned by defendant who had asked for an extension of the due-dates of the bond and mortgage, which the mortgagee was willing to grant and for which the agreement provided. It contains this provision: “4. The party of the second part guarantees the payment of the interest within ten days after the same becomes due and payable, and the principal of said bond so secured, . . . anything in said mortgage contained to the contrary notwithstanding, together with all taxes assessed as aforesaid.”</p>

Defendant admits this default. Nothing is averred in <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>the affidavit of defense that can stop summary judgment.

    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[302,528,1153,1126]]]'>(1) It is .alleged, somewhat inconsistently, that the mortgage was not assigned but that, in any event, the use-plaintiff gave no consideration to the legal plaintiff for the assignment; that the use-plaintiff “was not a bona fide purchaser in good faith of the” mortgage. Such averments state no defense against the demand of the mortgagee, the legal plaintiff. There is no averment of anything in the relations of the legal plaintiff and the use-plaintiff which would discharge defendant’s obligation to the legal plaintiff, which, after all, is what is involved in the suit. Apart from exceptions not now material, it was<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> long the rule that, while the use plaintiff is the equitable owner of the cause of action, his name is unnecessary in the suit and may be disregarded: <em>Brownfield v.

As there is no averment that this agreement was in writing — it should have been made part of the affidavit if it was — we conclude that it was an oral understanding. From averments of this kind, defendant concludes that it “was discharged from <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>its personal liability under said extension agreement to tbe mortgagee by tbe latter’s alleged assignment of said mortgage.” It is difficult to understand bow tbis conclusion, that tbe assignment extinguished defendant’s obligation to tbe legal plaintiff, follows from tbe facts alleged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> But in any event it is sufficient to say that there is no averment that tbis oral understanding was omitted from tbe writing by fraud, accident or mistake without which it could not be proved and therefore cannot be considered a defense: <em>Gianni v.

    <p id="b393-3" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[103,1080,1155,427]]]'>(3) Appellant also contends that there is no liability on tbe extension agreement because there is no averment that tbe mortgagor has been shown to be insolvent or its equivalent. Tbis brings up tbe meaning of tbe words, “Tbe party of tbe second part guarantees tbe payment” etc., as tbe parties used them in tbe contract. It is said defendant cannot be called on to pay until tbe legal plaintiff has established its loss.</p>

L. 971, 8 PS section 1, that “Every written agreement ... to answer for tbe default of another” shall be held to be a contract of suretyship unless it shall expressly declare otherwise. Tbe parties have said what they intended and it is necessary only to deal with their language in tbe <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>light of the circumstances in which it was used. Briefly, the situation of the parties was this: defendant had taken title<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> to the mortgaged property from Rae Weintraub under and subject to the mortgage then held by the Pennsylvania Company, legal plaintiff, which would mature October 13, 1930; an extension of the maturity date was desired. This contract was then made, presumably to change their existing legal relations. In determining what they intended, some help may be had by considering what their relations were just before the agreement was made. In buying from Weintraub under and subject to the mortgage, defendant assumed the obligation of indemnifying Weintraub against any loss resulting to him from defendant’s failure to pay the mortgage debt, — that is, against the sum he might be required to pay to the legal plaintiff if the security proved inadequate. If, on the sale of the security, the mortgagee received less than the debt, Weintraub would be answerable to the mortgagee for the deficiency and defendant would be answerable to Weintraub on its contract of indemnity. As those were the legal relations of the parties, when they came to make the extension agreement, we come to the question, what changes were made? It can hardly be said that they made the extension agreement in order that defendant might again obligate itself to pay only the deficiency remaining after the foreclosure of the mortgage security, because defendant was already under substantially that obligation. We think the words of the agreement were intended to create another relation, to raise another obligation, that defendant would pay the whole debt within 10 days after maturity in consideration of the extension.
