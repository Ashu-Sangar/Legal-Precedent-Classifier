    <p id="b76-11" data-blocks='[["BL_76.15",76,[298,1380,1151,744]]]'>Three firemen, employed by the City of Philadelphia, were injured, while riding on one of the city’s fire trucks, which was struck at a street intersection by one of defendant’s trolley cars, negligently operated. For the injuries received, the men brought actions of trespass against defendant and recovered verdicts aggregating 125,000, one of which was paid after the trial and the other two affirmed on appeal. In the statement of claim filed by them in the suits, the three plaintiffs claimed for loss of wages and the cost of medical care. On the trial, no evidence of loss of earnings or of the cost of medical care was introduced, and the trial judge instructed the jury that there could be no recovery for these.</p>
    <p id="b76-12" data-blocks='[["BL_76.16",76,[301,2140,1149,265]],["BL_77.1",77,[132,362,1154,537]]]'>After the injury to the three men, the city complied with the mandate of the Act of June 28, 1935, P. L. 477, (amended by the Act of May 14, 1937, P. L. 632, 53 PS Sec. 327),’ and paid them the compensation they were entitled to receive and their medical'and hospital bills. <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>Section 1 of the 1935 Act reads as follows: “That any policeman or fireman of any city (except of the second class A), borough, town or township, who is injured in the performance of his duties and by reason thereof is temporarily incapacitated from performing his duties, shall be paid by the municipality, by which he is employed, his full rate of compensation until the disability arising therefrom has ceased. All medical and hospital bills, incurred in connection with any such injury, shall be paid by such municipality.”</p>
    <p id="b77-3" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[134,910,1154,370]]]'>The suit now before us was brought by the City of Philadelphia to recover from defendant the sums paid the three men and expended for their medical care, amounting in all to $6,092.27. The case was heard: by Judge Lamberton without a jury, who denied recovery. This action was affirmed by the court in banc.- The city appeals.</p>
    <p id="b77-4" data-blocks='[["BL_77.5",77,[135,1294,1151,472]]]'>The court below was of opinion that the city’s right to recover for any loss it may have sustained should have been asserted in the original actions brought by the three men on the theory that the city was entitled to subrogation in their recovery for the amounts it had expended, and the fact that they did not press for recovery of their wages and hospital and medical expenses, by proof of them, makes no difference so far as this suit is concerned. With this view we are in accord.</p>

They were in the nature of disability compensation, similar to workmen’s compensation payments and payments under an accident insurance policy and should be treated in the same manner.

    <p id="b79-3" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[128,537,1155,974]]]'>Appellant contends that the relation between the city and the firemen was that of master and servant and at common law a master has a right of action for loss of services of his servant caused by the negligence of a third party and that the city’s suit can be sustained on that theory. It is extremely doubtful whether such a right of action should be recognized under modern conditions. It had its beginnings at a time when the relation of master and servant was totally different from that of today: <em>Chelsea Moving &amp; Trucking Co., Inc., v. Ross Towboat Co., </em><a href="/mass/280/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="280 Mass. 282" data-case-ids="858482" data-case-paths="/mass/280/0282-01">280 Mass. 282</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20N.E.%20177" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="182 N.E. 177">182 N. E. 177</a>. In any event, no attempt was made to establish the extent of the city’s loss by reason of the incapacity of the firemen. Apparently the only loss sustained was the compensation and expenses paid. As pointed out, the right to recover these items is in the firemen themselves and the city’s right is based on subrogation, which cannot be asserted in a separate suit.</p>
