    <p id="b561-3" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[117,426,1150,1090]]]'>Plaintiffs, A. Larry Hoffman and Alice «Hoffman, his wife,-sued Orville Repp and Joseph H. Breen, to recover damages resulting from a collision, which it is alleged was caused by Repp’s negligent driving of a truck in furtherance of Breen’s business. On the basis of a claim that Hoffman was liable over to defendants for the reason that his negligence caused the accident, defendants issued a writ of scire-facias under the Act of April 10, 1929, P. L. 479, as amended by the Acts of June 22, 1931, P. L. 663, May 18, 1933, P. L. 807, and June 25, 1937, P. L. 2118,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> to bring the husband-plaintiff upon the record as additional defendant.The latter ¡.filed an affidavit of defense raising questions of law, asserting the writ of scire facias and the praecipe.to be invalid upon their face in that they allege the additional defendant is liable over to the original defendants, but do not aver any facts sustaining such a legal conclusion, thereby failing to state any cause of action. This appeal is from the action of the lower court in. sustaining the affidavit of defense raising questions of law.</p>

Finnegan, </em><a href="/pa-super/110/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="110 Pa. Super. 404" data-case-ids="969806" data-case-paths="/pa-super/110/0404-01">110 Pa.

(2d) 503</a>. In the present writ, no reasons are advanced which would support the allegation that the <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>additional defendant “is liable over” to the original defendants. The facts set forth, if proved, would establish that the negligent driving of the former was the proximate cause of the accident, and would fasten him with direct responsibility. The averments are totally inconsistent with the assertion of liability over. Such duplicity, is fatal to the statement of a valid cause of action: see <em>Bowers v. Gladstein, </em><a href="/pa/317/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="317 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="8846431" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0520-01">317 Pa. 520</a>, 523.</p>
