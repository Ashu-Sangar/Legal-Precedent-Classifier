The weather was sleeting; there was no evidence of inadequate lighting, defect ip the <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>box, or that it stood on ground that was not level. A brakeman stood on one side of the box and a chauffeur, who had come to receive plaintiff, stood on the other, the chauffeur helping her down by having, as she testified, “his hand on my elbow”; she thought the box “tipped” or “slipped bach on the sleet”. The learned court below concluded there was no. evidence of negligence on the part of defendant; nothing to show that the box was misplaced or was defective, or that the injury resulted from an appliance of transportation. We agree with that conclusion. Compare <em>Dixon v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/98/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="98 Pa.
