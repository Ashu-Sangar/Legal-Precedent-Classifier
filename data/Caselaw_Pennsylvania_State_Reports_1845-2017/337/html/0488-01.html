Walter Weaver, Collector” at the time the bank was first placed under the control of a conservator, on March 25, 1933. The receiver filed a motion for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and, after argument thereon, it was dismissed by the Court of Common Pleas. The receiver thereafter appealed to the Superior Court, <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>and' from the order of that court reversing the lower court,-this appeal was allowed to Weaver and his wife.</p>

      <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>We are all of the firm conviction that the set-off should not be allowed. By using the word “Collector’?, Weaver expressly stamped the funds, not as his- own, but as belonging -in equity to some third person. Our" law abounds with instances where words of similar-fiduciary import created a' presumption that the funds were not personal deposits, but were trust funds. Most recently, upon a careful analysis of all the earlier cases, we have accorded such effect to the words “clerk of courts” <em>(Erie County v. Lamberton, </em><a href="/pa/297/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="297 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="1118247" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0406-01">297 Pa. 406</a>), “sheriff” <em>(Trestrail v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/298/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="298 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="1120352" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0388-01">298 Pa. 388</a>), and “Agency Account” <em>(Franklin Trust Company of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/319/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="319 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1162272" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0367-01">319 Pa. 367</a>). In the Trestrail cáse, we said (p. 396) : “Where the ownership of the fund is in contest, the designation ‘sheriff’ would presumptively entitle it to be known as a trust account. Such presumption may be rebutted: Stair v. York National Bank, supra, [<a href="/pa/55/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="55 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="1470712" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0364-01">55 Pa. 364</a>]; Gaffney’s Est., <a href="/pa/146/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="146 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="827887" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0049-01">146 Pa. 49</a>; but the burden is on one claiming otherwise.” It is true that the bank would have to honor checks signed by Weaver as “Collector” <em>(First National Bank of Lock Haven v. Mason, </em><a href="/pa/95/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="95 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="492920" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0113-01">95 Pa. 113</a>) , and could not safely pay that account to a third person <em>(Patterson v. Marine N. Bank, </em><a href="/pa/130/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="130 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="568950" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0419-01">130 Pa. 419</a>). This is because in the absence of knowledge on the bank’s part to the contrary, it is bound to presume that the trustee will apply the funds so drawn to their proper purposes: <em>National Bank v. Insurance Company, </em><a href="/us/104/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="104 U.S. 54" data-case-ids="3494530" data-case-paths="/us/104/0054-01">104 U. S. 54</a>, 64. But for the trustee to offset them against his own individual debt to the bank is to do more than to collect the funds from the bank, and is forbidden by our law. For example, where the bank has knowledge of facts, so that it knows that the trustee intends to use the funds for his own purposes, and that for it to honor a check drawn by him will be to aid a breach of trust, the bank will be liable for the 'amount of any checks thus honored: <em>Pennsylvania Co. for Insurances on Lives, etc. v. Ninth Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/306/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="306 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1136852" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0148-01">306 Pa. 148</a>, 153: Likewise, a bank with knowledge that a deposit is held for <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>the benefit of a third party cannot appropriate such moneys to the payment of an individual debt of the depositor: <em>The First National Bank of Bethlehem v.

The real owners could hold the receiver liable for.the misappropriation: see <em>Dickens v. Howard, </em><a href="/f2d/67/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="67 F.2d 263" data-case-ids="284647" data-case-paths="/f2d/67/0263-01">67 F. (2d) 263</a>, 264. It is clear beyond cavil that Weaver may not set off a deposit of trust funds in reduction of his own personal obligation to the bank: <em>Hunter v. Henning, </em><a href="/pa/259/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="259 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1038376" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0347-01">259 Pa. 347</a>; <em>Mullins v.

    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[294,1127,1150,965]]]'>Defendant’s allegations in the new matter as to the true nature of the account, far from rebutting the presumption arising from the use of the word “Collector” that the funds were trust monies, operate rather to prove that presumption. Instead of demonstrating that the deposit belonged to Weaver in his own right at the time the bank became insolvent, the averments show that upon that date, the fund represented tax collections, set apart by Weaver from his own moneys in trust for the taxing units concerned. It is immaterial that as custodian of the collections, Weaver in effect contracted to insure their safe-keeping and could deposit them wherever he chose. These factors do not have the effect of vitiating his fiduciary obligations with respect to the fund. What was said in this regard in <em>Trestrail v. Johnson, </em>supra, 395, was not an ill-considered dictum, but was the enunciation of a principle which is firmly embedded in our law.</p>

Similarly, <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>it has been pointed out that such deposits may not be attached for the private debts of the officer; that upon death they go to his successor, not to his administrator; and that should the officer become insolvent, the hand of the law would be laid on the money in such account as trust funds: <em>Trestrail v.
