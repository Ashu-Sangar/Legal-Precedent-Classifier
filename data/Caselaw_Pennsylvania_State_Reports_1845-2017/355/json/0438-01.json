        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThe question is whether the will conferred upon the executors and trustees a discretionary power to invest in and retain non-legal securities. The words to be construed are: \u201cI invest my Executors and Trustees with full power, authority and discretion as to the purchase, sale and investment of all principal of my estate.\u201d\nThe learned auditing judge decided that no discretion Avas granted. He ruled that the clause was equivocal in meaning and hence no such poAver existed. The account AA\u2019as that of the executor. The residuary balance was awarded to the trustees. The balance included non-legals to the extent of approximately $200,000. Apparently all securities had been decedent owned. No loss had been incurred to the date of the accounting. No surcharge was sought or decreed. The ruling excepted to is: \u201cIf the Executor as trustee takes over in kind the investments as set forth in the account, he is directed to dispose of the non-legals Avithin a reasonable time, and to make investments in conformity with the Avill as here construed.\u201d That, in substance, is a direction to convert.\nThe general rule as to permissive investment by a fiduciary in non-legals is well settled. Mr. Justice Walling in Detre\u2019s Estate, 273 Pa. 341, 345, 117 A. 54, accurately states the rule in these words: \u201cWhere, ... a trustee is clothed with discretionary powers as to investments and reinvestments, neither the state constitutional provision as to trust funds, nor the rule as to legal investments, applies: Barker\u2019s Estate, 159 Pa. 518; Cridland\u2019s Estate, 132 Pa. 479, 484.\u201d See: Greenwalt\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 413, 21 A. 2d 890; Hale Estate, 347 Pa. 177, 180, 32 A. 2d 20; Scott on Trusts, section 227.14.\nIn Bale Estate, supra, Mr. Justice Dreav said (p. 178) : \u201cIt is well settled that the power to invest in non-legals must not rest upon equivocal words or upon conjecture, but must clearly appear. The presumption is against the existence of such poAver, and all doubts are resolved against the party asserting it: Taylor\u2019s Estate, 277 Pa. 518; Restatement of Trusts, \u00a7227 (b). . . .\u201d\nWe have compared the language in this will with that of the wills in the cited cases. In Detre\u2019s Estate, supra, the words were (p. 344): to invest \"in such securities as to him may seem best without responsibility as to the exercise of his discretion in so doing.\u201d In Greenawalt\u2019s Estate, supra, the language was (p. 415) . . to reinvest ... in .. . such securities as may be for the best interests of my estate.\u201d\nThere would appear to be little, if any, difference in the expression of testator\u2019s intent in these cases concerning the grant of discretion to fiduciaries from the language employed in the present case. Here the words are: \"I invest my Executors and Trustees with full power, authority and discretion as to the purchase, sale and investment of all principal of my estate.\u201d\nIn Hale Estate, supra, the words were (p. 177) : to \"be invested . . . in good sound securities.\u201d This language was held by this Court to be equivocal and not to give the trustee any discretion in the matter of investments. Mr. Justice Drew, in discussing Greenawalt\u2019s Estate, supra, and Detre\u2019s Estate, supra, said (p. 179) : \u201cIn Greenawalt\u2019s Estate, supra, the extensive discretionary power given to the trustees was interpreted to permit investment in non-legals. This was in accord with the general rule: Detre\u2019s Estate, 273 Pa. 341; Scott on Trusts, \u00a7227.14. ...\u201d\nJudge Ladner, the learned auditing. judge, distinguishes the words in Detre\u2019s Estate, supra, from the language here employed. He said that in the Detre case there was included an exemption from liability resulting from the exercise of discretion. We cannot adopt such a distinction. If discretion be conferred, it follows that liability could not attach for doing what was authorized. The learned auditing judge analyzed the language and ruled that it was equivocal. He said that grant of discretion was susceptible of different meanings; it \u201cmay have meant determination (a) whether to buy or sell, or (b) when to buy or sell and not necessarily (c) what to buy or sell\u201d (italics ours). We cannot adopt the distinction. If the fiduciaries were given the power to buy, sell and invest, it necessarily follows that such discretion extends to and includes what securities are to be bought, sold, invested in, or retained. If the fiduciaries were held to be limited merely to the purchase and sale of legal investments, the words of the clause would be superfluous. The fiduciaries already possessed that authority under the law.\nWe think the language clearly clothes the fiduciaries with discretionary power to invest in and retain nonlegal securities. This case is ruled by Detre\u2019s Estate, supra, and Greenawalt\u2019s Estate, supra.\nThe decree is reversed. Costs to be paid by the appellee.",
