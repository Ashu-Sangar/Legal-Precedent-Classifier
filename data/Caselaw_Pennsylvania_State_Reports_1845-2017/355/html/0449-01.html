    <p id="b476-9" data-blocks='[["BL_476.15",476,[220,1232,1148,640]]]'>Esther Moran Jacobs, appellant, filed a petition for a writ of alternative mandamus, to compel the School District of Wilkes-Barre Township, and John Kinsel, John J. Quinn, Stephen Gola, Ellsworth Davis, Nicholas Solack, Leon Ziomek, and Andrew Kuren, appellees, to reinstate appellant to her position as a teacher in said school district, and pay to her moneys to which she was allegedly entitled under the terms of her contract. At the trial the jury was directed to return a verdict in favor of appellees. This appeal is from the refusal of the court below to grant appellant’s motions for a new trial and for judgment non obstante veredicto.</p>

L. 213, 24 P.S. 1121, et sec, was enacted. In conformity with said Act, a proper contract was duly entered into between appellee school district and appellant on August 29, 1940. Beginning February 25, 1941, appellant, without notice to the board, or permis<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>sion therefrom, voluntarily remained away from her duties for the balance of the year. On July 30, 1941, a child was born to appellant. In September, 1941, appellant resumed teaching and continued to do so until June, 1942. In September, 1942, she again failed to appear to perform her duties as teacher, but addressed a letter dated September 1, 1942, to the board requesting a sabbatical leave. The envelope containing said letter was postmarked October 12, 1942. No action was taken upon the said request by the board. In September, 1943, Ellsworth Davis, one of the appellees, spoke to appellant on the telephone and requested to know what her intentions were with respect to her duties and her contract. Appellant replied that she would inform the board of her decision in the course of two weeks. She did not subsequently contact Davis, the board, or any member thereof. Thereafter, the position on the teaching staff for which appellant was employed was filled by employment of another regular teacher. Thereafter, neither appellant nor the board, on her behalf, paid any moneys into the retirement fund. In January, 1944, a second child was born to appellant. On September 5, 1944, at the beginning of the school year 1944-45, appellant presented herself for duty but was denied the privilege of teaching. This petition for writ of alternative mandamus was then filed.</p>

L. 309, sec. 1209, 24 P.S. sec. 1128. The obvious intention of the legislature in enacting the latter provision was to prevent one who has breached a contract by refusing to continue to <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>teach from obtaining employment elsewhere in this Commonwealth as a teacher in the public schools.

L. 309, sec. 1205, as amended, 24 P.S. sec. 1126, provides: “The only valid causes for termination of a contract entered into with a professional employe in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be — immorality, incompetency, intemperance, cruelty, persistent negligence, mental derangement, persistent and wilful violation of the school laws of this Commonwealth on the part of the professional employe.” Provision is thus made whereby termination of the contract may be effected either by the professional employee or by the school board. When, therefore, one of the parties seeks to terminate the contract, the respective statutory provisions apply. Those situations are not here involved.</p>
    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[187,1200,1150,807]]]'>The legislature has not restrained or prevented mutual recognition of the termination of the contract. “It is always competent for the parties to a written contract to show that it was subsequently abandoced in whole or in part, modified, changed, or a new one substituted. And this may be shown by parol by showing either an express agreement or actions necessarily involving the alterations: <em>Achenbach v.

The action of appellee school board in employing a permanent teacher to replace her, only after a reasonable time had elapsed after they had contacted appellant, was an act of, or acquiescence in, the abandonment. Together, these acts constituted a mutual rescission. That the parties have abandoned the contract by acts instead of words or writing is of no consequence. Had appellant and the board, in writing, agreed that the contract was to be thenceforth void and of no effect, it could not seriously be contended that effect would not be given thereto, even though the procedure required by the Act had not been complied with. Similarly, had the parties orally agreed to the same terms, effect would be given to said oral agreement.</p>
