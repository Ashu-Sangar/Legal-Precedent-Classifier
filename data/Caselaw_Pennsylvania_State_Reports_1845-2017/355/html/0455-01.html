    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.8",482,[221,369,1150,534]]]'>This litigation developed from a petty neighbor dispute between adjoining real estate owners. From it has emerged an important legal principle, affecting real estate enjoyment throughout the Commonwealth. The question is: Where a landowner erects a structure on his own land which obstructs the light, air, and view of an adjoining owner, thereby annoying the adjoining owner, may legal or equitable relief be had by the adjoining owner if the landowner’s motive in erecting such structure was purely malicious?</p>
    <p id="b482-5" data-blocks='[["BL_482.9",482,[226,915,1148,640]]]'>Plaintiffs and defendants are adjoining property owners. The east wall of plaintiffs’ house, erected on the property line, extends a number of feet beyond the rear of defendants’ house. Two windows in plaintiffs’ wall overlook the back yard of defendants’ dwelling. One window is on the first floor and the other is above it on the second floor. The panes in the windows are of frosted glass. Defendants erected a brick wall, entirely upon their own land, one and one-half inches from plaintiffs’ wall. The wall is 9 inches thick, 12 feet long and 10 feet high. It completely obstructs and blocks off plaintiffs’ first floor window.</p>
    <p id="b482-6" data-blocks='[["BL_482.10",482,[226,1567,1148,587]]]'>Plaintiffs filed a bill in equity seeking to compel the removal of the wall. They maintained that the shutting out of light and air impaired the use and value of their property and jeopardized their health. It was contended that the structure served no useful purpose and was erected for the sole purpose of harassing and annoying plaintiffs and created a nuisance. Defendants denied that it was a “spite” structure, but was erected for a useful and beneficial purpose to defendants, viz: to permit the hanging of a clothes line in the yard and as part of a proposed garage.</p>

It may be immoral, and shock our notions of fairness, but what the law permits, equity tolerates. It would be much more inequitable and intolerable to allow a man’s neighbors to question his motives every time that he should undertake to erect a structure upon his own premises, and drag him before a court of equity to ascertain whether he is about to erect the structure for ornament or profit, or through motives of unmixed malice.”</p>

We know of no . . . rule of law . . . that confers upon an individual a right to maliciously injure another, regardless of what method may be employed to inflict such injury. On the other hand, every one is entitled to the protection of the law against invasions of his rights by others. The use of one’s own property for the sole purpose of injuring another is not a right that a good citizen would desire nor one. that a bad citizen should have.”</p>

We have decided, however, on many occasions and in varying circumstances, that a lawful act is not actionable though it proceed from a malicious motive. In the early case of <em>Jenkins v. Fowler, </em><a href="/pa/24/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="24 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="9504477" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0308-01">24 Pa. 308</a>, Justice Jeremiah S. Black, said, p. 310: “ . . we cannot take cognisance of mere feelings and motives. These considerations may and do often aggrevate the character of wrongs. Malicious motives make a bad act worse; but they cannot make that wrong which, in its own essence, is lawful. When a creditor who has a just debt brings a suit or issues execution, though he does it out of pure enmity to the debtor, he is safe. In slander, if the defendant proves the words spoken to be true, his intention to injure the plaintiff by proclaiming his infamy, will not defeat the justification. One who prosecutes another for a crime, need not show in an action for malicious prosecution that he was actuated by correct feelings, if he can prove that there was good reason to believe the charge well founded. In short, any transaction which would be lawful and proper if the parties were friends, cannot be made the foundation of an action merely because they happened to be enemies. As long as a man keeps himself within the law by doing no <em>act </em>which <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>violates it, we must leave Ms motives to Him who searches the heart.” In that case adjoining owners fenced in an unopened road, contrary to law. Defendant tore down his part of the fence which exposed plaintiff’s field and permitted crops to be destroyed by cattle let in upon it. <em>Jenkins v. Fowler, </em><a href="/pa/24/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="24 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="9504477" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0308-01">supra,</a> is the leading case in this Commonwealth and has been frequently cited Avith approval and as late as 1941 in <em>Stofflett v.
