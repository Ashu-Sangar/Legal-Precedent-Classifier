The contract provided for the installation by plaintiff on defendant’s premises of a semi-public branch exchange system consisting of a switchboard and other equipment, for the use and maintenance of which defendant was to pay a monthly charge. Defendant, acting as plaintiff’s agent, was to collect for it the established public telephone rate of ten cents for each local message from the hotel premises and the established charges for toll messages, and was to receive from plaintiff a commission of 60% of the gross receipts from local messages and 20% from toll messages, not to exceed 25 cents on any one message. The contract was to continue in force from month to month until terminated by ten days’ notice in writing from either party to the other. It was not filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, but plaintiff had on file with the Commission the tariffs specifying local and toll message rates.</p>

Plaintiff informed defendant of this order of the Commission, but apparently to no avail in spite of the fact that the Federal Communications Commission also held that the practice of hotels in making and collecting surcharges not provided for in plaintiff’s filed tariffs was improper as to interstate calls over semi-public branch exchanges. On February 12, 1944, plain<a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>tiff gave defendant notice that their contract would be terminated at midnight February 23, 1944, notice on March 1, 1944, that plaintiff’s filed tariffs provided for the collection of its established charges only and not for any surcharges by hotels, and notice on April 3, 1944, that plaintiff would, after April 15,1944, make commission payments only to hotels which in writing had advised plaintiff of their compliance with the tariff provisions by discontinuing their practice of making surcharges. Defendant did not respond to these notices and, since February 23, 1944, no contract for the payment of commissions has been in force between the parties.</p>

It is plaintiff’s contention that during that period defendant was illegally collecting surcharges in addition to the rates in effect under the filed tariffs and that after the termination of the contract between the parties on February 24,1944, defendant had no right to any commissions whatever.</p>

In the present case the only tribunal in which plaintiff can sue for the moneys it claims is the Court of Common Pleas; whatever the function of the Public Utility Commission to determine the reasonable and just amount of defendant’s commissions that body cannot give relief to plaintiff by awarding him a judgment, followed, if necessary, by a writ of execution. The Public Utility Commission has no jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding by a public utility to recover its charges. If plaintiff is entitled to recovery in its present action it is for the Court of Common Pleas to say so; if it is not entitled it is likewise for that court so to declare.

The Pennsylvania Hotels Association, of which defendant is a member, has made the same complaint to the Commission, in proceedings still pending, which defendant makes in the present action, and has prayed the Commission to determine the reasonable and proper rates, regulations and practices affecting the compensation for hotel telephone service for the period here in question and also for an order compelling plaintiff to adopt and recognize as a part of its tariffs for that period the same “division of the message rate for hotel service” which was in effect prior to April 15,1944. It may be that the consideration of this complaint by the Commission will result in providing defendant with a defense in whole or in part to the present action and in a consequent total or partial defeat of plaintiff’s claim, or its decision may form the basis of a claim for refund, but in no event can it impair or in any manner affect the question of the jurisdiction of the court over the present action.</p>
