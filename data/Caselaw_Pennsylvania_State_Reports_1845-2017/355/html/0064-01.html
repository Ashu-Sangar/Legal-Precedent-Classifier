It is not pretended that any such right existed prior to the merger. The exchange of stock, in the merger, was <em>not </em>in payment of defaulted accrued dividends on the preferred stock. The trustee exchanged common and preferred stock which had paid no dividends for a number of years, for new stock which has paid and is still paying dividends. We said in our previous decision, pages 28 and 29: “Each trust contained shares of common and preferred stock of a corporation. The preferred stock had arrearages for dividends undeclared. The corporation effected a recapitalization and merger with two of its wholly owned subsidiaries. The trustee exchanged each share of pre<a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>ferred stock, with accrued dividend arrearages, for one-half share of 5% cumulative preferred stock, Series A, one-half share 5% cumulative convertible preferred stock, Series B, and one and one-quarter shares of no-par common stock; each share of $100 par common stock was exchanged for one share of no-par common stock. The recapitalization and merger did not affect the capital nor increase or decrease the surplus. The assets and financial situation of the corporation remained unchanged. The trustee, owner of the stock, neither gained nor lost by the transaction. The same property interest was represented by the new certificates of stock that had been indicated by the old. There have been no stock dividends declared, no corporate dissolution, no distribution of corporate assets, and no sale of any of the new stock by the trustee.” No sound reason is advanced why we should now overrule what we have decided in this case, and in the numerous cases stemming from <em>Earp’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/28/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="28 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="981664" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0368-01">28 Pa. 368</a>.

Nothing which we said in our prior decision is susceptible of, or intended to have, any other meaning. We said in that case, page 29: “There is probably no more difficult and intricate branch of the law than the <em>application </em>of what is termed the Pennsylvania, or American, Rule of Apportionment. The principle of equitable apportionment was early established (see Earp’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/28/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="28 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="981664" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0368-01">28 Pa. 368</a>), and its development and refinements are ably discussed by former Chief Justice Kephart in Nirdlinger’s Estate, <a href="/pa/290/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="290 Pa. 457" data-case-ids="1104400" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0457-01">290 Pa. 457</a>,<a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20200" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="139 A. 200">139 A. 200</a>, and in Waterhouse’s Estate, <a href="/pa/308/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="308 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="1140235" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0422-01">308 Pa. 422</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.%20295" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="162 A. 295">162 A. 295</a>. There is a host of other cases, which need not be cited, dealing with various applications of the principle. In general, it is the rule that on distribution a life tenant is entitled to receive accumulated profits and earnings, except where necessary to preserve the ‘intact value’ of principal. Where there is a stock or cash dividend, a corporate liquidation, a sale or distribution in kind, the life tenant is entitled to such accumulated profits and earnings.

But he is only entitled to receive them on a stock or cash dividend, a corporate liquidation, or a sale or distribution in kind, and then only to the extent that the intact value of principal is not impaired.

In no sense does the case involve any distribution of earnings or profits by way of stock issuance or exchange. No such distribution was made either in furtherance of or as a result of the merger.

The incorporated worth ascribable to the additional common stock given in connection with the exchange of the preferred shares was contributed by the <em>common </em>stockholders of the corporation. By approving the plan of merger, they, i.e., common stockholders, permitted their interest in the equity in the corporation’s assets to be diminished by the issuance of an increased number of <em>common shares of no par value </em>whereof they received <em>one share for each share of their old $100 par value common stock. </em>The residue of the new no par common stock issue, after the exchange of the old $100 par common on a share for share basis, provided the block of new common that was given in the merger to the preferred stockholders <em>in addition to </em>(i.e., over and above) the cumulative preferred $100 par shares they received, share for share, in the exchange.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The common stock thus received by the stockholders on account of their <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>preferred was given in extinguishment of the unpaid accumulated dividends on the old preferred.

As to that, Mr. Justice Parker appropriately pointed out (pp. 612-613) that “Here the values which form the basis for issuing 40% additional preferred stock were furnished by the common stockholders and were supplied for the purpose of discharging the arrearages in preferred dividends. . . . The additional values assigned to the preferred stock issue did not come from the corpus of the estate or affect it but were supplied by another class of stockholders [viz., common] <em>for the purpose of paying the arrearages in </em>dividends”. It was consonantly held (p. 612) that “As between life tenant and remaindermen <em>the additional stock was in fact given in discharge of dividends and must be so </em>treated(Emphasis above supplied). The learned Justice further aptly observed (p. 615) that “The intact value of cumulative preferred shares will ordinarily ... be the par value, if the capital is not impaired”. That means, and correctly so, that, upon an exchange of preferred shares for preferred shares <em>on a share for share basis and both of the same par .value, </em>no question of intact value of the preferred arises if the capital is not impaired. And, here, indisputably the capital was not impaired by the stock distribution. As I believe the above-quoted statements from <em>FisheFs Estate </em>correctly interpreted a situation identical with the one with which we are now concerned, I am compelled, to disagree with the ruling in the majority opinion that this is an' “apportionment” case and that “The exchange of stock, in the merger, was <em>not </em>in payment of defaulted accrued dividends on the preferred stock”.</p>

It was therefore quite proper to consider <em>there </em>all those matters that are alleged to be involved in this case. It would have been premature in that case to have considered such matters unless there had been a sale.” I respectfully submit that it was wholly immaterial to the decision in <em>Fisher’s Estate </em>that the preferred stock there received in the exchange (including the additional stock in extinction of the accumulated and unpaid cash dividends) was later sold and that the question of the life tenant’s right to the stock arose on the trustee’s accounting for the proceeds of the sale. Had none of the stock been sold, the question of the life tenant’s right to it would not have been premature and the decision would have been the same. As was stated in <em>Buist’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/297/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="297 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1118271" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0537-01">297 Pa. 537</a>, 543, <a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.%20606" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="147 A. 606">147 A. 606</a>, a life tenant is entitled to shares of stock received as a result of a merger when “(2) distributed in the form of a stock dividend. . . .” And, was it not ruled in <em>Fisher’s Estate </em>that the distribution of the <em>additional </em>shares to the preferred stockholders in that case was in discharge of the accumulated but unpaid dividend arrearages on the old preferred, — veritably, a stock dividend to the old preferred stockholders contributed by the common stockholders without resort to the company’s earnings, its surplus or its capital assets?</p>

While the life tenant is presumptively entitled to such dividends, so much thereof as is necessary to preserve intact the value of the corpus stock, as of the date of the creation of trust (ordinarily the time of the testator’s death), must be apportioned to corpus: see <em>Waterhouse’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/308/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="308 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="1140235" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0422-01">308 Pa. 422</a>, 428, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.%20295" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="162 A. 295">162 A. 295</a>, and cases there cited.</p>

The reported decisions in this State disclose that, to date, the question of intact value has been <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>raised exclusively with respect to common stocks: see <em>Fisher’s Estate, </em>supra, at p. 608. Nor has that circumstance been fortuitous. Subject to lien and property securities (e. g. bonds and preferred stock), the common stockholders are the equitable owners of the assets of a company. The book value of their stock is necessarily affected by a distribution of earnings or profits. If such distribution is sufficiently large to diminish the book value of the stock below what it was when the trust came into being (i.e., at the death of the testator), then there is an impairment of the intact value which must be restored out of the distribution. But, that is not so with regard to preferred stock. While its right to a proportionate interest in the assets of the company is preferential, the amount thereof is fixed at par and its book value remains constant. It never varies as the result of an addition of earnings or profits to surplus or a distribution thereof, whether current or accumulated. Its book value remains one and the same unless the preferred capital of the company is impaired which, of course, cannot lawfully happen from dividend distributions to stockholders. In the instant case, the intact value (i.e., book value) of the new preferred was exactly the same as was the intact value of the old preferred. And, that was known the day the distribution in exchange was made to the trustee as well as now. There was, therefore, no occasion for apportionment nor for a witholding of the dividend stock from the life tenant until there had been a <em>sale </em>thereof.</p>

Among those shares were the 972 ear-marked shares received in payment of the dividend arrearages on the old preferred stock. So that, there has been a sale if that were important. Hence, even under the majority opinion the time for the determination of the life tenant’s right <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>to the proceeds of the common (dividend) stock has arrived. If, however, the requirement of the majority opinion means that there must also he a sale of the preferred stock received in the exchange, no basis for the ruling is apparent. The sale price of the preferred (i.e., its <em>market value </em>at the time sold) would have no materiality in establishing its intact value after the exchange distribution. Market value is not evidence of intact value: see <em>Baird’s Estate, </em>supra, at p. 42.</p>

The life tenant objected to the trustee’s espousal of the remaindermen’s claim to the dividend stock. The learned court below ruled, correctly, I believe, that the trustee was but a stakeholder and therefore not permitted to take sides between the life tenant and the remaindermen: see <em>Buist’s Estate, </em>supra, at p. 542; <em>Thompson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/262/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="262 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1044500" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0278-01">262 Pa. 278</a>, 281, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.%20273" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="105 A. 273">105 A. 273</a>; Restatement, Trusts, § 183. The fact that the trust contained spendthrift provisions did not change the trustee’s proper róle as between interested beneficiaries. In fact, the trustee’s preference of the remaindermen to the disadvantage of the life tenant was hardly in keeping with the desire of the testator. It is not to be presumed that he intended that the life tenant would “. . . be required to starve in order that remainder-men may ultimately feast:” <em>Nir danger’s Estate (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa/327/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="327 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1176707" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0171-01">327 Pa. 171</a>, 174, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.%2030" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="193 A. 30">193 A. 30</a>.
