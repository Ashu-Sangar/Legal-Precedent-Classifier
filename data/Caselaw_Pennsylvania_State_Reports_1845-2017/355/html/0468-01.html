Webb and a train of Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines. Plain<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>tiffs are Webb, Anna L. Babich, a guest passenger in the car, who was a minor when suit was entered and the action was instituted in her behalf by her father and guardian, Peter Babich, who together with Mary Babich, his wife, brought suit in their own behalf. Before trial Anna L. Babich attained her majority and became a party plaintiff and her father, Peter Babich, died and a voluntary nonsuit was entered as to him.</p>

So considered the pertinent facts are: On September 20, 1942, at 11:30 o’clock P. M., Webb and Miss Babich were returning from a moving picture show to her home in the outskirts of Camden, New Jersey. Webb drove his car in an easterly direction on Chelten Avenue. Miss Babich sat next to him on the front seat. They proceeded along this four-lane paved street to the place where it is crossed at grade by the tracks of defendant company. It was a dark and windy night. Webb testified that when five or ten feet from the nearest rail, he brought his car to a full stop, and looked and listened for an approaching train, and that when he did not see or hear anything, he put his car in first gear and started over the crossing at a speed of five or ten miles an hour. He said he continued to listen and to look in both directions, and after he had crossed three tracks and was upon the nearest rail of the fourth track, his automobile was struck by an engine or train that he did not see or hear. He further said the distance across the four tracks was forty or fifty feet. He stated positively that there were no lights visible at the crossing, or upon the engine or train which struck him; that there was no safety gate and that no warning whatever was given by bell, whistle or anything of the approach of the train. When struck, Webb was rendered unconscious and had <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>no recollection of anything that happened after the collision. He was painfully and permanently injured.</p>
    <p id="b496-4" data-blocks='[["BL_496.5",496,[208,391,1148,644]]]'>In her testimony Miss Babich corroborated all Webb said concerning the fact that he had stopped, looked and listened, and had kept an outlook as he crossed the tracks. She said she had looked and listened, but saw or heard nothing, and she gave positive testimony that she did not see the object which struck the automobile until “a fraction of a second” before the collision. She was also positive in her testimony that there were no lights of any kind at or near the place of the accident or upon the engine or train which struck them, and that no signal was given of the approach of a train to the crossing.</p>
    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.6",496,[205,1048,1151,1185]]]'>The only testimony in the case was that given by Webb and Miss Babich. At the close of plaintiffs’ case the motion of defendant for compulsory nonsuit was granted, the learned court being of opinion that Webb and Miss Babich were contributorily negligent as a matter of law and therefore could not recover. In the opinion of that court it is asserted that these plaintiffs were negligent because they were bound to see the approaching train if they had looked, and also that they could not have helped but hear the approaching train if they had listened. On the facts of this case, we are unable to accept as true either of these conclusions. If the testimony of plaintiffs is true, is it difficult to see what more they could have done. Their uncontradicted testimony that they neither saw nor heard anything, although they stopped, looked and listened before entering upon the first track and continued to do so as they proceeded across all four tracks was sufficient evidence to require submission of the case to a jury: <em>Hugo v.
