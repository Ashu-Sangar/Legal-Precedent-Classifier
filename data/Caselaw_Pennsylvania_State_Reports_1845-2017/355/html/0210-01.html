The trust res was to be “kept intact for the purposes and uses herein provided”. There was a spendthrift provision to prevent the pledge, assignment or sale by any of the beneficiaries of any principal or income payable or distributable to them, and to make the property immune against liability for their debts. The trustees were “vested with full and complete title to all of the property of the estate”; they were given power to sell, mortgage or lease the property or any part thereof and to reinvest the proceeds. They were also given authority to designate an agent to manage and operate the trust properties and for that purpose to employ such other help as they might deem necessary. They were to collect the income and pay all necessary operating and maintenance expenses. They were to be allowed reasonable compensation for their services. The trust was to “exist and remain in full force and effect for a period of fifteen (15) years from the <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>date hereof, however, the trust created hereunder may be terminated at any time upon the mutual and concurrent decision of the trustees and of the beneficiaries hereunder.

It is clear, from a long line of authorities,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">3</a> that, even though the property has beeii delivered to a trustee and vested remainders given to the beneficiaries, if the donor himself continues as beneficiary until his death, as by reserving a right to the income during his life, the interest of the remaindermen does not take effect until the donor’s death and is, therefore, subject to the transfer inheritance tax. But, if there is no such reservation, if the donor has not retained any power of revocation or amendment whereby he may reassert dominion over the property, if he has divested himself absolutely of all title to the property at the time of the execution of the trust instrument, the transfer is a perfected gift inter vivos and, therefore, not subject to the tax: <em>Commonwealth v. Linderman’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/340/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="340 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="1203387" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0289-01">340 Pa. 289</a>, 291, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20397" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="17 A.2d 397">17 A. 2d 397</a>, 398. The criterion is not whether the beneficiaries are to acquire actual possession or enjoyment at or after the death of the donor but whether the latter has irrevocably parted with all his interest, title, possession and enjoyment in his lifetime. Prom this it follows that the fact that income, which is vested in the beneficiaries, <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>is to be accumulated and not paid to them until after the donor’s death does not make the gift subject to the tax as one not intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment until after such death.

    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[200,1424,1150,914]],["BL_243.1",243,[189,281,1148,593]]]'>It is to be noted that the right of the beneficiaries in the Glosser trust to the ultimate enjoyment of the income is absolute; it is not limited by any discretionary power on the part of the trustees. The beneficiaries became, from the very inception of the trust, the sole owners of the income even though their actual possession of it was to be delayed and meanwhile spendthrift provisions were attached to it; (cf. <em>Loehrie’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/340/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="340 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1203336" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0145-01">340 Pa. 145</a>, 153, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.2d%20133" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="16 A.2d 133">16 A. 2d 133</a>, 137). Much is made by the Commonwealth of the statement in the trust instrument that the beneficiaries were to have no interest in the property itself but only in the income as and when distributed. But this provision, which for some purposes— as, for example, in connection with the tax problem involved in <em>Commonwealth v. Stewart, </em><a href="/pa/338/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="338 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1199947" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0009-01">338 Pa. 9</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.2d%20444" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="12 A.2d 444">12 A. 2d 444</a> — might have practical significance, here has none. In some States and by some learned jurists it has been <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>held that trust beneficiaries have a proprietary interest in the trust res; in other States and by other writers the view is taken that they have merely the right to enforce the trust provisions against the trustee. But, though the rights of the beneficiaries in the present trust are declared not to be in rem, the essential fact remains that the donor parted at the time of the declaration of the trust with all his right, title and interest in the property, all of which passed to the trustees without any reserved power on his part to reclaim or ever regain title, possession or enjoyment of any part thereof.</p>
    <p id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[190,884,1150,1359]]]'>There is an additional factor in this Glosser trust which strongly militates against the Commonwealth’s position. The taking of possession or enjoyment by the beneficiaries was not to be contingent upon, or in any way connected with, the death of the donor. The trust was to terminate, not at donor’s death, but at the expiration of a fixed period of fifteen years, at which time the beneficiaries were to receive possession of the principal and accumulated income irrespective of whether the donor was then living or dead. His death, therefore, passed no interest in title, enjoyment or possession to any of the beneficiaries, nor enlarged or in any manner affected their rights. It is true that there is a provision that the trust could be terminated at any time upon the “mutual and concurrent decision” of the trustees and the beneficiaries, so that it would have been possible, upon such an agreement being reached, for the trust to be terminated and the assets distributed at the time of decedent’s death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">4</a> But, this result being something to which the consent of the beneficiaries was required, the donor cannot be held to have intended it, since, in the very instrument creating the trust, he placed the implementation of any such intention wholly beyond his control: cf. <em>Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., </em><a href="/us/278/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="278 U.S. 339" data-case-ids="3905649" data-case-paths="/us/278/0339-01">278 U.S. 339</a>, 346.</p>

There was no. retention here of any control of such a nature as to render the trust assets subject to the transfer inheritance tax: <em>Dolan’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/279/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="279 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="1083564" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0582-01">279 Pa. 582</a>, 591, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.%20176" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="124 A. 176">124 A. 176</a>, 179; <em>Townsend Trust, </em><a href="/pa/349/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="349 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="458782" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0162-01">349 Pa. 162</a>, 169, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20A.2d%20438" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="36 A.2d 438">36 A. 2d 438</a>, 441; <em>Reinecke v.

That the trustees were to be entitled to compensation for their services is also a customary provision; certainly they would not have been allowed to abuse that privilege and in fact they received no compensation at all. Nor is there any justification for the view taken by the Commonwealth of the provision that each of the beneficiaries was to have a one-third interest “the value of which may be diminished or increased in accordance with the terms and- provisions” of the trust instrument, or that distribution might be made in kind of “such property as may then [at the termination of the trust] remain in the trust estate”. As the result of sales, re-investments, and the ordinary fluctuations in the value of securities, it was naturally contemplated that the value of the trust assets might vary from time to time and thus be greater or less at the time of distribution than when the trust was originally created; as a matter of fact that value was largely increased in that interval as is evidenced by the appraisal made by the tax authorities. These provisions cannot, by the. widest stretch of judicial interpretation, be held to mean that the trustees were to be allowed to diminish the value of the interests of the beneficiaries by actually removing assets from the trust.</p>
