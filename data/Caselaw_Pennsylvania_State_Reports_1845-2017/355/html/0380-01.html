    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[193,879,1152,1132]]]'>Luther A. Harr was treasurer of the City and County of Philadelphia from January 3, 1938, to January 5, 1942. Instead of paying all fees into the treasury, he retained $3,500 to pay the cost of the surety bond which the law required him to give as a condition of holding his office. The learned court below held that he. must return this sum to the county treasury. In support of his appeal, he contends <em>First: </em>that the Act of May 13, 1925, P. L. 656,16 P.S. 3071, amending section 42 of the Act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 537, designating county treasurers as “agents of the Commonwealth,” allowed him to retain, in the words of his brief, “(a) an amount equal to 20% of his salary; (b) the amount of the bond premiums; (c) expenses of collection of monies, including compensation to necessary employes.” <em>Second, </em>that the Act of 1937 modified the Act of 1925 only by withdrawing the element (a) which he had designated as “an amount equal to 20% of his salary,” leaving in effect the elements (b) and (c) and therefore entitling him to withhold from the county treasury the amount which he paid to his surety.</p>

Section 5 of Article XIV provides: “The compensation of the county officers shall be regulated by law, and all county officers who are or may be salaried shall pay all fees which they may be authorized to receive, into the treasury of the <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>county or State, as may be directed by law. In [Philadelphia .County] all county officers shall be paid by salary . . As required by that provision, the legislature promptly passed the regulating Act of March 31, 1876, P. L. 13, 16 P.S. 2231, directing in section 1 that “all fees” received by county officers “shall belong to the county . . .; and none of the said officers shall receive for his own use, or for any use or purpose whatever except for the use of the proper county or for the state, as the case may be, any fees for any official services whatsoever.” Section 15,16 P.S. 2240, provided that their “salaries . . . shall be in lieu of all or any moneys, fees, perquisites, or mileage which are now or may hereafter be received by any officer named in this act; and all said moneys . . . received by any of them as compensation, fees or perquisites, from any source whatever, shall in all cases belong to the county, and shall be paid into the treasury, (except where required to be paid to the state) . . .”</p>

So long as county officers were authorized to act as agents for the Commonwealth, (prior to the Act of 1937) they were authorized to receive such compensation as the state might provide, but once the state agency was abolished, as it was by the Act of 1937, the right to the agent’s compensation ceased, even though they performed the same work for the Commonwealth thereafter.</p>
