What was said in that case (p. 385 and p. 390) applies equally to the present situation: ‘The object in this <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>[the incorporation of the state council of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics] was not to sever the relations of the state council with the rest of the order but for certain purposes, to give it legal personality. In other words, the state council was left just as it was before incorporation except that it was endowed with corporate powers . . . The act [incorporating the state council] did not create a new society, nor was it the foundation of a new organization. It simply gave corporate form to an unincorporated branch of a society already in existence. It was not intended to create a new society with a purpose different from that of the old order, but, on the other hand, the manifest intention was to preserve the old order, and to make the incorporated branch an integral part of it.’ To the same effect is Schriner v. Sachs, <a href="/pa/253/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="253 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="1024028" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0611-01">253 Pa. 611</a>, 616.”</p>

The Grand Lodge refused to receive back the charter, as proposed by the subordinate lodge, and on October 2, 1945, filed this bill in equity against the defendant alleging the relationship of the three corporations among <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>themselves and referring to their respective constitutions and laws. Among other averments, plaintiff set forth that by defendant’s conduct “the persons, who were members thereof at the time of its adoption, [of the resolution of March 12, 1945] lost their status as members of a subordinate lodge of the Order of Knights of Pythias, unless they apply for membership in some other subordinate lodge of the said Order, or upon refusal of admission by such lodge, maintain their status as members in a state lodge, known as Excelsior Lodge No. 1 Knights of Pythias.</p>

The important issue is whether the plaintiff or the defendant shall administer a fund of $17,089.06 in defendant’s treasury, representing the proceeds and increment of the sick and death benefit collections received and held for the relief of defendant’s members as provided in its by-laws.</p>

Chapter XIV of the Grand Constitution and Statutes of the plaintiff provides in sec. 249, entitled “Funds”: “The manner in which the funds of a subordinate lodge shall be disposed of, and the purposes to which they shall be applied, are matters entirely within the discretion of the lodge, except that such funds shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with the laws, principles and purposes of the Order, and shall not be partitioned or divided among the members of the lodgé; and that, in case the lodge from any cause shall cease to exist, its funds shall revert to the Grand Lodge.” We understand that all sums annually required to be paid by defendant to plaintiff have been paid.</p>

The law furnishes a remedy for maladministration. The provision in section 249 that “in case the lodge from any cause shall cease to exist, its funds shall revert to the Grand Lodge” is not applicable in the circumstances presented by the record.</p>
