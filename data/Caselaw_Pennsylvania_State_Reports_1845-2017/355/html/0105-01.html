Fisher, appellant, filed this petition for a declaratory judgment to detérmine the interest of its ward in the estate of Edna H. Fisher, deceased. Paragraph “Second” <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>of her will gave her entire estate to her sister, Mary E. Fisher, if she survived testatrix. Paragraph “Fifth”, standing alone, devised real estate situate at 405 North McKean Street to Richard C. Fisher. The court below construed paragraph “Fifth” in conjunction with paragraphs “Third” and “Fourth” and held them to be conditioned upon the death of Mary E. Fisher, during the lifetime of testatrix. This appeal followed.</p>

Fisher, jointly owned certain real estate situate at 405 North McKean Street, Butler, Pennsylvania. Paragraph “Second” of her will provided: “I will, devise and bequeath unto my sister Mary E. Fisher should she survive me, all of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate, to be hers absolutely.” Paragraph “Fifth” provided: “I will, devise and bequeath to my brother Richard C. Fisher all of my interest and claim in house and lot situate No. 405 North McKean Street, Butler, Pennsylvania, to be his absolutely.” Mary E. Fisher died testate March 13, 1945, and by her will devised all her real estate to G. Clayton Critchlow, in trust for certain uses. Critchlow now claims the entire interest in the said real estate.</p>
