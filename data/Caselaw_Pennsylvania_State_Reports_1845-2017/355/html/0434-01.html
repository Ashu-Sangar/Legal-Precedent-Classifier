Suit was brought upon compliance and payment bonds, given to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in which Stewart Contracting Com<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>pany was principal and appellees were sureties. This appeal is from the decree of the court below sustaining affidavits of defense raising questions of law filed by both appellees challenging their liability under the respective bonds, and entry of judgment in their favor.</p>
    <p id="b462-4" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[215,565,1151,936]]]'>Stewart Contracting Company and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania entered into a contract for the improvement of a certain section of highway and bridges.

A reading of the bonds clearly shows that the parties never intended to so consider appellant. The court below aptly said: “The phrase Tor service rendered by public utilities’ was obviously intended to cover facilities such as electricity, gas and telephones supplied by public utilities.” This Court said, in <em>City of Pittsburgh v. Parkview Construction Company, </em>supra, “There is an abundance of authority to the effect that the payment of premiums for insurance policies does not fall within the obligation of such a bond.”</p>
