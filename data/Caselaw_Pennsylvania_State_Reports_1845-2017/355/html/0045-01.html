      <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>It is a general act to be applied by all courts having jurisdiction over fiduciaries. In the Statutory Construction Act of May 28,1937, P. L. 1019, fiduciary is defined in section 101 ^42) as follows: “(42) ‘Fiduciary,’ an executor, administrator, guardian, committee, receiver, trustee, assignee for the benefit of creditors, and any other person, association, partnership, or corporation, acting in any similar capacity.” It came up for construction in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County and the court held the act unconstitutional. The proceeding Avas an ancillary executor’s petition for an order authorizing private sale of his decedent’s real estate for the payment of debts pursuant to section 16 of the Fiduciaries’ Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, 20 PS 321. The petition averred that Harry G. Austin “has made a bid of $25,000 cash for the . . . property, and . . . signed . . . Articles . . . for the purchase of same, and that the said price offered is better than can be obtained at public sale.” The court fixed a day for hearing and notice was given that the petition would be heard on the day fixed “when higher offers will be considered and exceptions or objections to the proposed sale will be heard.”</p>

J. Carroll and C. A. Waite for $27,850.00, secured by a certified check, whereupon the ancillary executor was directed to make a deed for the property described in the petition. After the sale was ordered and before delivery of the deed to Carroll and Waite a petition was presented on October 10, 1945 by Harry G. Austin, the first bidder, praying for the revocation of the order of September 26, 1945 and, after notice to Carroll and Waite, upon deposit of a cashier’s check by Austin, the previous order of sale was revoked and a new order of sale was made to Austin [for $30,-000.00] on the 10th day of October, 1945.” Messrs. Carroll and Waite excepted to this action and contended that the order of the court was in conflict with the Act of 1945. After hearing on the exceptions, the court dismissed them and held the Act unconstitutional on the ground that it limited or restricted supervisory power <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>that had been exercised by the orphans’ court prior to the effective date of the present Constitution, and that such legislation was prohibited by Article V, section 22, of the Constitution.

The Act of 1945 changed the substantive law. It provided that in certain circumstances the court could not set aside its approval after it was once given. The Act deals with two classes of contracts: (1) those not requiring court approval and <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>(2) those requiring it.

No change was made for counties in which the orphans’ court proceedings remained in the charge of the common pleas judges. By section 31 of the Schedule, adopted with the Constitution, the people directed that “The General Assembly at its first session, or as soon as may be after the adoption of this Constitution, shall pass such laws as may be necessary to carry the same into full force and effect.” Pursuant thereto, the legislature passed the Act approved May 19, 1874, P.

That act withdrew from the judges of the Court of Common Pleas of these respective counties the right to exercise the power of an Orphans’ Court, and vested these powers in an independent and exclusive jurisdiction. We think it would not have been competent for the legislature, by a repeal of this act, to defeat and set aside the constitutional tribunals thus established; for these courts, although put into actual operation by the legislature, were created by and now exist under the authority of the constitution itself. Having done what the constitution required, it would not have been in the power of the legislature wholly to undo it. The constitution itself set up this system of separate Orphans’ Courts, and it is for the legislature to regulate and maintain, not to destroy it. The constitution is the paramount law; it is above legislatures and courts; what is therein ordained and established cannot be set aside by a simple act of legislation.” Except to provide for separate orphans’ courts, as specified, section 22 made no other changes in the jurisdiction and powers of the orphans’ courts as administered by judges of the courts of common pleas prior to January 1, 1874.</p>

The words “all the jurisdiction and powers now vested,” that is, jurisdiction and powers that were vested in all orphans’ courts at that time, were used to describe the jurisdiction and powers to be exercised by the new orphans’ courts. In other words, all the orphans’ courts, new and old, should have the same jurisdiction and exercise the same powers all of which had been declared by statute. The uniformity provision [quoted later] of the same judiciary article requires that all orphans’ courts exercise the same powers. In 1873, when the Constitution was adopted, the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court had been for many years set forth in section 19 of the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, 792. That section provided: “The jurisdiction of the several orphans’ courts shall extend to and embrace — I. . . . IV. The sale of real estates of decedents; . . . VIII. All cases within their respective counties, wherein executors, administrators, guardians or trustees, may be possessed of, or are in any way accountable for, any real or personal estate of a decedent. And such jurisdiction shall be exercised under the limitations, and in the same manner provided by law.” The jurisdiction over each of the classes of subjects named was expressly conditioned on legislative regulation and was not absolute and un<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>changeable. The Act of 1836 specified what were the classes of jurisdiction which the constitution identified by the words “now vested” as the jurisdiction and powers to be exercised by the separate orphans’ courts when established by the legislation necessary to execute, the constitutional direction. As the Act of 1836 vested the jurisdiction expressly subject to regulation by the legislature, the power to regulate of course remained with the legislature. The people, in adopting the constitution, understanding the words in their popular sense, did not intend that the separate orphans’ courts should have different and greater powers than the existing orphans’ courts whose powers, it is conceded, were subject to subsequent limitation. This conclusion is put beyond doubt by Article V, section 26. “All laws relating to courts shall be general and of uniform operation, and the organization, jurisdiction and powers of all courts of the same class or grade, so far as regulated by law, and the force and effect of the process and judgments of such courts, shall be uniform; and the General Assembly is hereby prohibited from creating other courts to exercise the powers vested by this Constitution in the judges of the courts of common pleas and orphans’ courts.” While the orphans’ court is a constitutional court which cannot be abolished by the legislature, it is not a common law court;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> it is a court of limited powers conferred by statutes: <em>Watson’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/314/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="314 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="1154694" data-case-paths="/pa/314/0179-01">314 Pa. 179</a>, 181, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.%20254" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="170 A. 254">170 A. 254</a>. What was originally section 19 of the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, conferring jurisdiction and powers on the orphans’ court was revised and supplemented by the Orphans’ Court Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 363, 20 PS 2082, as amended. In view of the erroneous conclusion of the court below that section 22 of Article Y of the constitution prohibits the limitation of powers exercised by the orphans’ court prior to 1874, it may be of interest to refer to some of the limitations of such powers enacted <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>since section 22 was adopted which show an accepted constitutional interpretation wholly inconsistent with the conclusion reached by the court below. The Orphans’ Court Act of 1917, P. L. 363, section 18 (a) (5), 20 PS 2376, omits the power to issue writs of vend. ex. against real property although the power had existed since April 21, 1846, P. L. 430. Section 59 (e) of the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, P. L. 447, 20 PS 1025, restricted the power to appoint guardians for the estates of non-resident minors on petition of minors under 14 though the power had formerly existed under section 44 of the Act of April 25, 1850, P. L. 569. Section 41 (a) of the Fiduciaries Act, supra, 20 PS 801, 804, 805, changed the law by authorizing a fiduciary to make legal investments without prior approval of the court, though section 14 of the Act of March 29, 1832, P. L. 190, had authorized such application before investment. The Act of 1713, 1 Sm. L. 81, section 13, authorized the court to determine “The true intent and meaning of the testators” while the Act of July 9,1897, P. L. 213, limited that power by requiring certain words to be given a specified construction. The Fiduciaries Act, in section 59 (c), 20 PS 1023, prohibited the appointment of a trustee as guardian of a minor interested in the estate administered by the trustee although prior thereto the only limitation in that respect under the Act of March 29, 1832, P. L. 190, section 6, prohibited his appointment as executor or administrator. Section 59 (d), 20 PS 1024, deprived the court of power to appoint the father or the mother of a minor as guardian of the minor’s estate. It will be observed that most of those limitations were made in statutes drawn by the commissioners appointed to revise the Orphans’ Court and Fiduciaries Acts.</p>

If the Act of 1945 is a valid exercise of legislative power, as the majority holds, then the orphans’ courts have been rendered impotent to protect their wards in such cases. Under the Act, any agreement made by an incompetent or inexperienced fiduciary with power of sale will be enforceable against the estate, despite gross inadequacy of consideration, except in <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>tlie infrequent case where fraud, accident or mistake can be proved. In the present case, where the fiduciary was not acting under a power, application of the Act results in a loss to the beneficiaries of $2,160 and a corresponding gain to the vendee. Had he been acting nnder a power, the original agreement fixing the purchase price at $25,000 would have bound the estate irrevocably, and the loss to the beneficiaries would have been increased to $5,000. The court would be equally powerless to interfere, in the supposed case of a fiduciary acting under a power, if the original agreement had called for a purchase price of $1,000, with a resulting loss to the estate of $29,000. This Act goes far beyond the suggestion of the concurring Justices in <em>Kane v.

The court flatly rejected the only fiduciary contract ever introduced in this proceeding.

IV, of the Act of June 16,1836, which was carried into the Orphans’ Court Act of 1917 as Sec. 9, cl. (f). Consequently, when the Act of 1945 is construed so as to embrace a fiduciary’s contract for a private sale of a decedent’s real estate for the payment of his,debts, yet necessarily subject to due proceedings in an orphans’ court, then the Act is additionally unconstitutional in that it works an amendment of extant orphans’ court statute law without so forecasting in its title and without specifying the amendment in its body as required, respectively, by Art. Ill, sections 3 and 6, of the Constitution.</p>

The law with respect to the power of the orphans’ courts over fiduciaries even to the extent of reviewing, setting aside and, if necessary, ordering a resale “of real estate made under a testamentary power” <em>(Dundas’s Appeal, </em><a href="/whart/1/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="1 Whart. 96" data-case-ids="1829053" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0096-01">supra, p. 331</a>) was likewise an interpretation of the statutory definition of <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>the orphans’ court powers in such regard as contained in section 19 of the Act of June 16,1836, which section 9 of the Orphans’ Court Act of 1917 carried forward.

III, sections 3 and 6, of the Constitution, the Act of 1945 is now judicially accredited as an amendment of cognate prior statute law without so much as a reference in the title of the Act to its amendatory intent or the slightest intimation in the body of the Act of any amendment therein contained.</p>
    <p id="b89-4" data-blocks='[["BL_89.5",89,[210,1066,1149,1109]]]'>The majority opinion holds that the authorities show the Act of 1945 is not in conflict with Article Y, section 1, citing four decisions. But not one of these cases involved an Act comparable in terms or effect with the legislation now before us. The basic principle of the decisions referred to is that the Constitution having granted to the legislature, by section 1 of Article V, the power to create from time to time courts other than those enumerated, nothing contained in the subsequent sections of that article is sufficient to deprive the legislature of the power to create courts of a different class or grade, and to transfer to the courts so created some of the jurisdiction of the courts enumerated, or vest in them a limited concurrent jurisdiction: <em>Gerlach v. Moore, </em><a href="/pa/243/0603-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="243 Pa. 603" data-case-ids="1001618" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0603-01">243 Pa. 603</a>, 609, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20A.%20399" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="90 A. 399">90 A. 399</a>. Here neither the power to create “such other courts as the General Assembly may from time to time establish”, expressly conferred in the first section of the judiciary article, nor the power to vest some part of the existing judicial powers in “such other courts,” is in any way involved.</p>
