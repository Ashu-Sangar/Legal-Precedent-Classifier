The stock was not registered in the Era Company’s name, but was registered in the name of C. A. England and Company. Neither knowledge nor notice of claim of such beneficial ownership in Era was shown to have been possessed by or given to the coal company. A merger was proposed of the coal company with the Consolidation Coal Company under the Business Corporation Act of 1933, supra. A meeting of stockholders was fixed for July 24, 1945, to vote upon the proposal. On July 13,1945, the coal company received the following letter:</p>

At the meeting it was used to vote 250 shares <em>against </em>the merger. The merger was approved by a majority of the stockholders and became <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>effective. On or about December 10,1945, C. A. England and Company made demand for tbe payment of tbe fair value of 250 shares of stock. Era Company filed its petition for appointment of appraisers on January 22,1946, to which an answer was filed, issue joined and hearing had. In a well considered opinion by Judge Patterson the court below decided that appellant was not a registered stockholder entitled to relief within the terms of the act. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b248-4" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[227,760,1151,1557]]]'>The learned counsel for appellant concedes that under the act it is the <em>registered owner </em>who must act, but earnestly maintains that it was the registered owner who was acting, <em>“through his agent.” </em>With this we do not agree. A letter from a New York bank stated that an <em>undisclosed </em>client held 250 shares of the coal company stock and wished to vote against the merger; that the certificates are registered “in the name of [the bank’s] nominee” and under separate cover the bank was forwarding a proxy to vote against the merger. Such a letter cannot be construed as a written objection <em>from the registered owner. </em>What authority did a stranger to the corporation have to declare that its undisclosed client was the true owner of the shares? The corporation was under no duty to ignore its stock registry and pass upon the equitable ownership of the shares. An objection by an alleged agent of an undisclosed principal cannot be regarded as that made by the <em>registered owner. </em>The corporation properly ignored such an irregular objection. The petition by the alleged beneficial owner for an appraisement and payment of fair value, likewise is not the act of the <em>registered owner </em>as required by the act. The decree of the court below, for the reasons therein cited, properly dismissed the petition because it failed to comply with the provisions of section 908 of the Business Corporation Law of 1933, as amended.
