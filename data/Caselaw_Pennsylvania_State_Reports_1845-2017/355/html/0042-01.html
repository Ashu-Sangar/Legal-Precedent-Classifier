Liebman appealed to the court of common pleas from the decision of the Board of Revision of Taxes <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>refusing to reduce the 1944 tax assessment upon the Crozer office building situate at 1420-22 Chestnut Street in the City of Philadelphia. The court below found as a fact that the actual market value was $831,000, the value originally placed upon the premises by the assessor, and dismissed the appeal.</p>

Accordingly, the assessor reduced his value to $831,000. The record further disclosed that the ground values were uniform and comparable in this block.</p>

Solis-Cohen, Jr., a real estate expert, who testified that the fair market value of the property at the time the assessment was made was $400,000. In arriving at this valuation the witness took into consideration the sale of the property in December, 1942, for $310,000, the inability to produce sufficient income from rentals to meet operating expenses, evidenced by the $9,000 annual loss, and other sales of surrounding properties. He said that the building, since it could not be rented at a profit, had no market value. Frank W. Kidd, the City’s real estate expert, placed the market value of the land at $736,000 and that of the building at $140,000. While the appellant’s expert witness testified that the building had no market value, it was con<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>ceded at the oral argument the building was kept insured for $300,000.

The inability to make a profit as well as the price obtained at a bona fide sale are factors to be considered by the court. They are not, however, controlling. With regard to the latter, the Act of June 27, 1939, P.L. 1199, section 13, 53 P.S. 4805.13, provides: “In determining the actual value of property, the price at which the same would separately bona fide sell shall be considered but shall not be controlling.” Appellant’s present objection is inconsistent with his failure to appeal the 1943 assessment.</p>

I figure that the land there is worth $11,000 a front foot for a hundred foot depth. I used the merge point in there because I used a $2,000 base for the rear street. On using the merge point I got 195 feet which is allocated to the front of the building, and 35 feet that is allocated to Sansom Street”: Notes of testimony, p. 18-a.</p>
