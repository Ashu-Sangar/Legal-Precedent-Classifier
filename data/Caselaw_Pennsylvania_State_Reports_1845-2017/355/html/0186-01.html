Lohr, appellant in Appeal No. 99, filed tbeir respective petitions in the court below pursuant to the provisions of the Act of 1925, P. L. 23, 12 P.S. 672, to set aside extra-county service upon them, made pursuant to an order of court in conformity with Equity Rule 27. Alfred Slater, receiver of Kennerly Coal and Coke Company, appellee, filed a Bill in Equity against numerous defendants, two of whom are appellants, praying that a mortgage upon land forming a part of the assets of the company be foreclosed free and clear of any interest which appellants might have, together with S. H. Cauffiel, Trustee, by reason of their purchase of respective tracts of the real estate at a tax sale, and to secure a conveyance by the appellants to appellee of all their right, title, and interest in the aforesaid land. The court below held that the proceeding, being ancillary and dependent upon its action appointing the receiver in 1925, was within the provisions of the Act of 1859, P.L. 387, 12 P.S. 1254, the Act of 1921, P.L. 899, 12 P.S. 302, or the inherent power of the court, and service was, therefore, properly made.</p>

H. Cauffiel, trustee for bondholders, praying for the appointment of a receiver. Granting of the prayer was affirmed by this Court in <em>Franklin National Bank et al. v. Kennerly Coal &amp; Coke </em>Co., <a href="/pa/300/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="300 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="1125957" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0479-01">300 Pa. 479</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.%20902" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="150 A. 902">150 A. 902</a>. The receiAer was directed to take immediate possession of all property of the said company. The sole assets of the company consisted of certain tracts of land and seams of coal in place underlying other tracts of land situate in Somerset County. On August 14, 1905, said company executed and delivered to S. H. Cauffiel, as trustee for <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>bondholders, a mortgage to secure payment of mortgage bonds. Said bonds, both as to principal and interest, are in default. The income received from the assets and amounts realized from sale of a portion thereof, were insufficient to pay the annually assessed county, road and school taxes. Tax sales were made by the County Treasurer and County Commissioners of Somerset County. No redemption has been effected by the receiver. Appellants, R. W. Lohr, Samuel Hammer, and John Cauffiel, as purchasers, claim ownership of, or an interest in, certain tracts of land thus sold for taxes. Their interests in specific tracts are fully set forth in the pending Bill of Complaint. The Bill avers that necessary and proper steps were not taken to divest the land of the lien of said mortgage and that the same was not divested by the tax sales.</p>
    <p id="b215-3" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[221,1165,1148,482]]]'>The relief prayed for in the Bill was: (1) that the 1905 mortgage be foreclosed, and that the land, coal in place and all property of said company be sold by petitioners subject to the approval of the court, free, clear, and divested of the lien of said mortgage, and (2) that appellants be required to convey to Kennerly Coal and Coke Company all right, title, and interest which they might have acquired in and to the land by the said tax sales.</p>

When a court has by lawful proceedings taken possession of specific property, it has during that possession and as incident thereto jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions respecting the title, possession, and control thereof, and courts of coordinate jurisdiction are powerless to render any judgment or decree that will invade or disturb the possession of the property while it is in the custody of the court which has thus first acquired it. . . .” All assets of the company passed at once <em>in gremio legis </em>and could not be interfered with by the process of any other court: <em>Tenth National Bank v.

There is here involved an equity receivership appointed by the court below. By virtue of the appointment of the receivers, the court below became the only court which acquired jurisdiction over them and the assets to be administered from the moment of appointment.
