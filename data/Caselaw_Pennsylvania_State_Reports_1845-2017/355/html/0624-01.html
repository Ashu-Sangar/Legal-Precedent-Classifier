Johnson, Jr., to recover for personal injuries sustained when an automobile owned by the former and operated by the latter collided with an auto-bile owned and operated by Eugene W. Yost, in which she was riding as a passenger. Yost was brought upon the record as additional defendant in this action and a separate action was instituted by the Johnsons against Yost for personal injuries and property damage, in which action Yost filed a counterclaim.</p>

      <em>Samuels </em>and <em>Schweitzer </em>cases filed motions for a new trial which the court below granted as to all defendants. Yost also moved for a new trial in the action brought against him by the Johnsons, but the motion was later withdrawn and judgment on the verdict against him has since been paid and satisfied. Karl C. Johnson, Sr. and Karl C. Johnson, Jr. have appealed from the granting of a new trial as to them.</p>
    <p id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[214,718,1149,369]]]'>Appellants state: “The only question raised by these appeals is a legal one, namely, is the judgment in <em>Johnson v. Yost, </em>in favor of the Johnsons, determinative of their liability arising out of this accident.” Clearly <em>that </em>judgment, unappealed from, is determinative of their liability in that action. It is not, however, determinative of their liability in <em>this </em>action.</p>

Yost </em>is <em>res judicata </em>as to their negligence here, <em>Barker v. Barrett, </em><a href="/pa-super/145/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="145 Pa.

That case involved a collision between an automobile owned by Felker and another owned by Barrett and driven by Barchfield. Barrett instituted an action against Felker and a second action was brought by Barker, a passenger in the Felker automobile, against Barrett and Barchfield jointly. In the latter action Felker was brought in as additional defendant. Both actions were tried together, resulting in a verdict for Barrett in his action against Felker, and a verdict for defendants in the action brought by Barker, the injured passenger. Barker was granted a new trial as to the additional defendant, Felker, but was refused a new trial as to original defendants, Barrett and Barchfield, on the ground that the judgment on the verdict in the case of <em>Barrett v. Felker </em>was <em>res judicata </em>as to Felker’s negligence. On appeal by Felker from the order granting a new trial as to her only, the appeal was dismissed for the principal reason that the judgment on the verdict in favor of <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>original defendants, nnappealed from by either plaintiff or the additional defendant, would necessarily be <em>res judicata </em>as to them on any retrial of the case. On the correctness of the trial court’s reason for refusing a new trial as to original defendants, however, the Superior Court, opinion by Kellek, P. J., had this to say (p. 25) : “The court may have erred in its opinion in holding that the verdict in the case of <em>Barrett v. F ether, </em>which was tried at the same time, and is now satisfied, was <em>res judicata </em>as to Felker’s negligence in this action <em>(Woodburn v. Penna. R. R.

An order granting a new trial as to both defendants was reversed as to McCombs on appeal, because the opinion of the court below disclosed that except for the one reason assigned, which had to do solely with the issue between plaintiff and Sheppard, and did not involve the consideration of any oral or other evidence, a new trial would not have been granted as to McCombs. Here the opinion of the court below does not disclose that it would have refused to grant a new trial as to either or all of the defendants but for reasons distinctly set forth, not involving the consideration of oral evidence, and, consequently, no appeal lies: <em>Fitzpatrick v. Sheppard, </em>supra, 241; <em>Class and Nachod Brewing Co. v.

They were clearly entitled <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>to a verdict against Yost, against the Johnsons, or against both. Justice demands that the passenger plaintiffs be granted a new trial against all the defendants.” The court below having concluded that justice requires a new trial as to all the defendants, its order to that effect will not be disturbed, in accordance with our usual practice in such cases: <em>Brogan v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/346/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="346 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="1216409" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0208-01">346 Pa. 208</a>, 210, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%20671" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="29 A.2d 671">29 A.2d 671</a>.</p>
    <p id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.5",654,[230,712,1149,538]]]'>Appellants also complain that the order granting a new trial directed that this case be tried separately from the action brought by the Schweitzers. This was done for the reason, as stated in the opinion written by the trial judge, that “The trial of these cases has shown that the issues are too numerous and complicated to be tried together.” This was a matter for the discretion of the court below, not reviewable on appeal.
