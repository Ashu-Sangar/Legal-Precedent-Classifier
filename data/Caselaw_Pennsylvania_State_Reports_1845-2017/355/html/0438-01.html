The words to be construed are: “I invest my Executors and Trustees with full power, authority and discretion as to the purchase, sale and investment of all principal of my estate.”</p>
    <p id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.5",466,[200,600,1149,814]]]'>The learned auditing judge decided that no discretion Avas granted. He ruled that the clause was equivocal in meaning and hence no such poAver existed. The account AA’as that of the executor. The residuary balance was awarded to the trustees. The balance included non-legals to the extent of approximately $200,000. Apparently all securities had been decedent owned. No loss had been incurred to the date of the accounting. No surcharge was sought or decreed. The ruling excepted to is: “If the Executor as trustee takes over in kind the investments as set forth in the account, he is directed to dispose of the non-legals Avithin a reasonable time, and to make investments in conformity with the Avill as here construed.” That, in substance, is a direction to convert.</p>

    <p id="b467-7" data-blocks='[["BL_467.7",467,[208,1219,1147,606]]]'>In <em>Hale Estate, </em>supra, the words were (p. 177) : to <em>"be invested . . . in good sound securities.” </em>This language was held by this Court to be equivocal and not to give the trustee any discretion in the matter of investments. Mr. Justice Drew, in discussing <em>Greenawalt’s Estate, </em>supra, and <em>Detre’s Estate, </em>supra, said (p. 179) : “In Greenawalt’s Estate, supra, the extensive discretionary power given to the trustees was interpreted to permit investment in non-legals.

He said that in the <em>Detre </em>case there was included an exemption from liability resulting from the exercise of discretion. We cannot adopt such a distinction. If discretion be conferred, it follows that liability could not attach for doing what was authorized. The learned auditing judge analyzed the language and ruled that it was equivocal. He said that <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>grant of discretion was susceptible of different meanings; it “may have meant determination (a) <em>whether </em>to buy or sell, or (b) <em>when </em>to buy or sell and not <em>necessarily </em>(c) <em>what </em>to buy or sell” (italics ours). We cannot adopt the distinction. If the fiduciaries were given the power to buy, sell and <em>invest, </em>it necessarily follows that such discretion extends to and includes <em>what </em>securities are to be bought, sold, invested in, or retained. If the fiduciaries were held to be limited merely to the <em>purchase </em>and <em>sale </em>of legal investments, the words of the clause would be superfluous. The fiduciaries already possessed that authority under the law.</p>
