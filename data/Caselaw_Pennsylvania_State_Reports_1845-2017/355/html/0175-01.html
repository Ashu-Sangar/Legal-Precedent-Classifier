Three children were born of this marriage. In the latter part of 1917, Joseph E. Pierce, appellee, then 17 years of age, began boarding at the home of the Martins. Appellant at this time was 29 years of age. Shortly thereafter, appellant and appellee began a meretricious relationship. Roy Martin left appellant about August 1, 1918, and his whereabouts remained unknown to either party for many years.

She falsely stated at that time that she had been married only once and that her husband had died in 1923. She had no information regarding his death, nor had there been any false rumor of his death. The only evidence in that regard was that she had been interested in having a support order complied with and had inquired of the Erie police whether they knew the whereabouts of Roy Martin. She was informed they did not. Subsequent to said ceremony, the parties to this action resided at divers places in Westmoreland County; purchased the tract of land in question on October 2,1936, as husband and wife, and for the entire period each held out the other as his or her spouse.</p>

Pierce thereupon consulted his attorney, left appellant, and filed this Bill in Equity for partition and for an accounting. Appellant testified that on March 23,1931, Pierce returned home from a trip to Erie about 1:30 A.M. and informed her that he had learned of the invalidity of their marriage of 1925, and thereupon said, “I will take you for my wife,” to which she replied, “If that is the case, I will take you for my husband.” The court disbelieved her testimony regarding the conversation, accepted appellee’s denial thereof, concluded that no valid- common law marriage had been effected, and directed partition, but refused an accounting.</p>

No new marriage contract was entered into after the death of said husband. The court below held that there was no common law marriage. The Superior Court reversed, holding that subsequent cohabitation and reputation constituted sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of a continued meretricious relation. The majority opinion is based upon numerous presumptions of innocence, and a presumption that the husband had secured a divorce prior to the putative marriage. Judge Keller, in a dissenting opinion, stated: “No other case in Pennsylvania, which I have been able to find, holds that a wedding ceremony, which was void because one of the parties was already married at the time it was performed, became a legal marriage, after the removal of the original bar or obstacle, by mere cohabitation and reputation and without a new contract of marriage, <em>where the parties knew of the invalidity of their original contract of marriage </em>and of the removal of the bar to their being legally married.” This later statement represents the true rule in Pennsylvania and is controlling here.
