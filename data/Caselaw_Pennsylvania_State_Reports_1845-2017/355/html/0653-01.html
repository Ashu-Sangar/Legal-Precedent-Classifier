    <p id="b680-4" data-blocks='[["BL_680.8",680,[233,389,1150,913]]]'>This appeal must be remitted to the Superior Court. In an action of assumpsit to recover damages for breach of an implied warranty of quality and fitness of a hydraulic press capable of exerting nine thousand tons of pressure, plaintiff claimed damages in the sum of $57,270. Defendant in its affidavit of defense pleaded a set-off and counterclaim for the sum of $6,039.89, with certain interest. The case was tried by a judge without a jury. The judge found against the plaintiff on its claim for $65,856.06 and found in favor of the defendant on that portion of its counterclaim for the expenses of its engineer, $939.89, in installing new columns and nuts. All of plaintiff’s exceptions were subsequently dismissed by a three-judge reviewing court and judgment was entered in favor of the defendant for its counterclaim of $939.89, in which damages were assessed in the amount of $1,291.05.</p>

L. 212, sec. 7; as amended by the Act of May 5, 1899, P. L. 248, sec. 1; and the Act of March 2, 1923, P. L. 3, No. 2, sec. 1, 17 PS 181 and 184. That Act, as amended, provides that “if also the amount or value thereof really in controversy be not greater than twenty-five hundred dollars, exclusive of costs, and if also the action be not brought, authorized, or defended by the Attorney General in his official capacity”, the jurisdiction of the Superior Court shall be “exclusive and final.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

In any suit, distribution or other proceeding in the common pleas or orphans’ court, if the plaintiff or claimant recovers damages either for a tort or for a breach of contract, the amount of the judgment, decree or award shall be conclusive proof of the amount really in controversy, but if he recovers nothing the amount really in controversy shall.be determined by the amount of damages claimed in the statement of claim, or in the declaration.”</p>

L. 212, as amended by Section 4 of the Act of May 5, 1899, P. L. 248, conclusively determines the amount in controversy for the purpose of determining jurisdiction of the appeals, and that in such a case where the amount of the award is less than $2,500.00 the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to pass upon the merits of the appeal and the Supreme Court will on its own motion, remit the appeal to the Superior Court.
