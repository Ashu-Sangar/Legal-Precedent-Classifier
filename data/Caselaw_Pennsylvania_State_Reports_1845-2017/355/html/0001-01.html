Keasbey and Doctor Richard V. Mattison determined to sever their business relationship. They were associated together in Keasbey &amp; Mattison Company, a corporation, in which each was the owner of 50% of the capital stock. Mattison purchased Keasbey’s shares for the sum of $3,900,000 of -which $750,000 was paid in cash, and the balance $3,150,000 by the delivery of Mattison’s bond. The bond was secured by the deposit in escrow of 10,000 shares of each of the preferred and common stock, the entire outstanding shares of the Keasbey &amp; Mattison Company, representing the one-half interest then owned by Mattison and the one-half interest which he was purchasing from Keasbey. The bond for $3,150,000 was dated January 11, 1929, and called for six payments of $500,000 on January 25 of each year thereafter, and the final payment of $150,000 on January 25, 1936, all with interest at 6%.</p>

The court en banc being of the opinion that before the relative rights of the life tenant and the remaindermen under the trust inter vivos could be determined, it should be made certain that the total proceeds received from the sale of the stock of Keasbey &amp; Mattison Company and as liquidating dividends from Mattison Estates, Inc. had been properly divided between the trust inter vivos and the testamentary trust, and that the former trust had received all moneys to which it was entitled. The court said that this matter could be determined only in the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County where the account of the testamentary trustee was then pending because, while the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County could surcharge the trustee under the deed for any excess improperly paid to the testamentary trust, the Montgomery County Orphans’ Court alone could make the necessary order on the testamentary trustee if it found that some of the proceeds in question allocated to that trust should be returned to the trust inter vivos. The court further said: “We have considerable doubt concerning the ae<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>countant’s action in ignoring the right of the inter vivos trust to apportionment with respect to ‘interest’ on the entire obligation and in accepting the division solely on the basis of the principal claims ... As a matter of procedure ... it seems unwise and impractical to consider surcharging a fiduciary for failure to prosecute a legal claim, when proceedings involving the claim itself are pending before a court of competent jurisdiction which can adjudicate all phases of the question in dispute. Since the excess, or overpayment, if any, is in the testamentary trust, for which an account is presently pending in Montgomery County, a majority of the Court is of opinion that we should suspend confirmation of the adjudication and direct the trustee of the trust inter vivos to present a claim against the testamentary trustee for the alleged excess or overpayment.” For that reason, the learned court did not pass upon the merits of the adjudication, but dismissed all exceptions filed “pro forma”. From the order thus made the executor of the estate of the deceased life tenant appealed to this Court, and we quashed that appeal, on the ground that no appeal would lie from an order suspending proceedings for a temporary period <em>(Keasbey’s Trust Estate, </em><a href="/pa/342/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="342 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1206989" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0439-01">342 Pa. 439</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20A.2d%20281" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="20 A.2d 281">20 A. 2d 281</a>).</p>

These exceptions and the claim of the trustee raise the same question that there was an overpayment to the testamentary trust. The learned auditing judge in the Orphans’ Court <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>of Montgomery County held that the division of the proceeds as made by the trustee between the testamentary trust and the inter vivos trust was proper, and, therefore, he dismissed all exceptions and rejected the claim of the trustee of the inter vivos trust. This action was confirmed absolutely by the court en banc.</p>
    <p id="b35-5" data-blocks='[["BL_35.5",35,[225,607,1152,1413]]]'>The account of the trustee of the inter vivos trust then came before the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County for reconsideration. The auditing judge held that “There has been no change in the status of any of the parties in interest, and the questions involved which were previously considered and decided are the same. My original views with respect to these questions, which are fully set forth in the prior adjudications, have not changed in the least, and there is nothing which I now care to add to what was said at that time. Whether or not the opinion of Judge Holland [the auditing judge of the account in the testamentary trust in Montgomery County], wherein he decided (as I did) that the division as between this trust and the testamentary trust was proper, renders that question <em>res judicata, </em>is a moot point which I do not intend to discuss or pass upon in this adjudication. I have ruled that the apportionment mentioned was proper. An exception to that ruling will bring the matter squarely before the Court <em>en Banc </em>and, if the <em>res judicata </em>feature is material, it can be argued and decided at that time.” The court en banc confirmed absolutely this readjudication, holding, inter alia, that the decision of the Montgomery County Orphans’ Court was res judicata as to the division of assets received from the salvage operation between the trust inter vivos and the testamentary trust.</p>

This contention is based on the fact that in the deed of trust, Keasbey set forth that he was assigning to the inter vivos trust “all the interest required to be paid by the term of the said bond” of Mattison, and that “for the purposes of this deed all interest required to be paid by the terms of the bond ... on the entire principal sum ... is to be considered income.” We are not impressed with this argument. Keasbey used this phraseology in his deed merely as a direction that all interest on the bond was to be paid to the trustee of the inter vivos trust and that he reserved none to himself, in contrast to the division of the principal in two portions —the larger amount to be paid to the trust, and the smaller to be paid to himself. It was also his intent that all interest which was required to be paid by the bond was to be treated as income of the inter vivos trust. It was not his intention that such interest should be guaranteed or made up for the life tenants out of principal of the portion assigned to the trust or that retained by him, in the event the interest was not actually paid.</p>

A careful examination of the facts and circumstances of the case has convinced us that the division made was proper.</p>

At the time he became insolvent and made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, he was indebted to Keasbey in the principal <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>sum of $650,000 (upon which no interest was due to Keasbey); and he was indebted to the inter vivos trust in the principal sum of $1,500,000, as well as for interest at the rate of 6% from April 1, 1931, on this total indebtedness of $2,150,000. This condition prevailed at the time of Keasbey’s death, when Mattison’s indebtedness to him passed into his testamentary trust. From the sale of the collateral, which secured the two portions of the debt, a fund was realized by Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, as trustee of both trusts, which was clearly insufficient to pay the principal owing or any interest.</p>

Merely because trust estates are the creditors involved and the trust company is acting in a dual capacity as trustee for each, does not alter the character of the issue or raise any question which would not be involved between them if they were individuals. Whether or not the pro rata distribution between the trusts should be based solely upon their respective principal claims (as decided by the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County), or should include interest, (as contended by appellant), must be ascertained under the rules for distributing assets of an insolvent debtor among his creditors. The doctrine laid down by this Court in <em>Nirdlinger’s Estate (No. 2), </em>supra, has no bearing in determining what would be a proper division of the money received by the trustee between the two trusts. As was correctly stated by the auditing judge of the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County: “When the trustee of the Deed of Trust has received what it is entitled to, then and then only does the principle of <em>Nirdlinger’s Estate, supra, </em>apply as between the principal and income beneficiaries of that trust.”</p>

And this is true even though one creditor’s claim carries interest and the other none at all. While some considerable time elapsed from the time of the assignment and the actual sale of the collateral and distribution of the fund received, nevertheless no one should gain an advantage or suffer a loss as a result, for such delay was due solely to the usual difficulties of collection, liquidation and distribution.
