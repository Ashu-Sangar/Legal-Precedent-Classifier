    <p id="b183-8" data-blocks='[["BL_183.14",183,[196,1390,1147,635]]]'>The Commonwealth appeals from an order of distribution of the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale of real estate. Its judgment, on which the Commonwealth based its claim, was entered against the defendant, Frill, December 7,1939, and was revived November 29,1944, by amicable scire facias. Among other judgments against the same defendant, was one marked to the use of Geary on which the execution issued and raised the proceeds for distribution. The Commonwealth contends that the judgment to the use of Geary, to which distribution was made, had lost its lien and was therefore not entitled to share ahead of the Commonwealth.</p>

L. 774, 12 P.S. 864.1, the distribution made below would be correct, but contends that a different result is required by the Act of 1943 “regulating the lien of judgments; prescribing the procedure for the revival of judgments and for the continuance of the lien thereof,” which repealed the Acts of 1827 and 1887.</p>
