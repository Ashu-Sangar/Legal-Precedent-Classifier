    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.8",454,[212,386,1148,267]]]'>This appeal concerns the construction of a will. The question is whether the gift of the residue confers upon the trustee an absolute discretion <em>as to what, if anything, </em>He shall pay the beneficiaries, or merely constitutes a discretion as to the <em>time </em>or <em>method </em>of making payments.</p>
    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.9",454,[213,667,1146,207]]]'>Testator’s “home made” will provided “all moneys remaining &amp; other things of value I hereby leave to Russell E. Ricker, Sr., to be kept in trust for his two boys to be given them at his discretion.”</p>
    <p id="b454-6" data-blocks='[["BL_454.10",454,[212,888,1148,489]]]'>The will is dated March 8, 1943. Testator died November 17, 1943. The beneficiaries were not related to testator. At the date of the will, Russell was aged 22 and Roy was 19 years of age. Both were then eligible for, and thereafter entered, the armed services of the United States. Both were then unmarried. Russell E. Ricker, Jr., the elder, married Iris Burgess on December 9,1944. He was killed in the service nine days after his marriage. No issue survived.</p>
    <p id="b454-7" data-blocks='[["BL_454.11",454,[211,1390,1149,600]]]'>On January 29, 1945, Russell E. Ricker, the trustee and father of the beneficiaries, filed his account as executor, which was audited before Judge Hunter. At the audit the widow of the deceased son Russell claimed that her deceased husband possessed a vested equitable interest in one half of the residuary trust fund, and hence it should be paid to his estate. The trustee maintained that his discretion consisted of his absolute determination of <em>what </em>he should pay and not merely <em>when </em>it should be paid and that therefore Russell’s share was not vested and formed part of the trust estate.</p>
    <p id="b454-8" data-blocks='[["BL_454.12",454,[212,2004,1146,324]],["BL_455.1",455,[197,283,1152,1388]]]'>Judge Hunter, with considerable reluctance, refused to adopt the widow’s contention. He awarded the entire trust fund to the trustee “in trust for Roy L. Ricker” the surviving beneficiary. He said: “To my mind there should be a strong presumption in favor of the beneficiary where the gift is not limited to his life, and there <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>is no gift over of the unpaid portion. The disherison of a young widow, as in this case, and possibly of children, should be avoided. To carry out the distinction made by the Bestatement, Trusts, §155, and by Scott on Trusts, §155, between a gift of ‘only so much of the income and principal or either as the trustee in his own uncontrolled discretion shall see fit to pay or apply,’ and a gift ‘where the trustee has discretion merely as to time of payment, and where the beneficiary is ultimately entitled to the whole or to a part of the trust property,’ I suggest that consideration be given to the nature of the gift in the first instance. Where a gift is found only in the words ‘so much’ of the income or principal as the trustee may pay, then it should be considered that there is no ownership in the beneficiary until payment is actually made. On the other hand, where there is first a gift to B in absolute terms or a gift ‘in trust for B,’ then it could be considered an equitable fee in B, and the subsequent words as to the trustee’s discretion construed not as cutting down the gift, but as referring merely to time and manner of payment. The trust would be sustained as an active trust, but there being no gift over, the fund would devolve from the beneficiary upon his death as an equitable fee in the same manner as a legal fee: Boies’ Estate, <a href="/pa/177/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="177 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="883703" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0190-01">177 Pa. 190</a>; Penrose’s Estate, <a href="/pa/317/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="317 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="8846186" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0444-01">317 Pa. 444</a>.”</p>

Testator divided his residue into fourteen equal shares, eleven of which were given absolutely to his eleven surviving children and two shares were given, per stirpes, to the issue of his two deceased children. The remaining share was not given to his son Neil absolutely, but was placed <em>in trust </em>with testator’s wife (Neil’s mother) with payments of either income or principal to <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>be made <em>"at the absolute discretion” </em>of tbe wife. In construing tbe words of tbe trust, and taking into consideration that “Neil had become addicted to drink” and that “testator obviously desired to protect (Neil) against the consequences of his drinking habits” (page 149), this Court decided that any payments to Neil of either principal or income were in the absolute discretion of his mother; that the fund was not given to Neil, but only so much thereof as the mother saw fit to pay Mm.

In the first instance, the gift was to the trustee “to be kept <em>in trust </em>for his two boys” (italics ours). We do not regard the immediate phrase following: “to be given them at his discretion” as cutting down the gift, but referring <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>merely to the time and manner of payment. It is true that in the <em>Lochrie </em>case, there was an immediate gift to the beneficiary of an equitable estate, but the <em>proviso, </em>considered with the surrounding circumstances, effectively cut down the gift, and conferred upon the trustee a discretion to pay the beneficiaries whatever, if anything, she chose.

The beneficiaries were friends of testator; they were immediately potential service men, and shortly thereafter did enter the armed service; there was an immediate probability that these soldiers would be assigned to foreign shores or to distant parts of their own country; there was the real possibility of casualty and at the close of the war they would require readjustment in civilian life; also there was a probability of marriage and families, either here or abroad.
