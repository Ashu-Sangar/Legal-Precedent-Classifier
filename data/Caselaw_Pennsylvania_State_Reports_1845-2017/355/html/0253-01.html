According to the latter the contractor was to be paid from amounts collected by the City Treasurer from the abutting property owners, and “the City of Reading shall under no circumstances be held responsible for the payment of any part of the cost of said improvement, except as to the cost of paving intersections of streets, the paving and curbing in front of properties exempt by law from the payment of the cost of such improvements, and the amounts actually received from the assessments by the City Treasurer”. It was provided by section 1908 of the Third Class City Law of June 23, 1931, P. L. 932, that, where the whole or any part of the cost of an improvement was to be paid by assessments upon the properties abutting or benefited and the agreement with the contractor called for his payment from such assessments, the city should not be otherwise liable “whether said assessments are collectible or not”.</p>

      <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>It is important at the outset to realize the exact change that was effected by this “validating” statute. Under the terms of the bonds as originally issued the City of Reading was practically nothing more than an agent or trustee to make the assessments and to collect from the abutting property owners and pay over to the contractor or to the assignees of the bonds the funds due under the contract; it could itself become liable for the payment of the bonds only if guilty of negligence in the performance of its duties as such quasi agent or trustee; the source of payment was limited strictly to the assessments, and the credit of the municipality was in nowise involved. By virtue of the statute, however, the city became an absolute debtor on the bonds and the credit of the municipality and its complete taxing power were placed at the disposal of the bondholders as the source from which to effect payment. The latter were thus granted a pure gratuity, a windfall, by which money was legislated out of the pockets of the taxpayers of the city for the private benefit of the contractor or the assignees of the bonds as to none of whom was there any obligation whatever, legal, equitable, or moral, to justify such a grant. The city ordinances^ the Third Class City Law, the contract, and the bonds themselves, all plainly specified that the city’s obligation was limited; the bonds were accepted with full realization of that fact, and the contractor received exactly what the contract provided that he should receive. Indeed it is obvious that if the parties had contemplated an unlimited municipal liability it is not likely that the bonds would have borne interest, as they did, at the high rate of <em>5% </em>per annum. No consideration or benefit of any kind was received by the city in return for the liability imposed upon it, nor was any public purpose thereby subserved, — not even, as it might be claimed, to establish a better credit with contractors in general, because by the Municipal Borrowing Law of June 25,1941, P. L. 159, section 214, the future issuance of such “improve<a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>ment bonds” by municipalities had been forbidden, and only bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the municipality were thereafter to be issued.</p>

Admittedly the original contract for paving and curbing the streets might have provided for the payment of the entire cost by the city (Third Class City Law of June 23, 1931, P. L. 932, section 2931), but since, in fact, the contractor was to receive payment only from the abutting property owners, could the legislature, by its mere fiat, subsequently impose upon the city an absolute liability purely for the private benefit of the contractor or those to whom the bonds originally issued to the contractor had been assigned?</p>

Such an obligation might exist where a contractor did not, for some legalistic reason, receive what the parties had agreed in the contract he should receive. A moral obligation has been defined as one “which cannot be enforced by action but which is binding on the party who incurs it, in conscience and according to natural justice,” or as “a duty which would be enforceable by law, were it not for some positive rule, which, with a view to general benefit, exempts the party in that particular instance from legal liability”: <em>Bailey </em>

Notwithstanding the constitutional provisions above quoted, it is well established in our own State, as well as generally elsewhere, that a claim supported by such a moral obligation and founded in equity and justice, even though not legally enforceable, may be recognized by the legislature and made collectible either from the State itself or any of its political divisions; the legislature may compel municipalities to adopt and discharge such obligations and to exercise the power of taxation for that purpose.

Here ten years had gone by from the original filing of the liens, during which time delinquent taxes may have accrued to wipe out any realizable value from the properties, and the only defense which the city could properly offer to its failure to proceed would be that the amounts likely to have been obtained from sales on execution would have been less than the costs involved: <em>First Catholic Slovak Union v.

There was no legal requirement upon plaintiff to offer to indemnify the city against costs, for it was the duty of the city itself to issue executions and institute proper actions unless it were fairly obvious that the costs, even though a prior claim upon the funds realized, would not be salvaged. The jury should have been allowed to pass upon the question • whether the failure of the city to exhaust all possible measures to effect collections from the property owners, was, under the circumstances, negligence on its part, thereby making itself liable for the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds. The record must now be remanded in order that that question may be properly determined.</p>

There is not one word in plaintiff’s statement of claim which declares or even intimates what the majority opinion asserts, to wit: “As it appeared extremely doubtful whether sufficient funds could be realized out of the liens which were filed on the abutting properties, plaintiff brought the present suit in assumpsit against the city . . .” There was in this case no such “doubt” and no basis for such doubt.</p>

The Act passed declared that “the outstanding debts incurred therefor in the form of improvement certificates shall be a lawful indebtedness of the municipality concerned.” The Supreme Court of New Jersey said: “That the drainage of these extensive swamps within the city of Hoboken would be conducive to the health and comfort of the community throughout the city, and hence was a matter of local interest and benefit which the legislature might have committed to and made chargeable upon the municipality, is not, and, I think, cannot be questioned. 10 Am. &amp; Eng.

The city on December 17, 1926, assumed the payment of debts amounting to $5,000,000 “to enumerated persons, firms and corporations”, which debts were incurred in connection with the Sesqui-Centennial.

L. 7) an Act was passed by the Pennsylvania Legislature “validating all bonds issued by any city of the first class for any public exposition celebrating the sesquicentennial anniversary”. This Act was passed after the debt of $5,000,000 had been incurred, resulting in payments totalling that sum to certain individuals and corporations who had furnished services and material to the Sesqui-Centennial amounting to $5,000,000. The taxpayers filed a bill against the City of Philadelphia and its fiscal officers attempting to restrain the payment of these bonds. They claimed that to use public money to pay these bonds violated the following provisions of the Constitution: Article 9, Section 7, Article 3, Sections 7 and 20, and Article 15, Section 2. They contended (as the majority contend in the instant case) that “A moral obligation arises only out of an actual debt which has become uncollectible because of some defect in the law under the authority of which <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>it was originally contracted.” This court overruled this contention and held that the bonds constituted a “moral obligation” of the City of Philadelphia. The Supreme Court cited with approval this statement by the court below: “That the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence was a suitable occasion for the holding of a celebration of a public character, is a matter beyond question . . . There can be no doubt that, under the cases hereinbefore considered, the celebration of the sesquicentennial fell within the scope of a public purpose for which the municipality could make proper appropriations, . . . The objection by appellant that the debts authorized by the ordinance of December 17,1926, were not actual debts of the city but were those of the Sesqui-Centennial Exhibition Association, is answered by the curative Act of April 6, 1927, supra, authorizing cities of the first class to pay for ‘work previously done, material previously furnished, or services previously rendered’ in connection with the sesquecentennial celebration ‘up to . . . $5,000,000,’ . . .

The contractors performed the required work, but the property owners “failed to pay the assessments”.

The constitutionality of the Act which contained these provisions was challenged, and as the Supreme Court of California pointed out, a rehearing was granted “in order to give fuller consideration to the difficult questions of constitutionality and statutory construction involved”.

That case held that the Legislature could not authorize a school district to issue bonds to pay the amount due under anticipation warrants against the taxes for educational purposes. The Illinois court took the position that a school district cannot “issue bonds and assume a legal liability for the payment of what it characterizes as ‘a moral, equitable and honorable obligation.’ ” Thus the Illinois court holds that the state cannot authorize the expenditure of public moneys in payment of moral and equitable obligations. The majority opinion takes the view that a state <em>can </em>authorize the expenditure of public moneys for such obligation, but it denies that there is any moral or equitable obligation on the part of the City of Reading io pay the bonds in suit. Judge Cooley and other eminent authorities hold that a state can authorize the expenditure of public moneys for the payment of a moral or equitable obligation. The Illinois court held that the money appropriated in this case was not for a public purpose. This is manifestly erroneous and is contrary to the decisions in all the many other states herein named.

He added: “In that opinion we said: ‘It is contended that the appropriation was not for a “corporate purpose”. If it was for a public purpose , — for the benefit of the inhabitants of the municipality— then it would be for a corporate purpose. The latter cannot be distinguished from the former; and all that we have said in relation to the public purpose of the tax, will apply with equal force to a corporate purpose.’ ” Justice Shaw then says:</p>
