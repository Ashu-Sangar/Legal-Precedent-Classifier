They own three pieces of real estate as tenants by the entireties — -a two story brick dwelling at 2014 Duquesne Avenue, a one story brick building at 443 Pacific Avenue, and a two story frame dwelling house at 439 Pacific Avenue, all in the City of McKeesport. Defendant conducted for several years a grocery and meat business in the 443 Pacific Avenue property. Husband and wife lived together in the Duquesne Avenue dwelling, but in 1944 disagreements arose between them, caused chiefly by the alleged philandering of defendant with a young woman employed in the business. In May of that year the parties separated; discussions ensued for a period of several months and in August a meeting was had in the office of plaintiff’s lawyer and an oral agreement entered into for what was intended to be a “complete” separation. The terms of this agreement were that defendant should transfer to plaintiff the business and a truck used in connection therewith and convey to her his interest in their real estate, in consideration of which plaintiff agreed to assume the mortgages and accrued taxes on the properties amounting to about $5,200, to liquidate all the then existing indebtedness of the business amounting to about $3,500, <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>and to pay to defendant in cash the sum of $1,500; plaintiff also waived all claim to support for herself and the children and, in general, all rights arising out of the marriage. While it was apparently understood that she intended to institute divorce proceedings there was no agreement to that effect. Defendant signed a deed in blank and also a certificate of title to the truck and deposited these documents with the lawyer in order that the latter might insert in the deed a description of the properties and fill out the blanks in the title certificate; the lawyer was also instructed to prepare a bill of sale for the transfer of the business. At the same time plaintiff paid defendant $1,000 on account of the $1,500. About two months later she started divorce proceedings which are still pending.</p>

Plaintiff told defendant she would give him a “trial” if he would come back and “stay good”; he came back but did not “stay good”; on the contrary, he allegedly continued his attentions to the woman employe with the result that the period of restored harmony lasted only for a couple of weeks, since which time the parties have not had conjugal relations. Plaintiff offered to pay defendant the remaining $500 due in cash, but he refused to accept it. She has been managing the business, has paid off the indebtedness, and has made reduction payments on account of the mortgages and taxes on the real estate.</p>

Here defendant, in Ms testimony, admitted tlie making of the agreement as claimed by plaintiff.

    <p id="b329-3" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[236,671,1149,1443]]]'>As to the second of the suggested defenses, although it is always competent for a party to a contract to establish that it was subsequently abandoned, as shown by actions of the parties inconsistent with its continued existence <em>(Weldon &amp; Kelly Co. v.

According to plaintiff’s version she accepted defendant’s return to the household only for a trial period and on condition of his subsequent good behavior; in other words, the reconciliation was merely a provisional one. Under such circumstances, and in view of the fact that the condition imposed was not met by defendant and the parties promptly separated again, it would seem clear that, while the agreement may have been regarded as temporarily suspended, it was not rescinded or finally abandoned: cf. <em>Alleman v. Alleman, </em>2 Dauphin County Rep. 209.</p>

If plaintiff’s charges in regard to defendant’s marital derelictions are justified she presumably will be awarded a divorce in the proceeding which she has instituted, and it is not contended that defendant at any time agreed that he would not defend such a suit by refuting her allegations if it is possible for him to do so.</p>
    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.5",330,[204,1108,1150,1092]]]'>As to the fourth defense, while equity will not ordinarily decree specific performance of a contract for the transfer of chattels or interests therein, it will do so where special and peculiar reasons exist such as render it impossible for the injured party to obtain adequate relief by way of damages in an action at law: <em>Schipper Bros.

As far as the grocery and meat business is concerned, it is a comparatively long-established and profitable enterprise, it enjoys a neighborhood good-will, and plaintiff would not be able to establish by any satisfactory standard of measurement in an action at law the damages that would accrue to her by defendant’s refusal to.carry out his agreement with regard to it. His obligation to transfer the business is therefore specifically enforceable.
