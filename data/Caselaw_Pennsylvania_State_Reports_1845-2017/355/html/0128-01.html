On April 10, 1940, suit was filed against the City of Pittsburgh and on April 24 of that same year, Esther Jane Davey was brought upon the record as additional defendant. On February 24, 1941, the latter conveyed her property consisting of a house and lot in Pittsburgh, to her daughter, Sarah Davey, the appellee, for a consideration, as recited in the deed, of “One Dollar and other good and valuable consideration”. After a trial and retrial of the case, in both of which plaintiff recovered verdicts, judgment was finally entered against the mother, Mrs. Davey, on the plaintiff’s verdict as of June 17, 1943. On June 22 of that same year, Mrs. Davey died.</p>

The facts there were as follows: During the period from December, 1934, <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>to October, 1937, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania furnished old age assistance to Elizabeth Smith in the aggregate sum of $672. On July 14, 1938, she conveyed the house where she lived in Latrobe to her son, Gerald J. Smith, and Alice Smith, his wife, the consideration expressed in the deed being one dollar. On September 9, 1938, Elizabeth Smith died. Seeking to recover the sums paid to her the Commonwealth instituted suit against Barclay-Westmoreland Trust Company, administrator of her estate, in accordance with the provisions of section 15(a) of the Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, and also brought proceedings in equity to set aside the conveyance as being in fraud of its rights as a creditor of the decedent. The court directed judgment to be entered in the sum claimed by the Commonwealth with interest, and decreed that the conveyance be set aside to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[280,1246,966,42]]]'>In sustaining the court below this court said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.6",157,[207,1300,1151,1083]]]'>“That the conveyance [by an insolvent] was made without a fair consideration was established prima facie by the fact that the consideration expressed in the deed was one dollar, and defendants, in their answer, did not deny the allegation in plaintiff’s bill that a fair consideration would have been $2,100 . . . Gerald J. Smith testified, in somewhat vague fashion, that the conveyance had been made to reimburse him for moneys he had laid out for his mother’s support over a long period of years. Even if true, and even though an agreement to that effect had been made in advance by mother and son, it would not defeat the rights of plaintiff, because, where a conveyance of property is made in consideration of an agreement to support the grantor in the future, it is invalid as to creditors if by the conveyance the grantor renders himself unable to pay his debts, the theory being that a conveyance whereby a debtor puts his property beyond the reach of his creditors under an agreement that it shall be devoted in any way to his own use is constructively fraudulent.” (Citing 5 cases)</blockquote>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.3",158,[229,270,1148,576]]]'>
      <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>Judge Soffel of the court below correctly distinguished the <em>Smith </em>case from the instant case, in the following language: “An agreement to convey property upon consideration of future support is only invalid as to grantor’s existing creditors. In the <em>Smith </em>ease such creditors existed at the time the agreement to convey was entered into. In the instant case, at the time the conveyance was actually made the daughter had performed her part of the contract and had advanced money and services to her mother beyond the value of the real estate.”</p>
    <p id="b158-5" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[228,866,1149,692]]]'>Among the cases cited in the <em>Smith </em>case were <em>Hennon v. McClane, </em><a href="/pa/88/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="88 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="1061160" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0219-01">88 Pa. 219</a>, 222, and <em>Isett v.

In the case of <em>Hennon v. McClane </em>the conveyance was held to be valid because, as Chief Justice Agnew pointed out, there was no evidence to show that there were existing creditors at the time of the execution of the agreement. Likewise, in the instant case the agreement between the defendant, Sarah Davey, and her mother, wherein the daughter was to support and care for her mother in return for which the property would be turned over to her was made nearly 2% years before Rorison became even a claimant against Mrs. Davey.</p>

Isett, a childless widow, 83 years old, residing on her farm in Huntingdon County, entered into a contract with her niece, Ellen C. Maclay, a trained nurse living in Philadelphia, that the latter should give up her profession and reside with and care for the former during the balance of her life, for which Miss Maclay was to have all of Mrs. Isett’s property, including the farm, worth about $4,500 and $6,000 in personalty. This was duly transferred and the use thereof for life secured to Mrs. Isett. The niece carried out her part of the agreement. Mrs. Isett died three years later. The plaintiff was a nephew of Mrs. Isett’s husband, and lived with them as a member of the family from the <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>death of his parents in 1884 until his marriage in 1897. Thereafter he continued to spend as much time as possible on the farm. He assisted his aunt in its management and did work thereon, also bought seed grain and other necessaries for the farm from time to time. He kept no account of the work so done or money so expended and never requested payment for either, and while she made some statements that he would be paid there was no agreement to that effect. In April, 1917, four months after the death of Mrs. Isett a stranger handed him an envelope in which was a note dated July 10, 1908, promising to pay to the order of Harry C. Isett, thirty-five hundred dollars, with interest. Plaintiff had no knowledge of the existence of the note until it was handed to him. Defendant had no knowledge of plaintiff’s claim until after the death of Mrs. Isett and acted throughout in good faith. The bill was dismissed, the court finding that plaintiff was not a creditor of Mrs, Isett in February, 1914. Upon appeal to this court the action of the court below was sustained. We said:</p>
    <p id="b159-4" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[218,1360,1148,477]]]'>“Under the Statute of Elizabeth a conveyance of land as here to secure future maintenance is void as to existing creditors [citing cases], but otherwise valid: [citing cases] So the real question here is, was plaintiff a creditor of Mrs. Isett in February, 1914?

That the daughter also agreed to render her mother services in the future is of no materiality as the services then already rendered and the advances already made constituted a fair consideration for the conveyance of the property. Appellant endeavors to attack the court’s finding as to the value of the past services by arguing that since the daughter paid nothing for board and lodging in her mother’s home the past services and advances did not <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>constitute a fair consideration. Inasmuch as the daughter was paying all the expenses of maintaining the home and furnishing the food, besides rendering extraordinary personal services to her mother, we, like the court below, find no merit in this argument. It must be borne in mind, as the court found, that the daughter also paid the bills for water and taxes, telephone, electric and gas supplies, and also for doctor bills and for painting, repairing, papering and plumbing, and these bills were for very substantial sums.</p>

The agreement as then made did not defraud creditors — either present or future. It was a valid, legally enforceable agreement. At the time that the claim of Rorison originated, Sarah Davey was already a bona fide creditor of her mother. It was therefore not fraudulent for the mother to secure payment to her creditor daughter by this conveyance, even though in so doing the grantor denuded herself of all real estate.”</p>
