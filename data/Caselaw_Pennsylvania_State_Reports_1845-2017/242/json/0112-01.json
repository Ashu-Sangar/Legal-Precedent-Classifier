    "head_matter": "Hoffman, Appellant, v. Howell.\nEquity \u2014 Equity practice \u2014 Preliminary injunction \u2014 Appeals\u2014 Supreme Court.\n1. The established practice of the Supreme Court on appeals from the awarding or refusing of preliminary injunctions is not to consider the merits of the case, but only to determine whether under the facts presented in the Common Pleas there was reasonable ground for the action of the court.\n2. An order dismissing a preliminary injunction was sustained on appeal where it appeared that the injunction was granted on averments in the bill and injunction affidavit, some of which were not supported by proof at the hearing and others of which gave rise to questions that could not be properly considered until after final hearing and decree.\nArgued April 20, 1913.\nAppeal, No. 177, Jan. T,, 1913, by plaintiffs, from decree of C. P. McKean Co., June T., 1913, No. 1, in Equity, dissolving a preliminary injunction in case of E. J. Hoffman and C. M. Brooks v. Orville D. Howell.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Mestrezat, Potter and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for an injunction to restrain defendant from drilling oil and gas wells on certain land. Before Bouton, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that Junius E. . Clark, and Edward K. Clark, being the owners of a tract of land situate in the Borough of Kendall, conveyed a part thereof to Wilson Green. The deed to Green contained the following reservation: ,:\n\u201cThe party of the first part reserves all the oil and gas on the premises hereby conveyed, but agrees not to locate any well on any parcel hereby conveyed.\u201d\nGreen\u2019s title subsequently became vested in the defendant, and the title of the Clarks descended to Ellen C. Hanna and Mary E. Clark, who leased the whole tract above mentioned, together with certain other lands, to the plaintiff's, reserving however, \u201call lots of land which have heretofore been conveyed from any of the above described tracts of land.\u201d Later Mary E. Clark and Genevieve Clark Hanna, the devisee of Ellen C. Hanna, undertook to convey to the defendant \u201call the oil and gas in, under and upon the land above described, (the land of the defendant), reserved by them or their predecessors.\u201d\nThe defendant was about to drill a well upon his land for the purpose of removing oil therefrom, when plaintiffs filed a bill in equity to restrain defendant from drilling such well or wells, alleging that Mary E. Clark and Ellen C. Hanna had declared at the time of leasing the property to plaintiffs that no wells should be drilled on defendant\u2019s land by defendant, and that relying on such declarations and on covenants contained in various recorded deeds, plaintiffs had paid their lessors $16,000 for the privilege of taking oil and gas from the whole of the leasehold estate, which they averred gave them the right to take oil and gas from defendant\u2019s land. There was no evidence of the declarations alleged in the bill. A preliminary injunction was granted, which, upon motion for a continuance thereof until final hearing, was dissolved. From the decree dissolving the injunction, plaintiffs appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was in dissolving the injunction.\nEdgar W. Tait, with him Edwin E. Tait, for appellants.\n\u2022/. E. Mullm, with him Thomas B. Wilson, for appellee.\nJune 27, 1913:"
