    "head_matter": "James v. James, Appellant.\nContracts \u2014 Joint and several contracts \u2014 Breach\u2014Assumpsit\u2014 Nonjoinder of parties.\nSix brothers entered into a contract with two of the brothers as parties of the first part and the other four as parties of the Second part, whereby it was agreed, inter alia, that the parties of the second part should buy certain shares of stock, and other property, owned by one of the parties of the first part at a valuation to be fixed by appraisers; the appraisers were appointed and rendered a report, and thereupon the shares of stock, deeds, etc., which were to be sold, were delivered to a trust company, appointed in the contract to receive them for the parties of the second part; the parties of the second part refused to pay the amount fixed by the appraisers as the value of the property. In an action of assumpsit on the contract to recover this amount, only one of the parties of the first part was named in the writ as plaintiff, and one of the defendants named therein was not served. Held, that the contract, though joint in form, was several in effect, and the action could be maintained without joining all the parties, and a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.\nArgued April 14, 1913.\nAppeal, No. 121, Jan. T., 1913, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. McKean Co., Dec. T., 1911, No. 60, on verdict for plaintiff in case of W. A. James v. D. M. James, E. B. \u00abTames, and H. J. James.\nBefore Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit to recover money alleged to be due under a written contract. Before A. O. Smith, P. J., specially presiding.\nProm tbe record it appeared that six brothers controlled, through stock ownership, various corporations, and that they were tenants in common of certain coal and gas properties. Disagreements had taken place between them as to the management of these corporations, and for the purpose of settling all disputes, they entered into a written contract with W. A. James and J. C. James, as parties of the first part, and D. M. James, E. B. James, H. J. James and D. W. James, as parties of the second part. It was provided in the contract, inter alia, that the parties of the second part should purchase of W. A. James various shares of stock, and his interest in a gas lease, at a valuation to be fixed by appraisers whose appointment was provided for in the contract; the appraisers were appointed, and reported that the value of W. A. James\u2019s properties was <\u00b696,452.90. The stock, deeds, etc., were delivered to a trust company appointed to receive them for the parties of the second part. The parties of the second part refused to complete the purchase, however, alleging that the written contract had been modified by a subsequent parol agreement, and that the appraisement had been fraudulently made. The court submitted the question of the modification of the contract, and of the good faith of the appraisement to the jury, and refused to charge that the action could not be maintained because the contract was a joint contract, and all the parties thereto were not parties to the action. It appeared that J. C. James, of the first part, was not named in the writ, and that D. W. James, of the second part, though named in the writ, was not served.\nThe material parts of the contract in question were as follows:\nThis agreement made this 30th day of January A.
