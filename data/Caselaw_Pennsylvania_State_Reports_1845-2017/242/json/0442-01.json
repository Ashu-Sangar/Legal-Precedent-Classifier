    "head_matter": "Improved Traction Engine Company, Appellant, v. Christner.\nContracts \u2014 Sales\u2014Condition sales \u2014 Case for jury.\nIn an action to recover the price of a traction engine and two trucks sold and delivered to the defendant, where plaintiff claimed that the sale wat. for cash without conditions, and defendant contended that pla ntifi at the time of sale had guaranteed that the engine and trucks would do the work for which defendant desired them, and that defendant could test them and should pay for them only if found satisfactory, aud that they were tested and found unsatisfactory and worthless, and that plaintiff was promptly notified of that fact, the case was held to he for the jury, and a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff was sustained.\nArgued. October 10, 1913.\nAppeal, No. 56, Oct. T., 1913, by plaintiff, from, judgment of C. P., Somerset Co., Sept. T., 1910, No. 361, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Improved Trac'\u00e1on Engine; Company, a corporation, v. M. Christner.\nBefore Brown, Potter, Elkin, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit to recover the price of a traction engine and two trucks alleged to have been sold and delivered to defendant. Before Ingraham, P. J., specially presiding.\nFrom the record it appeared that defendant was operating a lumber plant in Virginia, and desired to procure a traction engine to haul the lumber from the plant to the railroad. He went to plaintiff\u2019s works, to buy a new traction engine for this purpose, and was informed that plaintiff had no new engine on hand, but that they knew of an engine of their make in West Virginia, which had been used for a short time, and which could be purchased. A few days thereafter plaintiff\u2019s salesman and defendant went to West Virginia, and after an examination of the engine and trucks plaintiff purchased them from the Eastern Lumber Company, and, plaintiff contended, resold them to defendant. Defendant contended that the engine and trucks were delivered to him under an agreement that he might test them and should pay for them only if satisfactory; that upon the arrival of the engine at his lumber plant in Virginia, he gave it a thorough test for about four or five weeks, and found it would not haul the required quantity of lumber and that it was entirely worn out and useless, of which he promptly notified plaintiff. Plaintiff denied that its salesman had guaranteed that the engine would do the work, or that the sale was conditional on the engine proving satisfactory. The court left the disputed questions of fact to the jury.\nVerdict for defendant and judgment thereon. Plaintiff appealed.\nErrors assigned were answers to points, various rulings of the trial judge, and the refusal of the court to enter judgment for plaintiff n. o. v.\nCharles E. Ealy, tv bib. him Charles F. Uhl, Jr., for appellant.\nC. W. Walker and A lemmder King, for appellee, were not heard.\nNovember 7, 1913:"
