Notice given in the title of an act, that corporations which have not commenced business within two years of the date of their letters patent shall be proceeded against for the purpose of having their charters forfeited, is sufficient notice of a provision in the enacting part of the statute that corporations “which have not paid in the capital required by law, and have not in any manner exercised the powers conferred upon them by their letters patent,” will also be proceeded against. A corporation which has not paid in its capital as required by law, and which has not in any manner exercised the powers conferred upon it by its letters patent, cannot in any proper sense of the word be said to have commenced business.</p>

The title is as follows: “An Act to provide that corporations of this Commonwealth having the right to receive deposits of money and to do a banking business which have not commenced business within two years from the date of their letters patent, or which have failed to exercise their corporate privileges, for two years after having been liquidated, shall be proceeded against by quo warranto by the attorney general at the instance of the banking commissioner to have their charter rights declared null and void.”</p>

The Constitution only requires that an act of the general assembly shall relate to a single subject which shall be clearly expressed in the title. The subject of the act in question here is the dissolution of corporations having the right to receive deposits of money and to&gt; do a banking business. The title expressly states that such corporations shall be proceeded against by quo warranto if they (a) “have not commenced business within two years from the date of their letters patent,” or (b) “have failed to exercise their corporate privileges for two years after having been liquidated.” The act declares that such corporations may be proceeded <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>against in the manner stated in the title when (a) “they have not paid in the capital required by law,” and (b) “have not in any manner exercised the powers conferred upon them by their letters patent,” or (c) “have failed to exercise their corporate privileges for two years after having been liquidated.” The title does not mention specifically “failure to pay in the capital required by law” as a ground for the commencement of proceedings to dissolve. The subject of the act being the dissolution of corporations of the character described, the title is sufficient to lead to inquiry as to the causes for which proceedings may be commenced, and this is all that is necessary.

It is conceded that it has the right to receive deposits and do a banking business. The title gives distinct notice that the act is intended to provide for the dissolution of such corporations by proceedings in quo warranto. The title declares that such corporations “which have not commenced business within two years from the date of their letters patent, or which have failed to exercise their corporate privileges for two years after having been liquidated shall be proceeded against by quo warranto.” The statute provides, that when such corporations “have not paid in the capital required by law and have not in any manner exercised the powers conferred upon them by their letters. patent, or which have failed to exercise their corporate-privileges for two years, after having been liquidated” shall be proceeded against. There is no real conflict be<a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>tween the title and the statute. The act might have been more carefully drawn. The meaning of the words “after having been liquidated” which appear both in the title and in the body of the statute is not entirely clear. But it is not necessary to interpret them in the present case for no question of liquidation here arises, and the amendment of the original suggestion was not really required. The title expressly declares that a corporation which has not commenced business within two years from the date of its letters patent may be proceeded against. The statute declares that a corporation “which has not paid in the capital stock required by law and has not in any manner exercised the power conferred upon it by its letters patent” may be proceeded against. There is no specific statement in the title in regard to failure to pay in the capital required, but failure to commence business within two years from the date of the letters patent is expressly stated to be sufficient cause for the institution of the proceeding. A corporation such as is referred to in the statute could not commence business or exercise its corporate privileges without having first paid in its capital stock. The payment of the capital or the providing of capital with which to do business is a necessary pre-requisite to the commencing of business or the exercise of corporate privileges, and we regard the title in this particular as sufficient. The defendant company admittedly has not paid in or secured any money for the purpose of enabling it to do the business of receiving deposits or carrying on banking. Much more than two years have elapsed since the corporation was created. It was organized solely upon the basis of the invisible intangible franchise purchased at the assignee’s sale for the sum of $10.00. It valued that franchise at $200,000.00 and issued certificates of stock to that amount to the persons interested in the purchase. This gave the corporation no.capital or money with which to carry on the corporate business. At the time of its organization it had <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>no money for the purpose of carrying on the corporate business or exercising corporate privileges. In the eight succeeding years it has failed to provide, any money for the conduct of the corporate business or to procure a place for the exercise of its corporate privileges. It has done nothing more than annually elect a president and directors. This, as we view it, is not carrying on corporate business or in any manner exercising the powers conferred by the letters patent. The defendant made no reports to the auditor general and has paid no tax of any kind to the Commonwealth. It has held and still holds a naked franchise without any attempt to use it for the purpose for which it was granted and has brought itself within the provisions of the statute under which this proceeding has been commenced. The privileges conferred by the Act of April 5,1872, P. L. 972j could not now be acquired by any corporation organized under our general laws, because the granting of charters for the varied purposes covered by this Act of 1872 is no longer regarded as proper. If the defendant company had made use of its franchise by providing the money or capital with which to do business and by conducting business in good faith and had exercised its corporate privileges in any way whatever, it might claim the right to retain the privileges granted by this act of assembly.</p>

L. 143, which <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>provides for proceedings against certain corporations to have their charter rights declared null and void. It is provided in the act “That all corporations in this Commonwealth, having the right to receive deposits of money, and to do a banking business, which have not paid in the capital required by law, and have not in any manner exercised the powers conferred upon them by their letters patent, or which have failed to exercise their corporate privileges for two years after having been liquidated,” shall be proceeded against by quo warranto. Counsel suggest that the subject matter.comprised in the words “which have not paid in the capital required by law, and have not in any manner exercised the powers conferred upon them by their letters patent” is not fairly indicated by anything in the title. Notice is however given in the title that corporations, which have not commenced business within two years from the date, of their letters patent, shall be proceeded against. This language is, we think, sufficiently comprehensive to cover that portion of the enacting clause to which reference is made. A corporation which has not paid in its capital,- as required by law, and which has not in any manner exercised the powers conferred upon it by its letters patent, cannot in any proper sense of the word be said to have commenced business. We agree with the statement in the opinion of the court below that “The payment of the capital or the providing of capital with which to do business is a necessary prerequisite to the commencing of business or the exercise of corporate privileges.” And we also' agree with the view of the trial court that the title in this particular is sufficient. It is unduly long for so short an act, but it points with sufficient clearness to the subject of the statute which is, proceedings to declare null and void the charters of certain corporations that have failed to exercise their privileges. In the original suggestion filed by the at- , tornéy general, it was charged that the appellant had not paid, in the capital required by law, and had not <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>exercised the powers conferred upon it by its letters patent. To these specifications were added at the trial a third, that “the defendant has failed to exercise its corporate powers for two years after having been liquidated.” Under the facts as found by the trial judge, the defendant was delinquent as charged in the original suggestion, and the amendment was not therefore necessary. It however did no harm. The information was subject to amendment either on or at any time before the trial: Com. v. Swank, <a href="/pa/79/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="79 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="438396" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0154-01">79 Pa. 154</a>.</p>
    <p id="b219-3" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[183,918,1163,1533]]]'>It appears from the record that in 1904 the assignee of the Penn Bank, which after a change of name had been operated under a special charter granted April 5, 1872, “to the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Wheatland,” sold the charter to Samuel B. Hartwell for the sum of $10.00. He with his associates undertook to reorganize the company, and without the payment of any cash capital into the treasury, they issued to themselves paid up capital stock to the amount of $200,000.00. This was in violation of a sound and fundamental rule that in banking corporations the capital stock must be paid in cash. There is no room for watered stock in such a corporation. If the reorganizers of this institution desired to continue the banking business, they were bound to pay in the designated amount of capital in cash. That the old corporation, the Penn Bank, was liquidated, cannot be denied. Admittedly it made a voluntary assignment for the benefit of its creditors, and its assets were distributed, and its charter was sold. Its affairs were wound up and settled. The attempt of the reorganizers to capitalize the franchise, or the right to do business granted by the State, at the sum of $200,000, was the merest farce. The action was a nullity. Nor does it appear that the reorganizers have in any proper manner exercised the powers conferred upon them by the letters patent. The mere hold-; ing of annual meetings and the election of officers, without anything else, is not a compliance with the law.</p>
