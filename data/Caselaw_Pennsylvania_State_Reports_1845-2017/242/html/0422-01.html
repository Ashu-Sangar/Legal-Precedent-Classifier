L. 58, providing that persons sustaining personal injuries while lawfully engaged or employed on or about premises of a railroad company, shall have only such rights to recover damages as they would have if they were employe ss of such company, is the nature of the business of the person Injured at the time of the injury. If it is business connected with, the railroad in the sense that it is ordinarily the duty of railroad employees, then while the party is engaged at it the statute treats him as a quasi employee, and puts his rights on the same basis. If, however, the work has no relation to railroad work as such, and is connected with the railroad only by irrelevant and immaterial circumstances of locality, the case is not within the statute at all.</p>
