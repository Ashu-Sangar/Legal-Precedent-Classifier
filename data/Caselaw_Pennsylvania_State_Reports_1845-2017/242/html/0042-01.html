Disagreements had taken place between them as to the management of these corporations, and for the purpose of settling all disputes, they entered into a written contract with W. A. James and J. C. James, as parties of the first part, and D. M. James, E. B. James, H. J. James and D. W. James, as parties of the second part. It was provided in the contract, inter alia, that the parties of the second part should purchase of W. A. James various shares of stock, and his interest in a gas lease, at a valuation to be fixed by appraisers whose appointment was provided for in the contract; the appraisers were appointed, and reported that the value of W. A. James’s properties was &lt;¶96,452.90.

The parties of the second part refused to complete the purchase, however, alleging that the written contract had been modified by a subsequent parol agreement, and that the appraisement had been fraudulently made. The court submitted the question of the modification of the contract, and of the good faith of the appraisement to the jury, and refused to charge that the action could not be maintained because the contract was a joint contract, and all the parties thereto were not parties to the action. It appeared that J. C. James, of the first part, was not named in the writ, and that D. W. James, of the second part, though named in the writ, was not served.</p>
