We are dealing with a mechanic’s lien claim filed under the general Mechanic’s Lien Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431. A motion to strike the claim from the record, on the ground that it was an apportioned claim upon a building not adjoining the other buildings embraced in the contract set out, and in the claim, prevailed in the lower court. On appeal to the Superior Court it was there held that notwithstanding the claim was an apportioned one, and the building sought to be subjected to lien was not adjoining the other buildings embraced, it was not for such reason invalid, since the purpose of the Act of 1901 as indicated in Section 12, was to give the lien privilege to apportioned claims whether the buildings were adjoining or not; but, that the Act of 1901 was in this regard unconstitutional, violating Section 7, of Article III, of the Constitution, which declares that no local or special law shall be passed “providing or changing-methods for the collection of debts or the enforcing of judgments.” The case lies within a very narrow compass, as we shall see. The mechanic’s lien claim filed in the case recites, that by the terms of a verbal contract with the owner, claimant was “to plaster nineteen dwelling houses on the south side of Fiftieth Street between Walnut and Locust Streets; one apartment house on the North-east corner of Fiftieth and Chancellor Streets, and an apartment house on the North-west corner of Fiftieth and Locust Streets for the total price or sum of Eleven Thousand seven hundred Dollars ($11,700),” etc., and that the work contracted for had been performed. It is nowhere affirmed in the claim that any of these houses are adjoining. Presumably the nineteen dwelling houses on Walnut street and the ten on Fiftieth street were adjoining; but, however this may be, <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>there is no contention here that the particular building against which this claim was filed — the apartment house on the corner of Fiftieth and Locust streets — adjoined any of the other buildings embraced in the contract. Admittedly this building was separated from all of the others by a public street. The claim filed was confined to this particular apartment house and curtilage for an apportioned sum, to-wit: $1,136. The one question is as to the sufficiency of the claim. The contention on part of appellant is that under the general Mechanic’s Lien Law of 1901, which has. superseded all prior enactments on the subject of mechanic’s liens, it is no longer required, to sustain an apportioned lien, that the building which it is proposed to subject to lien shall be adjoining. This view is sustained in the opinion filed in the Superior Court on, as we think, insufficient ground.</p>

Smith, (4 T. R. 419), that when the same word is used in statutes which are in pari materia, a distinction as to the sense in which it is used in the one, is a legislative exposition of the sense in which it is to be understood in the other. And in Bacon’s Abridgment, Title, Statute 1, it is said that “words and phrases whose sense in a statu te, has been ascertained, are to be understood in the same sense when used in a subsequent statute. Even though statutes in pari materia have been expressly repealed yet the survey must extend to them as well.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b385-4" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[186,811,1151,428]]]'>Here we have the origin of the “apportioned claim,” and a clear expression of what was to be understood thereby.

    <p id="b385-6" data-blocks='[["BL_385.7",385,[177,1632,1156,699]]]'>This then is what was meant by an “apportioned claim”; the term had thus a fixed, definite meaning by legislative usage and sanction; “adjoining each other” necessarily entered into and became essential to its definition.

Applying then the canon of construction above referred to we have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that as the term “apportioned claims” occurs in the Act of June 4,1901, the reference is to such apportioned claims as were recognized and allowed by the Act of 1831. These were the apportioned claims that were forbidden thereafter; there were none other.</p>

From this circumstance is derived the conclusion that it was the legislative purpose by the Act of 1901 to allow thereafter separate apportioned claims against separate buildings not adjoining. We attach no significance to the circumstance, for the reason that the Act of 1901, attempts no definition of the “apportioned claims” which it forbids, but simply disallows thereafter what for more than seventy-five years under legislative sanction and judicial interpretation had been understood as “apportioned claims.” Had any such radical change in connection with our Mechanics Lien laws as would necessarily result, were any contrary view to prevail, been contemplated, the legislature would hardly have left the fact to be derived solely by Inference from a circumstance of no more certain import than that here relied upon; it is only reasonable to suppose that it would have indicated its purpose in this regard by positive and direct expression.</p>
    <p id="b386-5" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[317,1454,1159,590]]]'>Our conclusion is that Section 3 of the Act of 1901 affords no warrant for the filing of “separate claim, with amount determined by apportionment,” except in cases where the buildings are adjoining. It follows that the claim in this case being a separate apportioned claim, and the building sought to be charged with an apportioned amount not being adjoining with the other buildings embraced in the claim, it was filed without warrant of law. In this respect it was incurably defective; and because it was so, the learned court was entirely correct in refusing the amendment offered.</p>
