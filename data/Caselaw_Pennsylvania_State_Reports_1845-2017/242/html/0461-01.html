A municipal ordinance provided for the carrying of a street over the land of a railroad company, occupied by stations and railroad tracks, by means of a viaduct. The railroad company brought a bill in equity to enjoin the municipality from opening the street and from building the viaduct over its land. There was evidence that the railroad company would be inconvenienced during the construction of the viaduct, and that certain of the supports thereof would interfere slightly with the use of a freight station, or of a track approaching thereto. It appeared that the property could still be used for railroad purposes, and that the construction of the viaduct would contribute to the public safety by making possible the elimination of dangerous grade crossings. The lower court found that the railroad company could be compensated in damages for whatever injuries it might sustain by reason of the building of the viaduct, and dismissed plaintiffs’ bill. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

The street thus ordained crosses over Cliff street at an elevation of twenty-five feet; thence eastward over the right-of-way of the Pittsburgh, Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad Company at an elevation of twenty-seven feet; thence passing eastward over the Connoquenessing Creek and lands of Mackey, it crosses the right-of-way and lands of the Pittsburgh and Western Railroad Company, now operated by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company at an elevation of twenty-two feet; continuing thence <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>eastward over land of Larkin to Fairview avenue and thence to Center avenue. The street so ordained is to be supported upon pedestals set in pairs twenty-four inches square at the surface level, standing thirty feet apart from center to center, according to plans and specifications made by the borough engineer. Three pairs of these pedestals are located wholly on the land of the plaintiff company. The first of these pairs to the westward is located at the west side of said company’s freight house, projecting twenty-four inches from the western line thereon. Another pair is located in like manner at the eastern side of said freight house. The third pair is located at the passenger station, one leg being at and against the west side of said building about sixteen feet from the southwest corner and the other rising at the edge of the platform at the south end of said station. Both freight and passenger stations are one-story buildings of board frame construction. Connoquenessing Creek passes through the Borough of Butler in a north-easterly and south-westerly direction. The Pittsburgh, Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad at the point in question, passes along the northwestern bank of said creek, whilst the Pittsburgh and Western Railroad passes along the southwestern bank of the stream. These railways, together with said creek, divide said borough into two unequal portions, the main part of the borough lying to the northwest of said stream and railroads, whilst another portion, containing a population of about four thousand, is situate on the southeast side thereof.

The general power thus conferred, was modified and regulated as to the manner of its exercise by the Act of June 7,1901, P.

This legislation both original and supplemental carries with it, by necessary implication, the right of the borough in ordaining streets, either at grade or overhead or beneath the grade, to occupy such portions, as may reasonably be necessary, of the railroad property for that purpose. Besides it has been repeatedly held that where the necessity exists, the franchises of a railroad company, like other property, are subject to be taken for public use.

Allegheny Valley Railroad Company, <a href="/pa/146/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="146 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="827925" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0297-01">146 </a><a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a><a href="/pa/146/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="146 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="827925" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0297-01">Pa. 297</a>, the Supreme Court says that “Railroad coporations are the creatures of the public, and were created to serve the public in the matter of transportation of freight and passengers. It is not too much to require them to submit to a slight inconvenience where the public interests are concerned, especially where such inconveniences can be compensated in damages. Their franchises like other property, may be taken by the public for the public welfare, where there exists a necessity for such taking. We have interfered repeatedly where such an attempt has been made without any actual necessity therefor. In the case in hand, we think such necessity does exist, and the slight inconvenience to the appellant company must yield to the public good.” This was said in a case where one railroad company sought to cross another at the point where its yards were located; where much business was carried on and many tracks were required to be crossed. The controversy was between two railroad companies, corporations formed for the same purpose, of the same kind and of equal grade. So far as concerns their legal rights, both were private corporations chartered by the State to serve a public purpose, but organized by those interested therein for private gain, and if the language above quoted was applicable in that case, how much more and with greater force may it be predicated of a controversy where the public welfare, represented by the municipal authorities, is set over against the convenience of a private corporation. Both are ci*eatures of the State with this difference, however, that the municipality is itself a governmental agency whose only function is to serve the public good, which must be the first consideration. In the case of Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Balto. R. R. v. Philadelphia, 9 Philadelphia 563, wherein a motion was pending to continue a special injunction granted by the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia restraining the defendants from opening 15th street through that portion of the plaintiff’s property known as the Baltimore depot, Judge <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>Paxson -then presiding in said court, speaking of the rights of the parties in that case says: “Nor do we see any force in the objection that the opening of Fifteenth street, as proposed, would destroy the franchise of the company. That such opening would be an obstruction to the proper and ordinary working of the railroad, is doubtless true. But it would only be an inconvenience; a serious one, perhaps, but not a destruction of the franchises of the company. And such franchises are held subject to certain rights of the public. One of those rights is that of opening public highways across the track of the railroad, in order that communication between different portions of the city may not be obstructed.” Again he says: “Of the wisdom of opening the street through the Baltimore Railroad depot we express no opinion. Upon such question the action of councils is conclusive. That it will involve the city in a considerable amount of damages seems highly probable. That it will seriously embarrass the operation of a leading line of railroad and create a highway that can only be used at the peril of life and limb is equally probable. While the claim of the railroad to prevent, as a matter of right, the city from opening this street cannot be maintained as a proposition of law, it will remain for the city authorities to determine whether, as a matter of policy, it is wise to cut one of the great arteries which supply the city with its commercial blood. Upon the entering of satisfactory security by the city, we will refuse this motion and dissolve the injunction.”</p>

L. 531, had not then been passed. The General Borough Act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320, was the authority under which the streets were laid out. In so many words that act empowers boroughs to survey, lay out, enact and ordain such roads, lanes and alleys as they may deem necessary. That the ordinance is unreasonable, in view of the danger attending the use of the crossing, and the adequacy of the crossings then existing for the public need, is a view that might have been urged when the adoption of the ordinance was being considered by the borough authorities; their decision however, with respect to it, in any event would have determined the question finally. It is settled law that where the legislature in terms confers upon a municipal corporation the power to pass ordinances of a specific and defined character, an ordinance passed pursuant thereto cannot be impeached as invalid because it would have been regarded as unreasonable if passed under the incidental power of corporation, or under a grant of power general in its nature. In other words, what the legislature distinctly says may be done, cannot be set aside by the courts because they deem it to be unreasonable or against sound policy.” In the case of Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Western Bailway Company v. City of Connersville, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20U.S.%20337" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="218 U.S. 337">218 U.

This court has said that the power, whether called police, governmental or legislative, exists in each state, by appropriate enactments not forbidden by its own constitution or by the Constitution of the United States to regulate the relative rights and duties of all persons and corporations within its jurisdiction, and therefore to provide for the public convenience and the public good.”</p>

That the municipal authorities have elected to open up a new street as provided in the ordinance of June 4, 1912, instead of erecting an elevated structure along Center avenue, we take to be such an exercise of their discretion as the court is without power to restrain. There is nothing in the testimony that indicates that this exercise of discretion is arbitrary or wilful or unreasonable. It may be presumed that in exercising their discretion to open up a new street rather than to impose an elevated structure on Center avenue, already opened, they were prompted in part by, the fact that the latter alternative would entail a large expenditure of money to compensate in damages the abutting owners along the way of any elevated structure on Centre avenue. In addition to this, however, if Center avenue at grade were abandoned for an elevated structure at that point, it would leave the plaintiff company without any adequate means of reaching its depot and station at grade. We are not aware of any authority in the court or elsewhere to prevent the borough authorities from abandoning Center avenue at grade in case of the erection of an elevated structure at that point. Besides it appears from the evidence that an overhead structure upon Center avenue, with its necessary approaches, to the plaintiff’s property would be more obstructive thereof than the elevated street now proposed to be constructed.</p>

In the present case the public inconvenience which renders the elevated street necessary was created, in part, by the plaintiff’s act in crossing the existing highway at grade. It may not now complain, we think, that it is called upon to supplement the burden of expenditure thus imposed on the defendant borough, by contributing a comparatively small degree of inconvenience on its part, in order that the greater inconvenience and danger to the public growing out of the grade crossing may be avoided, especially when such contribution can be compensated in damages.</p>
