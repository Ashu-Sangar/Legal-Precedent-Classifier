The Commonwealth contended that the defendant stabbed the deceased with intent to take his life, and the defense was that the killing was accidental. The defendant testified that while he was fighting with a third person, the deceased struck him a number of times, that he was knocked down by this third person and ir. falling “put the knife in” the deceased. The court in its charge said that in its opinion defendant was not guilty of manslaughter, that “there is no evidence in this case of any heat or passion or provocation at all,” that “even the defendant does not contend that Holland (the deceased) did anything to him,” and that “there was, so far as the evidence in this case goes, on both sides, absolutely nothing that happened between this man an; • Holland, nothing at. all.” <em>Held, </em>error.</p>

We have not held, however, that he may express such an opinion where it is not warranted by the evidence or would amount to binding instructions; on the contrary, we have imposed these limitations in the cases in which his right to express an opinion was sustained: McClain v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/110/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="110 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="543733" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0263-01">110 Pa. 263</a>; Commonwealth v.

The defendant testified, inter alia, as follows: <em>&lt;r\\. </em>Did he (Donohue) strike him (the defendant) once or more than once? A. More than once, more than once. Q. How many times? A. I do not know how many trues, he always was jabbing me, and I was afraid. I am not a strong fellow. And I said, ‘What is the matter with you, Jim?’ I had the knife in my hand. I says, ‘What’s the matter with you? You. <em>fighting.’......Q.. Why did </em>you want to go in the house with the knife? A. And Swany (alias Donohue) did not leave me go, and he struck me, and when I was. going towards Swany I asked him, ‘What’s the matter with you?’ Tibien the boarding boss (the deceased) struck me, and.

If the jury had believed this evidence, they might have found that the defendant was assaulted by the deceased and Donohue immediately before the fatal wound was given, and that while smarting from the blows and in heat of passion he struck the deceased with the knife which resulted in Holland’s death. It is manifest that the evidence was vital!, / important to the defendant. If believed, it might haw justified a verdict of manslaughter. It should, therefore, have been submitted with proper instructions for the consideration of the jury. The error in telling the jury there was no such evidence was not cured by the suggestion of the court that the jury were not hound iby its opinion of the evidence. The positive declaration lay the court of the absence of such evidence could mn&gt;t be dislodged from the minds of the jury by the suggestion?! that they were the judges of the facts. Such a dee iaration Is not simply an opinion of the judge on all the evidence in the case; it is a positive instruction to <em>th </em>o jury that there is no such evi<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>dence on the question at issue, which in this case was of vital moment to the defendant.</p>

Either the contention of the Commonwealth is correct that this man was angry or cross and stepped out there and stuck this knife into Holland, or the contention of the defense is correct that it was all the result of an accident when he was knocked down.” It amounted to a binding instruction that the jury must find a verdict of murder in the first degree or of accidental homicide. It deprived the jury of the right to determine the facts upon the evidence and, if in their opinion the evidence warranted, to find the defendant guilty of manslaughter. The contention of the parties could not control the jury as to the verdict they should render. The fact that the Commonwealth urged a verdict of murder in the first degree and the defense set up accidental homicide did not prevent the jury from returning a verdict of manslaughter if, in their "judgment, the credible evidence justified such a verdict. If the jury disbelieved the Commonwealth’s testimony and gave credence to the defendant’s story that he inflicted the fatal blow when in a rage or passion caused by the assault made on him by the deceased and Donohue, the trial could have resulted in a verdict of manslaughter.
