On the contrary, after a protracted hearing and the taking of much testimony before a master, it affirmatively appeared that the appellant had accounted for every dollar he had received as treasurer for or on account of the appellee. After charging him with all the moneys he had received, the master credited him with payments exactly equalling the receipts. The account between the company and its treasurer for all moneys received by him was square; but, notwithstanding this, there followed, on June 13, 1913, a decree that he pay to the company the sum of $53,050, with interest from October 6, 1903. This decree resulted from a state of facts found by the master, which may be briefly summarized. In the spring of 1903 McHenry, the appellant, and others decided to establish a brewery at Spangler, Cambria County. Prior to the incorporation of the company he had taken title to certain lots of ground for which he paid $850.00. The charter of the appellee was left for record in the recorder’s office on July 1,1903, and the first regular meet<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>ing of the subscribers to the capital stock was held on the fifth of the following month. At this meeting all of the incorporators were present. McHenry still held title to the real estate which he had purchased for $850.00, and, carrying out a prearranged plan of the promoters of the brewery enterprise, who became the incorporators of the company, the stockholders, at the organization meeting of August 5, 1903, recommended that the directors purchase the said real estate from McHenry by delivering to him therefor full-paid capital stock of the company to the amount of $57,900. This action of the stockholders was duly recorded in the minutes of their proceedings. On the same day the directors, elected by the stockholders, held their first meeting, and, after organizing, it was resolved to purchase the said real estate from McHenry, as recommended by the stockholders. This action of the directors was duly recorded in their minutes. On October 6, 1903, certificates for $57,900 of the capital stock of the company were issued to McHenry in pursuance of the pre-existingarrangement between him and the other stockholders. He divided among them the stock thus issued to him for the real estate, each stockholder, with a single exception, receiving of the stock so issued sixty per cent, of his original subscription. Under the arrangement $6,000 of the stock went to McHenry. In this transaction no money came into his hands. On the stock issued to him the master and the court below credited him with the $850 which he had paid for the lots and with $4,00*0 in addition, paid by him for other real estate which he turned over to the company, leaving the balance charged against him $53,050.</p>
    <p id="b559-3" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[205,2120,1153,319]],["BL_560.1",560,[272,362,1166,2072]],["BL_561.1",561,[186,362,1150,810]]]'>A contention of the appellant in the court below and here was and is that the stock transaction was not within the scope and purpose of the bill, and that the decree is utterly foreign to the relief prayed for. The bill is a plain one, averring only a failure of the appellant to perform his duties as prescribed in the by-laws <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>and to account for moneys had and received by Mm in Ms capacity as treasurer of the company, and the prayer is in the usual form for an accounting. But this simple bill, having but one clear purpose, was turned by the master and the court below into one for the investigation of the way in which a large amount of stock had been issued by the company itself, and, after a finding that it had been unlawfully issued by the company to McHenry as an individual, the decree in this proceeding against him as treasurer is that he is now responsible to the company for the par value of the said stock, with interest from the date of issue. What averment in the bill supports this decree? In answer to what prayer was it made? Proceedings in equity may be elastic, but there is a limit to their elasticity. They are not to be stretched to give relief from a specific wrong not averred in a bill of complaint or to make a decree not in conformity to its prayers. This is just what was done in the case before us, and it was done in plain disregard of a rule of equity procedure laid down in all the text books and repeated time and again in chancery reports. Learned counsel for appellee make no attempt in their printed brief to justify this irregular proceeding. “The relief afforded by a decree in equity must conform to the case as made out by the pleadings as well as to the proofs.. Every fact essential to entitle a plaintiff to the relief which he seeks must be averred in his bill. Neither unproved allegations nor proof of matters not alleged can be made a basis for equitable relief. Relief cannot be granted for matters not alleged: 16 Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure, 483. Neither allegations without proof nor proof without allegations, nor allegations and proof which do not substantially correspond, will entitle complainant to relief, unless the defect be remedied by amendment: 1 Daniel’s Ch. (6th Ed.), 361, note. A complainant can be afforded such relief only as he is entitled to under the allegations of the bill: Marshman v. Conklin, <a href="/nj-eq/21/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="21 N.J. Eq. 546" data-case-ids="527561" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/21/0546-01">21 N. J. Eq. 546</a>. The order or <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>decree of a court of chancery should conform to the prayer in the bill: Horton’s App., <a href="/pa/13/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="964903" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0067-01">13 Pa. 67</a>. A master who finds that there is nothing in the testimony to sustain a bill as it is filed, should report a decree dismissing it: Morio’s App., 4 Pennypacker 398. Every averment necessary to entitle a plaintiff in equity to the relief sought must be contained in the stating part of the bill: Thompson’s App., <a href="/pa/126/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="126 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="968922" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0367-01">126 Pa. 367</a>; Pa.

Authorities need not be multiplied in support of the rule that the relief afforded by the decree must conform to the case as made out by the pleadings, and that it must be consistent with the relief prayed for. Applying this rule to the decree before us, it cannot be affirmed”: Luther v. Luther, <a href="/pa/216/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="216 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="950354" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0001-01">216 Pa. 1</a>.</p>

The decree is not for the relief of innocent stockholders who may have been wronged by the issue of the stock to McHenry, but it is that he pay into the treasury of the company, for its use and benefit, a large sum of money; and this in the face of the fact that the company had itself issued the stock to McHenry in pursuance of authority to do so given to the directors by all of the original stockholders, each of whom, with a single exception, promptly took his allotted share of the said stock. But more than this appears. More than seven years elapsed from the time the stock was so issued before the bill was filed upon which the court below made its decree; and if that decree should now be enforced, the appellant would be compelled to pay into the treasury of the brewing company more than $80,000, to enure largely to the benefit of the very men who, as original stockholders, were themselves parties to the issue of the stock to McHenry, one of whom is now the president of the company, with his name subscribed to the bill of complaint. As the decree must be reversed, <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>for the reason that it was not within the contemplation of the bill, nothing more need be said of its unconscionable character.</p>
