    <p class="syllabus" id="b373-7" data-blocks='[["BL_373.6",373,[175,744,1154,593]]]'>1. The manifest purpose of the Act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 230, is to permit city authorities to pay for benefits actually received by a city, although not embraced or provided for in a written contract for municipal improvements. It enables a city to pay an honest debt to a contractor under a written contract if two-thirds of the membership of councils, with the approval of the mayor, feel that it ought to be paid as a moral obligation, though as a legal one it has no existence. But there is no authority in councils to direct extra payment for any work or materials which are included in a written contract with the city. For what is done under such contract the contractor can receive from the municipal treasury only what the contract stipulates is to be paid to him, and councils cannot give him more.</p>

Upon the trial of an issue to determine whether the sum named in an ordinance of councils, passed by a two-thirds vote under the Act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 230, to compensate contractors for alleged extra work, includes any items which the appellants were obligated to furnish under their contract for the consideration therein named, the ordinance will make out a prima facie case for the plaintiffs, but if it includes items covered by the contract, they must be deducted from the sum appropriated by councils, which is available to the claimants only for extra work done by them which was not included in nor contemplated by the contract and for which they have not been paid. For whatever may be so due them they will be entitled to be paid out of the appropriation, and a writ of mandamus will be the appropriate process to compel payment, if refused upon demand made.</p>

The chief of the bureau of water having refused to draw the warrant for the sum appropriated, the contractors filed a petition in the common pleas for a writ of mandamus, directed to the chief of the bureau of water, the director of the department of public works and the city controller, commanding the first to draw the warrant, the second to approve it, and the third to countersign it. In their returns to the alternative writ of mandamus, the two latter officers did not deny the averments of the petition, and submitted themselves to the court. The chief of the bureau of water alleged that of the sum claimed by the plaintiffs only a part was rightfully due them on account of extra work, and alleged by an additional and distinct averment that all in excess of that amount was for items included in their contract with the city, and for which it had paid them. The lower court awarded a writ of peremptory mandamus, which was afterward set aside; subsequently plaintiffs filed a demurrer to the returns to the alternative mandamus; this was overruled and judgment was entered for the defendants; from that judgment plaintiffs appealed. <em>Held, </em>the demurrer was properly overruled but the court should have granted the plaintiffs leave to traverse so much of the return of the chief of the bureau, of water as averred in effect that councils had undertaken to pay them for specific items covered by and included in their contract.</p>

Walton, city controller of the City of Philadelphia, commanding the first to draw his warrant upon the city treasurer for the sum of $56,-077.96, the second to approve it and the third to countersign it. In their returns to the alternative writ of mandamus the two latter did not deny the averments of the petition, and submitted themselves to the judgment of the court. Dunlap, in his return, averred that the extra work done by the petitioners, outside of their written contract and not contemplated by it, amounted to but $12,726.59, which sum he admitted to be due them, but an additional and distinct averment by him was that all in excess of that amount, as it appeared from a statement of claim filed by the petitioners in an action brought by them against the City of Philadelphia in July, 1908, and which is still pending, to recover for extra work, is for items which were included in their contract with the city and for which it has already paid them. On November 27,1911, — three days after the return of the appellees — judgment was entered for the plaintiffs and a writ of peremptory mandamus was awarded as prayed for. Two days later — on November 29 — a petition was filed by a number of resident taxpayers of the City of Philadelphia, asking that the judgment be opened and that they be permitted to intervene as defendants. On the 'same day a rule was granted to show cause why the prayer of the petition should not be granted, and, after depositions taken by each side had been filed, the petition, to intervene was denied, but the order awarding the writ of peremptory mandamus was set aside.

That question was to be determined from the pleadings alone, for there was a demurrer to the returns of the defendants. That of the chief of the water bureau admitted a certain sum to be due to the petitioners for extra work which was not included in their contract, and for that sum a warrant ought to be issued to them, without prejudice to their right to demand the balance of the appropriation. Under the circumstances, when the demurrer was overruled, leave should have been granted the plaintiffs to traverse so much of the return of the chief of the water bureau as avers, in effect, that councils have undertaken to pay them for specific items covered by and included in their contract. While a demurrer admits all matter sufficiently pleaded, the court will consider the whole record in rendering judgment and see that substantial justice is done. Where a demurrer is sustained, in strict practice judgment may be entered on the demurrer, but if it is not sustained, the demurrant may have leave to plead over: Johnson’s Pennsylvania Practice, Yol. I, Chap. 32. On a traverse the issue will be, Does the sum named in the ordinance of November 10, 1911, include any items which the appellants were obligated to furnish under their contract for the consideration therein named? While the ordinance will make out a prima facie case for the claimants, if it includes items which were covered by the contract, they must be deducted from the sum appropriated by councils, which is available to the appellants only for extra work done by them which was not included in nor contemplated by the contract, and for which they have not been paid. For whatever may be so due them they will be entitled to be paid <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>out of the appropriation, and a writ of mandamus will be the appropriate process to compel payment, if refused upon demand made.</p>
