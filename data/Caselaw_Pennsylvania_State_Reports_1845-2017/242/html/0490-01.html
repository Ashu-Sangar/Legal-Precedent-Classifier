As to certain items for which claim was made,, the affidavit of defense <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>alleged that the cost of the work and materials specified therein was unreasonably high, and in excess of the market price; that plaintiff had neglected to take proper precautions so that certain plaster furnished and laid would be substantial; that an excavation for a cellar lacked the required depth; that certain plumbing for which plaintiff claimed was embraced in the original contract and was not extra work, and that certain subcontractors, who had furnished work and materials to plaintiff, for the building, had made demand upon defendant for payment therefor. The averments as to the cost of the labor and materials were not responsive to plaintiff’s claim; there was no allegation that the plaster had been laid in an unworkmanlike manner, nor did it appear how nearly the depth of the cellar approached the required depth, what items of plumbing were included in the original contract, or that plaintiff was under any legal obligation to pay the subcontractors. On a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense for so much of plaintiff’s claim as was included in the above items, the court entered judgment for plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

The plaintiff avers that plaintiff and defendants entered into a further verbal agreement whereby defendants agreed to pay plaintiff for any extra work done, the cost of the material and labor of such extra work and in addition a commission of ten per centum on said cost. In the affidavits of defense there is no denial of this contract or of its terms, nor is there any denial that the work done and materials furnished in pursuance with the agreement did not cost the plaintiff the amount charged in the statement. The defendants’ averment, that the plaintiff’s statement for actual cost was in many respects unreasonable, excessive and exceeded the market value of labor and materials in vogue at the time of the performance of the work, is not responsive to plaintiff’s claim.</p>

      <em>2. </em>The defendants allege that plaintiff neglected to have the building properly closed and heated, so that the plaster would adhere and be solid and substantial, but there is no averment that the material used was of an inferior quality, nor that the work was done in an unworkmanlike manner, nor in what respects the plaintiff was negligent in not enclosing and heating the building.</p>

The charge for the extra plumbing work is specifically set out in plaintiff’s statement, and there is no reason assigned by the defendants why they cannot now determine what are the items included in the original contract. The averment is vague and indefinite.</p>
