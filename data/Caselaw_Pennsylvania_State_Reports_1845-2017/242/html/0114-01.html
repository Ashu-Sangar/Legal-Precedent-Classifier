In an action to recover damages for the alleged unlawful diversion by the defendant of the waters of a stream on which plaintiff’s mill was located, by pumping water therefrom at various times within six years before the bringing of the action, it appeared that' after defendant’s pumping station had been installed, a sensible diminution in the flow of water had occurred, though the amount of water withdrawn did not appear. PlaintifE contended that he was thereby compelled to use power and to incur additional expense in the operation of his mill, and sought to measure his damages by these outlays. There was evidence that the diminution in the flow of water was not due entirely to defendant’s pumping. The jury was instructed that plaintiff could recover only for such expenditures as were compelled by defendant’s acts, and fdund á verdict for plaintiff which the court held excessive and reduced to a sum reasonable under the evidence for which judgment was entered. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

But it must be remembered that the pumping began in 1896, and the evidence relating to the previous volume of the stream as compared to what it was afterward, and what it was from 1904 to 1910, was only admitted to show the general fact that its volume had decreased after the defendant’s pumping began. It also tended to show whether the diminution complained of was material or not. To show the stages of the water for a reasonable time prior to the date of the first pumping was a proper method of ascertaining the average condition of the stream, and was a more reliable maner of determining the real change of the conditions than to have limited the testimony to the precise date when the pumping began, or to a very brief period immediately preceding it. This admission of the evidence of the former conditions disclosed the fact that <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>the waters of the stream, had at times, gotten so low prior to 1896, that auxiliary steam power was necessary to run the plaintiff’s mill, and that there had been wide fluctuations in the volume of the stream at different seasons.</p>
