The defendant has appealed from this settlement, and trial by jury has been waived by the parties in accordance with the Act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b196-9" data-blocks='[["BL_196.10",196,[312,1948,1159,424]]]'>The learned counsel for the defendant contends that it. is a manufacturing company and suggests that “manufacturing industries consist in the application of art, science or labor to bring about certain changes or modification of already existing material” and that manufacturing necessarily includes “the modification of material objects and their adaptation to satisfy human wants.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b196-10" data-blocks='[["BL_196.11",196,[359,2391,1109,43]],["BL_197.1",197,[199,355,1156,1311]]]'>As already stated, the president of the defendant tes<a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>tifies that the only products of the corporation are hides, horns, hoofs, bones, fat, brains, blood, materials for casing, livers, hearts, tails, tongues, tripe and beef.” Everyone of these so-called products is a part of the animal which the defendant has divided up into its constituent parts and separated from the entire body of the animal. Not one of these parts has received the application of art, science, skill or labor to bring about any change or modification in them so as to adapt them to satisfy human wants. The defendant company simply takes the animal apart and disposes of the parts or pieces in their natural condition. The purchaser of the respective parts applies to them such art, labor, skill or process as is necessary to change the parts into the desired product. The defendant sells its products as raw material and others adapt the raw material to various uses by processes of manufacture. It may be admitted that treating the hides of animals by the usual processes of tanning and producing sole leather as a finished result is manufacturing as was decided in the case of Commonwealth v. Elk Tanning Company, Commonwealth Docket, 1896, No. 598, but in the present case the hides are simply sold by the defendant company and the tanning process is applied by others.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b197-3" data-blocks='[["BL_197.5",197,[198,1677,1155,759]],["BL_198.1",198,[300,352,1159,758]]]'>Slaughtering hogs and making therefrom merchantable food such as loins, shoulders, hams, sausages, scrapple and lard is manufacturing, as was decided in Commonwealth v. Salt Company, 1 Dauphin County Reports 97, but in the present case no merchantable food is produced by the defendant company; no hams are cured and no sausages made; the meat is sold in its natural state, and others apply the various processes which adapt it for use as food. It may be conceded that “changing clay into brick by the ordinary processes of digging, tempering, moulding and burning” is manufacturing, as was decided in Commonwealth v. Excelsior Brick and Stone Company, No. 535, January Term, 1893, but the mere digging of clay and selling it to another who tern<a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>pers, moulds and burns brick therefrom is certainly not manufacturing. Farmers at times slaughter an ox, remove the hide and entrails, cut the carcass into quarters and make sale thereof, and certainly it cannot be successfully contended that in so doing the farmer is carrying on manufacturing. A farmer may fell a tree, remove the bark and sell it to a tanner, cut the trunk into various lengths and sell the parts to saw mill owners, who convert the same into lumber for the purposes of the market, and it certainly cannot be successfully contended that the person cutting down the tree, removing the bark and cutting the trunk into logs is carrying on manufacturing. He is simply preparing raw material for the process of the manufacturer.</p>
