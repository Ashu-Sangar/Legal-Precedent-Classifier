The question at the trial was whether the plaintiff was a stockholder. No verdict was rendered by the jury. After the introduction of the plaintiff’s evidence tending to establish his claim and of the defendants’ evidence in denial thereof, the trial judge at his own instance withdrew a juror and continued the case and dismissed the petition. This was done January 13, 1912. On October 15, 1912, he, by order filed, directed a verdict in favor of the defendants nunc pro tunc as of January 13, and ordered judgment to be entered thereon.</p>
