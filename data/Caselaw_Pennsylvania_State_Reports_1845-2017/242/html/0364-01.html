A statement of claim alleged that the plaintiffs had executed with the defendants a contract to underwrite an issue of bonds of a railway company and that a copy of such contract was attached to the statement. It appeared from such copy that the contract should not be binding on any signer until bonds in the sum of $565,000 had been subscribed for and that the defendants had signed as <em>subscribers; </em>but the copy did not show any signatures except those of the defendants, who had not subscribed for the whole issue.

The court sustained defendants’ demurrer to the statement and entered judgment for the defendants, and subsequently dismissed plaintiffs’ petition for a rehearing and the right to amend the statement. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>
