It begins and ends in about the usual way; it recites that the agreement was made and concluded 15th March, 1911; it binds the parties thereto, their heirs, executors and administrators; it provides distinctly what each party shall do in order to carry out the contract; it contains no intimation that a mere offer is made to the defendant; it provides for the payment of hand money and the balance on the transfer of the license by the court; it stipulates that the parties are to use their best efforts to have said transfer made and the instrument is signed and sealed by both parties. There is no uncertainty about the transferee of the license. That transfer, if made, is to be to E. J. Sullivan, the defendant. The balance of the purchase money is to be paid when the license is transferred. And it seems to necessarily follow that the <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>payment of such balance was agreed to be paid by the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[301,506,1162,857]]]'>It is not necessary for the promise to pay to be expressly set forth. The contract is to he construed as a whole. Thus we .find in 2 Page on Contracts, Sec. 1118: “Terms which can be inferred from a consideration of the entire instrument are as much a part of the contract as if exprcscly set forth therein...... Although the promise idled upon, as a consideration may not be expressly stated in any clause of the contract, still if it appears lion the entire contract that such promise is intended, it will be as binding and as much a valuable consideration as though it were expressly stated. Thus a promise to pay for realty agreed to he conveyed, or to permit the use of certain realty may he implied from the entire contract.” The principle will he found enforced Lawler v., Murphy, 20 Atl.

    <p class="summary" id="b473-3" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[189,590,1156,1088]]]'>The contention that the instrument sued on is a mere option and not a contract of sale seems to be an after thought and an excuse for non-compliance with its terms. The defendant prior to suit regarded and treated the instrument as a contract of sale; he paid five hundred dollars on account of the purchase money; he filed a petition in court for a transfer; he likewise filed an affidavit setting forth, inter alia, that he had purchased the lease, furniture, fixtures, etc., in the Pricedale House from John Uhlman subject to the transfer of the license. The license was transferred. The plaintiff, it seems, did all the contract obligated him to do. The defendant complied in every respect with the terms of the contract until after he had secured a transfer of the license. Even then he made a move to take possession, but refused when he ascertained that a third license had been granted in the village of Pricedale. He made no complaint of failure on part of the plaintiff and his only grievance was that the court granted a third license, which action did not meet with his approval.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b473-4" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[186,1689,1157,585]]]'>If the instrument is an option, when was the offer to be accepted or declined? There is no intimation in the paper itself as to the time of acceptance. Even if an option, it would appear too late to decline after the transfer of the license and after such silence had put the plaintiff to inconvenience and expense. Some incidental questions, might be worthy of consideration but without serving any good purpose as counsel for defendant frankly admit that if the instrument sued on is not an option there is nothing else to complain of in the trial of the case.</p>
