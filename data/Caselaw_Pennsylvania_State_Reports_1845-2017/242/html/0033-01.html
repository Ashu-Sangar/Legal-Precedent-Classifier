    <p id="b66-6" data-blocks='[["BL_66.8",66,[290,748,1163,972]]]'>This appeal is from an order discharging a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The action was to recover hack money paid the defendant for making for the plaintiffs four machines for mining and loading coal. By the written agreement between the parties the machines were to be similar to a machine made by the defendant for another mine owner and then in use, with such changes as might be decided upon by the defendant and the plaintiff’s manager, to whom the specifications were to be submitted. They were to be furnished at cost and “put in place and position as soon as possible in order to demonstrate their abilities.” It was alleged in the statement of claim that only two of the four machines had been furnished and that they were useless for the purpose intended. The main ground on which a recovery was sought was that there was an implied warranty that the machines would do the work for which they were ordered.</p>

These averments were sufficient to prevent judgment. The agreement itself indicates at least that the undertaking was joint and experimental.</p>
