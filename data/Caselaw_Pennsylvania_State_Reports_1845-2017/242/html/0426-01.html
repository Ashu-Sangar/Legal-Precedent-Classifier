It was said in the opinion of this court: “It may be conceded that upon the question of the contributory negligence of the appellee this is a close case, but after a careful review of all the testimony we have concluded it was for the jury.” See Reitler v. Railroad, <a href="/pa/238/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="238 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="991603" data-case-paths="/pa/238/0001-01">238 Pa. 1</a>.
