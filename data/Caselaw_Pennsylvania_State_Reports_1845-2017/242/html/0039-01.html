    <p class="syllabus" id="b71-5" data-blocks='[["BL_71.6",71,[212,718,1158,680]]]'>1. A resident and a nonresident were appointed ancillary executors of a decedent’s estate, and in accordance with the directions of the will were to operate the business left by the testator. The resident executor did not participate in the management thereof, and the nonresident executor appointed as his agent therefor a third person whose conduct was detrimental to the interests of the estate, and who was restrained at the instance of the resident executor, by injunction, from wasting its assets. Thereafter the resident executor petitioned for the removal of the nonresident executor, alleging that he was mismanaging the estate. <em>Held, </em>that the court was correct in removing such executor, where a finding that he had neglected to perform his duties, had grossly mismanaged the estate to its great injury, and had refused to appear before the court to explain his conduct, when directed so to do, was justified by the evidence.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.7",71,[214,1415,1155,222]]]'>2. In such a case, the record of injunction proceedings brought by the resident executor against the manager for the purposes of preventing the wasting of the assets is admissible in evidence, where it appears that the nonresident executor had in a letter to his attorney referred to said manager as his agent.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b71-7" data-blocks='[["BL_71.8",71,[212,1647,1157,174]]]'>3.

A. Nystrom in charge of the works. Nystrom had no experience in the. manufacture, of automobiles. C. H. Ruhl, Esq., attorney for Milton A.

Mr. Gherst testified that this letter contained a correct statement of the affairs. Milton A.' Gherst, as executor, thereafter filed a bill in. equity against Nystrom. alleging that the conduct of the said-Nystrom was detrimental to the interests of the estate of Joseph Middleby, deceased, and that he was apprehensive that the said Nystrom would remove' the property and estate from the jurisdiction of the court,' and prayed for a preliminary injunction restraining the said Nystrom from selling or disposing of any of the property of the estate and from removing the same from the premises and plant of the decedent, etc. An injunction, was granted. Thereafter the petition of &gt; Milton A. Gherst was presented and a citation awarded directed to Jeremiah J.

The court permitted the taking of depositions of G. A. Nystrom and William E. Burke in the City of Boston and overruled the motion to take the depositions of McCarthy.</p>

He was, as the court below correctly said in denying the motion for the commission, a party to the record, and, for the purpose of the estate, within the jurisdiction of the court. Nor was there error in admitting in evidence the record of the proceeding in equity between Gherst, ancillary executor, and Nystrom, for, though the appellant was no party to that proceeding, he had written, on August 10, 1912, to William J. Rourke, Esq., his attorney, as follows : “I should like you to advise Mr. Nystrom of his rights in the matter of the suit brought against him by Mr. Gherst. What I wish to avoid is any breach by him of any temporary injunction or order of the court. I should like you to prepare answer for Nystrom and submit it to me and then with your approval, file it in the case and push the case for trial without any quarter to Gherst who is deserving of no consideration.” In this letter he referred to Nystrom as his agent.</p>
