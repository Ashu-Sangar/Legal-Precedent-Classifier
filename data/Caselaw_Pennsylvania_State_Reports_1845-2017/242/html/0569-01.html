A railroad company which has not instituted condemnation proceedings for the purpose of appropriating the water of a stream, may be restrained at the suit of a riparian owner from taking the water of the stream for the purpose of generating steam in locomotives which are merely temporarily on the land in transit to other points, although proceedings for the condemnation of land on the banks of the stream are then pending. The fact that the water of the stream is more than sufficient for the use of both parties is immaterial. Scranton Gas <em>&amp; </em>Water Co. v. Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western R. B.

Defendant railroad company, a corporation having the power of eminent domain, laid out its right of way through a portion of plaintiff’s property and across a stream, over which was constructed a bridge, instituted condemnation proceedings for the taking of the land, filed its bond, and entered upon the construction of its road. Pending plaintiff’s appeal from the award of the viewers, defendant installed a pump, pipe line and water tank within the limits of the condemned land, and proposed to extract water from the stream for the purpose of producing steam for its <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>locomotives and other operating purposes. The lower court, • on plaintiff’s bill in equity, granted an injunction restraining defendant “from taking or appropriating any portion of the water from plaintiff’s property for steam-producing or operating purposes of defendant’s railroad.” <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

    <p id="b603-3" data-blocks='[["BL_603.8",603,[175,463,1160,1799]]]'>The plaintiff company, a Pennsylvania corporation, is the owner in fee of a tract of land in Somerset County containing about 168 acres, upon which it maintains a large hotel; this land lies on both sides of Casselman river, and a tributary of that stream known as Iser’s Eun flows through the portion located on the east side, comprising about fifty-four acres of timber land, which is used as a pleasure park in connection with the hotel. The defendant company is also a Pennsylvania corporation authorized to construct, operate and maintain a railroad in Somerset and Fayette Counties; it laid out its right of way through the plaintiff’s timber land and across Iser’s Eun, over which it constructed a bridge; the parties could not agree upon the price to be paid for the land taken and the defendant instituted condemnation proceedings, filed its bond and entered upon the construction of its road; the plaintiff appealed from the award of the viewers, and that action is still pending; in the meantime the defendant installed a pump, pipeline and water-tank within the limits of the condemned land, and proposed to extract water from Iser’s Eun for the purpose of “producing steam for its locomotives and other operating purposes.” The plaintiff filed a bill in equity and prayed the court to restrain the defendant “from taking or appropriating any portion of the water......from the plaintiff’s property for steam-producing or operating purposes of defendant’s railroad.” The case was heard on bill and answer; the chancellor found the facts as we have stated them, and granted the relief prayed for. The defendant has appealed and assigns for error the final decree; complaint is also made of the court’s ruling on a number of exceptions taken to its conclusions of law.</p>

The defendant did not intend to make an extraordinary use of the water upon the land, but to take it for the purpose of generating steam in locomotives which were merely temporarily thereon in transit to other points; and the case just cited decides that a use of that character will be restrained in equity; and this notwithstanding the contention there made that a railroad company cannot be restrained by another riparian owner on the same stream “from taking water for the use of its engines at a time when the flow of the stream is four times the amount needed for both parties” (see <a href="/citations/?q=240%20Pa.%20606" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="240 Pa. 606">240 Pa. 606</a>).
