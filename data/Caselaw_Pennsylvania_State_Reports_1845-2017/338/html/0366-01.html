During the year 1937, as the result of mining operations thereon, 915,815 tons of coal were taken from certain of its tracts lying in Coal ToVnship, Mount Carmel Township, and Kulpníont Boroitgh. The company’s request for a reduction of the assessments of these tracts for the year 1937 was refused by the County Board of Revision of Taxes. The company then appealed to. the court below, contending that under Section 432 of the General County Assessment Law of May 22,1933, P. L. 853, the assessments of its properties fixed at the triennium should be reduced by reason of the mining of coal therefrom. Upon the refusal of the court to grant relief this appeal was taken.</p>

No appeal was taken from this decision and the assessments therein made became final.</p>

In this manner effect should be given, so it asserts, to Section 432 of the General County Assessment Law which provides that in inter-triennial years assessments shall be changed where there has been “the mining out of coal, ore, or other minerals assessed under the triennial assessment.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

However, there is no doubt that it would contravene well-established principles to reduce the assessments of the company’s properties in exact proportion to the number of tons of coal removed from each tract. According to the company’s contention, assessments would be determined by a formula having no relation whatever to market value, whereas market value is the only permissible standard of assessment. We have repeatedly condemned the use of such mathematical shortcuts in the making of assessments. As we said in <em>D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co. v. Luzerne Co.

Undue stress is placed upon the finding of the court below, in its opinion concerning the 1936 assessment, as to the tonnage of each tract, since any tonnage figure was at best a rough estimate. Moreover, it appears that- this finding was intended to be no more than a mere indication of the weight given by the court to this one factor in determining the market value of these coal lands.</p>

In the instant case, the assessors and the board apparently disregarded the mining from the company’s property,— although we are informed that notice of this fact was given to them — taking the arbitrary position that no change in assessments would be made in inter-trienniál years.

Presumably, although it has not expressly so provided, the legislature intended that a taxpayer should bring such alterations in value to the attention of the assessor. Otherwise, an extremely heavy burden would be placed <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>upon the tax officials to discover the existence and extent of mining throughout their districts.</p>
