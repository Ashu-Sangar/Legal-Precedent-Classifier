Metzger, with whom he was then having marital difficulties, could and probably would tie up or otherwise jeopardize the rents and income therefrom to which the mother was entitled during her lifetime, by virtue of the agreement signed by his sister .and himself at the time of the original conveyance to them, and that the best interests and protection of the mother required that a re-transfer of the son’s interests be made to .her..

In such instances, there is more than the mere breach of an oral agreement; these cases involve, as Mr. Justice Cardozo pointed out in the leading case of <em>Sinclair v.

The broken agreement or promise of the appellant was made at the time his mother executed the deed to him and was the inducement to its execution; and if he could now profit from his bad faith, the Act of 1856, which is intended to prevent fraud, would itself become the instrument for the perpetration of it. Under the proviso in that act, the unkept promise of the appellant made him a trustee ex maleficio: <em>McCloskey v.

Such a confidential relation exists not only when there is a fiduciary relation such as exists between attorney and client, trustee and beneficiary, guardian, and ward,, and the like, but. also where, because of family relationship or otherwise, the transferor is in fact accustomed to be guided by the judgment of the transferee or is justified in placing confidence in the belief that the transferee'will act in the interest of the-transferor ” </em>(Italics supplied.)
