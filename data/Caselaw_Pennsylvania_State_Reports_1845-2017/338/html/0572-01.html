L. 23, are from an order of the court below determining that it has jurisdiction over the cause of action in a proceeding for the partition of several parcels of real estate, instituted by Elinor Ivory McCabe, appellee. The appeal at No. 62 is taken by all the appellants jointly and for that reason is bad; the appeals at Nos. 63, 64, 65, and 66 are taken by four of the appellants, severally, solely for the purpose of protecting themselves “from danger of inadvertently jeopardizing their rights by mistaken practice.”</p>

      <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>To the third amended bill of complaint in partition filed by the appellee, on January 4, 1939, with the consent of counsel for all parties concerned, the defendants named therein, appellants here, preliminarily objected on the ground that the bill was multifarious in that it embraced a tract of property in which less than all of the named defendants were interested. Thé'preliminary objections were ■ sustained with leave to-appellee to amend, in accordance with Equity Rule 49, by striking out the objectionable paragraphs of her third amended bill, “without prejudice to the right- of defendants to raise any questions, jurisdictional or otherwise, to the. Third Amended Bill of Complaint as so amended, by either preliminary objections or answer to the Third .Amended Bill. of Complaint.” This amendment was made by appellee, whereupon appellants presented a petition asking that the proceeding b.e dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the cause of action, under section 1 of the Act of 1925, which provides: “Wherever in any proceeding at law or in equity the question of jurisdiction over the defendant or óf the cause of action for which suit is brought is raised in the court of first instance, it shall be preliminarily determined by the court upon the'pleadings or with depositions, as the case may require; and the decision may be appealed to the Supreme or the Superior Court, as in cases of final judgments.” ■ After argument, the court below dismissed the petition-and. these appeals followed.</p>

Garland et </em>al., <a href="/pa/287/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="287 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="1099671" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0291-01">287 Pa. 291</a>. While section 1-of the Act of 1925, supra, which appellants insist affords the necessary statutory authority to maintain the present appeal; allows appeals from such interlocutory decrees for the limited purpose of questioning, before trial on the merits, “jurisdiction over defendant or of the cause of action for which suit is brought,” this Court hás repeatedly held that the question of jurisdiction over the subject-matter relates, on appeals-under the Act, solely tó the competency of the court below to determine contro véísies of the general'class to which the ease presented for its consideration belongs.

Therefore, the sole question within the scope of our inquiry on this appeal, as limited by the decisions above referred to, is whether the cause of action sued upon, to wit, parti<a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>tion of real estate, is within the general class of controversies committed to the jurisdiction of the court below. Of this there can be no doubt, in view of section 1 of the Act of July 7, 1885, P. L. 357, which provides that “The several courts of common pleas of this commonwealth shall each have all the power and jurisdiction of a court of equity in all cases of . . . partition, within their respective counties.” Appellants admit this, for they state, in their brief: “The jurisdictional defect is not in. the tribunal; it is in the fatal multifariousness of the bill by which the jurisdiction was attempted to be invoked.” Since clearly the present proceeding was within a general class of controversies which the court below is competent to determine, and since there is no question as to the court’s jurisdiction over the persons of appellants or over the property involved, the appeal will have to be dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[296,1297,1154,801]]]'>The questions which appellants, in reality, are now asking that we pass upon relate solely to whether an action for partition can be sustained where the bill of complaint embraces, inter alia, property in which not all of the parties to the proceeding are interested, and whether such a bill can be amended by the elimination therefrom of such property. While the rulings of the court below on these questions are clearly interlocutory, and subject to review by this Court only after final decree <em>(Lewis v. Beatty, </em><a href="/pa/306/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="306 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1136894" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0242-01">306 Pa. 242</a>), it might not be amiss for us now to state that we are of opinion that the appellants’ objections thereto are not well taken.
