Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1037. They asked the court to decree that “The said trustees are not under a duty to dispose of said investments as promptly as reasonably can be done without a sacrifice, but are merely under a duty to exercise the due care and prudence that an ordinary man would exercise in determining from time to .time whether to hold or sell any part or the whole of any one or more of the said investments in the same manner as if said investments were legal for the investment of trust funds under the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania” and that “The said trustees having determined in the exercise of due care and prudence that it is unwise to sell any of the said investments at the present time, are under no duty to <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>do so. . . . ” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The will contains a power to retain investments of the testator, but no power to make' nonlegal investments.</p>

L. 1037, requires the orphans’ court to take jurisdiction of their petition. The Section, as amended, provides that “Where stocks, bonds, or other securities have been distributed in kind <em>as above pro</em>videdto any fiduciary, if such fiduciary be doubtful as to the propriety of retaining or making sale of such securities, he may apply to the orphans’ court having jurisdiction of his accounts, by petition, for authority and direction to retain or sell the same; whereupon, after due notice to all parties interested, the said court shall make such order in the premises as to it may appear proper.” Appellants argue that under this Section the Court is required to take jurisdiction where the doubt of the fiduciary as to the propriety of retention or sale and reinvestment in legáis arises out of his uncertainty as to the latitude of discretion given him by the law, as well as where the doubt arises out of facts and circumstances affecting particular securities in such a way as to cause doubt as to the propriety of their retention ór sale, as the case may be.</p>

In the second place, if this Section, properly construed, requires the taking of jurisdiction of a petition which, like the present one, seeks a purely advisory opinion interpreting the law, then this Court would be obliged to hold it invalid as a legislative effort to turn the courts from tribunals organized to determine controversies judicially into those of giving legal advice, a function not contemplated by our organic law: <em>Reese </em>
