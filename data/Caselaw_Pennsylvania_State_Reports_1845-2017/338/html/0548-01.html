The evidence establishes that they were duly authorized by a resolution of the congregation which directed the Board-to borrow the money needed for the erection of its new church building, and, as security therefor, to execute the necessary notes. It was also shown that Shields, Kommer, By-bee and Philips, together with Baer as chairman, constituted the Board of Trustees at the time these three notes were executed.</p>

The evidence submitted to the jury proved, and the jury by its verdict must have found, that these four signatures were endorsed upon the notes merely as representing the personnel which constituted the Board of Trustees of the Church. Neither when the loans were first made nor at any subsequent time preceding the execution of the notes upon which these suits are brought, did plaintiff request any individual endorsements other than those of three persons, Ewalt, Clark and Shields, who admit that they agreed personally to obligate themselves. This explains why Ewalt and Clark, in adding their names as endorsers to those of the four trustees, left a space of from one-half inch to <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>an inch below the other, signatures so as to distinguish their signing as individuals from the signing by the others as trustees. Ewalt and Clark were not trustees but Shields was, and it tvas obviously for that reason that, on the third note, he signed in both capacities and therefore in both groups. In many of the notes in the renewal series, the names of the trustees were indicated as such in other ways, as, for example, by side brackets and the lateral notation “Board of Trustees,” or by some other marking of segregation. The evidence showed that, with an exception hereinafter noted, if an endorser ceased being a member of the Board he stopped endorsing the renewal notes, and as new members of the Board were chosen they became endorsers in the same manner as their predecessors in office, so that the signatories in the first group of endorsers always comprised the membership of the Board at the time óf execution of. the respective notes.</p>
    <p id="b586-4" data-blocks='[["BL_586.5",586,[283,1356,1153,589]]]'>It is argued that there was no necessity for the individual members of thé Board of Trustees to endorse the notes. This, however, is open to question, because the authority to borrow the money and to execute the notes'was given by the congregation to the Board of Trustees, and, while the execution and endorsement by the Board through its chairman and secretary may have been sufficient, it would seem natural and reasonable that the members of the Board should have considered it. proper, or even necessary* for their individual signatures to be appended.</p>

Instead of the endorsements on this note being in two groups as in the case of the others, — those of the Board members and those of the individual endorsers, — the names of Shields, Kommer, Ewalt, Clark, Bybee and Philips appear under the words “Mt. Lebanon Baptist Church, Board of Trustees” as apparently constituting the membership of the Board. Defendant Philips at that time still remained as such a member, but the term of de<a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>fendant Kommer as trustee had expired some three months before this note was executed, and, therefore, although his signature so placed indicated that he signed in a representative capacity, he was not among those authorized by the resolution of the congregation to act on its behalf. Since section 20 of the statute exempts those who sign in a representative capacity only <em>if duly authorized, </em>he has failed to bring himself under its protection and must be held liable accordingly: <em>Farmers’ Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.
