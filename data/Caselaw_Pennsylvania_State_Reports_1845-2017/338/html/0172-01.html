However, no certified copy of the lien was transmitted for indexing to the prothonotary of Lackawanna County, where the corporation had its place of business and owned a large tract of real estate, for nearly twenty-two years. During this interval the state authorities took no steps to collect the taxes. On September 27, 1937, the certified liens were filed in Lackawanna County, and the scire facias sur lien was issued against the corporate taxpayer, 'with notice to the present terre-tenant, Williams Bakery Company, ■' the appellee in this court. The amount of the taxes claimed, $826.92, with statutory interest and attorney’s commission, brings the total to approximately $3,300.</p>

The Act of April 16, 1827, P. L. 471, <em>9 </em>Sm. Laws 433, sec. 4, provided that the Auditor General should be <em>“authorized- and required </em>to transmit to the prothonotaries of the respective counties, to be by them entered of record, certified copies of the liens” thereafter arising under the Act of 1811, above quoted. The Act of 1827 was thus mandatory in its' provisions as to the transmission of liens for recording in the counties and- it was so construed by this court. It was held that if the provision was' not complied with and the lien was not filed in the county where the real estate of the. taxable was located, subsequent lien .creditors took precedence over the' claim of the Commonwealth. This Court, <em>In re Wilson, </em><a href="/pa/4/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="401925" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0164-01">4 Pa. 164</a>, said at page 165: “The account settled by the auditor-general at common law, gave the Commonwealth no lien. The Commonwealth’s lien on the land of her debtor is. created and- exists in pursuance of the acts of the legislature! Both acts are -to be -taken together. Our legislature have uniformly discountenanced all liens and encumbrances from transactions that do not appear of record. <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%2073" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Serg. &amp; Rawle 73">7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 73</a>. The Act of 1811 gave the Commonwealth a lien on all lands of the debtor within the state. The Act of 1827 did not abridge'that lien, but made it the duty of the auditor-general to file the lien in the county where the debtor resided, for the purpose of notice. Every citizen interested could go there and examine; and if the auditor-general had done-his duty, he could have saved the lien of the Commonwealth. The settlement not being placed of record in Washing<a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>ton County, the lien created by the first act was not notice to judgment creditors. It is the duty of the officers of the state to obey the acts of the legislature.

L. 112, sec. 14, although it was held not to have repealed the Act of 1811, supra, was so similar to it as to be almost identical. It gave the Commonwealth a lien on the franchises and property, real and personal, of corporations subject to the state taxes imposed by the act, among them a capital stock tax, “from the time the said taxes are due and payable.” In <em>Wm. Wilson &amp; Son Silversmith Co.’s </em>Assigned <em>Est., </em><a href="/pa/150/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="150 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="834412" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0285-01">150 Pa. 285</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20A.%20636" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="24 A. 636">24 A. 636</a>, we again sustained the mandatory provision of the Act of 1827, supra, with respect to the filing of liens for Commonwealth taxes in the respective counties, as affected by the Act of 1879, supra, and again held that unless this was done the tax failed of priority as against judgment creditors. We pointed out that the Act of 1811, as well as that of 1879, applied to all public funds or moneys, as well as taxes, of whatever character, due the Commonwealth and settled by the auditor-general, and we declared the following (pp. 289-290) : “The Act of 1827, sec. 4, Purd. 1386, pi. 30, prescribes the duty of the auditor-general in all cases arising under the Act of 1811, and although that act does not declare that the lien shall not prevail if the duty to file a certified copy is not performed, yet we have held that such is the consequence of a noncompliance with the act. . . . Other lien creditors have the same right to notice under the Act of 1879 as under the Acts of 1811 and 1827, and we can see no reason why <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>the rule of duty applicable in the one class of cases is not equally applicable in the other. . . . Hence the Act of 1827, which prescribes the duty of filing a copy in the county of the debtor is just as applicable to the settlement of taxes under the Act of 1811, whether they are created by that act or by acts of later date. We find nothing in the Act of 1879 which conflicts, or is inconsistent, with this view of the subject. The reasons of public policy, which is averse to secret liens, are quite as applicable against taxes created by the Act of 1879 or any other acts as they were against such liens under the Acts of 1811 and 1827.”</p>

L. 955, an important procedural change in the collection of state taxes was made. As already pointed out, the Act of 1827, supra, sec. 4, was mandatory in nature and “authorized and required” the auditor-general to transmit the certified liens for state taxes or claims to the counties for filing. Section 2 of the Act of 1911, however, merely provided that the auditor-general <em>“may at any time </em>transmit to the prothonotaries of the respective counties of the Commonwealth, to be by them entered of record, certified copies of all liens for State taxes,” etc., and in section 3 of the act it was directed that it should be the “duty” <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>o;f the auditor-general to issue to any party applying therefor, apon payment of a feé of 25-cents, a certificate showing- “the character and amount of all liens that may he of record &gt;in his department against any corporation . . . under the provisions of this act or any other law of this Commonwealth.” • The fourth section of the act repealed the fourth section of the Act of 1827, supra. The : Act of 1911, supra, was in force when the taxes sought to be collected- in the present suit were assessed, and had been in force for some years prior to that time. It may be noted that section 1 of the Act of 1911 substantially reenacted the provisions of the prior Acts. of 1811, 1879 and 1889, and directed that “all State taxes imposéd under the authority of any law of this Commonwealth now existing or that may- hereafter- be enacted, and unpaid bonus, interest, penalties, and all public accounts settled against any corporation, company, association, joint-stock association, or limited partnership, shall be a :first lien upon the franchise and property, both real and personal* of such corporation* company, association, joint-stock association* or limited partnership, from the date when they are settled by the Auditor General and approved by the State Treasurer; . .- ..” This section of the Act of 1911, supra (72. PS sec. 3342) ,- was amended by the Act of April 12, 1923, P. L. 63, and has been continued in force by the almost identical provision of section 1401 of The Fiscal Code of April 9, 1929, P. L.-343, as last amended by the Act of June 11, 1935, P. L. 303 (72 PS sec. 1401) ; whereas section 3 of the Act of 1911, supra, has now become section 213 of The Fiscal Code,.supra (72 PS Sec. 213). These later changes have made no difference, however, in the rule embodied in the Act of 1911, supra, which is still the guide for the fiscal administration by the Commonwealth of. its liens for taxes.</p>

It was thenceforth sufficient, in order to establish the lien, for the Commonwealth to settle the tax in the auditor-general’s office in Harrisburg. The judgment creditor of or bona fide purchaser from the party against whom the taxes were assessed was thereafter required, for his own protection, to consult the auditor-general’s records .or indices in the State Capitol, where a search .could be obtained for a small fee. The judgment indices in the county could not be exclusively relied upon. The purchaser later received the further protection, in 1929, by Section 1403 of The Fiscal Code, supra, of being entitled, on a bulk sale of 51 per cent or more of the real or personal property of the taxable corporation, to be supplied with a certificate from the Department of Revenue, to be delivered by the seller, showing the payment of all state taxes assessed to the date of transfer: 72 PS sec. 1403. As we pointed out in <em>Traction Materials Co. v. P., McK. &amp; W. Ry. </em>Co., <em>(No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/261/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="261 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1042172" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0153-01">261 Pa. 153</a>, 159, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20552" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="104 A. 552">104 A. 552</a>, the Act of 1911, supra, dispensed with the necessity of filing the lien of record. This change was considered by the Superior Court in <em>Lewis v. Wyalusing </em>Light, <em>Heat &amp; Power Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/62/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="62 Pa. Super. 282" data-case-ids="455248" data-case-paths="/pa-super/62/0282-01">62 Pa. Superior Ct. 282</a>, 286, where that court said: “As stated before, the Act of 1911 did away with the requirement of the Act of 1827 which compelled the Commonwealth to transmit a certified copy to the prothonotary of the county to be entered in his office and in lieu thereof it provided that the auditor-general should, upon the payment of a fee of twenty-five cents, give to any one interested a certificate showing the amount of all tax liens against any corporation. In other words, the manner and place of getting information as to State taxes was changed. This was a mere change of procedure and affected no rights. No one has any vested right in a particular remedy. If the records of a certain office are notice to every one as to matters therein appearing, the legislature may, in its wisdom, unless prevented by some <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>constitutional restriction, at any time provide that thereafter such records shall be kept in some other office. Certainly no one would think that such an act changing the place where one must go for such information in regard to liens of a certain character deprived him of any right. The argument advanced that the Act of 1911 created secret liens and was thus against public policy, deserves no extended notice. Information that may be obtained by application to the auditor-general’s office and which is certified by said office for a fee of twenty-five cents can hardly be characterized as secret.” In that case liens not filed of record, which became such prior to the passage of the Act of 1911, supra, were disallowed, but those for taxes settled subsequent thereto were accorded priority.</p>

The conclusion is inescapable here that the Commonwealth did all that it was required to do, to establish the priority of its liens for the 1914 taxes, by settling them in the office of the auditor-general prior to sale by the Central Realty Company, the taxable, of the real property now belonging to appellee. Upon settlement the liens attached, and no subsequent legislation has diminished the right of the Commonwealth in respect thereto. The terre tenant cannot be judicially relieved of the consequences of its failure to search the title to the land which it purchased.</p>

This section, after declaring all state taxes to be a first lien on the property of the taxpayer and payable first out of the proceeds of any judicial sale of the property, continues: “ . . . but the lien of transfer inheritance taxes shall be limited to the property chargeable therewith, and, unless <em>such </em>

This construction is borne out in the amending Act of June 11, 1935, P. L. 303, which, among other changes inserted a period before the word “but” and made a new sentence of the proviso we have referred to.</p>

The rule was thus expressed by Justice Mitchell, in <em>Ash’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/202/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="202 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="992287" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0422-01">202 Pa. 422</a>, 424, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20A.%201030" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="51 A. 1030">51 A. 1030</a>: “When the commonwealth comes into its. courts, it is subject like all other suitors to the established rules of evidence. It must meet the burden of proof, its evidence must be relevant, material, the best attainable, and must be presented in due order under the regular rules of procedure. In all such respects it stands upon the same footing as ordinary litigants. Statutes of limitation do not apply to it. . . . But rules of evidence and legal presumptions are not changed for or against the state as a suitor. A statute of limitation is a legislative bar to the right of action, but the presumption of payment from the lapse of time is not a bar at all but simply a rule of evidence, affecting the burden of proof: <em>Miller v. Williamsport Overseers, </em><a href="/pa-super/17/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="17 Pa. Super. 159" data-case-ids="835158" data-case-paths="/pa-super/17/0159-01">17 Pa.
