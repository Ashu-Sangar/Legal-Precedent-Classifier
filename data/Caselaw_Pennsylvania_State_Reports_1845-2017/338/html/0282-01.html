    <p id="b315-9" data-blocks='[["BL_315.13",315,[166,1239,1159,647]]]'>In this appeal by Butler County from the dismissal of its exception to the report of viewers, we have presented as the question involved: When an order of the Publie Service Commission, from which no appeal, was taken, abolished a grade crossing and directed that all public utilities remove their facilities within the new right of way at their own expense, under the provisions,of the Act of July 17, 1917, P. L. 1025, as amended, 66 PS Sec. ,574, can a water company in a claim for damages, in addition .to recovering damages for land taken, also recover the cost of removing, its facilities as a separate and additional item of damage?</p>
    <p id="b315-10" data-blocks='[["BL_315.14",315,[173,1899,1152,260]]]'>. .The report of the viewers awarded $900 for land taken and $2,647.85 for the relocation of facilities which, in the main, consisted of its pipes which could not be maintained in their original location because piers of the new overhead bridge were placed over them.</p>
    <p id="b315-11" data-blocks='[["BL_315.15",315,[172,2172,1153,264]],["BL_316.1",316,[269,358,1152,864]]]'>It is argued by appellant that because the water, company is subject to regulation under the police power, the action of the Commission in compelling it, under the Act of 1917, at its own expense, to relocate its; equipment and facilities, deprives the water company of any <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>right to recover the expensé of relocation in this proceeding. We are not prepared to go this far, nor do we think the position can be constitutionally justified. The order of the Commission and the Act of 1917 have no bearing on the question in issue here. As státed by the court below, “the act has nothing whatever to do with the right of a public service company to be compensated for property taken, injured or destroyed in the abolition of a grade crossing of a highway. It is regulatory and covers the power of the Commission to say what shall be done, by whom it shall be done and who shall pay for the doing in the first instance.” This was recognised by the Commission itself when in a subsequent order it was stated that there was no intention to deprive the water company of damages. The- facilities are on the water company’s land, part of which is appropriated.</p>

The true measure of damages is the difference between the value of the property, before and after the appropriation. The cost of removal of things on the land to a different location is not allowable as a separate element of damage, but may be taken into account in fixing the before and after value: <em>Becker v.
