    <p id="b455-4" data-blocks='[["BL_455.7",455,[169,806,1153,1469]]]'>September 30, 1931, the McKeesport bank was appointed guardian for Edmundson by the common pleas of Allegheny County. Edmundson had an account with the Dollar Savings Bank, which, on the production of a certified copy of the order of the McKeesport bank’s appointment, paid the deposit to the guardian. Edmundson also had a deposit in the Irwin Savings and Trust Company, a bank doing business in Westmoreland County. That bank filed a petition in the common pleas of Allegheny County to vacate the appointment of the McKeesport bank as guardian and on June 13, 1932, the petition was dismissed. The Irwin bank then appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed the order dismissing the petition and remitted the record “to the court below with directions to hear witnesses, and decide from the evidence the ‘residence’ of Grant Edmund-son at the time the original proceedings in this case were instituted; and if found to be in Westmoreland County, to revoke the appointment of guardian.” <a href="/pa-super/109/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="109 Pa.

The hearing was had and on October 4, 1933, the appointment of the McKeesport bank was revoked. On November 9, 1933, the common pleas of Westmoreland County appointed the appellant trust company guardian. From the order of appointment, the McKeesport bank appealed and the Superior Court affirmed the decree: <a href="/pa-super/113/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="113 Pa.

The trust com<a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>pany entered an appearance de bene esse and objected to the audit and confirmation, and the account was neither audited nor confirmed.</p>
    <p id="b456-4" data-blocks='[["BL_456.5",456,[269,527,1152,425]]]'>June 25, 1935, the trust company brought this action to recover the amount to Edmondson’s credit November 9, 1931, when the defendant Dollar Savings Bank paid it to the McKeesport bank, guardian, as has been stated. The Dollar Savings Bank brought in the McKeesport bank as additional defendant and the trial resulted in the judgments from which the trust company took this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b456-5" data-blocks='[["BL_456.6",456,[263,965,1155,1080]]]'>It seems unfortunate that the small estate of the ward should be dissipated by the expense of all this litigation, some of which, at least, we think might have been avoided. In the course of the trial the account of the McKeesport bank as guardian, the same account on file and unaudited in the common pleas, was examined; evidence was put in to show that the expenditures, for which credit was claimed in. the account, had been made, a number of the expenditures having been ordered by the court. In instructing the jury the learned trial judge referred to the fact that some expenditures had been ordered by the court and that some of the others “were properly made”. It appeared by the account that the McKeesport bank still had in its possession $25.04 of the ward’s estate and that, as the learned judge said, “In addition to that, it is my finding that it paid out improperly $75.00 which was the amount over and above the contract price of building the house. ... It should have in that instance secured an order of Court, in our opinion, and therefore, it should be surcharged.”</p>

The reason for subsequently granting the McKeesport bank’s motion for judgment n. o. v. need not be stated because in our view of the case the guardian’s account could not <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>be audited — for that was what was attempted — in this action.</p>

It was not accurate to say, as appellant does, that the appointment and the proceedings were void. They were voidable on a showing, such as was subsequently had, that the jurisdictional fact was not as it had been alleged in the petition, which, without the subsequent trial, would have supported the appointment. <em>Zeigler v.
