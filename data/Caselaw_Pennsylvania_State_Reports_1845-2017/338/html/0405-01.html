The court said: “In fixing the amount of the assessment we must take into consideration the fact that, due to insolvency, bankruptcy, death, etc., the assessment cannot be collected from every subscriber; and it is therefore essential that the amount of the assessment be large enough to permit allowance to be made for such contingencies; <em>Buckley v.

The Act, as amended April 9, 1929, P. L. 464, 40 PS section 964, provided: “Section 1004. Declaration to Be Filed with Insurance Commissioner ; Contents.— Such subscribers, so contracting among themselves, shall, through their attorney, file with the Insurance Commissioner of this Commonwealth a declaration, verified by the oath of such.attorney, setting forth: . . . (d) A copy of the form of power of attorney, or other authority of such attorney, under which such insurance <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>is to be effected or exchanged, and which shall provide that the liability of the subscribers, exchanging contracts of indemnity, shall make provision for contingent liability, equal to not less than one additional annual premium or deposit charged.” If subscribers were not advised of this provision, their ignorance will not constitute a defense to the demand for payment; they could only become parties to such reciprocal insurance on the terms allowed by the legislature. If their agreements included provisions prohibited by or inconsistent with the statute, such provisions are nugatory. And this was understood by such of the subscribers as participated in policies in form like the one included in the record at p. 65a, for it contained a provision saying: “Any and all provisions of this policy which are in conflict with the statutes of the State wherein this policy is issued and/or effective are understood, declared and acknowledged by Keystone Indemnity Exchange to be amended to conform to such statutes.” Policies which did not have such a provision must nevertheless be considered as if they contained it. The amendment of 1929, providing the liability to pay a sum equal to not less than one annual premium, supplements section 1004 and fixes the maximum that may be demanded by the commissioner if liquidation becomes necessary pursuant to the Insurance Department Act of 1921, P. L. 682. We can find nothing in the statute that would support the right of a subscriber to restrict the liquidator’s assessment to less than the subscriber’s total liability by the application of the ratio proposed in appellants’ statement of the second question involved. Equity will limit his payment to what is needed to discharge debts and expenses, and the order appealed from provides that any part of the assessment not required on distribution shall be repaid to the subscriber. While unable to point to any provision in the statute restricting the rate of the assessment, appellants contend that the parties, by their policy contracts, have imported into the transaction a <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>limitation of liability not contained in the words of the statute. In the record, supplemental to what had been printed when the case was here before, are two forms of policy and our attention was particularly directed to the opening words of one of them as typical: “The Subscribers to Keystone Indemnity Exchange, severally, but not jointly, each rateably with other subscribers, but not one for the other, and represented by Keystone Indemnity Company, Attorney-in-fact ...” agree, etc. If the only effect that can be given to these words is to relieve the subscriber from an obligation imposed on him by the statute, it is ineffective for the purpose, as we said before: <a href="/pa/335/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="335 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1193013" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0333-01">335 Pa. 333</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20821" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="6 A.2d 821">6 A. 2d 821</a>. On the other hand, if the contract is construed to mean that each subscriber shall be contingently liable for the payment of an additional annual premium, but shall not be liable to satisfy any part of another’s contingent liability to pay such additional premium, the words will be satisfied and the construction will be consistent with the statute. This single obligation, however, is to pay the additional premium and is not discharged until the subscriber has paid it; no one is under joint liability with the subscriber to pay that sum, if assessed, and he need join no one in paying another’s assessment. There is, in that view, no joint liability; both the statute and the policy contracts are satisfied by that construction. Appellants, however, appear to say: When we deny joint liability we do not mean that we agreed not to be jointly liable for each other’s additional premium, but we mean that it was agreed we should not pay our full assessment unless every other subscriber also pays his; that, if anyone became insolvent, or for any reason could not pay, then (in the words of the stipulation) “. . . each subscriber is liable only for the same proportion of his annual deposit premium as the total losses, however defined, occurring during the term of his policy bear to the total amount of premiums collected during the same period.” Or, to illustrate it, as we understand the con<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>tention, if the total loss is $100,000 and the total of the subscribers’ contingent liability assessment is $200,000, the subscriber’s total liability will be one-half of the contingent liability imposed on him by the statute whether or not any money can be realized on other assessments. In that view, creditors could never be paid in full unless every subscriber paid his assessment. On the other hand the Commonwealth and the non-subscribing creditors, who are appellees, contend that the contingent liability which the law imposed, and which was in an amount “equal to not less than one additional annual premium” must be paid in full by each subscriber if that amount is needed to pay all the liabilities. The legislature dealt with various forms of insurance; had before it a long experience with non-assessable and assessable forms of insurance; contemplated liquidation and provided in the amendment of 1929 that each subscriber must be prepared to make the additional payment if the contingency of insolvency required it. The words used in the statute are to be given the construction required by the context in which they were used.</p>

It may be that the legislature thought that the creditors’ experience with the reciprocal insurance as conducted by the William Penn Motor Indemnity Exchange required correction and for that reason, in the next session of the legislature, imposed the contingent liability by the amendment of 1929, Appellees also call attention to the fact that the power of attorney given by the subscribers to the Keystone Indemnity Exchange is in general terms and, to that extent at <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>least, in harmony with the statute and that it will not authorize the writing of a policy which limited liability otherwise than as allowed by the statute.</p>

As has been said, the statute imposed obligations which each subscriber must be held to have assumed; one of them was to pay at the rate specified for the purpose of raising the fund necessary to liquidate the business.
