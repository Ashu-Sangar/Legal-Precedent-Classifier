Harriman, a resident of the State of New York, executed deeds of trust assigning and transí erring to a trust company in New York and two individual residents of New Yoi*k certain bonds and stocks in trust “for the sole and exclusive use and benefit of Carol A. Harriman [who was the daughter of <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>the grantor and is referred to in the second deed as Carol Harriman Smith] during her natural life.” The trustees were to invest and reinvest the securities in their discretion and to pay the net income to Carol A. Harriman (Carol Harriman Smith) during her life, the property at her death to be transferred and delivered to her surviving children and the issue of deceased children, or, if there were no such children or issue, to the other children of the grantor and their issue. The securities at all times have been kept in a safe deposit box in the vaults of the trust company in New York. The life beneficiary (by re-marriage Carol Harriman Stewart) is now a resident of the State of Pennsylvania. In a rider to her State personal property tax return for the year 1937 she stated: “The taxpayer’s valuation of the securities held in said trust, based upon her present age of 47 years, is $1,899,506. The taxpayer received an income from said securities in the year 1936 of $140,088.29.” In the same rider, however, she claimed that her equitable interest was not taxable. The valuation thus fixed by her was 53.9% of the market value of the securities on January 1, 1937. After some intermediate proceedings of no present significance, the Department of Revenue accepted the taxpayer’s valuation and assessed the tax thereon, including interest, at $8,148.88. An appeal by the taxpayer to the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County was sustained, from which judgment the Commonwealth now appeals to this court.</p>

It must first be determined, therefore, whether appellee’s right to the income of the trust for life constitutes an equitable interest in personal property. For many years academic authorities, in learned articles, have argued the question of the real nature of a beneficiary’s interest in a trust, — among them Maitland, Holdsworth, Ames, Langdell, Pound, Scott, and Stone (now Mr. Justice <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>Stone of the Supreme Court of the United States). According to the one school, the rights of the beneficiary-are merely in personam, that is, only against the trustee and without any property right in the trust res itself, a mere chose in action. This view undoubtedly represents the early juridical conception of the status of a cestui que trust. But the modern trend of equity jurisprudence has inclined toward the doctrine that, in addition to rights against the trustee, the beneficiary also has rights in rem, an actual property interest in the subject-matter of the trust, an equitable ownership of the trust res.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

A proceeding by the beneficiary or his assignee for the enforcement of rights in and to the property . . . could not be treated as a suit on a contract, or as a suit for the recovery of the contents of a chose in action, or as a suit on a chose in action”: <em>Brown v. </em>Fletcher, <a href="/us/235/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="235 U.S. 589" data-case-ids="3674745" data-case-paths="/us/235/0589-01">235 U.

Appellant submits that ownership of the trust certificate is evidence of his interest in the land, legal title to which the trustee holds. . . . Apparently no opinion of any court definitely accepts the theory now advanced by appellees, but some writers do give it approval because of supposed consonance with general legal principles. . . .

By virtue of that interest he was entitled to enforce the trust, to have a breach of trust enjoined and to obtain redress in case of breach. The interest was present property alienable like any other, in the absence of a valid restraint upon alienation. . . . The assignment of the beneficial interest is not the assignment of a chose in action but of the ‘right, title and estate in and to property.’ ”</p>

Whilst the cestui que trust of the bonds in question may not ‘possess’ them, he may in some sense be said to own them. . . . We are of opinion that the bonds of the Lehigh Yalley Railroad Company, held in trust by corporations, were properly taxable, not in the name of the corporations holding them, perhaps, but in the name of the beneficial owners thereof. If this were not so, the holders of corporate bonds would have it in their power, at their pleasure, by a mere transfer and deposit in trust for their own use, or the use of another, to place their bonds outside of the operation of this act, and by a mere device or shabby trick to evade the payment of a state tax thereon. There is neither reason nor authority to support such a proposition; it is absurd to suppose the legislature could have so intended.”</p>

There are many circumstances in which more than one state may have jurisdiction to impose a tax and measure it by some or all of the taxpayer’s intangibles. . . . She [testatrix] . . . created two sets of legal relationships resulting in distinct intangible rights, the one embodied in the legal ownership by the Alabama trustee of the intangibles, the other embodied in the equitable right of the decedent to control the action of the trustee with respect to the trust property and to compel it to pay over to her the income during her life, and in her power to dispose of the property at death. ... In effecting her purposes, the testatrix brought some of the legal interests which she created within the control of one state by selecting a trustee there and others within the control of the other state by making her domicile there. ... We find it impossible to say that taxation of intangibles can be reduced in every case to the mere mechanical operation of locating at a single place, and there taxing, every legal interest growing out of all the complex legal relationships which may be entered into between persons.” The case of Graves v. Elliott is substantially to the same effect.

All that the Constitution requires is, not that there be no classification of the subjects of taxation, but that it be based upon some valid reason: <em>Commonwealth v.

It is argued that the tax here is invalid because only the equitable interest is taxed if the trustee is a non-resident, whereas, in the case of a resident trustee, the entire corpus is taxed. In both cases, however, the tax is assessed on the value of the property taxable in Pennsylvania. Less than such a base of taxation the State need not, more it constitutionally cannot, adopt. A classification can scarcely be said to be unreasonable when compelled <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>by constitutional limitations: see <em>Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co. v.

The right to receive income, however, is the most valuable and distinctive attribute of ownership, and there is no reason why the state, in imposing a tax, may not segregate those having a right to income from the property and those not having such a right. While the State Personal Property Tax Act <em>expressly </em>limits the taxation of an <em>equitable </em>interest to cases where the owner thereof is entitled to receive income from the trust, the same limitation would seem to be implicit in the ordinary case of <em>legal </em>ownership of personal property, although, of course, if the right to receive income exists, the property is taxable whether income is actually received or not.</p>
