Clabby, who died unmarried on July 21,1922, possessed of an estate of $821,679.59, invested almost exclusively in nonlegal securities. Under the terms of his will, he bequeathed to a brother, Thomas F. Clabby, one-half of his estate absolutely, naming him as executor and trustee. He gave the residue in trust to divide the net income into four equal parts, and to pay one part to each of his three sisters, Ella J. Cooper, Mary A. Messier and Maggie Ann Butler, and to another brother, William P. Clabby, during the life of each one. He directed that upon the death of any of them, the share of income theretofore paid to the deceased sister or <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>brother be then paid to his nieces, Agnes Marie McCann, Ethel Messier, and Helen Butler, or their issue, share and share alike. Upon the decease of the sisters and the brother, it was provided that each niece, upon attaining the age of thirty years, receive an equal portion of the corpus of the estate, the issue of a deceased niece to take the parent’s share by substitution.</p>

A controversy arose at that time because the executor had not converted a block of 16,670 shares of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, which constituted the largest single investment of the estate. A surcharge was refused, but the court suggested that the executor “as a fiduciary . . . should rid himself as quickly as possible, of all securities which are not legal investments.” The estate also owned 1,000 shares of Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, and 200 shares of Philadelphia Traction Company.</p>

It shows that the securities of the. estate were then almost completely liquidated by the executor, and the proceeds reinvested in legal securities. For the interests of Ethel M. Kydd and Helen B. Emrey there were awarded to the trustee securities of a value of $219,313.45, all in legal investments, excepting only 333% shares of Philadelphia Bapid Transit Company and 66% shares of Philadelphia Traction Company, while to the remainder interest of Beatrice M. de Lozada securities valued at $136,-129.39 were allotted, which included 166% shares of Philadelphia Transit Company and 33% shares of Philadelphia Traction Company.

The trustee’s first account was approved by all parties in interest, and an adjudication by the court below, dated November 1, 1928, awarded the corpus to be retained by the trustee in the two segregated funds for the purposes of the trust.</p>

The auditing judge recognized this fact when he said: “It is therefore with regret that I enter a surcharge in this case, especially in view of the fact that the condition of this estate as a whole is far better than is usually found in estates of this size in these days.” And again he said, “the stock which has been directed to be replaced with cash forms but a small part of this estate and . . . the rest of the assets are gilt-edge bonds of unquestioned security ...” Moreover, it is significant as attesting the successful management of this estate that only two of the four trust beneficiaries, representing but a one-third remainder interest, are dissatisfied and have attempted to place this charge upon the estate of the deceased fiduciary.</p>

The question is, did they consent to the retention of the shares so that they are estopped from demanding a surcharge. In 1923 they joined in an effort to hold the executor responsible for the failure to sell the shares of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, but on September 4, 1923, the attorney representing them wrote to counsel for the trustee: <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>“In reference to the shares ... of the Philadelphia Bapid Transit and Philadelphia Traction Company, my clients will he satisfied to have you retain them for the present.” In 1928 the trustee’s first account showed that the shares of stock were included as part of the trust assets, yet no complaint was made by either of the ex-ceptants.

In consequence, both Mrs. Cauffman and Mrs. Emrey (the latter became an income beneficiary in 1925) knew that the investments were still in the hands of the trustee, yet no demand was made by them for the sale of these shares.

For fourteen years after provisionally approving the retention of these shares the exceptants indicated no change of intention concerning them. Their contention that they expected the trustee to observe the warning of the auditing judge in 1923 to sell all nonlegal securities, carries little <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>■weight at this time in view of the letter of September 4, 1923, of their acquiescence in the retention of these shares by their approval of the account filed in 1928, and of their receipt of the dividends with full knowledge of the existing circumstances.

The false optimism of the period is aptly expressed in <em>Seamans’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/273/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="273 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1070806" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0341-01">supra.</a><a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> It would have appeared to be folly for the trustee to “jettison seasoned investments” of this sort at such a sacrifice. See <em>Coggins’ Appeal, </em>supra, (p. 445). At no time after 1931 could these shares have been sold except at great loss to the estate, and they represented but one-tenth of its assets. To make our after-sight the sole judge of the trustee’s prudence in this matter would manifestly be unfair: <em>Brown’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/273/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="273 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1070806" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0341-01">supra,</a> (p. 503).</p>

This instrument, on its face, could not have the broad effect attributed to it by the court below. It merely empowered the attorney-in-fact to hold the trust assets for safekeeping, to collect income and to distribute it under the <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>terms of the will. The agent was given no power over investments, and the actual management of the trust remained at all times in the hands of the trustee. The delegation of such purely ministerial duties is a common practice in trust administration, and we all agree that it was not improper. The power bestowed by the fiduciary upon the agent was entirely dissimilar to that considered in <em>Bohlen’s Estate, <a href="/pa/75/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="75 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="1036680" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0304-01">75 </a></em><a href="/pa/75/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="75 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="1036680" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0304-01">Pa. 304</a>, and that given in <em>Iscovitz’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/319/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="319 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1162352" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0277-01">319 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/319/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="319 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1162352" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0277-01">277</a>. </em>In <em>Beamans’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/273/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="273 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1070806" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0341-01">supra,</a> the advisory powers of the attorney-in-fact were so broad that the fiduciary felt relieved of responsibility for investments, and the agent actually purchased securities for the estate without consulting him.
