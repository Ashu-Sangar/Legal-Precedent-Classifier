The revenue difficulties of the .City of Philadelphia during recent years are well known and are spread over , the records and reported cases of this court. It. is matter of common knowledge that frequent appeals on behalf of the city were made to the legislature. The Act of 1932 was an expression of the legislative intention to increase the taxing power of the city. It must be conceded that in delegating the power to tax (1) a privilege (2) a transaction (3) subject. (4) occu<a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>pation (5) personal property, more specific definition might in some instances have resulted in greater certainty of the interpretation intended. Out of the classes mentioned in the act, “transaction” is the word now for special consideration because that is the word used in the ordinance. The legislature expressly provided that the city should not tax what the state was then thxing and that the right of thé city to collect a tax should cease'if the state subsequently taxed the same thing.</p>
    <p id="b357-3" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[157,862,1155,856]]]'>As the Sley System Garages is a corporation and challenges the ordinance on the ground that the corporation pays certain state taxes and theréfore cannot be taxed by the city, we begin with the state of the law when the legislature passed the enabling act. The Capital Stock tax was then familiar, and we think it must have been generally understood that thn corporation’s liability to a capital stock tax would not prevent the city from taxing corporate transactions merely because the gains or losses from such transactions would be reflected in the value of the capital stock. The stock tax is a tax on property ; the tax imposed by the ordinance is an excise tax. -Nor is the tax on the parking transaction in conflict with payment of a mercantile, license tax if the operator of the parking lot also deals in automobile accessories. '</p>
    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.5",357,[156,1739,1154,369]]]'>But the argument continues that by subsequently subjecting corporations to the corporate net income tax<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the. legislature manifested its intention to repeal the power theretofore granted to tax these parking transactions if conducted by corporations; it is certain that the act does not say so and we find nothing from which such intention can be implied. . , '</p>
    <p id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[156,2120,1152,154]],["BL_358.1",358,[275,361,1152,1631]]]'>Taxes are commonly divided into property taxes and excise taxes though the difference between them is frequently disregarded and the names applied in legisla<a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>tion are not always consistent or conclusive. This court is committed to the view that the corporate net income tax is a property tax.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The tax imposed by the ordinance is an. excise tax and therefore cannot be in conflict with the state act taxing property. What the ordinance taxes is the “transaction”, the activity specified in the enabling act; it is the transaction that results when one parks his car in an open parking, place, whether conducted by a corporation as in appeal No. 307, or by an individual as in appeal No. 364. To such a transaction the operator of the parking lot may only become a party in virtue of a license which he must obtain from the city; and the ordinance provides that if he fails to comply with its terms he shall forfeit his right to participate in such transactions. As the validity of the transaction is conditioned on the operator’s setting aside for the city the tax imposed as one of the conditions of conducting the transaction within the city limits, it is clearly an excise tax; the effect of the ordinance on the corporate income tax act is so remote and incidental that the legislature cannot have intended, by passing the corporate net income tax act, to set -aside the ordinance: <em>Blauner’s, Inc., v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/330/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="330 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1182999" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0342-01">330 Pa. 342</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%20889" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="198 A. 889">198 A. 889</a>.

    <p id="b358-4" data-blocks='[["BL_358.4",358,[275,2004,1151,206]],["BL_359.1",359,[177,361,1154,805]]]'>Another contention is that the ordinance is bad as discriminating against open parking places in favor of closed garages engaged in parking. It has not been shown that the municipal legislature did not have rea<a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>sonable ground for separating open parking lots from closed garages and placing them in separate classes for the purpose of taxing the parking transaction in the open lot. The growth of such parking in recent years is matter of common knowledge of which the courts take notice. Generally, the operation of such lots involves more extensive use of sidewalk and street than is involved in the operation of the closed garage; land occupied by a closed garage is assessed at the value of the land and buildings, whereas the open parking lot is assessed without buildings or buildings of negligible value. Other elements of the same general character suggest themselves. In such circumstances the court cannot say that the the municipal authorities had not sufficient reason for the classification.</p>
    <p id="b359-3" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[175,1184,1154,585]]]'>Little need be said on the point that the ordinance is confiscatory. The state expressly authorized the city to levy taxes for general revenue purposes and the ordinance so provides. There is nothing in the record to show that the rate imposed by the ordinance is so high as to result in. taking property without due process. The probability is that, in effect, the tax will be passed on to patrons, but if it is not, and if an occasional operator cannot afford to continue in business and pay the tax, it may be unfortunate but will not render the ordinance invalid.</p>
