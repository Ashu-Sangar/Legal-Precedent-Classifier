    <p id="b143-6" data-blocks='[["BL_143.8",143,[159,850,1154,310]]]'>The judgment is affirmed on the following from- the opinion of President Judge Bok: “On June 19, 1936, at’ a little before eight in the. morning, George -Edward Burger left his home near Upper Black Eddy, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, to get a doctor for his wife and never returned.</p>

The road at this point appears to run Northeast and Southwest. He was seen about one. hundren fifty feet before the collision by a lady who was baking bread in her house and glanced up as he went by. This lady, testifying by deposition, said that he was on her side of the road, although her fence prevented her’ from seeing his wheels. Her house being West of the road, Burger was therefore on his proper side.</p>
    <p id="b143-8" data-blocks='[["BL_143.10",143,[159,1841,1153,207]]]'>“No one saw the accident except the drivers of the two vehicles. Burger died soon after the collision, and the truck driver testified for the defendant in a manner that entirely cleared himself of negligence.</p>

The truck, which was ten or eleven feet long, was diagonally across its right side of the road, its right front wheel off the macadam and on the shoulder, and its rear end extending two or three feet over the center of the street: whether its rear wheel or wheels or merely its superstructure <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>overhung the center does not appear, but other cars had to drive partly on the West shoulder in order to pass around it. The Ford was described in various positions, all of them definitely on the East side of the road with the rear of the car a foot or two over the center line. One or both of its front wheels were off the macadam, its front was damaged, and the point of contact appeared to be the left front corner of both vehicles, but the whole front of the Ford was damaged. . . . The vehicles formed a V, their fronts being the apex.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[279,901,1150,252]]]'>“The most important piece of evidence was a fresh skid mark made by a tire. It lay <em>between </em>the vehicles and led eight and a half feet from a point eighteen inches or two feet on the West side of the center of the road underneath the Ford and ended at its left front wheel.</p>

If it began at the left front wheel of the Ford, it would indicate that plaintiff was well on his proper side of the road and that the defendant was negligently on its wrong side. If it began at the right front wheel, it would indicate that most of plaintiff’s car was on his wrong side of the road and that the truck was far on its proper side, since damage <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>to the truck was at its left front corner.
