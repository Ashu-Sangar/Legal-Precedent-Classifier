The answer discloses <em>no consideration, whatsoever </em>for ,this note. It merely states the <em>conclusion </em>that there was.adequate consideration., We are kept' entirely in the dark as' to <em>what </em>that consideration was.- The 6th paragraph of the answer says: “The purpose of the note was based upon consideration-known to all parties thereto and that the proceeds were-to be used for any purpose that the plaintiff saw fit.” The 7th' paragraph admits that plaintiff did not-discount the note and did. not purchase a farm and did. not-pay the taxes. Plaintiff is <em>completely secretive </em>as to the consideration! In 'the case of <em>Zajaczkowski v. </em>Jawer, <a href="/pa-super/36/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="36 Pa. Super. 324" data-case-ids="874352" data-case-paths="/pa-super/36/0324-01">36 Pa. Superior Ct. 324</a>, Judge Orlady, speaking for that court, said: “The defendant further alleges.‘that he received no consideration from the said Bernard Mialistzkey for the said note, and that it was not intended to create any liability against the petitioner.’ The answer filed by the plaintiff averred that .the note was given to him by defendant; that he had received a true, good, and valuable consideration .for the .same;. .. . . It-is apparent on examination of the petition and answer that the whole transaction is not disclosed, and that the plaintiff is designedly withholding the true facts in regard .to it. Assuming that the petition was sufficient to warrant the court in granting the rule to open the judgment, the answer, as filed by-the plaintiff, is <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>go manifestly evasive in not averring' the real consideration for the note, as well as the purpose, of its execution, that the court below was fully warranted, in treating the plaintiff’s judgment with suspicion. No testimony was taken, and in order to sustain the judgment, the court below would be expected to conclude, as a chancellor, that the note was for a good consideration. . . . In order to arrive:at this conclusion,:the court should be impressed with the truth and frankness of the plaintiff’s answer, and we see-no error in holding the plaintiff to a higher degree of- proof- and more specific statement of his claim than he submitted in reply to the defendant’s petition, that the note was without any consideration, was given to another party, and was not intended to create any liability. . . The only question before us is'whether the court below rightly exercised its discretion on the evidence before it, and applying the well-settled principles announced in many cases decided in the Supreme and in this court* we see no error in making the rule absolute, and in allowing the parties to thrash out their mysterious’controversy before a jury.” We are here met with the same proposition : a petition by the defendant showing facts that warrant the conclusion that there was a -total failure .of consideration for the obligation and the plaintiff’s answer “manifestly evasive in not averring the-real consideration for the note, as well as the purpose -of the execution.” The' court below in opening the judgment properly held “that the matters.set forth.in the defendant’s petition for rule to open judgment are sufficient.” On this state of the record no testimony needed to have been taken to warrant a court in opening the judgment and submitting the question of fact as to the failure of consideration to a jury: <em>Zajackowski v. Jawer, </em><a href="/pa-super/36/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="36 Pa. Super. 324" data-case-ids="874352" data-case-paths="/pa-super/36/0324-01">supra,</a> and <em>George v.

When the depositions however were taken on the rule to open the judgment, they were taken only in behalf of the defendant although the plaintiff is held “to a. higher <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>degree of proof” since Ms answer was not responsive. The defendant in the depositions was handicappéd in the interpretation of his testimony by an incompetent interpreter, a condition that the court below properly took notice of by reference in its opinion to “his difficulties in communication.” These depositions, however, showed that the defendant “never seen a penny” from the plaintiff for “the support of [himself], [his] wife, or for the maintenance of [his] property,” and when the plaintiff was called as for cross-examination for the defendant’s depositions, while at times he talked of his then deceased mother having “had all receipts for all the money that I gave her,” he also, when asked if he gave defendant anything for that note, flatly stated: “No, I didn’t give him anytMng,” and when further interrogated whether the defendant signed it willingly or whether he had to use persuasion, stated: “He signed it. I told him my mother had the receipts and <em>he had to sign it </em>[italics supplied].” Defendant reiterated what he had already stated in Ms petition that “when he signed the note” plaintiff promised to keep him “as long as he lived.” Defendant testified further that two weeks after he signed the note, the step-son (plaintiff) refused to support him and defendant went around begging groceries and plaintiff said to defendant as to this: “As long as you bring it in it is all right.” Defendant testified that plaintiff had not given Mm a penny in the past four years prior to the making of the depositions in 1939. When one takes into consideration the plaintiff’s unresponsive answer, his failure to take depositions to sustain his judgment, and the relationship of the parties, the separation of the mother and stepfather when the note was signed, the plaintiff’s complete failure to produce or even account for the failure to produce the receipts which he said was in his mother’s possession (since they were alleged to be receipts <em>to him from his </em>mother, they should have been in <em>his </em>possession), the action of the court below in opening the <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>judgment cannot be adjudged error. See <em>George v. George, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[145,476,1153,475]]]'>Further, when depositions were taken on the rule to open judgment, it was agreed by counsel that “parts admitted in the answer filed by the plaintiff in the petition to open judgment are admitted as evidence.” These are the paragraphs above quoted. Since the answer in this case was evasive, as already noted by us, the stipulation agreed to constitutes very strong proof in support of the allegations on which the rule to open judgment is entered.</p>

He was asked: “How did you arrive at the figure of $5,100.00? A. My mother counted it all up. ... I put my money into the house, everything I made from 1920 to 1930, outside of buying a car.” This testimony was wholly insufficient to rebut the unanswered averments in the petition to open judgment. The evidence as to his earnings is vague and indefinite. Plaintiff was not 21 years of age until 1926 and whatever he earned during his minority belonged in law to his parents. He did not testify that his mother had agreed to give him all his earnings during his minority. If he had attempted to do so, his testimony would, under section 5, clause (e) of the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, have been incompetent, for his mother was dead at the time the depositions were taken and the defendant, her husband, represented on the record her interest in the subject in controversy. Nor did plaintiff testify that his step-father, the defendant, had made him any such promise. Under the Act just cited and under the Act of June 11, 1891, P. L. 287, where a party to an agreement is dead, and no witness has testified as to an agreement made prior to the death of the decedent, the surviving party to the contract is incompetent to testify as to what took place, i. e., if the surviving party is a witness whose interest is adverse <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>to the party on the record who succeeds to the rights of the deceased in “the thing or contract in action:” See <em>Tarr v.
