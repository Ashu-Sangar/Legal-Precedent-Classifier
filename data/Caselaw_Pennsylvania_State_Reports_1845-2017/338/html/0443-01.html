He further provided that in default of appointment by a child of its. share same should go to testator’s “grandchildren” living at the death of such child per stirpes. A son, James R. Shoeh, died January 7, 1918, leaving a will dated October 30, 1913, by which he gave his entire estate to his wife. A child, James B. Shoeh, Jr., who survived his father, was born January 9, 1917, subsequent to the date of the will. It was there held that under section 21 of the Wills Act, as previously construed in <em>Shestack's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/267/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="267 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1057717" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0115-01">267 Pa. 115</a> and <em>Young's Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/39/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="39 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="996219" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0115-01">39 Pa. 115</a>, “it is plain that, as to James B.

Shoch, over which James R. Shoch had power of appointment, when we determine that the latter died intestate as to his son, we must then look at the will of Henry R. Shoch to see what he provides in case of such an intestacy, in order to determine the present interest of the minor child . . . When we look at the will of Henry R. Shoch, deceased, we find it provides that, in case his son, James R. Shoch shall die. intestate, the fund in question shall go to the latter’s children; and, as James R. Shoch did die intestate so far as James R. Shoch, Jr., is concerned, since the latter is. the only child surviving his father, it follows that this grandchild takes the entire fund, under the terms of his grandfather’s will.”</p>
    <p id="b479-5" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[150,1424,1153,1019]]]'>Appellant contends that Shoch’s Estate (No. 1) is not determinative of the present controversy for the reason that here there was an explicit exercise of the testamentary power of appointment, by the donee thereof, whereas in the Shoch case the power was not so exercised, but only impliedly so by virtue of section 3 of the Act of June 4, 1879, P. L. 88 (reenacted in section 11 of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403). He takes the position that the Shoch case decides merely that' the presumption, created by the Act of 1879, of exercise of a general power of appointment, is overcome by a counter presumption arising under section <em>21 </em>of the Wills Act that, the donee of the power did not intend to exercise the power, i. e., that the case rests solely upon the conclusion, thus arrived at, that there was in fact no exercise of the power of appointment. It is argued that since in the present case there is the fact of actual exercise of the power of appointment, the presumption of non-exercise must “bow before the fact.”</p>

      <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>Appellant relies for Ms position, as to the real basis of the Shoch case, upon the following statement therefrom, at page 164: “In the case at bar, one act of assembly, that of June 4,1879, P. L. 88, created a presumption of intention on the part of James B. Shoch to execute-the power given him by the will of Henry B. Shoch; while, under our statutory doctrine of implied revocation, arising from an after-born and unproVided-for-child, a counter conclusive presumption arises that James B. Shoch did not intend to exercise the power so far as concerns the after-born child, James B. Shoch, Jr. Therefore, the power has never been exercised, for the Act of 1879 haS not changed the last-mentioned statutory doctrine in the least; consequently, the appellee takes under the will of his grandfather.”</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[289,1202,1151,1127]]]'>In answer to' this contention it is only necessary to point out that the “counter presumption,” referred to in Shoch’s Estate (No. 1), is-not a presumption that there has been no exercise of the power, but a presumption that a decedent whose will, in fact or law, would otherwise, operate as an exercise thereof, intends that the exercise of the power shall be regarded as a nullity so far as after-born and unprovided-for children are concerned. Manifestly, this presumption is not overcome by a Showing that the power was exercised by a will made before the birth of a child any more than a decedent’s presumed intention to die intestate as respects his individual estate, so far as after-born children are concerned, can be overcome by showing a will, disposing of same without making provision therein for such children, executed prior to their birth. These “presumptions” are not presumptions of fact, which -is the sense in which appellant uses the term; they are legislatively created presumptions of law which are irrebuttable: <em>Young’s Appeal, </em>supra, 118; <em>Baum’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/269/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="269 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="1063516" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0063-01">269 Pa. 63</a>, 66.</p>
