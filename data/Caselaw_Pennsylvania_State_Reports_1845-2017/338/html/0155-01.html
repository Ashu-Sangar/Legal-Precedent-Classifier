Richardson, aged 62, the husband of plaintiff, was crossing the four railroad tracks of defendant company at a public crossing in the Borough of Homestead and had almost cleared <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>the fourth track when he was struck and fatally injured hy a train of defendant company.</p>
    <p id="b189-3" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[172,467,1152,640]]]'>The negligence complained of is that the train ran at an excessive rate of speed without giving any warning of its approach and that defendant employed an incompetent watchman at the crossing. Further allegations are that the “watchman failed to give the decedent fair and timely warning of the approach of the train by lowering the gates or otherwise” and that “he lowered the gates of the crossing after the decedent was committed to the crossing, and trapped him ... so that he did not know from which direction or on which track peril impended, and he had no time for mature reflection.”</p>
    <p id="b189-4" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[171,1128,1154,421]]]'>The nonsuit was granted on the ground that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. In refusing to take off the nonsuit, the court stated that the evidence established that decedent was “guilty of contributory negligence in that he proceeded across the railroad tracks in the face of an on-coming train which he must have seen when it was at least two hundred feet away had he so much as looked.”</p>
    <p id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.6",189,[173,1568,1154,864]],["BL_190.1",190,[268,356,1160,1572]]]'>The facts show that decedent had about completed the crossing and was stooping to get under the crossing gate, which had been dropped after he was committed to the crossing, when he was fatally injured by the cylinder head of the locomotive of a freight train moving from forty-five to fifty miles an hour. Witness Charles Scott testified that he “was walking out Amity Street towards Eighth Avenue” at the time in question and “the bell started to ring on the railroad. . . . The man [Richardson] was walking over fast, coming towards me from across the tracks.” Richardson “was between the second and the third track . . . walking very fast,” and “the gates were up.” The witness looked eastwardly and saw “the train coming very fast . . . about 800 feet” away, at “about forty-five-fifty miles an hour. As the train came towards the crossing the man continued to <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>walk! over fast, and he come right across, and just as he stepped over the last rail, by that time the train was there, and he stooped to get under the gate and the gate fell right down in front of him, like, and at that time the train hit him. . . . The gate came down fast.” These questions and answers then followed: “At the time that the gate fell in front of him how far, approximately, away was the train? A. It was back about 200 feet, I would say. Q. Will you state whether or not, if the gate had not come down, whether the man had safely cleared the track? A. Well, he could have got across if the gate hadn’t come down, I figured.” After the gate came down Richardson “stooped over and continued to try to get under the gate before the train hit him.” The gate when it is down is about three feet from the level of the ground and it is about two and a half to three feet from the last rail of the last track. The cylinder head “which sticks out ... a pretty good piece” struck Richardson on the right hip. On cross-examination, the witness said that Richardson when crossing the track “was almost running.” From the time the witness saw Richardson until he was struck, the latter “covered about fifteen feet.” He said that Richardson “didn’t have time to look back at the train; he was trying to get across.” The witness testified further that from the time he saw Richardson cross the track, he, the witness, was standing about “18 feet from the railroad” and that he could see up the track “about 800 feet” (in the direction from which the train came).</p>

There is no evidence in this record that the deceased saw the train approaching before he committed himself to the cross<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>ing. The fact that the gates were up was some indication that he could safely start across although this court has held that while open safety gates intimate that no train is approaching, they do not relieve one about to cross a railroad from the duty of exercising due care. The deceased cannot be adjudged guilty of negligence because he did not escape from his position of danger, for he apparently would have done so had the gates not descended in his pathway. The descending gate would naturally cause him to slacken his speed somewhat until he could decide just <em>where </em>it would descend, so as to avoid being hit by it. After it did descend, his speed was slackened by his stooping to get under it. He did not possess the agility of youth. While in this stooped position his right hip was struck by the projecting cylinder of the locomotive.</p>
