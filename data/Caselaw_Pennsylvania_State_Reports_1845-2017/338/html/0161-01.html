A majority of the court, Judge Carr dissenting, took off the nonsuit and ordered a new trial. The second trial, which we are now reviewing, was conducted by Judge Dumbauld. It resulted in verdicts in plaintiffs’ favor aggregating $12,500. Motions were made by defendants for judgments non obstante veredicto. A majority of the court in banc, Judge Carr again dissenting, refused the motions and entered judgments on the verdicts, Judge Carr stating that for the reasons set forth in his former dissenting opinion, he would enter judgments in defendants’ favor. That opinion, so far as now applicable, is.as follows: , .</p>

The, wife-plaintiff, during a stop of her bus at the terminal, entered the rest room, inserted a coin to unlock and open.one of the doors and stepped up into the compartment, closing the door after her. When she was ready to leave a few minutes later, she pushed the door fully open and at the same time stepped forward without looking, in consequence of which her foot slid over the edge of the platform and she fell. • The defendants are charged with fiegligent'cbnstruction in that the platform was' not éxténded beyond the door of the toilet compartment a sufficient distance to permit an occupant to step completely out before encountering a change of floor levels. . . .</blockquote>

Upon entering the toilet compartment, she opened the door and ascended to the higher level without difficulty or mishap. Thus, she had actual notice that the step was there. Her eyes unquestionably saw the step up into the toilet, else she would have stumbled. Had she been blind, her sense of touch must have disclosed to her the elevation, for she was compelled to raise her foot to reach it. On leaving, had she looked before plunging blindly into space, she must again have seen the floor below. The door itself was a warning that this very condition must exist: <em>Garret v. W. S.

Her testimony shows her thoughtless inattention to her surroundings, her neglect to look, and her careless assumption that the floor levels were the same. Careless persons cannot be prevented from hurting themselves.</blockquote>

It is true, of course, that momentary forgetfulness may be excusable in sudden emergencies or stress of peril, when reasonable cause for such lapse can be shown, apart from mere inattention. But we cannot go to the length of holding that Mrs. Wessner’s uneasiness furnished any adequately disturbing cause for her forgetfulness. No extraordinary situation confronted her; her faculties were not in any way impaired. The result cannot be foreseen if it be admitted that mere inattention or lapse of memory can excuse negligence. Such a rule would invalidate all sense perceptions, and would effectively put an end to the law of contributory negligence in the practical administration of justice. Though we may regard with amused tolerance the proverbial abstractions of middle age hunting for the thimble on its finger or the pen in its mouth, and of old age troubled <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>that it cannot find the glasses on its nose, absent-mindedness is not a satisfactory standard of care in the modem world. In my view of the law, this accident was caused solely by the negligence of Mrs. Wessner. . . . The case is governed, to the exclusion of all other questions, by these two points of law, which I believe the court has decided erroneously.”</blockquote>

She says that in entering the compartment, she had to step up from the floor of the room into it. If she had used her faculties, she was bound to know that she had to step down.
