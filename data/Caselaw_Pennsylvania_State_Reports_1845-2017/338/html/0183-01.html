On the 5th or 6th day of July, 1939, the plaintiff received notice from Calvin B.

Representatives of labor unions informed the secretary that there was a strike on the project. No statement was filed in the public employment office with regard to the existence of an industrial dispute, or strike; no communication was had between the department and the employee nor to the employer; no investigation was made by the department at any time. An attempt seems to have been made at mediation, but none of the parties, employees or employer had invoked the services of the department in mediation. There is no evidence that the defendant put itself in communication with the parties to any controversy. What the evidence does disclose is that certain employees were ordered by a representative of a labor organization to quit, which they did and, within a week thereafter, were again employed in some other work at equal wages and there was subsequently called by the department a meeting, on July 20, 1939, which the Secretary or his duly appointed representative, the plaintiff and a few representatives of labor organizations attended, but no representatives of the employees attended, (nor is there any evidence that they were requested to attend). At the said meeting there was an endeavor tot persuade the plaintiff to unionize his project, which the plaintiff refused to do. At the time of this meeting which was held in the office of the Secretary, no strike existed. The men had secured employment elsewhere and had abandoned their connection as employees of Moses. At that meet<a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>ing, particularly, from the evidence, the conclusion is irresistible that the object of that meeting was not to get the men to return to work, but to have the plaintiff company unionize the industry.</blockquote>
