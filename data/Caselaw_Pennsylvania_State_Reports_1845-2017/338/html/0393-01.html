They are the executors of Benedict H. Birkel, deceased, <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>who in 1914 made a contract with Archbishop Prendergast of Philadelphia to build a parish church for $32,000. The land on which the church was subsequently built had been owned by Birlcel and his sister and in.' 1913 was conveyed by them to the Archbishop for the use and benefit of the members of the parish. The church was completed in 1919, accepted, and thereafter used by the parish congregation. The Archbishop was not, by virtue of his office, the agent of the lay members (compare <em>Reifsnyder v. Dougherty, </em><a href="/pa/301/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="301 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1126405" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0328-01">301 Pa. 328</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%2098" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="152 A. 98">152 A. 98</a>), but it does not appear that they had not approved the contract; as they accepted, used, and paid for the church, we assume, for the purposes of this case, that they had approved it.</p>

No members of the congregation were made parties. The sole defendant is Cardinal Dougherty, whose diocese includes South Bethlehem.

He contends that if the contractor was not paid in full, the obligation to pay was on the lay members of the parish for whose benefit and on whose behalf the contract was made in 1914; that he is merely the holder of the record title on a dry trust. That view was accepted by the learned court below and required the dismissal of the bill.</p>
