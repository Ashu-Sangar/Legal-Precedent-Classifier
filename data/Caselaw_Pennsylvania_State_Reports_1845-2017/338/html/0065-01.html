Appellant elected to be tried separately. It was alleged that the motive for the homicide was the collection by Mrs. Alfonsi of the proceeds of insurance policies she had been carrying, as sole beneficiary,, for about two years on the life of her husband, though it happened that the largest policy, one for $2,000, had lapsed 27 days before his death. Some small industrial insurance policies had also lapsed, <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>and Alfonsi died with only $400 “death benefits.” Mrs. Alfonsi was acquitted of her husband’s murder on October 27, 1939.</p>

Myer testified: “Polcino told Petrillo [defendant] that I needed $25.00 to keep my business up. . . . He [defendant] asked me why stop at $25 when I had a chance to make $500. So I asked him what his proposition was and he told me to bump off a guy, ... a fellow by the name of Ferdinand Alfonsi.” Myer said he asked defendant “why he didn’t do the job himself” and the latter replied: “Well, I know this man and I can’t do it but I just knocked a guy off five days ago, but I didn’t know him so good.” Myer testified that defendant showed him an iron pipe eighteen inches long, which he wanted him to hit Alfonsi over the head with and then throw the latter downstairs to make it look like an accident, that on the following day defendant told him he had made arrangements with Mrs. Alfonsi for her “to go at 8 o’clock to a show with her two children and be back again after the job was completed,” that he (Myer) “went around that night” to see “whether Mrs. Alfonsi was really connected with this in any way” and that he saw her leave about 8 o’clock and come back a quarter to eleven; that the next morning he told defendant that he was to the house and nobody was there, and defendant said he would make arrangements for him to do the job that night, that defendant later suggested that Myer kill Alfonsi by hitting him over the head with a bag of sand, that defendant said he made arrangements for Mrs. Alfonsi to put a white <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>towel on the back fence so that Myer would get to the right house, that defendant later took Mrs. Alfonsi to her mother’s in Bristol for ten days during which time Myer was supposed “to do the job,” and that defendant offered to give him $500 in lawful money or $2,500 in counterfeit money to do this. Myer had no conversation at any time with Mrs. Alfonsi except on September 5, 1938, when, according to his testimony, he went to the Alfonsi home and “asked for the contractor” and was informed by her that “he has been very sick.” Myer then asked his name and she replied: “Alfonsi.” Myer then said to her: “I am looking for Periniti, the contractor.” She replied: “He is over on Clearfield Street, Belgrade Street.” Myer said he told defendant that he had a friend who “just came out of Trenton from doing three years . . . for murder” and “he will do the job” and that defendant asked him to “bring him along.”</p>

Phillips was assigned to work with him. Phillips at the time was an agent of the United States Secret Service and was assigned to this case (so he testified) by his Chief, W. A. Landvoight, shortly before August 1, 1938. On this latter date he first met the defendant in the store of Domenick Polcino at 1802 East Thayer Street, Philadelphia. Myer said he and Phillips “proceeded to dicker” with defendant for the counterfeit money, that defendant suggested to him and Phillips that they take Alfonsi “out in an automobile, ask him to look at the headlights and then run over him and then keep on going,” or that they “take him down to the beach for a swim and say that he did not come out of the water again,” that they kept “stalling” defendant off and later found that Alfonsi was very sick, and that they later met defendant who told them they “didn’t have to go ahead with the job” because Alfonsi was in the hospital, and that defendant said: “The fools in the hospital think he has got influenza or pneumonia. ... I gave <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>him enough arsenic to kill six men.” Myer said that when defendant talked about having given Alfonsi arsenic, he questioned defendant as to how he knew that “the arsenic would work,” and he replied: “It worked on the other job.

I will pay any amount of money that it costs. I want him to stay home.” The doctor testified that the next day he convinced Mrs. Alfonsi that her husband should be taken to the hospital by telling her that he would be there only a half hour for the purpose of getting an X-ray taken, and that her husband was then taken to the hospital. Mrs. Alfonsi told the doctor that defendant recommended him to her. The doctor also testified that sometime prior to his treating Aifonsi, defendant came to his office for examination and while there offered the doctor “two or three hundred dollars” for “typhoid germs” and the doctor said he told defendant to “get out.”</p>

Only a small portion of this conversation was in the presence of defendant. The gist of the conversation that the witness related and which was not in the presence of defendant, Was that Paul Petrillo tried to induce him to drop certain powder in a glass of beer to be administered to an unnamed man which Paul said he had insured for $500. Later “Uncle Paul” also suggested to the witness a plan for killing Domenick Starace. He said he told his uncle that “if anything happens to Domenick Starace I will expose you. I will tell everything I know.” He said that Paul then threatened to kill him. Later his Uncle Paul and the latter’s mistress, Eose Carina, went to Brooklyn to the Starace family. The witness visited them there. He said that Molly Starace (Mrs. Starace’s daughter) had a certain letter that the witness wanted to get, that he, his Uncle Paul and Molly entered the latter’s bedroom, and the witness said: “Molly, I know what is going on here, and I do not want to have any part of it. . . . If anything happens, I do not want to be implicated in it. If anything happens to your father — your stepfather — I am going to tell everything.” Molly noticed that the witness had a. gun and she told his Uncle Paul. While the witness and his uncle were struggling for possession of it, the uncle “pressed the gun” and the witness fainted. While Caco<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>pardo was on the stand, the Commonwealth put in evidence, over objection, a letter allegedly written by Paul Petrillo to Molly Starace in Avhich he suggested that the only way to “quiet” Molly’s stepfather was “to send him to ‘California’” (meaning as it was testified later, to kill him). The word “California” was underscored. The letter then said: “Johnny [Cacopardo] understands what I mean, and I could do it in twenty-four hours or a week. Anyway you want it, but it will cost your mother $500. Let me know if there is any insurance on his life. If not, take all you can get and when the time comes I will take care of it.” The Commonwealth also produced in evidence a correspondence card written on both sides by Molly Starace to Paul Petrillo, in which she refused to accept the suggestion of Paul that she have her stepfather murdered. She said: “We will have to let it go for the present.” The card was found in Paul Petrillo’s tailor shop in Philadelphia. It appeared in the evidence that John Cacopardo murdered (by shooting) Molly Starace on December 13, 1936, and he was convicted in Brooklyn, New York, and sentenced to Sing Sing Prison for a term of from thirty years to life.</p>

Christine Cerrone was named as beneficiary in most of these policies. In one policy the defendant was the beneficiary under the name of “Herman Caruso, brother,” and in another he was beneficiary in his own name, as a nephew. Caruso met his death by drowning in the Schuylkill River. There was no evidence of violence. There was no proof that Caruso had been murdered; in other words, no “corpus delecti” was established as to him.</p>

He testified that he arrested Mrs. Carina Favata on October 17, 1938, that she made a statement to him and over defendant’s objection he read this to the jury. The salient points in the statement are these: She began living as a “common law wife” with Charles Ingrao in 1925, who died “in August 1934 or 1935.” She carried $5,000 insurance on his life. This was paid her after his death. He had two children “in the Catholic Bureau”: Philip and Michael. The former was sixteen years of age when he came to live with her on August 29,1936. Six months later Michael came to live with her. Philip “got sick” on June 7, 1938, and died shortly afterwards (exact date not given). She listed the following insurances she had on this boy: $2,500 in Prudential Life Insurance Company; “about $1,400” in the John Hancock Life Insurance Company; “about six or eight hundred dollars” in the Home Life Insurance Company; “one thousand” dollars in the Monumental Life Insurance Company; $500 in the State Mutual Benefit Society; $500 in the Prudential Company; and $200 in the Tribune Association. She was the beneficiary in these policies which total $6,900.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> She also carried on the boy Michael a policy for $1,000 in the Prudential Life Insurance Company and two other policies in other companies totaling $750.

Twenty-two months later his body was exhumed and it was found after analysis that his stomach, kidneys and liver were “positive for arsenic.” Agent Shearn “got a lead” on DiMartino from one Ralph Picelli and insured DiMartino for $2,000. Agent Casale placed a policy for $500 on DiMartino. The latter paid the premium. Ca-sale did not know the defendant. Agent Milici in March, 1936, placed a policy on DiMartino for $496. The insured paid the premium and gave the agent all necessary information. Defendant had nothing to do with the matter. The insured’s wife was the beneficiary. (The good faith of none of these agents is challenged.) Mrs. Favata knew the DiMartinos but it does not appear that she had anything to do with the matter of placing the insurance. Three months after the insured died Mrs. Favata went with Mrs. DiMartino to the claim department of the Home Life Insurance Company and “gave the superintendent an argument” about one policy on which there was a contest because a boarder named Muselli had signed an application which supposedly was signed by DiMartino. The defendant appeared in this case only when three months after DiMartino’s death, he met a man named Corigliano, an employee of the Home Life Insurance Company whom the defendant knew well enough to talk to a few times a week and asked him “how the company refused to pay DiMartino’s claim.” The agent said: “How come you are interested in this connection?” and defendant answered: “Oh well, after all, you know the woman mixed up the God damned thing.”</p>

The <em>evidence </em>which can be so used of other crimes, <em>presupposes that the other crime is prima facie established by competent proof. </em>Justice Agnew made that very clear in <em>Shaffner v.

Justice Agnew said: “To make one criminal act evidence of another, a connection between them must have existed in the mind of the actor, linking them together for some purpose he intended to accomplish; or it must be necessary to identify the person of the actor, by a connection which shows that he who committed the one must have done the other. Without this obvious connection, it is not only unjust to the prisoner to compel him to acquit himself of two offences instead of one, but it is detrimental to justice to burthen a trial with multiplied issues that tend to confuse and mislead the jury. The most guilty criminal may be innocent of other offenses charged against him, of which, if fairly tried, he might acquit himself. From the nature and prejudicial character of such evidence, it is obvious it should not be received, unless the mind plainly perceives that the commission of the one tends, by a visible connection, to prove the commission of the other by the prisoner. If the evidence be so dubious that the judge does not clearly perceive the connection, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the prisoner, instead of suffering the minds of the jurors to be prejudiced by an independent fact, carrying with it no proper evidence of the particular guilt. . . . It is obvious that to connect together the deaths of Sharloek and Nancy, and make the former bear upon the latter, they must have been both contemplated by the prisoner as parts of one plan in his mind, in which the taking of Sharlock’s life was part of his purpose of taking the life of Nancy. He must, therefore, have contemplated the death of Nancy before tak<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>ing the life of Sharlock. In order to let in the poisoning of Sharlock, the judge must have had before his mind some fact or facts exhibiting this pre-existing determination to take Nancy’s life.” Justice Agnew’s language is specially apposite to this ease.</p>

You say you find the defendant, Herman Petrillo, guilty of murder in the first degree, and fix the punishment at death, in the manner provided by law, and so say you all.” In our judgment, this action of the crier <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>in the presence of the court and the jury’s assent to what he said cures the irregularity in the rendering of the verdict.

Garfield, began his charge by quoting those constitutional provisions which he characterized as the “indispensable safeguards of life and liberty,” and then said: “They are intended for the protection of the innocent from injustice and oppression. It is only by their faithful observance that guilt or innocence can be fairly ascertained. Every accused person is presumed innocent until the accusation be proved, and until such proof no court dares to prejudice his cause or withhold from him the protection of this fundamental law.” Judge Truman C. White, who presided at the trial of the murderer of William McKinley, complimented opposing counsel on the fact that they had “made no attempt to unfairly secure a verdict one way or the other,” and he declared that the spirit which had characterized the trial and <em>should </em>characterize it <em>until the end </em>was the spirit of “a genuine, a tender and a reverent solicitude for the dignity and majesty of the law.”</p>
