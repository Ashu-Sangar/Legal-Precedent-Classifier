    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[293,496,1153,1789]]]'>It appears from the evidence that prior to the purchase of the cartridges the boy, Nix, had arranged with a friend for the furnishing of a gun but that boy was unable to provide it when, having procured the cartridges, Nix called upon him to perform. Thereupon Nix arranged with another boy, one Albert Bentz, to procure a gun belonging to the latter’s older brother and which had been loaned to one Rudy Valencia, whose age does not appear. Accordingly, on January 4, 1938, several days after the purchase of the cartridges, the two boys went to the Valencia home'where they procured the gun from Valencia, apparently upon the pretense that they had. been sent for the purpose of returning it to the Bentz home. Having thus procured the gun, the boys did some shooting in the open in the afternoon after which they returned the gun to the Bentz home. After dinner that same evening, between half past seven and eight o’clock, Nix went to the Bentz home, the two boys went upstairs, “took down the gun,” and discharged six bullets out of an upstairs window into and about the door of the home of the minor appellee, John Mautino, 300 to 350 feet away, one of which the jury found struck Mautinoj causing the injury for which appellant has been held liable. Appellant argues: “The mere selling of the cartridges did not affect plaintiff in any way. They were entirely passive with potentialities for injury only (sic) when used in connection with the subsequent agency of a gun . . .: Without the independent negligence of Rudy Valencia in turning over the gun, the injury to plaintiff could not have happened; and that subsequent act became the proximate cause of the injury, and eliminates all prior or remote conditions which made that injury possible.”</p>

    <p id="b471-3" data-blocks='[["BL_471.4",471,[161,1241,1155,1028]]]'>The Shaffer case does not support appellant’s position, as analysis will show. It was there decided merely that if the parent-plaintiffs in that case were negligent, they could not recover, as a matter of law, and that the question of their negligence was for the jury in view of evidence of knowledge concerning their son’s possession and use of the gun by which the previously purchased cartridges were accidently discharged, killing another son. Applying that decision to the facts of the present case, negligence on the part of Valencia would require that he be regarded as having “so far intervened in bringing about the harmful result . . . as to assume or to be fixed with the risk thereof” in an action by him, had he, rather than a stranger to the transaction, in the position of minor appellee, sustained the injury, and his negligence would be a question for the jury. For purposes of the present case, however, whether or not Valencia’s conduct constituted negligence is immaterial, as the court below properly held.</p>

Intervening human action, whether innocent or negligent, is not a superseding cause of harm which an actor’s conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about, if - such action ought to have been foreseen <em>(Nelson v. Duquesne Light Co. et al., </em><a href="/pa/338/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="338 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="1199954" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0037-01">338 Pa. 37</a>, Restatement of Torts, Section 447). Appellant cannot be heard to say that it was not reasonably to be anticipated by it that some third person might, either prior or subsequent to the unlawful sale of- cartridges, inadvertently make possible the acquisition of that which'was obviously requisite to the discharge thereof in the customary and usual way, and thus relieve itself from all responsibility for injuries' resulting from such discharge either to the purchasing minor or an innocent third person. To hold otherwise would be to permit the evasion of liability by reason of an act of another, the very likelihood of the occurrence of which was one of the risks which made appellant’s conduct dangerous, and a risk which it must be presumed the legislature, in making such sales unlawful, intended that purchasing minors and innocent. third persons should be protected against. See Restatement of Torts, Section 449, and Penna. Anno. thereto, citing, inter alia, <em>Shaffer v. Mowery, McMillen v. Steele </em>and <em>Wassel v. </em>Ludwig, <a href="/pa-super/92/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="92 Pa.

The contention that the sále of cartridges to tbe minor Nix, being in violation of instructions not to make such sales to per-: sons under 21 years of agé, is not chargeable to appellant, is squarely ruled agáinst it in <em>McMillen v.

Where the sale is made in the ordinary, course of business, it is immaterial whether the clerk or the owner sells the weapon. A principal is liable in damages because of the criminal acts of his agent, where such acts are within the scope of the agent’s employment: 26 Cyc, 1529; A. &amp; E.

The picture was made up by placing the retrieved lead portions of a “.32” bullet and a “.22 short” bullet, previously discharged into a bale of cotton, upon the X-ray film plate, under the body of minor appellee, so as to <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>enable the making of a finished picture showing these bullets, thus photographed through the body, as well as the bullet lodged within the body.</p>

Significantly, appellant’s ballistic expert, under whose direction the experiments were conducted, refused to testify the photograph indicated “positively” that the bullet lodged within minor appellee’s body was not a “.22 short.” His testimony was as follows: “As to whether the one in the center to say positively is not a twenty-two, I would say it is a larger object than a twenty-two calibre bullet and compares quite closely in size to the thirty-eight (later changed to thirty-two) but not quite.” He further testified that discharging bullets into wood rather than cotton would destroy the size, and admitted that if the bullet in minor appellee’s body “had struck something,” such as bone, the spent bullet might take on a different form.
