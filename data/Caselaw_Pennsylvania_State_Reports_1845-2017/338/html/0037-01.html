He had in the front seat with him as a guest passenger, David Nelson, husband of Catherine Nelson, the above named plaintiff. The automobile, while proceeding at a speed which' Mes-singer declared was about 30. or 35 miles an hour, collided with a wooden electric light pole located on the highway. As a result of the accident Nelson recéived injuries which caused his death about a week later.</p>
    <p id="b71-9" data-blocks='[["BL_71.12",71,[163,1841,1152,593]],["BL_72.1",72,[265,354,1153,1189]]]'>The boulevard runs north and south in the City of Pittsburgh and is a four lane highway. At a certain point,-Nobles Lane (hereinafter referred to as the lane) runs off to the right of the boulevard as one lane roadway up the hill to Carrick. From this point on, the boulevard continues as a forty foot highway around a left curve for a distance of 200 feet when it continues as a thirty foot highway. Nobles Lane is in its direction really a continuation of the boulevard. The boulevard by curving to the left at the lane constitutes a very substantial curve, the degree of which is indicated on <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>the map exhibit but does not appear in the record. At the converging of the boulevard and the lane there is an intermediate triangular “island” or nontraversable area. The distance from the westerly edge of the concrete boulevard to the northerly, i. e., the broad end, of the island is forty-one feet. The Duquesne Light Company’s pole with which the car collided is “122 feet from the point of curve, which is practically the northerly end of the island.” The pole is situated in front of a service station of the Standard Oil Company and its distance eastward from the eastern edge of the thirty-foot paved highway is 5.54 feet. The width of the right-of-way of the boulevard at the locus of the accident is 70 feet. The old <em>paved </em>road of the boulevard is thirty feet wide; west of this there is twenty feet of unpaved highway, but east of it, i. e., in front of the service station the right-of-way is paved for twenty feet. If we take the fifty foot paved area as <em>the </em>boulevard and divide this into northbound and southbound traffic halves, the pole is located two feet westward of the center of the northbound traffic half. The colliding automobile was northbound.</p>

In order to avoid it a driver would have to veer to the right and pass between the pole on his left and the service station on his right. The pole was painted with black and white stripes for a considerable height. There was a 600 candle power light on the pole itself and similar lights near the traffic island. The pole was erected by the Duquesne Light Company in 1930 to take the place of two poles of theirs which had stood for some time six feet eastward from the edge of the pavement in a then (i. e., before 1930) unpaved portion of the right-of-way. These two poles were in front of a lot of the Standard Oil Company. The latter decided to erect a <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>service station on this lot and to pave with cement both the area in front of this station and also the 20-foot eastern strip of the right-of-way. The oil company requested the light company to remove the two poles and erect one pole in the right-of-way, 5.54 feet east of the old <em>paved </em>right-of-way. The light company secured a city permit for the installation of the pole. The issuance of this permit was under the authority of the Act of May 8, 1889, P. L. 136, sec. 2, which gives electric light companies the power to “erect and maintain the necessary apparatus for supplying light . . . and to distribute the same, with the right to enter upon any public street . . . for such purpose . . .; Provided” it obtains “the consent of such entry, of the councils of the city or borough in which such streets may be located.”</p>
    <p id="b73-3" data-blocks='[["BL_73.4",73,[157,1231,1153,701]]]'>There was testimony that the light on the pole was located on an arm about thirty feet above the street and that the light did not reflect at all at or near the base of the pole. An employee of the gasoline station testified that from the latter part of June, 1935, to October 23, 1935, there were two accidents caused by collisions with the pole in question. He also testified that during the same period there were other machines that struck the pole but he didn’t consider them accidents because no serious damage was done. He also said that he saw “cars brush their fenders and bumpers” against the pole and then kept on going without stopping. He saw about “five cars do that” during that period.</p>

This is true even though the given condition in a street may not technically be.a. nuisance: <em>Lawrence v.

    <p id="b74-4" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[266,953,1153,590]]]'>(2) When a. telegraph or an electric light pole is erected in a. highway with the consent of the proper authorities, it is <em>not. per se a nuisance. </em>Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Vol. 3, sec. 1220, says: “Legislative sanction directly given by the legislature, or mediately conferred through proper municipal action, is necessary , to authorize the use of streets for the posts and wires of a telegraph or telephone company. If such posts be erected within the limits of a street or highway without such sanction, they are nuisances ;• but if the erection be thus authorized, they are not.”</p>

It is stated in <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.L.R.%20496" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 A.L.R. 496">2 A. L.

In <em>Little v. Telegraph Co., </em><a href="/pa/213/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="213 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="943434" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0229-01">213 Pa. 229</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.%20848" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="62 A. 848">62 A. 848</a>, arising from personal injuries sustained by a vehicle coming in contact with a telephone pole near the traveled portion of the highway, it was held by this court that while the right of a telegraph or telephone company to place its poles on the public highways is statutory, yet the company’s “right to use the public highways in the construction and maintenance of its lines is qualified and prohibited to the extent that the public should not be inconvenienced in the proper use of the highways.” The Act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 73, which was invoked in that case declares that the line “shall not be so constructed as to incommode the public use of said roads, streets or highways.” While the Act of , May 8, 1889, P. L. 136, conferring the right upon municipalities to give <em>electric </em>companies permission to erect and maintain poles on highways, does not <em>declare </em>the same restriction, it is legally implied that a municipality cannot consent to an entry by an electric company any more than to a telephone company, in the public highways which places them in an unsafe condition and which amounts to negligence. In 29 C. J., page 680, sec. 444, it is set forth: ^Counties and towns are not insurers of the safety of their highways, but must use ... at least ordinary or reasonable diligence at all times, when practicable, to keep the road reasonably safe in view of the. probable traffic. . . ,.

This court said in that case: “It was competent for the defendant to show that the pole was not unlawfully upon the street, but had been erected by a corporation that had a legal right to erect it and upon whom the duty to maintain it in a safe condition primarily rested. This fact would not have relieved the defendant from the duty of supervision and inspection, but its duty would have been secondary and the rule in relation thereto is less stringent than that which would apply if the pole had been unlawfully upon the street or had been erected by it and was under its sole management.” In <em>Norristown v. </em>Moyer, <a href="/pa/67/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="67 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1022570" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0355-01">67 Pa. 355</a>, it was held that plaintiff made out a case of negligence for a jury when it was shown that he was injured by the falling of a pole in the street, erected by citizens years before, the pole having become rotten. That case held further that a municipal corporation, which is bound by its charter to keep its streets in repair, is liable for an injury occasioned by its neglect to do so, and it is not material whether the neglect was wilful or not: <em>Erie v. </em>Schwingle, 10 Harris 384, 385. The principle was reiterated that negligence might consist not only of “nonfeasance, that is, omitting to do, or not doing, something which ought to be done, which a reasonable and prudent man would do,” but also of “a misfeasance, that is, the doing of something which ought not to be done* something which a reasonable man would not do, or doing it in such a manner as a man of reasonable and ordinary prudence would not do it, in either case leading to mischief or injury.” Applying this principle to the instant case, if the pole in the highway was under the circumstances something which it was im<a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>prudent and unreasonable to have there, the city’s tolerating it would be negligence from nonfeasance; its giving its initial consent to having it placed there would be negligence from misfeasance.</p>

E. 759</a>, a driver of a car collided with a trolley pole in the center of a city highway, fifty feet wide. Judgment was recovered against, inter alia, the City of Buffalo, “on the ground that the trolley poles were unreasonable and dangerous obstructions.” The city council had consented to the erection of the poles and the company placed them in the space between its tracks at intervals of 125 feet. The trial judge told the jury that the railway company and the city were liable if poles located in the center of the street were unreasonable and dangerous obstructions of the highway. The New York Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Judge Cardozo, said: “Whether that ruling may be sustained is the first question to be determined. . . . The poles, if placed and maintained with due regard for the public safety, are not unlawful obstructions. They are obstructions incidental to the exercise of a statutory right. The statute has not said, however, where the poles shall be located. <em>The implied condition is therefore attached that they must be so located as to avoid unreasonable danger to travelers upon the highway </em>[italics supplied]. . . . The railway company was, therefore, free to make its own choice if the choice was not unreasonable. Freedom of selection it had, but not freedom without limits. We do not mean to say that to make out a breach of duty it is enough to show that there was error of judgment. . . . <em>The question is whether the place chosen is so dangerous and the danger so needless that the choice becomes unreasonable. </em>[Italics supplied.] If danger in that degree is present, both the railway company and the city are charged with liability. The railway company is liable, because the poles are then a nuisance. The city is liable because the nuisance is not abated. <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>. . . The question, therefore, is whether there is any evidence that . . . when the accident occurred, the location of these poles was dangerous, and that the danger was unreasonable. . . . We think the jury had the right -to find that . . . the center poles have become a menace to the traveler. . . . The very location of the poles gives room for conflicting inferences. Plainly, there was at least some risk of accident; plainly the risk was needless, whatever its degree; plainly, therefore, the inference of fault may be drawn unless the risk was so remote or trifling that reasonable men in the exercise of reasonable care would- not have striven to avoid it. In the light of all the circumstances, we think that question was for the jury.” Among the circumstances which Judge Cardozo noted that the jury had the right to consider were “the growth in traffic during 20 years, the change in methods of locomotion, the added chances and dangers of collision, and the need, obvious without evidence, of freeing the space between curb and curb from obstructions which could be made without risk to serve their purpose elsewhere,” and the fact that in another section of the same street the poles had been admittedly a danger to public traffic. Judge Oardozo added: “We place our judgment, not on any of these circumstances singly, but on all of them collectively. Their cumulative weight, we think, makes possible the inference that the center poles had become dangerous, and that the danger was unreasonable.” He said further: “These poles were hot a municipal improvement. They were not planned and placed by the city. They were planned and placed by the railway. <em>If their location was dan</em>gerous, <em>and the danger was needless </em>[italics supplied], they violated the implied condition of the franchise, and were in the highway without right'. They were ho more a municipal improvement than defective rails or slots. . . '. The duty of the city was to see that it was kept clear of dangerous and unnecessary obstructions. . . . Error of judgment alone does not carry liability with <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>it, for error of judgment alone is consistent with reasonable care. But failure to abate dangers which reasonable care would have revealed, will charge the city with liability, and this whether the form of action be negligence or nuisance.” He cited with approval the following from <em>Kiernan v. </em>Mayor, <em>etc., of N. Y., </em><a href="/ad/14/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="14 A.D. 156" data-case-ids="2297441" data-case-paths="/ad/14/0156-01">14 App. Div. 156</a>, <a href="/nys/43/0538-02" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="43 N.Y.S. 538" data-case-ids="3504377,3504393" data-case-paths="/nys/43/0538-02,/nys/43/0538-01">43 N.

It was held that the city was responsible for the death of a man caused by the upsetting of a wagon which had struck a pole and the fact that there' was ample space between the curb and pole for teams to pass and repass, did not alter the case. We there said :• “Conceding the right of the electric company to place its poles in the center of the street and that, by reason of municipal permission, they do not create á nuisance by being located there, yet there was a duty imposed upon the electric company to exercise the power conferred by the municipality in such manner and- way as not unnecessarily to obstruct the highway or interfere with the purpose for which it was primarily constructed. . . . The beneficiary of the authority granted is required to exercise the legislative grant without negligence and with the necessary precaution to prevent injury to another.” This court there quoted Smith on “Modern Law of Municipal Corporations,” sec. 1097, as follows: “Though the legislature may authorize a person'or corporation to do an injurious act which would otherwise be a nuisance; ‘if the power be exercised . . .- in a way not to seriously injure the public, but is exercised in a way regardless of the public interest, there <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>will be no legislative protection. The grant of power is in all cases to be exercised in such manner as to least interfere with public rights and interests, and by construction the grant or license is construed in favor of the public.

The words ‘extraordinarily negligent’ denote the fact that men of ordinary experience and reasonable judgment, looking at the matter after the event and taking into account the prevalence of that ‘occasional negligence, which is one of the incidents of human life,’ would not regard it as extraordinary that the third person’s intervening act should have been done in the negligent manner in which it was done.” Viewing Messinger as the “third person” and the City of Pittsburgh as the “actor,” it cannot be held as a matter of law that the “actor” should not have realized when it permitted the pole to be placed in the line of traffic that a motorist might crash into it, nor can it be said that the motorist’s conduct was so “extraordinarily negligent” that the city could not have foreseen it when it permitted the pole to be placed and to remain in the street. .
