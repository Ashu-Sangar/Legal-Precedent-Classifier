The police power, originally conceived as applying to the health, morals and safety of the people, has been juridically extended to many fields of social and economic welfare. We have become familiar with statutes fixing rates in the case of industries affected with a public interest; neither is there any novelty in legislation aimed to control prices where the object is to prevent monopoly. But in these, as in all cases, the police power is not unrestricted; its exercise, like that of other governmental powers, is subject to constitutional limitations and judicial review, otherwise we would have an absolute instead of a constitutional scheme of government. It has frequently been stated by federal and state courts alike that a law which purports to be an exercise of the police power must not be arbitrary, unreasonable or patently beyond the necessities of the case, and the means which it employs must have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained: <em>Mugler v.

Price cutting in itself is not an evil; on the contrary, the more intense the competition the greater the likely advantage to the purchasing public. Indeed there is no reason why a merchant should not make an absolute gift of merchandise to his customers if he desires to be benevolent or thereby to advertise his business. There are many other conceivable and wholly proper reasons which might induce him to make sales without profit, as, for example, a necessity of paying importunate creditors. It is only when the object of price cutting is sinister, — to destroy a competitor by suffering a temporary loss in order to gain an ultimate monopoly <em>(Mogul Steamship Co., Ltd., v. McGregor, Gow &amp; Co., </em>23 Q. B., L. R. 598), or to defraud the public by seducing them into the purchase of other goods at an exorbitant price — that the selling of goods at less than cost may constitute an economic or social evil. The Pennsylvania act, therefore, is arbitrary, and the means which it employs are grossly out of proportion to the object which it seeks to attain.</p>

Closest of all to the present case, and practically determinative of it, is <em>Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota, </em><a href="/us/274/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="274 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="81092" data-case-paths="/us/274/0001-01">274 U. S. 1</a>, w;here it was held that a state law which made it an offense for anyone engaged in the business of buying milk, cream, or butter fat, for manufacture or sale, to pay a higher price therefor in some localities of the state than in others was an unconstitutional infringement of liberty of contract. • The court there said (p. 9) : "The real question comes to this— May the State, in order to prevent some strong buyers of cream from doing things which may tend to monopoly,' inhibit plaintiff in error from carrying on its business in the usual way heretofore regarded as both moral and <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>beneficial to the public and not shown now to be accompanied by evil results as ordinary incidents? Former decisions here require a negative answer. We think the inhibition of the statute has no reasonable relation to the anticipated evil — high bidding by some with purpose to monopolize or destroy competition. Looking through form to substance, it clearly and unmistakably infringes private rights whose exercise does not ordinarily produce evil consequences, but the reverse.”</p>
    <p id="b496-4" data-blocks='[["BL_496.5",496,[271,865,1150,479]]]'>The Commonwealth seeks to minimize the objectionable generality of the act by stressing the instances excepted from its provisions, as, for example, sales in liquidation, and sales of damaged and perishable merchandise. But these are minor in nature and leave practically untouched the sweeping prohibition of profitless sales made in the ordinary course of business and without any intent which is malicious or inimical to the public welfare.</p>

It may, however, be briefly pointed out, as to one of these, that, in creating an offense which was not a crime at common law, a penal statute must lay down a reasonably ascertainable standard of guilt;, it must be sufficiently explicit to enable a citizen to ascertain with a fair degree of precision what acts it intends to prohibit, and therefore what conduct on his part will render him liable to its penalties, — in the present case, to make it possible for a vendor to know whether a proposed sale at a given price would violate the provisions of the act. It would be within the knowledge of a merchant to know what his merchandise cost him, but if he wished to avail himself of the other standard of cost prescribed in the statute, namely, what the last quantity purchased by him would have cost if bought at the most favorable market price available to him at any time within the preceding thirty days, how could such cost be ascer<a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>tained without his exhausting every possible source of inquiry to find out what the most favorable market price was that would have been available to him within the time specified? And even if such price could, from a practical standpoint, be discovered, who could reasonably determine whether, as stipulated by the act, the price thus used as a basis for computing cost would be “justified by existing market conditions within this State”? And how could a merchant know whether a selling price which, he proposed to fix was legal because it met “the legal price of a competitor for merchandise of the same grade, quantity and quality”? How could such “legal price of a competitor” be ascertained without examining the competitor’s books in order to determine whether <em>Ms </em>price was legal? The standard set by the act to differentiate criminal from legitimate sales is so vague, indefinite and incapable of practical application that this in itself would make its enforcement a violation of the due process clause: <em>International Harvester Co. v.
