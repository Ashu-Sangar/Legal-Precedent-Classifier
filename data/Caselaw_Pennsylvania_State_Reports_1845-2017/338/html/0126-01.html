He was shot and injured hy John Lenzi, a duly elected constable of the adjoining Township of Plymouth.

A robbery had' been perpetrated in that borough and the robber had been fired- at by a policeman. Investigation by police at the barn disclosed some clothing and rags supposed to be blood stained. On the night of November 16, 1938, the chief of police of Conshohocken, other police, including plaintiff, a county detective <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>and Lénzi, the constable, apparently summoned by the sergeant of defendant’s private police, avIio had been appointed by the court, Avith the poAvers of a police officer, visited the barn about midnight to make an investigation. It was testified that they were in search of a “trespasser” but it is obvious from the evidence that they were conducting a general police inspection. They were under the direction of the chief of police of the borough. After the inspection was completed, it was arranged that the sergeant of defendant’s police and the constable should remain at the bam to watch for intruders and that the police officers should return at 3:30 in the morning to see Avhat had developed. It was the understanding that the two selected to remain should stay outside the bam. All of the men, including the constable, were in uniform. At the hour arranged, plaintiff and another police officer returned to the barn and ascended the stairs to the second floor. Upon arriving there, the constable, who with the sergeant Avas on the second floor in hiding, for some unexplained reason, fired the shotgun which was in his hands and inflicted injuries on plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[264,1564,1150,529]]]'>It was shown that the constable at times had been employed by defendant as an electrical helper and at other times had directed traffic in the road in front of defendant’s entrance gate, whether by its direction does not appear. But whatever he may have done in its behalf or howsoever employed by it at other times, it is clear that on the night in question he was acting as constable — as peace officer — in the discharge of his public service and duty and that defendant is not responsible for his act.</p>
