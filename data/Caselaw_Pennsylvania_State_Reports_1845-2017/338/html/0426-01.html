The statement of claim averred that on June 25,1931, Jacob Zayc made application to an agent of the appellee insurance company for a twenty payment life insurance policy in the sum of $2,000, with double indemnity provision, and that he paid four dollars as a deposit on the first premium ; that after June 25, 1931, Zayc was interviewed by agents of other companies, but, relying upon an alleged custom of insurance carriers to accept or reject applications within a reasonable time, the application made by him with appellee’s agent, and appellee’s retention of his deposit, he refrained from making any other application; that appellee did not reject or refuse the application on or before August 24, 1931, on which date Zayc was accidently killed, and did not theretofore offer to return his four dollar deposit; and that by reason of the negligence of appellee in failing to ad: vise Zayc within a reasonable time that a policy would or would not be issued, he was deprived of life insurance protection which he otherwise would have had.</p>

The case went to trial, and, at the close of appellant’s evidence, appellee moved for compulsory non-suit. This motion was denied, whereupon appellee rested, without offering any testimony, and submitted a point for binding instructions, which was likewise refused.</p>

He asserts a right to recover on the theory that where an application has been made and there has been delay on the part of the agent in forwarding, or on the part of the insurance company in accepting or rejecting the application, such delay constitutes a tort. Manifestly appellant’s attempt in this manner to hold the insurer responsible in damages for the amount of a policy because of delay, and thereby to accomplish by indirection that which the law has persistently refused to permit to be done directly, in an action ex contractu, cannot prevail, unless, independently of statute or contract, a legal duty devolved upon the insurance company either to accept or reject the application for insurance within a reasonable time. It is fundamental that negligence and liability therefor cannot be predicated upon a state of facts which does not impose any legal duty. “As a matter of course there can be no recovery in such a case, unless the defendant <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>was guilty of a breach of some legal duty which he owed to the plaintiffs.

As a general proposition it is true, as was said in <em>Bisson v. Kelly, </em><a href="/pa/314/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="314 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="1154642" data-case-paths="/pa/314/0099-01">314 Pa. 99</a>, 110, that “It is a primary <em>social </em>duty of every person to take thought and have a care lest his action result in injuries to others” and that “This social duty the <em>law </em>recognizes and <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>enforces, and for any injury resulting from any person’s lack of elementary forethought the law holds that person accountable.” However, this general proposition is not universal in its application. The law does not impose on persons in general a duty to act to save others from harm, but only in certain specific situations is there an affirmative legal obligation to act. And, as is pointed out in <em>Swentusky v. Prudential Ins.

Thus, it is said in <em>Insurance Co. v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/23/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="23 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="974019" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0072-01">supra,</a> “But it is said that the loss did not take place for near six months after the application, and that during all that time the defendants neglected to refund the money, and to notify the plaintiffs that their proposal was rejected. . . . What is the true effect of the delay? ... A neglect or delay that has properly a tendency to mislead another, and which is incompatible with honesty, may be charged as a ground of liability. . . . But in this case the plaintiffs had in their own hands the power of correcting the delay; for undue delay in accepting a proposal may be and ought to be treated as a rejection of it, and the proposer may refuse to' be bound by a tardy acceptance. A proposal not answered remains a proposal for a reasonable time, and is then regarded as withdrawn. Both parties are interested in its acceptance, and, both are expected to attend to it with reasonable diligence.” More <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>recently, in <em>Munhall v.

This may be and, indeed, perhaps some would regard it a salutary rule of law which would require, all persons to whom solicited offers are made to treat them with reasonable care.

In this connection, however, it is noteworthy that, granting the existence of the duty, there is a lack of unanimity of opinion as to whom it is owed. The majority of jurisdictions allowing recovery hold that the estate of the applicant and not the named beneficiary in a life insurance policy is the proper party to sue. But, because of the anomalous results which this view produces in instances where the beneficiary is a third party, comparatively recent cases take the position that if there is a right of action, it is the beneficiary who should sue and recover.
