        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Maxey,\nPlaintiff brought an action in trespass against defendant company for damages for personal injuries resulting to him by reason of certain harmful gases emitted from certain mines. The mine located under the property of plaintiff was known as No. 3 Mine, and was operated by the Patton Clay Manufacturing Company until 1932, after which date the operation was discontinued. Subsequent thereto, there were cave-ins of this mine and these were filled or partially filled by defendant with hot ashes, hot coke, cinders, and hot bitten or waste pipe, which, it is alleged, set fire to the crop coal in this mine and caused harmful gases to be emitted therefrom. These .gases entered the house of plaintiff, causing him to be overcome and rendered unconscious from January 28, 1936, to January 31, 1936. It is also alleged that this caused plaintiff other physical illness of a substantial character. The negligence pleaded is that defendant allowed its abandoned mine to cave in and carelessly dumped into such cave-ins \u201chot ashes, hot coke, cinders and hot bitten or waste pipe.\u201d It is pleaded that \u201cin dumping hot ashes\u201d etc., over an outcrop of coal, they should have known that this would cause a fire which would produce dangerous and poisonous gases, \u201cwhich they knew or should have known would enter plaintiff\u2019s home.\u201d\nIn the affidavit of defense it is averred, inter alia, that the alleged injuries complained of by plaintiff \u201chave resulted by reason of a fire in an abandoned coal mine underneath or in close proximity to plaintiff\u2019s property. Said coal having been removed a number of years ago by one Karlheim, then owner of the property, and later by William Medlicott under lease from the Beech Creek Coal and Coke Company, then owner of the fee. And that pillars or stumps of coal were left standing in said mine. That fire gained access to said old coal mine or workings by reason of the burning of a public rubbish dump, used by residents of the Borough of Patton, which rubbish dump covered the entrance to the abandoned mine or workings of William Medlicott.\u201d It was also averred that the \u201crubbish dump was set on fire from time to time by children playing around the same, and by other persons unknown to the defendant, and over whom defendant had no control.\u201d Defendant' further averred that they did not own the land on which the rubbish dump was burning, that they did not at any time own or operate a mine to mine and remove coal from that land, \u201cnor did they mine or remove coal from said abandoned mine or workings\u201d and that defendant \u201cin no manner contributed to the cause of said fire or the advance thereof.\u201d It is further averred by defendant that it \u201cnever at any time operated a coal mine under the property of the plaintiff, Steve Musleva, nor under property adjacent thereto.\u201d Defendant, however, admits that it did operate a clay mine on another property but that it discontinued the operation of this mine in 1932. Defendant denied that it filled cave-ins with hot ashes, hot coke, cinders and hot bitten or waste pipe.\nThe case went to trial and on conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, the court entered a compulsory nonsuit, which it subsequently refused to take off. This appeal followed.\nThe court stated in its opinion that there was not sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant company to go to the jury.\nAt the trial it was testified in behalf of plaintiff that the fire clay mine of defendant company ran up to within about ten feet of plaintiff\u2019s property line and that a watercourse had been driven entirely through the Mislevy property. This was the only clay mining that was done under that property. This watercourse was nine feet wide and eight feet high. The cover over the fire clay was about twenty feet in thickness at the Mislevy home. There was some outcrop coal near the Mislevy property, and there was evidence that there was some outcrop coal near the refuse dump of defendant company, and also that there were some openings at this point from the surface into the mine. Another witness testified that there were cave-ins of the clay mine a couple hundred feet from the Mislevy home. He said that he did not know whether the ashes dumped in these cave-ins were hot or cold, but that he did see lots of smoke coming up when they dumped the refuse in these holes. Another witness testified that she saw smoke coming from the cave-ins along the road leading to plaintiff\u2019s house, and that heat was escaping from the dump. On cross-examination she was asked whether she saw a dump truck dumping broken and bitten pipe into the cave-ins, and she replied, \u201cYes, sir. Easily ten years before 1936.\u201d She was asked: \u201cAt that time there was no fire, or no heat of any kind?\u201d She answered: \u201cI never noticed it.\u201d\nThe court in its opinion said: \u201cAll the evidence in the case discloses beyond any question that this refuse dump had been in use for twenty-five or thirty years and, in our opinion, the testimony is very indefinite and unsatisfactory as to the firing of the outcrop of coal, or any of the coal in the mine workings at any time within the period of the statute of limitations. The only evidence is that there were hot ashes dumped there, but there is no satisfactory evidence as to the time of the origin of the fire, if the fire caused the generation of the gases.\u201d\nP. F. Nairn, a former deputy secretary of mines and qualified as an expert on mines and mining, testified on plaintiff\u2019s behalf that over the sink in the kitchen of the latter\u2019s home he found carbon dioxide and a small quantity of carbon monoxide. A drain pipe extended from this sink down into the abandoned workings of a coal mine. He said that over the sink his \u201cflame safety lamp went out,\u201d thus indicating to him that there was present *10% or more of the [gas] mixture.\u201d In the cellar there was about 7% of deadly gas \u201ccoming up through cracks and crevices.\u201d The court asked the witness: \u201cIs this gas similar to the gas that is found in coal mines?\u201d The witness answered: \u201cIt is the same thing.\u201d A map offered in evidence showed abandoned mine workings under plaintiff\u2019s home. After the witness had said that \u201cgas is a part of the formation of every coal seam,\u201d the eourt asked: \u201cThat gas does not depend entirely upon whether the coal is on fire or not?\u201d The answer was: \u201cNo, carbon monoxide will generate in a mine even though there isn\u2019t any fire.\u201d He also testified: \u201cFires usually occur in the waste places in the mine, and they are due to the presence of iron pyrites, commonly known as sulphur.\u201d He said there was smoke coming up through the cracks to the surface, about 300 feet from the Mislevy home and that fire would increase the amount of gases \u201cand as the pressure is increased, it would have to advance to other parts of the workings to accumulate or be forced through to the surface.\u201d He was asked: \u201cIs it your opinion that that is what happened in this case?\u201d He answered: \u201cWell, I know it was coming up through the cracks in the cellar, and through the drain pipe, over the sink, and I know that the outcrop was on fire.\u201d He examined the watercourse tunnel through the Mislevy property and found \u201cthere was no gas present in the tunnel.\u201d This tunnel passed within a few feet of the Mislevy home and was open at both ends. The witness testified on cross-examination that \u201cabandoned mines, when the circulation of air is cut off, could catch fire by spontaneous combustion.\u201d This would necessitate, he declared, \u201csome coal, either outcrop or waste coal being there.\u201d He added: \u201cFires usually occur in the waste places in the mine.\u201d\nJ. W. Paul, a mining engineer called by plaintiff, testified that \u201cwhen a coal mine is closed up ... no circulation of air passing through \u2014 carbon dioxide forms and this uniting with nitrogen and oxygen forms black damp, a gas that won\u2019t support life.\u201d This witness testified that in his opinion the origin of the fire in the dump 600 feet away from plaintiff\u2019s home was that \u201cit was caused by the application of either fire, or hot material, either at the outcrop, or at some of the caved holes. I do not believe the conditions are favorable for spontaneous combustion.\u201d The witness also gave it as his opinion that if there was a fire in the underground workings of this mine, gas from this fire could reach plaintiff\u2019s home \u201cunless there was some very positive barrier constructed within the mine to prevent the spread of the gases.\u201d\nA reading of the testimony in this case leaves one in complete doubt as to whether the gas in plaintiff\u2019s home was the gas that naturally accumulated in the abandoned coal mine under his home or whether it was gas generated by a coal fire caused by the defendant\u2019s dumping of hot material 600 feet from his home. Even if the gas came from a coal fire, it is uncertain whether this fire was caused by the dumping of hot material by the defendant or by spontaneous combustion in the abandoned mine. There was also some evidence that certain residents of the town burned rubbish on a dump about half way between the dump in question and plaintiff\u2019s home. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence fails to establish his claim, to wit: that the defendant caused the ignition of coal 600 feet from his home and that this ignition caused the generation of the gases. The evidence in this record is equally consistent with the theory that the deleterious gas had its origin in natural causes with which the defendant had no connection.\nThose who. sustain injuries and attempt to fasten upon others liability for these injuries must always bear in mind that the burden of proof rests upon them. To suspect or charge another with wrong-doing resulting in damages is one thing; proof of that charge is another. A party attempting to fix liability on another has no right to have his evidence submitted to a jury if it is so inconclusive, i. e., so lacking in persuasiveness, that it fails to establish to an ordinary, reasonable mind the truth of the charge or claim made. If the evidence is as consistent with the nonprobability of the charge made as it is with its probability, then the plaintiff has failed to establish his claim by preponderating proof.\nIn Erb v. P. R. T. Co., 256 Pa. 567, 570, 100 A. 966, we held that \u201cthe burden was on plaintiff to show that defendant\u2019s negligent act was the sole and proximate cause\u201d of the act complained of \u201cto the exclusion of other causes. To show a state of facts from which it appears the injury may have been due to one or more causes is not sufficient.\u201d In Goater v. Klotz, 279 Pa. 392, 396, 124 A. 83, this court said:. \u201cWhere the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to establish certain facts before a recovery can be had, and his testimony, or that of his witnesses, on the question, is so contradictory as to present to the jury no basis for a finding, except a mere conjecture, a nonsuit is properly entered.\u201d See Ely v. P. C. C. & St. L. Ry., 158 Pa. 233, 27 A. 970. In Venzel v. Valley Camp Coal Co., 304 Pa. 583, 591, 156 A. 240, this court said: \u201cThere was no preponderating probability as to which gas caused his death. If either one of two possible causes may be responsible, it cannot be held liable.\u201d In Natvig et ux. v. P. R. T. Co., 293 Pa. 355, 359, 143 A. 18, this court held: \u201cIf the evidence be so contradictory in the material parts as to which the plaintiff has the burden of proof so that any verdict given thereon would be a mere guess, the jury should not be permitted to consider it [citing cases]. The function of reconciliation of testimony by juries (Parker v. Matheson Motor Car Co., 241 Pa. 461 [88 A. 653]), is not abrogated by this principle. . . . The other rule is applied only when it is clear to the trial judge the verdict would be but a guess, or where the testimony leaves the matter uncertain as to the possible cause of the injury, so that the jury might guess between a number of causes of the accident, for one or more of which the defendant may not be responsible: Raftery v. Pgh. & West Va. Ry., 284 Pa. 555, 558, 131 A. 470.\u201d\nThe court below aptly said: \u201cThe crux of the case rests upon the fact that it is impossible to state from the evidence when the fire originated, if it originated at all, and the jury would be required to guess as to the cause of the generation of the poisonous gases in question. If the fire started prior to the period of the statute of limitations and injury resulted to the plaintiffs from the generation of gases from that source, recovery would be barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n\u201cThere is no measure of the weight of evidence (unless the witnesses on the evidential facts are counted) other than the feeling of probability which it engenders\u201d: Dean William Triekett, The Forum, Dickinson School of Law, Vol. 10, p. 76.",
