        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Barnes,\nThese appeals present two questions regarding the construction of the will of Bernard Corr, who died December 26, 1912. The first is raised by the appeal of Joseph K. Seidle, the adopted son of testator\u2019s daughter, Katherine M. Gorman. Her death on May 22, 1938, is the reason for the present accounting by the trustees under the will.\nTestator\u2019s will, dated May 21, 1906, set up identical trusts of $400,000 each for his four surviving daughters, named in the will as Catherine McCafferty (later Katherine M. Gorman), Annie B. Jones, Mary G. Smith, and Helen M. Duffy (now Helen M. Griffin). Each daughter was given a life interest, with power to appoint the remainder \u201cto and amongst such of her said children and descendants of children as she may select, in such way and manner as she shall direct,\u201d and in default of appointment, the fund was given to her children or descendants per stirpes. Upon the death of a daughter \u201cleaving no children or descendants of children her surviving, and having failed to exercise her aforesaid power of appointment,\u201d the will provided that the share of principal of the deceased daughter was to be distributed to the children and descendants then living of her sisters, such distribution to be made \u201cper stirpe, upon the principle of representation.\u201d\nKatherine M. Gorman, the deceased life tenant, had no natural-born children. In her will she purported to exercise her power of appointment in favor of Joseph K. Seidle, whom she called \u201cmy beloved son.\u201d She had adopted him by decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County, dated March 24, 1930, when he was approximately forty-one years of age. The auditing judge held that this appointment in favor of Seidle was ineffective, since the power could be exercised only for the benefit of natural-born children. The court in banc dismissed the exceptions filed by Seidle to the adjudication, whereupon he appealed to this Court.\nWas it the intention of testator, in conferring upon his daughter this power of appointment, to include within the appointive class a person subsequently adopted by her? Appellant\u2019s argument is devoted largely to a review of the rights of adopted children in this state to inherit from intestates. We are concerned here solely with the question of his rights, if any, under the terms of the will. Therefore Cave\u2019s Est., 326 Pa. 358, and other cases to the same effect, cited by appellant, can have no bearing upon this case.\nPrior to the passage of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, it was the established rule that adopted children could not participate in testamentary gifts to \u201cchildren\u201d : Schafer v. Eneu, 54 Pa. 304; Puterbaugh\u2019s Est., 261 Pa. 235; Yates\u2019s Est., 281 Pa. 178; Freeman\u2019s Est. (No. 1), 40 Pa. Superior Ct. 31. As the testator died five years before the effective date of the Wills Act, this is the rule that must govern the interpretation of his will. But even if the Wills Act were applicable here, Seidle\u2019s position would be no better, because that statute modifies the former rule of construction only as to persons adopted before the execution of the will. See Section 16 (b) of the Wills Act.\nAppellant cannot bring himself within the appointive class by the extrinsic evidence, introduced at the audit but later rejected by the auditing judge, relating to his inclusion in the testator\u2019s household and to the strength of the affection that existed between him and his foster mother. Neither Seidle\u2019s testimony, nor the letters which he attempted to introduce, support the construction of the will for which he contends, particularly in view of the clarity of the testator\u2019s language. See Yates\u2019s Est., supra. Moreover, in the present will there is nothing to show that the testator intended the word \u201cchildren\u201d to be extended beyond its usual import of \u201cnatural-born children,\u201d and the fact that the gift to his daughter Catherine was phrased in exactly the same language as the gifts to his other daughters confirms our conclusion.\nThe second of the two questions involved is raised by the appeals of the five children of testator\u2019s daughter, Anna C. Jones. In each trust created for a daughter, the gift over is made in the following words: \u201c. . . to pay over the said trust fund of Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000) to and amongst the children or descendants, then living, of her sisters, the said fund to be divided amongst such children or descendants per stirpe, upon the principle of representation \u201d In addition to the children of Anna C. Jones, the three children of Mary G. Smith are entitled to participate in the gift over of the share of Katherine M. Gorman. The appellants contend that the words of the will require a per capita distribution of the share among the living children of the sisters. This claim was rejected by the auditing judge, and the fund was divided into two equal parts, one of which was awarded to the children of Anna C. Jones, and the other to the children of Mary G. Smith.\nThe appellants urge that the phrases \u201cper stirpe,\u201d and \u201cupon the principle of representation,\u201d were intended to apply only to the gift to the descendants of the sisters, because the children are the first takers of the gift over, and cannot take by representation. We are convinced, however, that the testator did not intend to limit the meaning of these words so narrowly.\nThe expression \u201cper stirpes\u201d may be used in two different senses; it may refer, first, to a \u201ctaking by right of representation,\u201d and second, to a taking \u201ccollectively by families and not equally as individuals\u201d: Hogg\u2019s Est., 329 Pa. 163, 167. It is clear that the testator used it in the second sense in the gift to the children of the deceased daughter\u2019s sisters, for otherwise there is no provision for the manner of distribution among them. In view of the careful draftsmanship of the will, and the manifest desire of the testator to direct the method of distribution of every gift, we cannot assume that he intended to make no provision for the distribution of this gift over among his grandchildren.\nAppellants urge that the additional phrase \u201cupon the principle of representation\u201d modifies the words \u201cper stirpe\u201d and requires that they be understood in the first sense, to refer to a taking in lieu of a deceased ancestor. The mere addition of these words, so frequently and loosely employed by scriveners in conjunction with the phrase \u201cper stirpes\u201d cannot overcome the plain purpose of the testator in this case. The will in its entirety shows that he intended a stirpital distribution of his estate among his grandchildren. He directed that each of his daughters should select from her surviving children those who were to take her share, and he provided that his residuary estate should pass to his daughters or their issue per stirpes. Nowhere in the will is there a provision for distribution \u201cper capita,\u201d and it is unlikely, therefore, that he intended the gift over of the share of a daughter who died without issue surviving to be distributed in this manner in the absence of an express provision.\nFurthermore, if the testator did not intend the words \u201cper stirpe\u201d to refer to the gift over to the children (of the sisters), the inclusion of the children in the clause \u201cto he divided amongst such children or descendants per stirpe,\u201d would be purposeless, because of the provision immediately preceding that they be paid the share of the deceased daughter, for this alone would have been sufficient to create the gift to the children, per capita. As we cannot assume that any of the words are meaningless, we conclude that the testator intended the words \u201cper stirpe\u201d to refer to the gifts to both children and descendants of the sisters, and the words \u201cupon the principle of representation\u201d to refer to the gift to the descendants, alone.\nThe court, therefore, was correct in awarding the share of Katherine M. Gorman in two equal parts to the children of Anna C. Jones and the children of Mary G. Smith.\nThe decrees are affirmed; costs in each appeal to be paid by the estate.\nCave\u2019s Est., 326 Pa. 358, holding that ah adopted child may inherit from the collateral kindred of the adoptive parents, deals solely with the law of inheritance and intestate succession.\nThis sub-section provides: \u201cWhenever in any will a bequest or devise shall be made to the child or children of any person other than the testator, without naming such child or children, such bequest or devise shall be construed to include any adopted child or children of such other person who were adopted before the date of the will, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.\u201d\nThese children are Bernard O. Jones, J. L. Bryant Jones, Dorothy Julia Jones, Catharyne Rita Jones, and Charles James Jones, Jr.; Charles J. Jones, Jr. has assigned his interest under the will to his mother, Arma C. Jones.\nAnna C. Jones was referred to in the will as \u201cAnnie B. Jones.\u201d\nThey are Helen A. Greenhalgh, Mary G. Heuisler and Rita M. Smith Castner. Helen A. Greenhalgh and Mary G. Heuisler have assigned their interests to Nana E. Scott,\nFor illustrations of a stirpital distribution among primary legatees, without reference to the decease of an ancestor, see Osburn\u2019s App., 104 Pa. 637; Miller\u2019s Est. (No. 2), 26 Pa.
