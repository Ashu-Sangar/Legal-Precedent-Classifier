        "text": "CONCURRING STATEMENT\nCHIEF JUSTICE SAYLOR\nI write in response to Justice Wecht\u2019s dissenting statement, which chides the Court for amending an original grant order to conform with the precise wording presented by the appellant in the first instance, and for purportedly accepting review of a waived issue.\nFirst of all, this Court\u2019s original grant order restyling the statement of the question presented was not a limited one\u2014 rather, the issue was merely and expressly \u201crephrased for clarity.\u201d Erie Ins. Exch. v. Bristol, 639 Pa. 187, 160 A.3d 123, 2016 WL 7475709 (2016) (per curiam). In joining that order, I, for one, had no intention of limiting a pivotal substantive question out of the case. Accordingly, I regard the Court\u2019s present action not as some extraordinary \u201cretroactive expansion],\u201d Dissenting Statement at 192, 160 A.3d at 125, but rather, as an appropriate correction which, importantly, conforms entirely with the briefs submitted to this Court by the litigants.\nSecond, as to the waiver concern, running throughout Appellant Bristol\u2019s submissions in the common pleas and intermediate courts is the assertion that \u201cErie\u2019s claim that this matter is barred by the applicable statute of limitations is without merit because, by agreeing to resolve this matter through arbitration, there was no need for and no legal or contractual requirement that Michael Bristol file a Complaint, Petition to Compel Arbitration or any other pleading.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgement in Erie Ins. Exch. v. Bristol, No. 2013-12947, 2014 WL 11770053 (C.P. Montgomery), at 6-7 (emphasis added). Although it would have been best for Appellant to forthrightly indicate in the common pleas court that he understood that the court was bound by prevailing Superior Court precedent concerning the timing of the commencement of the limitations period, but that he wished nevertheless to preserve a challenge for purposes of potential appellate review, I believe that his arguments have been phrased broadly enough to substantively subsume the commencement issue.\nSignificantly, moreover, nowhere in Appellee\u2019s present brief does the company contend that the commencement issue is waived. Indeed, Appellee repeatedly invites this Court to review the issue and to institutionalize the prevailing Superior Court precedent on the subject. See, e.g., Brief for Appellee at 27 (\u201c[Tjhis Court should uphold the Hopkins rule that provides a sensible and easy to establish time for the statute of limitations to begin to run.\u201d). In my view, the sua sponte scouring of trial records to identify waiver concerns\u2014when all litigants agree that an important issue is presented that should be resolved by this Court\u2014can be disruptive. In this regard, I have often commented on the prudential roots of the waiver doctrine, and, from my perspective, its proper application through discerning judgment.\nFinally, attempting to decide a tolling question in the absence of a settled understanding as to when the applicable limitations period commences is fraught with difficulties. For instance, it may be that the Court would find tolling appropriate only if the statute runs from the date of injury, as the intermediate-court precedent holds. Tolling, in this regard, could be viewed as compensation for an underlying approach to commencement with which the Court disagrees. Were the Court to proceed on such a basis, it would issue a decision having application only within an underlying framework of the Superior Court\u2019s design, which could later be rejected by this Court. Our decision, of course, would need to be carefully crafted with all the necessary disclaimers to avoid adoption of a regime that this Court has never previously addressed.\nI see no reason that such abstractions need to come into play here. Rather, I regard the Court\u2019s present amendatory order as an appropriate one.\nJustices Baer, Todd, Donohue, Dougherty and Mundy join this concurring statement.\n. The dissent's assertion that the case substantively was always and entirely about equitable tolling overlooks Appellant's contention\u2014also advanced in the petition for allowance of appeal\u2014that there was no legal requirement to act in the first instance. See Petition for Allowance of Appeal at 11 (contending that \"the event that triggers a party\u2019s obligation to seek judicial intervention, i.e., the refusal to arbitrate, never occurred here\u201d); see also id. at 12 (\"By agreeing to resolve this matter through arbitration, there was no need for and no legal or contractual requirement that [Appellant] file a Complaint, Petition to Compel Arbitration, or any other pleading.\u201d). In the absence of an underlying legal requirement to affirmatively preserve a cause of action, there is no predicate for equity to intervene, and nothing to be tolled.",

        "text": "DISSENTING STATEMENT\nJUSTICE WECHT\nToday\u2019s learned Majority is eager to decide the point at which a cause of action should accrue in the context of an uninsured motorist coverage dispute; so eager, in fact, that the Majority takes the unusual step of retroactively expanding and resculpting the scope of our December 29, 2016 allocatur grant. This is ill-advised.\nThe Majority begins by purporting to adopt the issue statement \u201cas originally framed in [Bristol\u2019s] Petition for Allowance of Appeal,\u201d but then proceeds to venture that it \u201cunderstands this issue to encompass\u201d arguments regarding when \u201ca cause of action accrues\u2014thereby triggering the commencement of the statutory period for bringing a claim.\u201d Per Curiam Order at 189, 160 A.3d at 123-24. The provenance of this understanding is unknown. Indeed, one may search through Bristol\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal all day long but in vain for any objection concerning the time at which his cause of action accrued. The issue that Bristol raised in his petition concerns what a claimant must do to toll the statute of limitations. The Majority\u2019s willingness now to reach back in time and reshape the case suggests a \u201cbuild to suit\u201d approach that is jurisprudentially unsound and antithetical to principles of judicial restraint.\nMichael Bristol has waived the issue that Today\u2019s Majority desires to resolve. One need not \u201cscour[ ] ... trial records to identify waiver\u201d here. This case is and always was about tolling; even a casual reading of the lower court opinions suffices to make this clear. In the trial court, Bristol never took the position that the four-year statute of limitations governing uninsured motorist claims begins to run only when an insurer explicitly rejects the claim. To the contrary, Bristol conceded that the applicable limitations period commenced on the date of the alleged vehicle accident. See Bristol\u2019s Answer to Erie\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, 10/10/2014, at 2 \u00b6 22 (admitting that the limitations period in this case commenced on July 22, 2005),\nBristol\u2019s sole argument in opposition to Erie\u2019s motion for summary judgment was that Erie \u201cshould be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense\u201d because: (1) Bristol notified Erie that he intended to pursue an uninsured motorist claim \u2018'within four years of the date of the accident and (2) Erie agreed to proceed to arbitration and then appointed an arbitrator.\nConsistent with his position at the trial level, Bristol raised the following issue on appeal to the Superior Court:\nDoes the four-year statute of limitations under 42 [Pa.C.S.] \u00a7 5525 bar a claim for uninsured motorist benefits when:\nThe parties had agreed to arbitrate the claim in accordance with the terms of the policy;\nThe parties had selected their respective arbitrators, but had not yet agreed upon the selection of a neutral arbitrator;\nThe claimant had provided a statement under oath to the insurer;\nThe insurer does not allege, and the trial court does not find, that the insurer was prejudiced by any delays in proceeding to arbitration?\nSuperior Court Opinion, 1119 EDA 2015, at 4 (quoting Bristol\u2019s Superior Court brief).\nIn other words, Bristol did not dispute that the four-year limitations period commenced on the date of the accident. Instead, he argued that the above facts tolled the statute of limitations. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that this Court\u2019s December 29, 2016 Order granting Bristol\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal focused upon whether \u201cextra-judicial actions,\u201d such as an informal demand for arbitration or the appointment of arbitrators, can \u201ctoll the statute of limitations.\u201d 689 Pa. 187, 160 A.3d 128 (2016).\nUnder prevailing Superior Court precedent, Bristol\u2019s cause of action against Erie accrued when his right to payment under the insurance contract vested (i.e., on the date of the vehicle accident). See Boyle v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 310 Pa.Super. 10, 456 A.2d 156, 162 (1983). I have no objection to this Court, in an appropriate case, adopting a different rule. But this is not an appropriate case. Even if one assumes that this Court has leeway to rewrite an issue statement after the parties have briefed and argued a case (and I do not so assume), the fact remains that Bristol has waived the issue that the Court\u2014after today\u2019s order\u2014is poised to decide.\nIt is not simply that \u201cit would have been best\u201d for Bristol \u201cto preserve a challenge for purposes of potential appellate review.\u201d Concurring Statement at 190-91, 160 A.3d at 124. Rather, it was mandatory. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (\u201cIssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Barnes, 637 Pa. 493, 151 A.3d 121, 124 (2016) (\u201cTypically, an appellant waives any claim that is not properly raised in the first instance before the trial court and preserved at every stage of his appeal.\u201d); City of Phila. v. Lerner, 637 Pa. 605, 151 A.3d 1020, 1026 (2016) (Saylor, C.J., dissenting) (noting that \u201c[t]his Court, of course, has moved far away from [the waiver doctrine\u2019s] prudential roots in the direction of strict enforcement of waiver\u201d).\nWith regard to the suggestion that the practice of assuming, but not deciding, the correctness of an intermediate court decision is \u201cfraught with difficulties,\u201d Concurring Statement at 190-91, 160 A.3d at 124-25, the obvious answer is that this Court should simply decline to review cases that will require such maneuvering. Notably, however, this Court often has little difficulty resolving appeals while avoiding unpreserved issues of first impression. See e.g., Duffey v. W.C.A.B. (Troladyne, Inc.), 638 Pa. 55, 152 A.3d 984, 986 n.4 (2017) (assuming \u201cthe validity of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s precedent\u201d); Commonwealth v. Kingston, 636 Pa. 438, 143 A.3d 917, 922 n.3 (2016) (assuming, without deciding, that prevailing Superior Court precedent is correct).\nIf adhering to our own rules of appellate procedure is too \u201cdisruptive,\u201d Concurring Statement at 191, 160 A.3d at 125, it seems to me that we should seek to amend them. Selective enforcement is not the solution. At that point, rules become mere suggestions. And we can then dispense with the notion that equity is cabined by law. \u201cThis is a court of review, not a tribunal unbounded by rules. We do not sit ... dispensing justice according to considerations of individual expediency.\u201d Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 11, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).\nI respectfully dissent.\n. Concurring Statement at 190-91, 160 A.3d at 124-25.\n. Bristol\u2019s Answer to Erie's Motion for Summary Judgment at 4, 9 (emphasis added); see also Notes of Testimony, 3/11/2015, at 14 (counsel for Bristol arguing that Bristol would have been required to file a petition to compel arbitration if Erie had not appointed an arbitrator), Bristol\u2019s contention that \"there was no need for and no legal or contractual requirement that [he] file a Complaint, Petition to Compel Arbitration^] or any other pleading\u201d is entirely consistent with his argument that the parties\u2019 extra-judicial acts tolled the statute of limitations. Bristol\u2019s Answer to Erie\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment at 6-7. Chief Justice Saylor seems to suggest that this vague sentence \"subsume[s] the commencement issue.\u201d Concurring Statement at 190-91, 160 A.3d at 124. Respectfully, it does not. Lest there be any doubt, the language appears just two pages after Bristol\u2019s concession that the statute of limitations began to run on July 22, 2005, and three pages before Bristol takes the position that his claim is not time barred because he informed Erie that he was pursuing an uninsured motorist claim \"within four years of the date of the accident.\u201d Id. at 2, 9.\n. It is trae that Bristol, in his brief to this Court, now takes the position that his cause of action against Erie never even accrued. See Brief for Bristol at 10. But that does not mean that the Court should decide an unpreserved issue. If anything, rewarding Bristol for briefing an issue outside the scope of our allocatur grant will only encourage future litigants to do the same.\n. This is, of course, distinct from the situation in which the Court rephrases an appellant\u2019s issue statement at the allocatur stage, usually in an effort to promote clarity or to discourage the parties from briefing extraneous matters.",
