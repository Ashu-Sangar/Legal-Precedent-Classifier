After the State Ethics Commission confirmed Section 1103(g) applied to limit Shaulis’s ability to practice in the relevant tribunals, this Court determined she was aggrieved because “if she took the actions therein proscribed, she would expose herself to the exact ethical investigation that she was attempting to forestall by seeking the advice of the Commission in the first place.” <em>Shaulis, </em><a href="/pa/574/0680-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="833 A.2d 123" data-case-ids="588007,9081567" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0680-01,/a2d/833/0123-01">833 A.2d at 130</a>.

The intended effect of these limited restrictions is obvious, and based on a sound and salutary public policy: to prevent conflicts of interest, or appearances thereof, in a historically controversial industry, by restricting current Board employees of all kinds from using their special contacts and insider expertise as a springboard to other employment opportunities in the field, at least for a closely circumscribed period of time. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief for Respondent at 18, <em>quoting Pennsylvania Senate Journal, </em>2009 Reg.

Such restrictions are not novel and can also be found in other industries where employees are privy to information and knowledge which could lead to an appearance of a conflict of interest in their field post-employment. <em>See, e.g., In re Clader, </em><a href="/a3d/135/1062-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="135 A.3d 1062" data-case-ids="6811537" data-case-paths="/a3d/135/1062-01">135 A.3d 1062</a>, 1072-73 (Pa.

Our Rules of Professional Conduct impose upon attorneys various affirmative obligations designed to protect against the conflicts of interest that can arise when public employees approach (or are approached by) individuals or entities with interests that lie within their agency’s jurisdiction with regard to future employment. To that end, Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 1.11 prevents a current government official or employee who is an attorney from negotiating employment with individuals and entities who have any present interest in matters with which that attorney is involved in her public capacity. <em>See </em>Pa.R.P.C. 1.11(d).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> However, the commentary to the rule cites the need <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>for balance, noting that “the rules governing lawyers presently or formerly employed by a government agency should not be so restrictive as to inhibit transfer of employment to and from the government.” Pa.R.P.C. 1.11, note 4.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>

The Majority opines that I have ignored “the clear holdings of this Court’s decisions in <em>P.J.S. </em>and <em>Maunus[,]" </em>Maj. Op. at 545, 161 A.3d at 242. Both cases preceded <em>Shaulis, </em>and neither provides sufficient clarity in this area of the law as it is implicated in the particular circumstances of today’s case. As the Majority notes, <em>Maunus </em>did not mention <em>Wajert </em>except "in a string-cite list of distinguishable cases[.]” Maj. Op. at 547 n. 9, 161 A.3d at 243 n. 9. <em>Maunus </em>and <em>P.J.S. </em>are distinguishable to the extent that those holdings did not pertain to former employees, while <em>Wajert </em>and <em>Shaulis </em>are directly relevant to the case at bar. Confronted with a fact pattern distinct from the circumstances at issue in either <em>Maunus </em>or <em>P.J.S., </em>the <em>Shaulis </em>Court carefully reconciled our precedents in an attempt to clarify this area of the law in relation to former attorney-employees, who were being restrained from practicing their profession. Like the attorney in <em>Shaulis </em>and the judge in <em>Wajert, </em>the restrictions here purport to cabin Attorney Yocum’s ability to practice her profession <em>in futuro. </em>Today’s case presents an additional wrinkle: here, the Board’s restrictions sweep up other employees (non-attorneys) in addition to attorneys. This additional feature does not remove, cure or immunize the impact that the restrictions have upon the practice of law, nor does it alter the fact that these restrictions are inconsistent with our express constitutional authority.</p>

Having said that, while note 4 to Rule 1,11 is suggestive regarding the impermissibility of proscribing <em>in toto </em>what we might characterize as job-seeking by an attorney while still in government employment, it is in undeniable tension with Rule 1.11(d)(2)(ii)'s restriction regarding with whom a government attorney may "negotiate for private employment" while "currently serving as a public officer or employee,” While that subparagraph of Rule 1.11 captures direct and obvious conflicts, such as arise when an attorney for a company seeking a gaming license is in talks regarding future employment with a Board attorney who is specifically reviewing that company’s application, it leaves the door open to future employment-related discussions with gaming entities or law firms with a gaming practice when it is foreseeable that such entity or firm will appear before the Board under circumstances that may fall within the attorney’s bailiwick, This naturally triggers entirely salutary concerns as to an actual or apparent conflict of interest arising from one’s present employment, precisely the concerns presumptively embodied in the Gaming Act’s prohibitions,</p>

I believe that the Majority underestimates the efficiency of the disciplinary system and our role in it, while overestimating attorney violations of our Rules of Professional Conduct. While the Majority correctly reports that more than 60,000 lawyers are in active practice in this Commonwealth, it fails to note that the Disciplinary Board, acting under our exclusive authority to regulate attorney conduct, received 3900 complaints in 2016 and resolved 3668 complaints, of which 240 resulted in discipline (most or all of which were the subject of lengthy and detailed review by this Court). <em>See </em>Annual Report, The Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 2016, <em>available at </em>http:// www.padisciplinaryboard.org/aboul/annualreports.php (noting that a disciplinary matter involving a single attorney may consist of multiple complaints).</p>

Op. at 551 n. 11, 161 A.3d at 246 n. 11. True it is that the Board has no obligation to track changes of address in an effort to identify possible conflicts of interest. The practice of law is quintessentially a self-regulating profession. As licensed professionals, attorneys practicing law in this Commonwealth are self-monitoring. They must personally examine their practices to avoid conflicts of interest in representations. Attorneys also have an obligation to report violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct to the Disciplinary Board. Pa.R.P.C. 8.3, Explanatory Comment. Before deciding to change employment or to accept a new representation, attorneys practicing in this Commonwealth have an ethical obligation to consider whether their actions are in compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct. Of particular significance in the present context, an attorney departing employment with the Gaming Board must determine whether his or her subsequent employment (and representations in connection therewith) complies with Rule 1.11, Law firms in this Commonwealth likewise have a variety of obligations to ensure conflict-free representations.
