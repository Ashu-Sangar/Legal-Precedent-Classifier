(“Mother”) and J.D.M. (“Father”) are the parents of A.D.M. (born March 2007) and L.B.M. (born May 2011). On July 2, 2013, Franklin County Children and Youth Services (“CYS”) conducted a home visit with Mother. The visit was prompted by a referral alleging that Mother was on the verge of becoming homeless. The next day, Mother contacted CYS seeking to place the children due to her unstable living conditions. At the time, Father was incarcerated. That same day, the trial court ordered the children to be placed with CYS. Soon after, the children were adjudicated dependent. As required by Section 6311, the trial court appointed a GAL for the children (Attorney Kristen Hamilton) at the beginning of the dependency proceedings.</p>

On November 25, 2014, after two hearings, the trial court issued findings of fact and a decree. The trial court declined to terminate Mother’s parental rights, finding that Mother, while only recently released from jail, had obtained both housing and employment. Decree, 11/25/2014, at 8,14-16.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Further, Mother had attended almost all of her available visits with the children and had <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>engaged and bonded with them. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9, 18.

However, while reunification was pending, L.B.M. returned from a weekend visit with Mother with bruises on his neck and chest. Although the bruises were suspected to be non-accidental, an investigation did not reveal their cause. Ultimately, the trial court delayed reunification in order to permit A.D.M. to finish the school year. Shortly thereafter, it was discovered that Mother had again violated her probation by living apart from her approved residence. Mother was reincarcerated. While in jail, Mother participated in visits with the children until her privileges were suspended after she tested positive for suboxone.</p>

In cases other than involuntary <em>(i.e., </em>contested) TPRs, the General Assembly has instructed that either counsel or a GAL adequately can represent the child’s interests. However, when a child’s relationship with his or her birth family could be severed permanently and against the wishes of the parents, the legislature made the policy judgment, as is evident from the plain, unambiguous language of the statute, that a lawyer who represents the child’s legal interests, and who is directed by the child, is a necessity. It is not our role to second-guess the policy choice made and expressed by the General Assembly. Nor is the legislative choice surprising; appointment of client-directed counsel optimizes the protection of the child’s needs and welfare, which form the ultimate issue that the trial court must resolve before granting the TPR.

Because the GAL is familiar with the case and has represented the child’s legal interests in the dependency case to the extent permitted by Pa.R.J.C.P. 1154 and Section 6311, there is some facial appeal in pressing (or allowing) the GAL into service as the child’s counsel for the TPR proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Moreover, because the Adoption Act does not require the appointment of a GAL, it might be suggested that the dependency GAL would not have to act as GAL during the TPR and could serve solely as the child’s lawyer in that latter proceeding, converting, as it were, to the “counsel” role specified by statute. But practical concerns militate against such dual service for the GAL. First, if the dependency GAL also was appointed as counsel for the TPR, all of <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>those involved—the court, the lawyers, the parties, the agencies—would have to be clear about the distinction between the roles: to wit, that the GAL advocates for the child’s best interests while counsel advocates for the child’s legal interests. That change in roles, and the subtle yet important distinction between those roles, has the potential to breed confusion for the child as well as other parties. Second, the dependency proceedings generally remain ongoing when the TPR petition is filed and may well continue, as they indeed did here, in the event that the petition is denied. To permit the dependency GAL to serve also as the TPR counsel while proceedings in each matter are ongoing increases the risk of confusion and may force the attorney to take conflicting stances in the proceedings depending on the role being performed at the time. These concerns argue against the GAL serving additionally in the distinct role of TPR counsel.</p>

In other cases, as CYS notes, an attorney, guided by Pa.R.P.C. 1.7 (Conflicts of Interest), may determine that he or she ethically cannot represent multiple children in a family because the children’s legal interests diverge. However, the language of Section 2313(a) is clear. The General Assembly has made the policy decision that these are the costs of ensuring that a child is represented adequately during a contested, involuntary TPR proceeding.

With respect to the former, the framers of our Constitutions, and the courts interpreting those charters, have determined that counsel was required to ensure that liberty interests and process rights are protected. With respect to the latter, our General Assembly has decided that counsel for the child is required because of the primacy of children’s welfare, the fundamental nature of the parent-child relationship and the permanency of termination. The legislature has codified a process that affords a full and fair opportunity for all of the affected parties to be heard and to participate in a TPR proceeding. The denial of mandated counsel compromises the framework of the proceedings and constitutes a structural error. Further, as suggested by the Juvenile Law Center, harmless error analysis would require speculation after the fact to evaluate the effect of the lack of appointed counsel, effectively requiring proof of a negative.

However, the General Assembly chose to use the term "counsel." Had the General Assembly believed that an attorney representing both best and legal interests of the child would be sufficient to protect all of a child’s interests, it certainly could have imported language into the Adoption Act similar to that utilized in the dependency statute, see 42 Pa.C.S. § 6111(b)(9), in which the legislature authorized a GAL to represent both species of interests.

Respectfully, my learned colleague Justice Baer’s desire to "allow[ ] the child to have continuity of representation between the dependency and termination proceedings...," Baer, J., dissenting at 454, 161 A.3d at 188, obscures this distinction and conflates the roles of GAL and counsel for the child.

While he agrees that failure to appoint counsel is a structural error, Baer, J. dissenting, at 454, 161 A.3d at 188, Justice Baer nonetheless suggests that remand is unnecessary in this case because “the record does not support Mother’s assertion that a conflict of interest existed between A.D.M.’s legal and best interests during the second termination proceeding.” <em>Id. </em>at 455-56, 161 A.3d at 189. We cannot know how the record was impoverished by the failure of the trial court to comply with the statute’s requirements that A.D.M. be provided with counsel charged with representing his legal interests. Counsel representing A.D.M.’s legal interests may have developed testimony from A.D.M. that was less equivocal about his wishes. It is this very speculation that shows the impossibility of determining <em>post hoc </em>the effect of the failure to appoint counsel and that compels the conclusion that this failure was structural error.</p>

A contextual reading of the passage is similarly not dispositive. The plurality aptly explains that the statutory scheme evinces the Legislature’s intent to distinguish between the respective roles of counsel, whose duty is to further the child’s legal interests, and a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>whose obligation is to advance the child’s best interests. It does not follow, however, that the General Assembly intended to categorically proscribe a guardian <em>ad litem </em>from serving as counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Thus, where zealous representation is made impossible because of an attorney’s duties as guardian <em>ad </em>litem—or, for that matter, any other reason—the court must refrain from making the appointment and should find a suitable candidate. Conversely, in the absence of an actual or potential conflict between a child’s legal and best interests, I see no reason why a guardian <em>ad litem </em>may not also serve as counsel. There are multiple scenarios in which a child’s legal and best interests may be indistinguishable, including, most notably, cases involving children who are too young to express their wishes.

As relevant to this case, a GAL Attorney should be assigned when a child “is without proper parental care or control, subsistence, education as required by law, or other care or control necessary for the physical, mental or emotional health, or morals,” a classification which corresponds to one of the definitions of a dependent child under the Juvenile Act. Pa.R.J.C.P. 1151(A)(1); 42 Pa. C.S. § 6302 (“Dependent Child”)(l).

Thus, in dependency proceedings under the Juvenile Act, a GAL Attorney represents both the best interests and legal interests of the child absent a conflict of interest. If there is a conflict of interest, the child must have a GAL representing her best interests and separate legal counsel representing legal interests. This provision is consistent with Pennsylvania’s Rules of Professional Conduct which forbid an attorney from representing a client “if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest.” Pa.

As such, it would be a better practice for courts in every contested termination proceeding to place an order on the record formalizing the appointment of counsel to highlight for all parties the responsibility for the representation of the child’s legal interests, while simultaneously permitting that attorney to serve as the child’s GAL so long as there is no conflict of interest between the child’s legal and best interests.</p>

Instead, I conclude that the trial court was correct in denying Mother’s motion because Mother sought not the appointment of counsel generally, but instead requested the appointment of “independent counsel.” Motion to Appoint Counsel for the Child [A.D.M.].

A conflict of interest may have existed during the first termination proceeding in 2014 when the GAL recommended that termination was in A.D.M.’s best interest in contrast to A.D.M.’s articulated desire to be reunited with Mother. However, by the time of the second termination proceeding, A.D.M. expressed a desire to live with his foster parents. He first noted that it was “a really hard decision because they both care about me. But my mom doesn’t act like it.” N.T., 9/15/2015, at 10. He then stated that he would “probably go with” his foster parents because he felt “like [his] mom’s not safe because she could probably do drugs again,” which he recognized would result in yet another removal of him and his younger brother. Id. at 11. In contrast he noted that living with his foster parents “would be pretty good because they’re a good family and they take good care of me.” Id. at 17. He also clearly expressed his desire for permanency, noting that he had been “in foster care for a really long time [and had] been switching around with foster families a lot.” Id. <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>Understandably, he hoped that if he was placed with his foster parents that his mom’s “family could connect with the [foster family], the whole entire family.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_7" id="ref_footnote_3_7">7</a> Id. at 18.

Nevertheless, as the trial court noted in denying Mother’s motion for appointment of new counsel, the children had an established relationship with the GAL attorney, and her continued representation would best suit the needs of the children. Id. In light of the statutory interpretation discussion above, I fail to see how this contested involuntary termination proceeding is “any other proceeding,” or how the GAL attorney appointed to represent the children is not “mandated counsel” in accordance with the first sentence.

The next sentence of <em>Hess, </em>however, makes clear that although the court’s intent was to appoint counsel that owed a loyalty to the child, it did not intend to limit counsel to advocate solely for the child’s legal interests. Indeed, the court was very much concerned with the child’s best interests and stated:</p>

Like the main opinion in this case, the <em>KM. </em>court also focused on the meaning of the second sentence of the statute in relation to the first sentence, but nevertheless concluded that the statute did not preclude a GAL attorney from serving as legal counsel for the children. Upon reflection, I believe KM.’s focus on the second sentence was unnecessary.

Nevertheless, there are two points I wish to make, First, as noted, the appointment of additional counsel following the appointment of a GAL attorney is superfluous. In this matter the GAL attorney represented the children’s interests throughout dependency proceedings. Under the main opinion’s interpretation, in addition to the GAL attorney, it would have been necessary to appoint an attorney for the first termination hearing when CYS petitioned to involuntarily terminate the parental rights of both Mother and Father. At that hearing, Father’s rights were involuntarily terminated, but Mother’s rights were not. Once the petition to involuntarily terminate Mother’s rights was denied, the Section 2313(a) appointed legal counsel would no longer be involved in the matter, and the GAL attorney would resume her sole advocacy on behalf of the children during the permanency proceedings. At the commencement of the second termination hearing, it would again be necessary to appoint Section 2313 legal counsel, possibly the same attorney that represented the children at the first termination hearing, perhaps a new attorney. This legal counsel would represent the children alongside the GAL attorney throughout the termination hearing. It is my view such dual representation is both unnecessary and taxing to the system, and undermines continuity of representation for the children.</p>

Opinion, at 442-43, 161 A.3d at 181. As previously noted, the GAL attorney must do this in the dependency actions, and Rule 1154 provides a procedure for appointing separate legal counsel from the GAL attorney if a conflict of interest between the child’s wishes and best interests arise. I see no basis for concluding that a GAL attorney would be incapable of being held to the same standard in contested involuntary termination of parental rights <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>cases. Further, in cases involving young children or children with limited capacity, the child may be unable to express a separate legal interest to an independent attorney appointed in addition to the GAL attorney, but would nevertheless be required to have one appointed under the plurality’s interpretation. Therefore, I disagree with the plurality’s holding that the GAL attorney cannot represent the child in a contested termination hearing.</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[267,847,1155,737]]]'>In conclusion, by writing separately I am in no way discounting the importance of the child’s interests or diminishing the mandate of Section 2313(a)’s requirement of appointment of counsel. A contested involuntary termination hearing is a proceeding with the highest level of finality, and no child should proceed into one absent representation by an attorney. I write separately because I believe appointment of a GAL attorney satisfies the mandates of Section 2313(a) and ensures the needs and welfare of the child will be adequately advanced. In my opinion, a remand for the appointment of a second attorney in this matter, when a GAL attorney already represented the children in accordance with Section 2313(a), is unnecessary. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>
