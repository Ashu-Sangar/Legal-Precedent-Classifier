He was sentenced to death for R.R.’s murder. In this automatic direct appeal,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Johnson raises nine issues for our review.

Talley, who was twenty weeks pregnant, and her mother left briefly to obtain a money order for a partial amount of Talley’s rent. Upon their return, Johnson arrived at the apartment. Johnson and Talley were friends and he was well acquainted with her visiting family members. Johnson was storing some of his belongings in the apartment and Talley occasionally allowed him to stay overnight. Johnson socialized with Talley and her family that afternoon. When Talley’s mother and sisters left at approximately 2:30 p.m., Johnson remained.</p>

The fire emitted a thick, black smoke that made it difficult for the responding firefighters to gain entry. Once inside, firefighters discovered Talley’s lifeless body in the bedroom. Talley was lying face-down with numerous stab wounds to her head, neck and body. A plastic bag was also wrapped tightly around her head.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Small, empty yellow wax bags stamped in red ink with “# 1 way to go” were found scattered around Talley’s body. More of these distinctive empty wax bags were found in a shoebox in the bedroom. In the living room, the firefighters found an unresponsive R.R. in a pool of blood beneath an overturned couch. R.R. had been stabbed in the chest and bled profusely. She was rushed to the hospital, but pronounced dead soon after her arrival. Minutes before the fire was detected, a resident of Avalon Court observed Talley’s vehicle speed out of the parking lot, hitting <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>another vehicle in its haste. The resident noticed that vehicle was being driven by a black male.</p>
    <p id="b248-4" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[260,467,1154,783]]]'>While emergency responders were still at the scene of the fire, Johnson placed a series of calls to Talley’s cousin, Brittany Coles. Ms. Coles, who had been alerted to what was happening at Talley’s apartment and was in a frantic state, told Johnson about the fire. Because she was at work and could not leave, she implored Johnson to return to the apartment complex to obtain more information. Johnson refused, explaining that he wanted to avoid the police because there were outstanding warrants for his arrest. Later that afternoon, Johnson called Talley’s sister, Paulina Burke. Ms. Burke informed Johnson that both Talley and R.R. had died. She asked Johnson to turn Talley’s vehicle over to the police and otherwise aid in the police investigation. Again, Johnson refused, citing the outstanding warrants as the basis for his refusal.</p>

When the police approached the vehicle, they found it was vacant. They also noticed that the license plate had been changed, but the VIN number, which is visible through the windshield, verified that it was Talley’s vehicle. Shortly after 7:00 p.m., Johnson entered the vehicle and began to leave the parking lot. The police immediately stopped him, utilizing a “felony stop” procedure. During a felony stop, the police officers remain shielded by their vehicles and, with weapons drawn, they instruct the motorist to exit his car, demonstrate that he does not possess a weapon, and lay on the ground before they approach. The police then transported Johnson to their headquarters for questioning. A subsequent search of Talley’s <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>vehicle revealed, among other items, a bundle of eight empty wax packets stamped in red with “# 1 way to go,” in the ash tray. These packets were identical to the packets found around Talley’s body and in her bedroom.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[193,582,1156,964]]]'>At the police station, Johnson waived his Miranda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> rights and agreed to speak with investigators. He explained his friendship with Talley and acknowledged that he was at her apartment earlier that day. He stated that he left Talley’s home on foot and met up with a friend named Eric Stahl, who was driving Talley’s vehicle, and that Stahl gave him the keys later that day. After being confronted with evidence that conflicted with this account, Johnson changed his story and admitted both to taking Talley’s car and her Xbox gaming system and hitting another vehicle as he did. When asked why he did not come to the scene of the fire or the police station at Talley’s family’s requests, he reiterated his concern about the arrest warrants. The police arrested Johnson that evening on charges of possession of drug paraphernalia based on items found in his possession when the police stopped him in Talley’s vehicle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> That night, while he was in custody, the police obtained and executed a warrant for samples of Johnson’s DNA, fingernail scrapings, hair samples and clothes.</p>

While detained in the Bucks County Correctional Facility, Johnson admitted to another inmate that he killed Talley and that he killed R.R. because she could identify him as her mother’s killer. Also while incarcerated, Johnson phoned his brother, Marquis Johnson, and told him that he hid “evidence” in a precise location at the Levittown Trace Apartments and asked him to retrieve it, admonishing that the items should never see the light of day. Marquis did as his brother requested and retrieved a blue plastic glove containing 167 packets of heroin, <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>all in wax packets stamped in red with “# 1 way to go,” and a money order for eighty dollars.</p>

      <em>Id. </em>at 200. Johnson also presented an assemblage of evidence under the catchall mitigating factor, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8), including evidence that Johnson’s life up until the time of the murders was characterized by chronic and pervasive abuse, neglect and abandonment; that he suffered brain damage and had been diagnosed with various mental illnesses; cycles of placement in and out of treatment programs; and a complete lack of any semblance of stability or permanence. The jury ultimately sentenced Johnson to death for R.R.’s murder and life in prison for Talley’s murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

To begin, Johnson admitted to killing both Talley and R.R., thereby establishing that they were unlawfully killed and that Johnson killed them. In his confession, he stated that Talley “made [him] kill her[,]” and acknowledged killing R.R. so that she could not identify him as her mother’s killer N.T., 6/1/2015, at 230, 233-35.</p>

Dr. Ian Hood, a forensic pathologist, testified that Talley suffered thirty-five stab wounds to her head, neck, chest and abdomen. N.T., 5/28/2016, at 205. One wound perforated the common carotid artery in her neck and two others entered her chest cavity, causing a collapsed lung and internal bleeding. <em>Id. </em>at 206-08.

Fires were set on or immediately beside the incapacitated Talley and R.R., N.T., 5/27/2015, at 186-88, and were discovered approximately half an hour after Talley’s mother and sister left, just minutes after Johnson was observed fleeing the scene at a high rate of speed in Talley’s vehicle. N.T., 5/29/2015, at 300. This evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, places Johnson in the apartment at the relevant time. Moreover, Talley’s DNA was found under Johnson’s fingernails, which, according to expert testimony, was not the result of casual contact with Talley. <em>Id. </em>at 186-87. Dr. Hood testified that Talley’s body bore multiple defensive wounds and that the relatively shallow depth of many of the stab wounds was the result of Talley’s struggle against her assailant. N.T., 5/28/2015, at 205, 210. Johnson was observed to <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>have recent lacerations on his hands and fingers just a few hours after the murders, and he had changed his clothes.

Johnson’s Brief at 37. Notably, Johnson does not dispute the evidence detailed above. Instead, he directs our attention to other evidence. For instance, Johnson acknowledges that he fled Talley’s apartment complex in a hurry, but argues that flight alone does not establish guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 38. He suggests that other people involved in the drug trade could have wanted to harm Talley, and presents an alternative scenario in which he arrived at the apartment only to find that it had been set on fire and fled in a panic. <em>Id. </em>at 38-39. He also points to the lack of blood found on his clothes and body, that his blood was not found in Talley’s apartment, and that his DNA was not found on Talley. <em>Id. </em>at 39-40.</p>
    <p id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[189,1326,1155,574]]]'>These alleged deficiencies of physical evidence were, however, offset by other evidence.

N.T., 5/27/2015, at 113; N.T., 5/29/2015, at 41. Likewise, Johnson’s focus on the absence of incriminating blood or DNA at the scene of the crime may be explained by testimony from a Commonwealth witness that the blood and DNA samples recovered from Talley’s apartment proved to be unsuitable for testing.

Instead, without discussing the three factors individually, he offers a blanket statement that these aggravating circumstances fail to adequately define what constitutes a circumstance that would fall under each of them, and therefore “fail to provide any meaningful basis for distinguishing those few cases in which the death penalty is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.” Johnson’s Brief at 80.
