An ample number of bustling corn and grist mills operated there during the 1700s, and it served as a vital supply depot for the colonists during the Revolutionary War. Later, during the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s, a number of paper mills and various other manufacturing industries began operating in and around the Borough. Manufacturing remained a cornerstone of the Borough’s economy throughout the majority of the 20th century.</p>

Thus, in 1925, the Borough created Kerr Park, a municipal park along the eastern banks of Brandywine Creek, which was noteworthy in that it was sustained not only by public expenditures, but by a community subscription program in which Borough residents voluntarily paid a monthly fee for maintenance and operation of the park. Kardon Park, at issue herein, was likewise created by the Borough for similar public purposes through a series of land acquisitions in the 1960s and 1970s, explained in more detail <em>infra. </em>It lies just east of Kerr Park, and straddles the northern border of the Borough with East Cain Township.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In the 1930s, the property which now comprises the western part of the park was extensively quarried for minerals by its owners. Once the minerals were exhausted, the open quarry pits were filled in with industrial waste generated by various industries operating within the Borough, as well as municipal waste. Orphans’ Court Opinion, 10/7/10, at 5, The waste dumped into these quarries included iron slag, heavy metals, paper, and wood products. <em>Id. </em>at 18.

Thereafter, in 1984, a paved, multi-use trail was constructed in the park by the Borough, which named it the “Lion’s Trail.” It runs along the western banks of Second and Third Lakes, traversing the entirety of the Southern and Northern Parcels, whereupon it exits the park and joins with the “Struble Trail,” which is a part of the national Rails to Trails Network. At the same time, the Borough also constructed a parking lot at the southern end of the park near Pennsylvania Avenue for use by park patrons.

Advanced Geo-Services crafted a comprehensive plan to address the contamination which called for a two-foot layer of topsoil to be spread over the areas in which waste had historically been dumped.

Accordingly, to determine if the park had been dedicated to public use, the court considered the Borough’s stated reasons for acquiring the land to create the park—to expand the available land in the Borough which could be utilized for recreation activities, historical, and conservation purposes—as well as the Borough’s lengthy history of maintaining and making improvements to the park, and the continuous recreational and other public uses of the park by the community. Although the court noted that certain areas of the park were used more heavily by patrons—such as the walking trail, the areas around the Victims of Violence Memorial, the ponds, and the parking areas—the court nonetheless concluded that the public had always been given access to the entire park property and used those other areas from time to time. Consequently, the court concluded that the park property, as a whole, was dedicated to public use.</p>

Observing that there was a complete lack of legal authority regarding the burden of proof the Borough had to meet to demonstrate these factors, the court chose to apply a preponderance of the evidence standard. The court rejected the Borough and Developers’ argument that the contaminated soil in the western portion of the park rendered the park, as a whole, unsuitable for its continued use by the public. The court found that, even after both environmental assessments identified the presence <a id="p693" href="#p693" data-label="693" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*693</a>of heavy metals and toxic waste imbedded in the soil, the Borough took no action to restrict the public’s access to the whole park, including its western areas which were the most heavily polluted, and the Borough continued to maintain the park so that it was open for the same public activities for which it had historically been used.</p>

Accordingly, in the court’s view, because the evidence of record showed the public use to which the park was dedicated remained unchanged even after the identification of the contaminated soil, the Borough failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the park’s original use was impracticable or impossible, or that the park had ceased to serve the public’s interest.

Objectors Kim Manufacturing and Stewart Hall (“Kim and Stewart”) argue that the Commonwealth Court in <em>Downingtown II </em>misapplied our Court’s decision in <em>Erie Golf Course </em>by deeming the DDPA’s application to be dependent on the manner in which the property is acquired by the political subdivision, thereby disregarding the public purpose for which the property is subsequently dedicated, and the corresponding interest the public acquires because of this dedication. Kim and Stewart contend that the Commonwealth Court improperly considered the Northern Parcels to have been dedicated when they were acquired, in part, with Project 70 Act funds, and Project 70 Act deed restrictions were placed on the properties. Kim and Stewart aver that the imposition of these deed restrictions was distinct from the dedication of the property which involved a series of actions on the part of the Borough over many years, and included the use of federal and state grant monies to <a id="p710" href="#p710" data-label="710" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*710</a>undertake various improvements to the park, as well as the Borough’s own maintenance activities and enhancements of the park. In Kim and Stewart’s view, our Court in <em>Erie Golf Course </em>held that the application of the DDPA to the disposition of dedicated public property is dependent on acts of dedication and is not triggered merely by the insertion of Project 70 Act-like restrictions in a deed. Consequently, according to Objectors, the DDPA continues to apply to the Northern Parcels, as they were dedicated to use as a public park, even though the General Assembly removed the formal Project 70 Act restrictions from them.</p>

Kim and Stewart assert the Commonwealth Court in <em>Downingtown </em>I—a decision that tribunal relied on in <em>Down-ingtown II </em>for its holding regarding the Northern Parcels— improperly found that their acquisition with Project 70 Act funds, and the legislature’s subsequent release of Northern Parcel 11-4-13 via the 1999 legislation, were the crucial factors determining their proper disposition. Instead, and again, Kim and Stewart proffer that our Court actually held in <em>Erie Golf Course </em>that it was the <em>dedication </em>of a property, and not the conditions of its original purchase, which were determinative of the DDPA’s applicability.</p>

Kim and Stewart point out this could imperil the 500 municipal parks it estimates have been built throughout the Commonwealth using Project 70 Act funds, and would exclude the judiciary and the public from participation in the disposition process, as the DDPA requires; hence, it “would signal a statewide ‘cash for parks’ opportunity” which would undermine the land preservation goals which the Project 70 Act sought to accomplish.

Thus, the Borough and Developers argue that the dedication was effected at the time the Northern Parcels were acquired with Project 70 funds and Project 70 Act restrictions, not through any later actions by the Borough or the public. Consequently, they reason, when the legislature authorized their release from Project 70 Act restrictions through the 1999 and 2012 legislation, and removed the restrictive covenant in the deeds, this voided their dedication and permitted their conveyance by the Borough. The Borough and Developers reason that, because Section 3946.20(b) of Project 70 Act limits the Borough’s disposition of lands acquired with Project 70 Act funds to the purposes specified in the Act, and requires the imposition of the restrictive covenant in the deed of conveyance, removal of these restrictions through subsequent legislation “necessarily authorizes the municipality to ‘dispose[ ] of or use[ ] the property ” for purposes other than those permitted by Project 70 Act. Borough and Developers Brief at 33 (citing 72 Pa.C.S. § 3946.20 (alterations original)). In the Borough and Developers’ view, the legislation releasing the Northern Parcels, which was enacted while the parcels were still being used as parkland, must be viewed as specific legislation that governs the Borough’s right to dispose of the parcels in the manner it sees fit, overriding any rights the public may have acquired under the DDPA—a statute the Borough and Developer consider to apply only to “the general category of dedicated property.” <em><a href="/pa/635/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="132 A.3d 978" data-case-ids="12280119,6822458" data-case-paths="/pa/635/0163-01,/a3d/132/0978-01">Id.</a></em>

The Borough and Developers further note that the 2012 legislation anticipates that the Borough will develop the park, as it placed a number of restrictions on the sale of the property in connection with the Borough’s planned development and the use of its proceeds.

As the orphans’ court found in its first opinion, and which finding is amply supported by the record, the Borough committed this land, along with the other three parcels which are the subject of this litigation, to public use as a park, expressly via ceremony, and via its actions of expending public monies over the course of two decades to maintain this land for public use and to make permanent improvements thereon. Likewise, the orphans’ court’s finding that the public accepted this land for this use as a park is equally well supported by the evidence of record.

Lackawanna Energy, Ltd., </em><a href="/pa/584/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="584 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="988571" data-case-paths="/pa/584/0550-01">584 Pa. 550</a>, <a href="/a2d/886/0667-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="886 A.2d 667" data-case-ids="8898399,8898511,988473,988571" data-case-paths="/a2d/886/0667-01,/a2d/886/0667-02,/pa/584/0549-02,/pa/584/0550-01">886 A.2d 667</a>, 678 n.7 (2005). Thus, as the easements would confer on Developers the right to control and use the portions of the parkland subject to the easements, the Borough has ceded to a private party some of the Borough’s exclusive rights as trustee of that land to manage it for the public’s benefit, thereby subordinating those public rights to the private rights of the easement holders. For these reasons, we conclude that the Borough was required to seek judicial approval from the orphans’ court under Section 3384 in order to grant the easements in question. We, therefore, reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court on this question, and remand this matter to it for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

Judge Simpson authored a concurring and dissenting opinion, joined by Judge McGinley, in which he joined the majority opinion with respect to its resolution of the issues involving the Northern Parcels and the Meisel Parcel; however, he dissented as to the majority’s ruling regarding the Southern Parcels. Judge Simpson noted that there is a conflict between the DDPA and the Eminent Domain Code as to which entity has controlling discretion to decide when property held in public trust by a governmental body is no longer being used for a public purpose and may be disposed of. As interpreted by <em>Erie Golf Course, </em>the DDPA vests such decision-making authority in the orphans’ court, whereas, under the Eminent Domain Code, the governmental body as condemnor retains sole authority to decide whether the public use of the property has been abandoned. Judge Simpson suggested that, to resolve this apparent statutory conflict, it would be proper to apply the approach taken by our Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Ogontz Area Neighbors Ass'n, </em><a href="/pa/505/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="505 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1788903" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0614-01">505 Pa. 614</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="505 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1788903" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0614-01">483 A.2d 448</a> (1984), and reaffirmed in <em>SEPTA v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/627/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="627 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="4352215" data-case-paths="/pa/627/0470-01">627 Pa. 470</a>, <a href="/pa/627/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="101 A.3d 79" data-case-ids="4352215,6913264" data-case-paths="/pa/627/0470-01,/a3d/101/0079-01">101 A.3d 79</a> (2014), which requires that the statutory language first be examined to see if it can be determined that the legislature intended one entity to have preeminent decision-making authority. Employing this approach, Judge Simpson concluded that the language in Section 3386 of the DDPA—which states that "[njothing in this act shall be construed to limit or effect the control by a political subdivision of public lands .,, acquired by such political subdivision by purchase or condemnation,” 53 P.S. § 3386— indicates that the condemning municipality should be the decision-maker regarding public trust property acquired by condemnation. Judge Simpson considered our decision in <em>Erie Golf Course </em>to be <a id="p705" href="#p705" data-label="705" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*705</a>distinguishable as, given the ambiguity in the term "purchase” as used in the DDPA, he viewed it as an attempt by our Court to protect a political subdivision from being subject to the more restrictive preexisting common law public trust doctrine which more heavily curtailed discretionary rights to dispose of purchased property, while not entirely excluding such purchased property from the scope of the DDPA’s application. By contrast, Judge Simpson discerned no ambiguity in the term "condemnation” and, hence, he considered Section 3386 to clearly exclude condemned property from its ambit.</p>
      <p id="A__" data-blocks='[["BL_745.2",745,[224,2084,1125,308]]]'>Judge McCullough joined the majority opinion in all respects except for its affirmance of the orphans' court decision regarding the grant of the easements for the Meisel Parcel and Northern Parcel 40-1-23.1. In Judge McCullough’s view, the easements violated the DDPA because they were granted solely for the benefit of Developers so that they could comply with the open space requirements of the Borough’s ordinance; thus, she opined that the easements impermissibly favored a private use of public land.</p>
