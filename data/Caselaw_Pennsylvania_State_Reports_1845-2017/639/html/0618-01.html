At this second meeting, Holland reviewed the disability policy and advised the Yenchis to keep it, as it was a good policy and he could not offer them a comparable product.</p>

The Proposal contained a notice that it had been prepared by “your American Express financial advisor” (Holland) and that “[a]t your request, your American Express financial advisor can recommend products distributed by American Express Financial Advisors and its affiliates as investment alternatives for existing securities.” Complaint, 11/13/2003, Exhibit 1, at 3. The Proposal offered the Yenchis a number of general recommendations, including that they monitor monthly expenses, consolidate their debt, consider various savings plans, consolidate current life insurance policies into one policy, review long-term care coverage, keep accurate records for tax purposes (medical expenses and charitable contributions), transfer 401(k) funds into mutual funds, and continue estate planning with an attorney and their financial advisor. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8.

In January 1996, Holland proposed a whole life insurance policy for Mr. Yenchi with an initial $116,000 death benefit. In June 1996, he proposed a similar policy for Mr. Yenchi with an initial $100,000 death benefit, plus a $25,000 rider for Ms. Yenchi. Mr. Yenchi purchased the latter policy, cashing out his five Met Life policies to make the initial payment. Because Mr. Yenchi also purchased the rider for Ms. Yenchi, she did not need to cash in her existing life insurance policies for a new one. Instead, in <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>1997 Ms. Yenchi used the proceeds from her two Met Life policies to purchase a deferred variable annuity. In 1998, Holland proposed that the Yenchis increase their life insurance coverage to $800,000, but they rejected Holland’s advice on this occasion, deciding that they had enough life insurance.</p>

Of relevance here, with respect to the breach of fiduciary duty claim, the trial court held that no fiduciary relationship was established between the Yenchis and Holland because the Yenchis continued to make their own investment decisions. Trial Court Memorandum, 7/28/2014, at 3. The trial court cited to its own prior decision in <em>Ihnat v. Pover, </em>146 P.L.J. 299, 303-10 (1999), in which it held that no fiduciary duty arises between an insurance agent and a policyholder unless the policyholder delegates decision-making control to the insurance agent. In applying its <em>Ihnat </em>decision, the trial court rejected the notion that there was any material difference between an insurance agent and a financial advisor. The trial court further indicated that the Yenchis “knew they were dealing with a representative of American Express who was <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>recommending purchases of American Express investments.” Trial Court Memorandum, 7/28/2014, at 4. While the trial court noted that this fact may be relevant to the Yenchis’ fraudulent misrepresentation and UTPCPL claims, it did not provide support for a fiduciary duty claim, since “a breach of fiduciary duty claim requires a policyholder to give up control.” <em>Id.</em>

Among the issues presented to the Superior Court was the dismissal of the breach of fiduciary duty claim. With respect to this issue, the Superior Court agreed with the Yenchis that the trial court erred in focusing exclusively on the nature of the relationship in question (that of a buyer and seller of insurance) and the Yenchis’ retention of decision-making authority over their investments. <em>Yenchi v.

Appellants claim that if, as the Yenchis suggest, a fiduciary relationship may be created any time one party relies upon the superior skill, knowledge or expertise of the other party, then fiduciary relationships would arguably exist in virtually every consumer transaction, including with plumbers, mechanics and salespeople.

The Yenchis contend that Appellants held themselves out as experts in financial and retirement planning matters, and that, by contrast, they had only high school educations and no experience working with a financial advisor. This substantial difference of relevant knowledge, the Yenchis insist, created a question of material fact as to whether their relationship with Holland was one so marked by dependence and inequality that it permitted him to take advantage of them. The Yenchis claim that they reasonably believed and trusted that Holland had prepared the Proposal, and later recommended the purchase of the 1996 whole life insurance policy, with their best interests in mind.</p>

In this regard, the analysis is no different in a consumer transaction than in other fiduciary duty cases decided by this Court. “[T]he critical question is whether the relationship goes beyond mere reliance on superior skill, and into a relationship characterized by ‘overmastering influence’ on one side or ‘weakness, dependence, or trust, justifiably reposed’ on the other side,” which results in the effective ceding of control over decision-making by the party whose property is being taken. <em>eToll, Inc., </em><a href="/a2d/811/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="811 A.2d 10" data-case-ids="9311676" data-case-paths="/a2d/811/0010-01">811 A.2d at 23</a> (emphasis in original) (holding that although an advertising company was <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>a “trusted advisor” to a software developer, no fiduciary relationship existed between the parties) (citing <em>Basile v.

While we recognize that the premium structure and payout terms of the 1996 whole life insurance policy were complicated, that fact does not change the character of the transaction in question. The Yenchis purchased an insurance product from a captive financial advisor with whom they had a business relationship for a little more than a year, initiated by a cold-call.

Capital Gains Research Bureau, </em><a href="/us/375/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="375 U.S. 180" data-case-ids="11718394" data-case-paths="/us/375/0180-01">375 U.S. 180</a>, 187, <a href="/us/375/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="375 U.S. 180" data-case-ids="11718394" data-case-paths="/us/375/0180-01">84 S.Ct. 275</a>, <a href="/us/375/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="375 U.S. 180" data-case-ids="11718394" data-case-paths="/us/375/0180-01">11 L.Ed.2d 237</a> (1963)). As Appellants correctly note, however, this ruling and legislation have no application here, as the present case does not involve advice regarding the purchase of securities. These laws, however, illustrate the manner in which legislative enactments can police an industry. We decline to make a change to the common law of fiduciary duty with respect to an entire industry. Such a sweeping change should be left to the Legislature, based upon its consideration of the various policy concerns and the financial implications of regulations on consumers and the industry.</p>

I find it significant that, early in their relationship with Appellants, the Yenchis paid $350 for a “Financial Management Proposal,” which was prepared by Bryan Holland, identified on the cover of the proposal as an “American Express financial advisor”, and, on the third-page “Important Message,” identified as “your American Express financial advisor”. Exhibit 1 to Deposition of Eugene Yenchi, 12/2/09 (R.R. at 296a). Except for the cover, each page of the proposal was marked “Confidential.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=316%20A.2d%20883" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="316 A.2d 883">Id.</a> </em>Critically, the recommendations in the proposal were the basis for the now-complained-of consolidation of the Yenchis’ life insurance policies in 1996. In my view, the fact that the Yenchis paid for financial advice, independent of and prior to any decision to purchase life insurance products from Appellants, suggests that their relationship was not simply an arms-length one between customer and insurance agent, but that, for their money, they reasonably could have expected some measure of fidelity to their interests from their self-proclaimed “advis- or.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

In their depositions, the Yenchis repeatedly indicated that they trusted Holland, and relied on his superior expertise. <em>See, e.g., </em>Deposition of Eugene Yenchi, 12/2/09, at 29 (R.R. at 243a) (“Q: How is it that you decided where [your money] should be invested while it was at American Express? A: [Holland] advised me to go into that.”); <em>id. </em>at 119 (R.R. at 265a) (“I trusted Bryan for doing it”); <em>id. </em>at 145 (R.R. at 272a) (“we trusted him that he knew the best”); Deposition of Ruth Yenchi, 12/2/09, at 37 (R.R. at 666a) (“Q: Did you ask any questions about it of anyone, either someone from American <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>Express or anyone else? A: No. Bryan probably said something about it, but we had just figured that Bryan knew the insurance more than we did.”); <em>id. </em>at 49 (R.R. at 669a) (“He was telling me basically what was on the pages, and he was my advisor and I took his word.”). At the relevant times, they stated he was the only financial advisor they ever spoke with. <em>See, e.g., </em>Deposition of Eugene Yenchi, 12/2/09, at 66 (R.R. at 249a); Deposition of Ruth Yenchi, 12/2/09, at 37 (R.R. at 666a), Finally, they testified that they signed documents prepared by Holland without reviewing them. <em>See, e.g., </em>Deposition of Ruth Yenchi, 12/2/09, at 41 (R.R. at 667a) (“Q: Would you have read this before you signed it? A: Well, Bryan would have probably said this is to say that you got your policy and then he would say you can sign it right here .... That’s the way most of it was done.”); <em>id. </em>at 49 (R.R. at 669a) (“He was telling me basically what was on the pages, and he was my advisor and I took his word.”).</p>
    <p id="b684-4" data-blocks='[["BL_684.4",684,[265,1208,1153,946]]]'>Nevertheless, I recognize there are countervailing indicators as well. In particular, the Yenchis never testified that the fee-based proposal was the basis for their trust in Holland or Appellants, or that Holland ever stated that he was acting in their best interests. Moreover, it appears that their trust in him had its limits, given that, as noted by the majority, they declined to follow his advice at times. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 625, 638, 161 A.3d at 815, 823. But, in my view, these conflicting indicators only highlight the factual dispute concerning the existence of a fiduciary relationship. Finally, while I recognize that we have not heretofore found a confidential relationship in a comparable consumer context, I eschew categorical limitations and maintain that our focus should remain on the fact-intensive nature of the inquiry. Accordingly, because I conclude there are outstanding material factual disputes and that summary judgment was inappropriate as a matter of law, I agree with the Superior Court that the trial court’s order granting summary judgment to Appellants on their fiduciary duty claim should be reversed.</p>

In <em>Estate of Scott, </em>this Court addressed whether the relationship between a brother and sister was a confidential one, thereby allowing the sister to challenge the brother’s obtaining of her signature to create a joint bank account while she was in the hospital. Although the brother defended his actions, in part, by noting that he had previously sold his sister's car and some of her stock at her request, there was no question of a <em>business </em>relationship between them. <em>See Estate of Scott, </em><a href="/citations/?q=316%20A.2d%20883" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="316 A.2d 883">316 A.2d at 886</a>.
