Appellants argued that because Philadelphia’s powers under the First Class City Home Rule Act7 [ (FCCHRA) ] extend to enacting and enforcing anti-discrimination laws, the FPO applied to SEPTA and the Philadelphia Commission had jurisdiction over it. Appellants further contended that an original action for declaratory and injunctive relief was inappropriate because SEPTA had to await final agency decisions in the individual administrative cases against it before it could seek appellate review in court. In response, SEPTA pointed out that the statute authorizing the creation of metropolitan transportation authorities, such as SEPTA, provides that such an authority “shall exercise the public powers of the Commonwealth as an agency and instrumentality thereof,” 74 Pa.C.S. § 1711(a), and asserted that Philadelphia’s authority as a home-rule jurisdiction extends only to the regulation of its municipal affairs. In its brief in opposition to the preliminary objections, SEPTA did not rely upon, or refer to in any manner, the section of its enabling legislation pertaining to sovereign and official immunity. 74 Pa.C.S. § 1711(c)(3).

Cmwlth. 2011) <em>(en </em>banc) [ (Septa II) ]. A majority of the court concluded that the Philadelphia Commission lacked jurisdiction because SEPTA is an “agency and instrumentality” of the Commonwealth and therefore within the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (the “State Commission”). The majority noted that the State Commission is responsible for the administration of the PHRA, which bans any “employer” from engaging in certain forms of discrimination. 43 P.S. §§ 955, 956(a). Because the PHRA defines “employer” as including “the Commonwealth or any political subdivision or board, department, commission or school district thereof,”9 and because neither the PHRA nor the FPO explicitly grants the Philadelphia Commission jurisdiction over SEPTA, the majority concluded the State Commission—and not the Philadelphia Commission—had jurisdiction over SEPTA. The Commonwealth Court did not base any portion of its reasoning upon the section of SEPTA’s enabling legislation pertaining to sovereign and official immunity. 74 Pa.C.S. § 1711(c)(3). Because the majority considered the State Commission’s jurisdiction over SEPTA to be clear, and a Commonwealth instrumentality’s challenge to “the scope of a governmental body’s action pursuant to statutory authority” through a declaratory judgment action to be proper, the majority also concluded that SEPTA had no duty to exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking relief in court.

In that case, the Department of Public Welfare (“DPW”)—which we characterized as “an agency of the Commonwealth”—applied to the City of Philadelphia for the permits needed to build a facility for the mentally handicapped. Id. at 449-50. The City denied the permits on the ground that the proposed facility did not comply with use and other restrictions under the Philadelphia Zoning Code. On review in this Court, we rejected the notion that DPW was immune from local land regulations because it had the power to condemn property to establish the facility it sought to construct. We reasoned that because the General Assembly had established both the City and DPW, and had fixed the extent of each entity’s powers, we would need to examine the enabling act of each entity to determine which entity’s authority the legislature had intended to prevail for purposes of the parties’ controversy. Because the applicable statutes did not clearly state which entity the legislature had intended to be “preeminent,” we applied the rule of statutory construction that a court may determine legislative intent by considering “the consequences of a particular interpretation.” Id. at 455 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(6)). Because Philadelphia’s zoning scheme would have been frustrated if DPW were to have prevailed, while subjecting DPW to local zoning rules and restrictions would not necessarily have frustrated DPW’s mandate to establish mental health facilities, we concluded that the legislature had intended the City to have priority in the circumstances at issue.</blockquote>

The dissent therefore considered the effect of holding each entity preeminent and determined that ruling in SEPTA’s favor would frustrate the legislature’s intended scheme. Characterizing the PHRA as granting the State and Philadelphia Commissions’ “concurrent jurisdiction,” the dissent explained that deeming SEPTA “preeminent” over Appellants would thwart the legislatively established system of shared jurisdiction. The dissent explained that, on the other hand, treating Appellants as “preeminent” would not interfere with SEPTA’s purpose of providing public transportation. The dissent stated, “All the consequence of the City’s and the [State Commission’s] preeminence means is that SEPTA would still have to respond to complaints, like private companies, of those choosing to file their claims of unlawful discrimination with [the Philadelphia Commission].” SEPTA [III], <em>supra </em>at 569 (Pellegrini, J., dissenting).</blockquote>

Rather, the question must be resolved through an inquiry into the legislative intent as revealed by the pertinent enabling legislation. Thus, we rejected SEPTA’s structure-based argument that for a Municipal Authority to exercise jurisdiction over a Commonwealth agency, it was necessary for the legislature to expressly so provide.

That assertion is mistaken. Ogontz is implicated when a question arises as to legislative intent respecting competing interests between distinct entities created by the legislature. In SEPTA III, we held SEPTA was “wrong in asserting that, in order for a local governmental agency to prevail over a Commonwealth agency or instrumentality, the legislature must have clearly stated its intent in that regard.” SEPTA III, <a href="/pa/627/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="101 A.3d 79" data-case-ids="4352215,6913264" data-case-paths="/pa/627/0470-01,/a3d/101/0079-01">101 A.3d at 87</a>.

While it is undisputed that neither enabling statute contained an explicit provision directly addressing the issue, that fact did not preclude the possibility that an examination of the statutes as a whole would reveal such a clear intent. Our holding merely recognized that the Commonwealth Court in SEPTA II did not perform a review to discern the legislature’s intent because it relied on the status of SEPTA as a Commonwealth agency, treating the competing entities in a hierarchical manner.

Reviewing the legislation establishing the City’s authority under Home Rule and the legislation creating SEPTA, we note several facts are undisputed. Respecting SEPTA, it is clear the MTAA provides that SEPTA exercises its public powers as an agency of the Commonwealth. 74 Pa.C.S. § 1711(a).

The general authority of the City to legislate in this area, simply does not address the issue of its jurisdiction over SEPTA. In contrast, the sovereign immunity provisions do create an express limitation on any entity in bringing suit against SEPTA. We recognize that the legislature specifically waived sovereign immunity for Commonwealth agencies for purposes of enforcement of the PHRA. 43 P.S. § 954. It does not follow that the waiver of immunity piggybacks to the FPO merely because local municipalities are permitted to exercise concurrent enactment and enforcement authority with the State Commission with respect to the subject matter at issue. Rather, Section 954 is an explicit expression of the legislature’s intent to grant the State Commission exclusive jurisdiction over Commonwealth agencies in anti-discrimination matters. As noted above, any waiver of sovereign immunity must be specifically enacted by the legislature. 1 Pa.C.S. § 2310. No such waiver appears in the City’s Home Rule authorization or SEPTA’s enabling legislation. The fact that the FPO has an array of enforcement options does not provide a basis to infer the legislature intended only a partial exemption. As SEPTA suggests, this would require a selective reading of the FPO.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The PHRA also provides that “[t]he legislative body of a political subdivision may, by ordinance or resolution, authorize the establishment of membership in and support of a Local Human Relations Commission,” 43 P.S. § 962.1(a), and that “legislative bodies of political subdivisions shall have the authority to grant to local commissions powers and duties similar to those now exercised by the [PHRC] under the provisions of [the PHRA].” 43 P.S. § 962.1(d). Philadelphia argues that, by granting local authorities “powers and duties similar to those” of the PHRC, the General Assembly effectively expanded the PHRA’s waiver of sovereign immunity to the FPO and PHRC. However, the language of Section 962.1 does not speak specifically to waiver of sovereign immunity. As I read and consider Section 962.1, I am unable to discern the specific and clear language required to allow for importing the PHRA’s waiver to the jurisdiction of local authorities.

Section 1171(c)(3) of the MTAA, the provision granting sovereign immunity to SEPTA, provides no exclusions from the jurisdiction of any tribunal, including but not limited to no exclusions from the jurisdiction of local administrative bodies like the Philadelphia Commission. Without any mention of any jurisdictional exceptions, section 1171(c)(3) merely states that authorities created under the MTAA and their members, officials, officers and employees “shall continue to enjoy sovereign and official immunity.” 74 Pa.C.S. § 1171(c)(3). The grant of sovereign immunity is entirely irrelevant to the issue of whether the PHRC has exclusive jurisdiction over Commonwealth agencies like SEPTA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a>

      <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>Justice Wecht also contends that the General Assembly’s decision not to amend the PHRA to include anti-discrimination protections for, inter alia, gender identity and sexual orientation, at the state-wide level evinces a legislative intent not to require Commonwealth agencies to comply with local regulations that do contain these protections. This reliance on the General Assembly’s silence, however, is misguided, as it reflects nothing more than the legislature’s intention to cede to local control over the extension of protections against discrimination for additional categories of citizens. In declining to amend the PHRA, the legislators were well aware that local ordinances providing additional anti-discrimination protections existed in various political subdivisions throughout Pennsylvania, including in Philadelphia. If the General Assembly had any intention to preclude Commonwealth agencies from abiding by such protections in local ordinances, or to confer to the PHRC exclusive jurisdiction over Commonwealth agencies with respect to anti-discrimination matters, it certainly could have amended the PHRA to do so,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> Instead, the General Assembly has not passed any legislation usurping the power of political subdivisions to enact and enforce anti-discrimination provisions beyond those set forth in the PHRA.</p>

Contrary to Justice Wecht’s concerns about SEPTA’s ability to provide transportation services if it is compelled to submit on occasion <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>to the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Commission, no serious conflict exists. The FPO provides that actions are instituted by the filing of a complaint, to which the respondent files a written answer. Phila. Code § 9-1112-13. When a complaint is filed against SEPTA that includes claims for money damages or mandatory injunctive relief, SEPTA may assert its sovereign immunity in its answer—at which time all such claims must be immediately dismissed. For claims that do not seek money damages or mandatory injunctive relief, however, SEPTA’S sovereign immunity provides no protection. With respect to these claims, the FPO provides that the Philadelphia Commission may perform an investigation, hold hearings, conduct mediations or conciliations, and order non-monetary relief, including the issuance of cease and desist orders to prohibit SEPTA from engaging in conduct that is unlawful under the FPO. Phila. Code §§ 9-1105-1118. In this regard, SEPTA is obliged to participate in these processes, including attendance at mediations and conciliations in furtherance of the relief sought, and compliance with investigative subpoenas issued by the Philadelphia Commission. Phila. Code §§ 9-1113-1116. Sovereign immunity provides no bar against SEPTA’s involvement in these FPO proceedings, including no shield against cease and desist orders, administrative investigations, or medi-ations and conciliations. SEPTA likewise has no sovereign immunity protection against the costs and expenses of participation in such litigation, including its attorneys’ fees and costs associated therewith.</p>

The only-consequence of subjecting SEPTA to the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Commission is that it places SEPTA and the Philadelphia Commission on equal footing in lawsuits seeking available relief. SEPTA has the right to due process in proceedings before the Philadelphia Commission, including the <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>right to present a defense to all allegations of wrongdoing. SEPTA also has the right to seek judicial review from orders of the Philadelphia Commission to any court of competent jurisdiction within thirty days of their entry. Phila. Code §§ 9-1105-1119.</p>
    <p id="b78-4" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[266,613,1154,1655]]]'>Moreover, subjecting SEPTA to the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Commission does not interfere with its core transportation mission. SEPTA’s core mission is not merely to provide public transportation. As explained hereinabove, while the General Assembly granted SEPTA sovereign immunity, it also waived that grant of immunity with respect to compliance with the anti-discrimination provisions of the PHRA. <em>See </em>supra at 82-33, 159 A.3d at 462. Accordingly, legislative intent reflects that SEPTA’s core mission is to provide public transportation without engaging in discriminatory conduct. Requiring SEPTA to comply with the FPO is thus entirely consistent with its core mission. In this regard, I cannot agree with the Concurrence’s contention that it was the General Assembly’s intent to preclude SEPTA from any participation in litigation of the type envisioned by the FPO. Such a contention amounts to an assertion that the General Assembly intended to require SEPTA to comply with some anti-discrimination laws (i.e., those in the PHRA relating to discrimination based upon, inter alia, race, color, religious creed, ancestry, age or sex, 43 P.S. § 956(a)), but to be free from any obligation to comply with other anti-discrimination laws (i.e., those in the FPO relating to discrimination based upon, inter alia, gender identity or sexual orientation, Phila. Code § 9-1103(1)). No language in any of the relevant legislation suggests any intent by the General Assembly to permit SEPTA either to engage in the types of discrimination specified in the FPO or to avoid litigation in connection therewith. SEPTA has offered no basis on which to conclude that while it can fulfill its core public transportation mission in compliance with the PHRA (and incurring associated litigation costs), it would be unable to do so if required to comply with the incremental additional anti-discrimination provisions of the FPO.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a>

      <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>On the other hand, serious consequences result from holding that SEPTA is exempt from the FPO, as the interests of entire classes of individuals otherwise protected by the FPO will have no protection from various forms of discrimination by Philadelphia’s largest transportation provider. The Concurrence’s position that this consequence is substantially mitigated because Philadelphia can carry out the purpose of the FPO by “enforcing it against other individuals and entities,” Concurring Op. (Wecht, J.) at 29, 159 A.3d at 460, misses the mark. The aim of the FPO is not to protect some, but rather all, Philadelphians from the types of discrimination identified in the ordinance. Exempting SEPTA from the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Commission and compliance with the FPO will interfere with the accomplishment of this purpose.</p>
