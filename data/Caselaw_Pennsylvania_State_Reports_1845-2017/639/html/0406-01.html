On July 29, 2013, the City submitted a brief to the panel on this topic. Meanwhile, on July 23, 2013, the Pittsburgh City Council passed a resolution to place a referendum on the upcoming general election ballot asking the voters whether the City’s home rule charter should be amended to require all City employees and officials, including police and fire personnel, to maintain their domicile within the City.

      <em>Township of Moon v.

Because the Act 195 amendments placed residency within the City’s control, an interest arbitration award could modify the residency requirement.</p>
    <p id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[199,795,1157,1424]]]'>The trial court also rejected the City’s argument that the interest arbitration award was unconstitutional because it required the City to act in a manner contrary to the amended home rule charter. Judge Colville noted that a home rule charter “cannot supersede Act 111, a statewide statute.” Trial Ct. Op., 7/9/14, at 10. In support of this conclusion, the court relied on Section 2962(c) of the Home Rule Charter Law, which provides that a municipality is precluded from exercising “powers contrary to, or in limitation or enlargement of, powers granted by statutes which are applicable in every part of this Commonwealth.” 53 Pa.C.S. § 2962(c)(2). The trial court noted that “Act 111 is a statute applicable to all municipalities throughout the Commonwealth.” Trial Ct. Op., at 11. The trial court further noted that Section 2962(c)(5) of the Home Rule Charter Law prohibits a home rule municipality from enacting “any provision inconsistent -with any statute heretofore enacted prior to April 13, 1972 affecting the rights, benefits or working conditions of any employee of a political subdivision of this Commonwealth.” 53 Pa.C.S. § 2962(c)(5). Because the General Assembly enacted Act 111 in 1968, and it affects the rights, benefits and working conditions of municipal employees by allowing them to bargain or arbitrate to set the terms of their employment, the trial court concluded that the home rule charter cannot restrict the scope of collective bargaining issues under Act 111, including residency. Accordingly, the trial court affirmed the supplemental interest arbitration award.</p>

Cmwlth. 2016). After observing that a home rule charter is the equivalent of a constitution, the court relied on <em>Spencer v.

The court concluded that no statewide law prohibits the home rule charter from requiring the City’s employees to live within its borders. It explained that although Act 111 allows an arbitrator to impose any non-managerial conditions and conditions of employment, unless removed from discussion or award by other laws, “an arbitration panel can only award that which the public employer, in this case, the City, its Mayor and its Council, have the power to agree to and nothing more.” <em><a href="/a3d/129/1285-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="129 A.3d 1285" data-case-ids="6770260" data-case-paths="/a3d/129/1285-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a3d/129/1285-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="129 A.3d 1285" data-case-ids="6770260" data-case-paths="/a3d/129/1285-01">at 1290</a>.

Section 2962 of the Home Rule Charter Law contains three explicit preemption clauses, <em>see supra </em>at 415-16, 161 A.3d at 165-66. Section 2962(e) prohibits home rule charter municipalities from taking any action that changes or modifies a uniform statute of statewide application. Section 9 of Act 111 makes clear that it is “applicable to every political subdivision of this Commonwealth.” 43 P.S. § 217.9. Furthermore, Section 2962(e) explicitly provides that “[statutes shall supersede any municipal ordinance or resolution on the same subject.” 53 P.S. § 2962(e). By including the word “supersede,” the General Assembly emphasizes that statutes of statewide application predominate over enactments of home rule municipalities.</p>
