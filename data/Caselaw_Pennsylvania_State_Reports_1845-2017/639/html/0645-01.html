Rather, the challenged statutory provision delegates preliminary determinations of claimant impairment ratings to board-certified physicians licensed in the Commonwealth who are active in clinical practice. The statute directs these physicians to utilize the most recent edition of the AMA Guides in connection with their initial impairment determination. There is no constitutional infirmity in this approach as it merely evinces the General Assembly’s policy determination to adopt the most up-to-date medical advances as the methodology to be utilized by physicians when evaluating whether to classify a claimant as totally or partially disabled. Stated differently, requiring the use of the most recent AMA Guides is not delegating the authority to make law; it is simply declaring the applicable standard by which physicians should conduct impairment rating evaluations. Accordingly, I would uphold the constitutionality of Section 306(a.2) and reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court, which held to the contrary.</p>
