For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Board abuses its discretion in failing to consider whether to grant CPVs credit for time spent at liberty on parole under the plain language of Subsection 6138(a)(2.1) of the Parole Code, 61 Pa.C.S. § 6138(a)(2.1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Additionally, in order to effectuate the intent of the General Assembly in enacting Subsection 6138(a)(2.1), we further hold that the Board must provide a contemporaneous statement explaining its rationale for denying a CPV credit for time spent at liberty on parole.

He ultimately pled guilty to PWID and was sentenced to one to three years of imprisonment.

The Board accepted Appellant’s admission and recommitted him in accord with his original 2011 sentence. The Board’s hearing report form, which details the circumstances surrounding an inmate’s parole revocation, includes the following line: “BOARD ONLY—Credit time spent at liberty on parole: [ ] No [ ] Yes (excluded offenses on pg. 8).” C.R.B., Tab 7, at 36. The Board checked “No” on Appellant’s report form, thus denying him credit for time spent at liberty on parole. Consequently, the Board directed that Appellant serve the entire balance re<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>maining on his original sentence and recalculated his maximum sentence date as October 21, 2015.

This conclusion, however, conflicts with Subsection 6138(a)(2.1), which states “[t]he [B]oard may, in its discretion, award credit to a [CPV].” 61 Pa.C.S. § 6138(a)(2.1)(supra, pg. 42 n.1, 159 A.3d at 468 n.1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

First, the Board must decide whether to recommit a parole violator. Next, if recommitment is so ordered, then the parolee shall be recommitted to serve the remainder of his original term, but the Board may, in its discretion, award the parolee credit for time spent at liberty on parole. The Commonwealth Court further observed that, under unrelated sections of the Parole Code, namely Section 6137 (relating to the Board’s power to parole <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>and reparole), the General Assembly set forth criteria to guide the Board in exercising its discretion. <em>See, e.g., </em>61 Pa.C.S. § 6137(h)(1) (setting forth, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Board must consider the benefit to the inmate and the interests of the Commonwealth when deciding whether to recommit a paroled inmate).</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth Court concluded that, under the plain language of Subsection 6138(a)(2.1), there are no statutory standards by which an appellate court can evaluate the Board’s decision to grant or deny credit for time spent at liberty on parole. <em>Pittman, </em><a href="/a3d/131/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="131 A.3d 604" data-case-ids="6827000" data-case-paths="/a3d/131/0604-01">131 A.3d at </a>611 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.5",87,[184,1315,1158,933]]]'>The Commonwealth Court further determined that Appellant’s reliance on its decision in <em>Gillespie </em>is misplaced. In <em>Gillespie, </em>after the Department of Transportation requested a continuance in a license suspension appeal, the trial court denied the continuance based on its established policy of continuing cases only when both parties agree to do so. <a href="/a2d/886/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="886 A.2d 317" data-case-ids="8894671" data-case-paths="/a2d/886/0317-01">886 A.2d at 318-19</a>.

Conversely, in this case, the Commonwealth Court concluded that the Board did not shirk its responsibility in deciding whether to grant Appellant credit by adopting a blanket policy for CPVs. Rather, according to the Commonwealth Court, the Board affirmatively chose to deny Appellant credit after considering the record before it. Accordingly, the court held that, by checking “No” on Appellant’s hearing report form, the Board properly exercised its broad discretion under Subsection 6138(a)(2.1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Again contrasting Subsection 6138(a)(2.1) with portions of Section 6137 (relating to the Board’s power to parole and reparole), which expressly require that the Board provide a contemporaneous written statement explaining its rationale for its parole decisions, the Commonwealth Court determined that the General Assembly did not intend to require the Board to issue a statement of reasons as it relates to the Board’s decision to grant or deny credit for time spent at liberty on parole. <em>Pittman, </em><a href="/a3d/131/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="131 A.3d 604" data-case-ids="6827000" data-case-paths="/a3d/131/0604-01">131 A.3d at </a>613-14 (citing, <em>inter alia, Fonner v.

In the dissent’s view, Subsection 6138(a)(2.1) requires the Board to give a reason as to how it exercised its discretion to grant or deny a parolee credit against his original sentence for time spent at liberty on parole. The dissent compared the failure of the Board to provide such an explanation to a sentencing court’s obligation to consider the factors set forth in Subsection 9721(b) of the Sentencing Code. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9721(b) (setting forth general principles that sentencing courts must consider when choosing among the available sentencing options); <em>see also Commonwealth v.

In this case, Appellant was not recommitted for reasons enumerated in Subsections 6138(a)(2.1)(i) and (ii). Thus, contrary to the Board’s proffered rationale during the administrative review phase that CPVs automatically forfeit credit, the Board unquestionably had the discretion to grant Appellant credit if it so desired.

Having concluded that the Board erred in finding that Appellant forfeited his right to credit as a CPV, we turn to whether Subsection 6138(a)(2.1) requires the Board to articulate a basis for its decision, an issue for which there was sharp disagreement in the Commonwealth Court. Initially, we recognize that the Board has the broadest of discretion over many decisions regarding parolees and that the Board’s description of the statute is accurate in so far as there is no explicit requirement that the Board must provide a contemporaneous statement explaining its decision in Subsection 6138(a)(2,l). However, Article V, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution grants all persons the right to appeal from an administrative agency to a court of record. Pa. Const. Art. 5, § 9 (“... there shall also be a right of appeal from a court of record or from an administrative agency to a court of record or to an appellate court, the selection of such court to be as provided by law[,]”). This is consistent with inherent notions of due process. To the extent Appellant has a right to appeal, an appellate court hearing the matter must have method to assess the Board’s exercise of discretion. Accordingly, we hold that the Board must articulate the basis for its decision to grant or deny a CPV credit for time served at liberty on parole.</p>

Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, </em><a href="/a3d/131/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="131 A.3d 604" data-case-ids="6827000" data-case-paths="/a3d/131/0604-01">131 A.3d 604</a>, 616 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016). The Commonwealth Court majority essentially disregarded the Board’s response to Appellant’s petition for administrative review, where the Board admitted to exercising no discretion by following a misguided belief that Appellant was automatically precluded from receiving any credit for the time he spent on parole. Therefore, I agree with the Majority that the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding the Board did not abuse its discretion by determining Appellant automatically forfeited credit for time served on parole. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the Majority Opinion, I agree that the Commonwealth Court’s order must be vacated, the Board’s decision vacated, and the matter should be remanded for the Board to exercise its discretion and determine whether Appellant should be granted credit for the time he spent on parole.</p>

Hence, I dissent. On appeal, the Board maintains its position that under the plain language of Subsection 6138(a)(2.1) it is not required to provide a written statement of its reasons for denying credit. Further, the Commonwealth Court in its opinion reached this same conclusion by looking to the statutory language of Subsection 6138(a)(2.1). Finally, the Majority concedes “the Board’s description of the statute is accurate in so far as there is no explicit requirement that the Board must provide a contemporaneous statement explaining its decision in Subsection 6138(a)(2.1).” Maj. Op. at 52, 159 A.3d at 474. Therefore, there is a consensus that the statutory language of Subsection <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>6138(a)(2.1) does not support requiring the Board to issue a written statement.</p>
    <p id="b97-4" data-blocks='[["BL_97.4",97,[192,467,1158,518]]]'>Nevertheless, the Majority now requires, based on the necessity of creating a reviewable record for the Commonwealth Court following a denial of a prisoner’s administrative appeal that a written statement be issued contemporaneously with the Board’s initial decision. Because a mechanism for explaining and reviewing the Board’s exercise of discretion already exists via the Board’s response to an appellant’s petition for administrative review, I cannot agree with the addition of a requirement unsupported by the statutory language of Subsection 6138(a)(2.1).</p>

Further, the Board certainly has the opportunity to indicate at the time it determines whether to award credit, the basis for exercising its discretion to deny credit. Nevertheless, imposing a requirement that the Board must now articulate a written reason in all cases is an extreme remedy, and outside the plain language of the statute.</p>
