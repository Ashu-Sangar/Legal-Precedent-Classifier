    <p id="b515-4" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[193,741,1156,901]]]'>First, he argued that both controlled-substance charges relating to dates after July 2, <em>2013—ie., </em>the third delivery count and the possession count—should be dismissed because PB-22 is not a controlled substance under the revised Schedule I.

In this regard, Appellee proffered that the statutory phrase, “within the specific chemical designation,” <em><a href="/a2d/728/0943-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="728 A.2d 943" data-case-ids="11626823,607149" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0943-01,/pa/556/0409-01">id.,</a> </em>should be understood to mean that the purported analogue must fall into the same structural classification. <em>See </em>Omnibus Pretrial Motion at 2-3.

First, he argued that the Commonwealth failed to offer any evidence that PB-22 has a chemical structure which is substantially similar to that of JWH-018, and that the Commonwealth’s own evidence, including Dr. Coyer’s lab reports, indicated that the physiological <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>and toxicological properties of PB-22 are unknown—thus negating any claim that its effects are substantially similar to those of JWH-018. <em>See </em>Omnibus Pretrial Motion at 5. Alternatively, Appellee argued that the term “substantially similar” was void for vagueness as applied to the two compounds in question. <em>See <a href="/a2d/728/0943-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="728 A.2d 943" data-case-ids="11626823,607149" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0943-01,/pa/556/0409-01">id.</a></em>

    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[264,704,1154,735]]]'>Finally, Appellee argued that, in the relevant scientific field, there is no consensus as to the definition of an “analogue” of a chemical compound, nor is there a generally-accepted methodology for determining whether one molecule is an analogue of another. As applied to this case, Appellee reasoned that, if scientists cannot agree on whether PB-22 is an analogue of JWH-018, the average citizen could not be on notice of such a relationship between the two chemicals and, therefore, that PB-22 is an illegal drug. That being the case, Appellee continued, it would offend due process, under the void-for-vagueness doctrine, for the Commonwealth to prosecute him under subsection 780-113(a)(30) for delivering PB-22 as an alleged controlled substance in the pre-July 2, 2013, timeframe. <em>See id. </em>at 3-4.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

      <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>To summarize, then, Appellee made three essential contentions: (1) that Section 780-104(l)(vii) was vague as applied to PB-22 before July 2, 2013; (2) that PB-22 was not a prohibited substance under Section 780—104(l)(vii) after July 2, 2013; and (3) that the designer-drug provision, Section 780-113(a)(36), could not validly be applied to PB-22. Because subsection (a)(36) predicates culpability in the disjunctive on a substantially similar effect <em>or </em>chemical structure, this latter argument had two subparts: (a) since PB-22’s effects were unknown, they could not possibly be proved to be substantially similar to those of JWH-018; and (b) either the Commonwealth did not satisfy its burden to demonstrate that PB-22 and JWH-018 shared a substantially similar chemical structure, or the term “substantially similar” was vague as applied to the structures of those two chemicals.</p>

Dr. Coyer opined, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that PB-22 is an analogue of JWH-018. <em>See </em>N.T., Nov. 7, 2014, at 35. He conceded, however, that there was no definition of “analogue” in the relevant scientific field, but that he considered the term to mean a compound which “has a similar structure but may possess different properties.” <em>Id. </em>at 36. In terms of methodology, Dr. Coyer indicated that he used a four-part process to arrive at this type of expert opinion: he visually compared two-dimensional diagrams of the molecules in question; he compared their potency or function; he reviewed his colleagues’ unpublished reports, anecdotal evidence, and peer-reviewed articles, if any; and he drew upon his experience conducting chemical analyses in his capacity as a forensic toxicologist. <em>See id. </em>at 40-42. However, Dr. Coyer was unable to identify any peer-reviewed articles suggesting that his methodology was a generally-accepted means for determining whether one compound is an analogue of another. <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>Finally, he clarified that his method did not employ a comparison of three-dimensional molecular illustrations. <em>See id. </em>at 51.</p>
    <p id="b518-4" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[268,472,1155,1425]]]'>Appellee's first expert witness was John W. Huffman, PhD, an organic chemist and professor emeritus at Clemson University who had been active in the cannabinoid field for decades. Dr. Huffman, for whom JWH-018 is named, created the compound when conducting federally-funded research into how such chemicals interact with the body’s cannabinoid receptors. He agreed with Dr. Coyer that there was no scientific definition of “analogue” and that PB-22 and JWH-018 were in different structural classes. <em>See id. </em>at 61, 81-82. Therefore, Dr. Huffman opined that the two compounds were not analogues and did not have similar structures. <em>See id. </em>at 90-91. Referring to a peer-reviewed scientific paper, Dr. Huffman also noted, consistent with Dr. Coyer’s lab reports, that scientists had no knowledge of PB-22’s pharmacological or toxicological effects, or of whether the two chemicals have similar effects. That being the case, he continued, there was no agreement in the scientific community on whether PB-22 could properly be classified as a synthetic cannabinoid, see <em>id. </em>at 83-84, notwithstanding that one team of chemists had labeled it as such “a few years ago.” <em>Id. </em>at 84. Dr. Huffman stated that he had never heard of anyone else using Dr. Coyer’s four-part technique for discerning whether one molecule is an analogue of another. He testified that such methodology was not generally accepted in the scientific field, particularly as three-dimensional modeling, not two-dimensional diagraming, was the accepted standard for comparative analysis of molecular structures. <em>See id. </em>at 76-77, 81-82.</p>

Dr. Harris explained that the mission of ACECSA—which also includes members of law enforcement agencies—is to develop methods for forensic chemists to use in discerning whether one chemical is an analogue of another. She testified that ACECSA had not yet developed <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>such a methodology. <em>See id. </em>at 96. Dr. Harris also discussed an entity funded by the federal Drug Enforcement Agency called the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs (“SWGDRUG”), which publishes recommendations for chemists involved in testing controlled substances. She noted SWGDRUG includes an analogue subcommittee which had as yet been unable to devise a methodology for determining whether a particular chemical is an analogue of a controlled substance. <em>See id. </em>at 97-98. Dr. Harris additionally related that she had recently reviewed the scientific literature. Based on that review, she opined that Dr. Coyer’s comparison methodology was not generally accepted in the scientific field. She added that she had been unable to locate any generally-accepted methodology. As well, Dr. Harris testified that there is also no commonly-accepted scientific definition of the phrase “substantially similar,” which she viewed to be a subjective term. Ultimately, she rendered her own professional opinion, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that PB-22 and JWH-018 are not substantially similar. <em>See id. </em>at 102.</p>

Dr. Michael Coyer, Ph.D, a forensic toxicologist, testifying as an expert for the Commonwealth, opined, using his methodology of, inter alia, visually comparing two-dimensional diagrams of the molecules, that the components of PB-22 and JWH-018 are “very similar.” N.T., 11/7/2014, at 25, 36. John Hoffman, Ph.D, testifying for Herman, opined that PB-22 and JWH-018 are not even in the same structural class, do not have “similar structures,” and that three-dimensional modeling, rather than two-dimensional modeling, is the appropriate standard for comparing molecular structures. <em>Id. </em>at 81-82, 91. Heather Harris, Ph.D, a forensic analytical chemist, also testifying on behalf of Herman, agreed with Hoffman that the chemical structures PB-22 and JWH-018 are “not structurally similar as a whole,” and that three-dimensional modeling, rather than the two-dimensional modeling used by Coyer, is a better indicator of similarity. <em>Id. </em>at 99,100.</p>

More fundamentally, they could not even agree on a methodology accepted in the relevant scientific community for analyzing chemical compounds to determine whether they are substantially similar to each other. Accordingly, based on the same reasoning relied upon by the Majority with respect to whether these compounds are analogues—that if scientists cannot agree on what constitutes substantial similarity, then the average citizen cannot be on notice that PB-22 is an illegal drug—we must likewise find that the definition of “designer drug” is constitutionally vague.</p>

First, to conclude that such diagrams fairly apprise an ordinary citizen of the prohibited status of a chemical, one must assume that an ordinary citizen is able to locate, interpret, and understand these diagrams. Surely, the typical packet of “Winter Haze” or “V-8 Air Freshener” is not labeled with an illustration of the chemical structure of PB-22 alongside potentially “similar” controlled substances. Nor are such prod<a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>ucts sold with a chemistry textbook that may aid a consumer in recognizing the nature of the various atoms, bonds, or functional groups that, together, give the substance its identity. Second, even if the ordinary citizen is presented with these diagrams, and can understand what they represent, there remains no principled standard by which to compare them and to ascertain their substantial similarity. Anyone can observe superficial similarities between two chemical diagrams. Indeed, the above diagrams of PB-22 and JWH-018 contain comparable lines, symbols, and polygonal shapes that make them appear similar at first glance. But does the additional “0” in the diagram of PB-22 make a difference? Does the extra “N” substantially change its structure? Is it significant that the two hexagonal shapes at the end seem to attach to the remainder of the structure in a different place? Absent any accepted metric for comparison, we cannot assume that a citizen’s determination that these substances are “substantially similar” is based upon a reasoned analysis of “chemical structure,” rather than any number of inapt considerations, such as the total number of atoms in the structure, the prevalence of straight lines compared to angled lines, or each diagram’s degree of resemblance to some other object.</p>

What remains is an overly broad description that lacks clear parameters by which an individual may gauge whether conduct is lawful, and whereby an individual may be guilty of a crime based upon a subjective determination for which there is no ascertainably right or wrong answer. Consequently, the definition of a designer drug is written in “terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application,” which “violates the first essential of due process of law.” <em>Lanzetta v.

Yet it is evident that, unless the Court has been fooling itself in these cases, the “scienter” meant must be some other kind of scienter than that traditionally known to the common law—the knowing performance of an act with intent to bring about that thing, whatever it is, which the statute proscribes, knowledge of the fact that it is so proscribed being immaterial. Such scienter would clarify nothing; a clarificatory “scienter” must envisage not only a knowing what is done but a knowing that what is done is unlawful or, at least, so “wrong” that it is probably unlawful. One difficulty here is that it is uncertain whether the courts which subsequently enforce the statutes which the Court sustains will employ the same brand of “scienter” as the Court; if not, and if “scienter” was essential to the Court’s <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>holding, then of course the statute which is constitutional is not being administered and the statute which is being administered is not constitutional.

At most, the scienter requirement may constitute a “means of limiting prosecutorial discretion,” Maj. Op. at 494, 161 A.3d at 211-12, in that it makes the elements of the crime more difficult to prove, particularly if it necessitates that a “defendant must know that the chemical he possesses has a molecular structure substantially similar to that of a scheduled drug.” Maj. Op. at 495, 161 A.3d at 212, Nevertheless, the scienter requirement does not aid in the provision of “fair warning” to the ordinary citizen that a given substance falls within the definition. The statute must allow an individual to gauge the legality of conduct in the first place, and the words “knowing” and “intentional” do not provide the standards that are necessary for the definition to be made amenable to intelligible or consistent application, by either those who are subject to it or those who seek to enforce it. A <em>mens rea </em>term is not a Rosetta Stone that enables one to decipher a statute that is inherently indeterminate. The problem remains that “chemical structure substantially similar to that of a controlled substance,” 35 P.S. § 780—102(b), is an amorphous and unduly subjective standard, which lies beyond the scope of knowledge attributable to an ordinary citizen, and which cannot be ascertained reliably, even by the most qualified of experts.

To be sure, this area of criminal law is in constant flux.

Undoubtedly, the designer drug statute targets such substances, even those yet to be invented.

The Majority further cautions that "it would be misguided to invalidate substantial portions of our controlled-substance legislation on the basis that compounds subject to regulation or criminalization are described by reference to technical formulae unintelligible to the general public.” <em>Id. </em>But this misses the point. We are not here confronted with a challenge to any provision that identifies particular substances by their chemical formulae. Nor can the prospect of future challenges alter our analysis in this case. Chief Justice John Roberts famously observed that, as an "umpire” of the law, "it’s my job to call balls and strikes and not to pitch or bat.” Hearing Before the Senate Judiciary Comm, on the Nomination of The Honorable John G. Roberts, U.S.C.J., to be the Chief Justice of the United States, 109th Cong.

As umpires in our own right, we cannot call a strike as a ball simply because a strike would be the third, or because it could change the outcome of the ballgame. But let us suppose for a moment that our constitutional analysis should be influenced by a fear of the potential impact upon other statutory provisions, a point I do not concede. Even so, .the available mechanisms for objectively determining whether a given substance is a scheduled drug serve as an important point of distinction from the indeterminate definition of a designer drug. Unlike the subjective determination of whether two substances share a ‘‘substantially similar” chemical structure, for which the statute provides the authorities no guidelines, law enforcement personnel readily can determine through chemical testing whether a given substance is, for example, "N-ethyl-3-piperidyl benzilate.” <em>See </em>Maj.
