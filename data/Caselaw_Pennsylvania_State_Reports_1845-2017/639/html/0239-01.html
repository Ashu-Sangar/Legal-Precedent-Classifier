In 2006, Appellee purchased a 1997 Chevrolet Venture minivan to meet her transportation needs. In October 2009, Appellee suffered two blood clots in her lungs and was hospitalized through November 2009. Upon her release, Appellee was placed on bedrest and prescribed several medications. During this time, Donald Graham, Appel-lee’s son, then age 50, and two of her grandchildren, resided with her at the house.</p>

On that date, Officer Billups and his partner, Officer Kevin Williams, met with a confidential informant who subsequently was observed giving Graham, who was exiting the house, $40 in pre-recorded money in exchange for a small bag of marijuana. Four days later, on November 14, 2009, the officers, with the confidential informant, observed Graham arrive at the house in a grey Chevrolet vehicle, later determined to be Appellee’s minivan. After exiting the vehicle, Graham gave the informant another small <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>bag of marijuana in exchange for $40. A similar transaction occurred two days later on November 16, 2009.</p>

During the course of their search of the premises, the officers confiscated a letter addressed to Graham, a scale, numerous new and used plastic packets, and six baggies of marijuana. While Graham was not present at the house when the search was executed, Appellee was present. The officers explained to Appellee, who was provided with a copy of the search warrant, that her son had sold drugs from the house and used a vehicle in connection with the sales on several occasions. The officers did not, however, arrest Graham on that date, and he was not charged with a crime based upon these sales.</p>

The informant met with Graham at the door of the house, where the informant provided Graham an unknown amount of currency. Graham momentarily re-entered the house, and then handed the informant certain small objects, which later tested positive for marijuana. Approximately one month later, on January 5, 2010, a similar transaction occurred: after an informant met with Officers McClain and Coaxum, he went to the house, Graham exited the side door of the residence, and both men entered Appel-lee’s vehicle. Thereafter, the informant exited the van with a small item which contained a green weed substance. The next day, Officer London returned to the house with Officer Coa-xum and observed a similar transaction take place. Specifically, an informant knocked on the door of the house, Graham answered, and allowed the informant to come into the house. Graham exited the house, went to Appellee’s van, remained in the vehicle for several minutes, then exited and returned to the house. Shortly thereafter, the informant left the house and provided the officers with a baggie containing small objects which testing later identified as marijuana.</p>

Immediately thereafter, at 4:45 p.m., Officer Robinson approached Graham and arrested him. Officer Robinson recovered a sandwich bag containing 4.6 grams of marijuana, one cellular telephone, $176.00 in unmarked currency, and $60.00 in pre-recorded currency. The police also took from Graham the keys to Appellee’s van. The officers then executed a search warrant on the house and recovered 1.3 grams of marijuana from the living room and 8.5 grams from the van. Graham pled guilty to possession of marijuana and possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, and was sentenced to 11 to 23 months house arrest. 35 P.S. §§ 780-113(a)(16), (30).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The trial court imposed no fine on Graham.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The court found that Appellee’s house and vehicle were used to facilitate illegal drug sales, as the police had observed several drug transactions inside or around Appellee’s house and van, and Appellee’s son Graham <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>was selling illegal drugs on a regular basis, and, thus, forfeiture of the property was proper.</p>

Further, the trial court offered that Appel-lee did not leave or vacate the property, or restrict her son’s access to her property. Moreover, the court concluded that Appellee “either knew of or consented to her son’s illegal activities on the subject properties.... [and at best] turned a blind eye to her son’s illegal conduct on the property and allowed it to continue over a prolonged period of time.” <em>Id. </em>at 14.

In doing so, the court relied upon this Court’s case law, discussed below, and looked to the penalty imposed as compared to the maximum penalty allowed, whether the violation was part of a pattern of unlawful behavior, and the harm resulting from the crime charged. The court rejected as irrelevant that Appellee herself was not charged with or convicted of a violation of the Drug Act; it found that for the relevant offenses Graham theoretically could have been charged with, he faced maximum criminal penalties of $80,000, which, according to the trial court, exceeded the combined appraised value of Appellee’s home and vehicle. The court noted that, for several years, Graham had continually sold illegal drugs from the property, and that this activity put “not only Mr. Graham’s neighbors in harm’s way, but also the <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>officers investigating his unlawful activities and serving warrants in connection with that illegal conduct.” <em>Id. </em>The trial court deemed this relevant time period as beginning in November 2009 and continuing until April 2011.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Thus, the trial court rejected Appellee’s statutory defense and constitutional challenge to its order allowing forfeiture of her house and vehicle.</p>

Generally speaking, forfeiture involves a taking of property through a forfeiture statute which provides that, when an item is possessed or used in violation of the law, private ownership of the property ceases, and the government becomes the owner of the property. Caleb Nelson <em>The Constitutionality of Civil Forfeiture, </em><a href="/citations/?q=125%20Yale%20L.J.%202446" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="125 Yale L.J. 2446">125 Yale L.J. 2446</a>, 2456 (2016) (hereinafter “Nelson”). Forfeitures fall into two broad categories: criminal <em>in personam </em>forfeitures and civil <em>in rem </em>forfeitures. Criminal <em>in personam </em>forfeitures arise from criminal proceedings in which the property owner is convicted of a crime. In contrast to the ancient concept of civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture, criminal <em>in personam </em>forfeiture is a more recent legal means by which to confiscate property, with the first federal criminal forfeiture statute being the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970. <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 1963">18 U.S.C. § 1963</a>. Conversely, civil <em>in rem </em>proceedings, which maintain a centuries-old focus on the property as the offender, do not require a criminal conviction, or even a criminal charge, as demonstrated in the case <em>sub </em>judice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Thus, criminal <em>in per-sonam </em>and civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture are a powerful means by which the state can seize private property. While, in this matter, the forfeiture concerns a civil <em>in rem </em>proceeding, the <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>distinction between the two types of forfeiture has played, and continues to play, an important role in this area.</p>
    <p id="b295-4" data-blocks='[["BL_295.4",295,[187,489,1156,956]]]'>The type of property at issue, at least to some extent, informs a forfeiture analysis. “Contraband” connotes property that is inherently illegal, the mere “possession of which, without more, constitutes a crime.” <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/citations/?q=880%20U.S.%20693" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="880 U.S. 693">880 U.S. 693</a>, 699, <a href="/us/380/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="85 S.

Ct. 1246" data-case-ids="1524671" data-case-paths="/us/380/0693-01">14 L.Ed.2d 170</a> (1965). Forfeiture of contraband is not subject to Eighth Amendment scrutiny, as removal of such illegal or dangerous property from society is deemed to be purely remedial in nature. <em>See United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em><a href="/us/465/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="465 U.S. 354" data-case-ids="11335902" data-case-paths="/us/465/0354-01">465 U.S. 354</a>, 364, <a href="/us/465/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="465 U.S. 354" data-case-ids="11335902" data-case-paths="/us/465/0354-01">104 S.Ct. 1099</a>, <a href="/us/465/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="465 U.S. 354" data-case-ids="11335902" data-case-paths="/us/465/0354-01">79 L.Ed.2d 361</a> (1984). Conversely, property that is “tainted” by unlawful use, but which is not otherwise illegal to possess, has come to be known as an “instrumentality” of the offense, and, as discussed below, has been a subject of contention as to whether such property is subject to Eighth Amendment protections. Whether property is an instrumentality is determined by evaluating the relationship of the property to the underlying criminal offense.</p>

While the “cruel and unusual punishment” clause has generated a significant amount of litigation, the United States Supreme Court has interpreted the Excessive Fines Clause only on rare occasions, and, for many years, that Clause with respect to civil <em>in rem </em>forfeitures went unexplored.</p>

The Court first noted that, unlike other provisions found in the Bill of Rights, the Eighth Amendment by its terms was not limited to criminal cases.

Instead, the Court reasoned that the fact that the maximum punishment that Bajakajian faced under the guidelines was but a fraction of the penalties authorized by the statute demonstrated his culpability relative to other potential violators of the reporting provision—such as “tax evaders, drug kingpins, or money launderers”—was small. <em><a href="/us/524/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="524 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="11182447" data-case-paths="/us/524/0321-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/524/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="524 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="11182447" data-case-paths="/us/524/0321-01">at 339, n.14</a>, <a href="/us/524/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="524 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="11182447" data-case-paths="/us/524/0321-01">118 S.Ct. 2028</a>.

Thus, the Court concluded that, when comparing the gravity of Bajakajian’s crime with the $357,144 sought by the government for forfeiture, such a forfeiture would be grossly disproportionate. Finally, the Court rejected the United States’ reliance upon early statutory enactments requiring full forfeiture of goods involved in customs offenses, as such statutes were not considered punishment for a criminal offense because they rested upon the theory of guilty property; thus, according to the Court, they revealed nothing about the proportionality of the punitive forfeiture at issue in the matter before it.</p>

Turning to consideration of what factors were appropriate under Article I, Section 13, the Court adopted Justice Scalia’s standard for determining whether a forfeiture was excessive—that the inquiry does not concern the value of the property forfeited, but, rather, the nexus between the offense and the subject property.

Additionally, the trial court was instructed to consider to what extent Graham’s pattern of misbehavior was due to the police sending its informant to Appellee’s house, rather than a distinct location.

Stated another way, the Commonwealth asserts that the Constitution permits civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture if the <em>res </em>is an instrumentality or its value is not grossly disproportional to the gravity of the underlying offense. The Commonwealth contends that our Court has applied the <em>Baja-kajian </em>standard to <em>all </em>punitive forfeitures, and made this the exclusive test in Pennsylvania, citing <em>54M Spruce Street </em>According to the Commonwealth, the Supreme Court in <em>Bajaka-jian </em>specifically rejected a requirement that the forfeited property had to be an instrumentality of the crime.

The Commonwealth goes on to argue that the Commonwealth Court improperly limited <em>Bajakajian’s </em>rejection of the property having to be an instrumentality of the underlying offense to criminal <em>in personam </em>forfeitures, and asserts that, to the contrary, the <em>Bajakajian </em>approach applies to both civil <em>in rem </em>and criminal <em>in person-am </em>forfeitures, which was made clear by our Court in <em>5444 Spruce Street. </em>Thus, the Commonwealth urges that, consistent with <em>Bajakajian, </em>our Court should reiterate that a civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture passes constitutional muster if the property is <em>either </em>an instrumentality <em>or </em>the forfeiture is not grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense.</p>

More precisely, the Commonwealth offers that justification for civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture of non-instrumentalities rests on the notion that the owner of the property is negligent. Thus, in the Commonwealth’s view, where the property owner has done all that he or she can reasonably do to prevent the criminal use of his or her property, forfeiture should be denied. This standard, according to the Commonwealth, would induce the owner to exercise greater care in allowing his or her property to be used by those who may commit a crime. Moreover, the Commonwealth offers that owner culpability is accounted for in the Forfeiture Act through the innocent owner defense, as the property is exempt from forfeiture if the owner did not know about or consent to the properties’ illegal use. 42 Pa.C.S. <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>§§ 6801(a)(6)(ii), 6802(j).

Moreover, the Commonwealth offers, as noted above, that our Court in <em>5444 Spruce Street </em>had expressed reservations about such a subjective approach, including the weighing of the effect of the forfeiture on the owner, as it had been adopted only in a minority of jurisdictions. The Commonwealth claims that such an approach is not faithful to <em>Bajakajian, </em>which, as noted above, offered that the appropriate punishment was initially for the legislature, and that any determination by the courts <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>regarding the gravity of a particular offense will be “inherently imprecise.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 33 (quoting <em>Bajakajian, </em><a href="/us/524/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="524 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="11182447" data-case-paths="/us/524/0321-01">524 U.S. at 336</a>, <a href="/us/524/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="524 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="11182447" data-case-paths="/us/524/0321-01">118 S.Ct. 2028</a>).

The Commonwealth urges that the legislature made drug sales illegal because they harmed individuals and society as a whole, and that such harm must have some weight in favor of forfeiture.

The Commonwealth submits that the proper balancing test compares the fair market value of the forfeiture to the applicable fine.

The Commonwealth submits that, even if the sales were limited to the period of December 2009 through January 2010, when the Commonwealth claims Appellee was on notice of her son’s selling of marijuana from her house, the aggregate maximum applicable fine would be $45,000 for the illegal drug sales from the house, and an additional $15,000 for each sale from the vehicle and the bulk marijuana found in the living room when the search warrant was executed. These aggregate fines were in excess of $75,000, which, according to the Commonwealth, were substantially less than the statutory máximums for the underlying crimes, but exceeded the value of the house and van.

The Commonwealth points to a pattern of selling drugs from Appellee’s house from November 2009 through January 2010, that it was used to facilitate at least seven sales during two police investigations, and that the vehicle was used for three transactions. The Commonwealth maintains that it took multiple police investigations and two search warrants to disrupt the sale of illegal drugs from the house, which supports the conclusion that the house was the focus of the drug trade and substantially connected to the illegal activity, thus, weighing in favor of forfeiture. The Commonwealth goes on to argue that the trial court’s rejection of Appellee’s innocent owner defense gives rise to a presumption that Appellee was responsible for the manner in which the house was used, and, this, according to the Commonwealth, is buttressed by Appellee’s failure to provide any evidence that she tried to stop the sale of drugs from her house. Moreover, the Commonwealth contends that <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>the trial court found sufficient evidence of substantial harm caused by the underlying crimes, including neighbors and police being placed in harm’s way, and the intransigent nature of the sale of drugs from the house requiring a need for repeated police surveillance.

First, Appellee argues that civil <em>in rem </em>forfeitures, as discussed above, were historically limited to instrumentalities of the underlying offense, stemming from the idea that the property itself was guilty of the crime, and that this notion persists in the United States Supreme Court’s jurisprudence, as the <em>Bajakajian </em>Court noted civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceedings subjected the property to forfeiture because it was the actual means by which the offense was committed. <em>Bajakajian, </em><a href="/us/524/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="524 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="11182447" data-case-paths="/us/524/0321-01">524 U.S. at </a>333 n.8, <a href="/us/524/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="524 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="11182447" data-case-paths="/us/524/0321-01">118 S.Ct. 2028</a>. Appellee stresses that the instrumentality requirement serves to maintain the distinction between civil <em>in rem </em>and criminal <em>in personam </em>forfeitures, noting that criminal <em>in personam </em>forfeitures carry with them substantial constitutional protections for a criminal defendant which a civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture property owner does not enjoy. Appellee points to Justice Scalia’s concurrence in <em>Austin, </em>which urged that excessiveness for civil <em>in rem </em>forfeitures depended only upon the relationship between the property and the underlying crime, and the fact that the <em>Austin </em>majority specifically left open the issue of an instrumentality requirement. Appellee also maintains that the Commonwealth Court was correct when it opined that <em>Bajakajian </em>did not rule out an instrumentality requirement for civil <em>in rem </em>procedures, but, rather, only clarified that it was not a consideration in criminal <em>in personam </em>forfeitures.</p>

According to Appellee, our Court in <em>5444 Spruce Street </em>did not place any such limitations on what a trial court may consider, instead allowing for further “sharpening and annealing” of relevant factors in the lower courts. <a href="/pa/574/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="832 A.2d 396" data-case-ids="587998,9086610" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0423-01,/a2d/832/0396-01">832 A.2d at </a>402 n.7.

Appel-lee stresses that the degree of culpability of the property owner must be considered, rejecting the Commonwealth’s focus on a comparison of the objective value of the property against the maximum statutory fine applicable to the criminal activity that the property facilitated.</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[196,1163,1157,1061]]]'>Furthermore, Appellee challenges the Commonwealth’s contention that a property owner is culpable when merely negligent and that this mandate is satisfied by a trial court’s rejection of the statutory innocent owner defense. Specifically, Appellee offers that, historically, courts did not consider whether the property owner was negligent when another person used his or her property for criminal activity, but, rather, the criminal use of the property led <em>ipso facto </em>to the conclusion that the property owner was negligent. According to Appellee, this legal justification for forfeiture of one’s property, however, is not synonymous with holding a property owner culpable for purposes of the Eighth Amendment whenever property is used in a crime. Moreover, Appellee claims that, an Eighth Amendment analysis is independent from any statutory defense and that a forfeiture that survives an asserted statutory innocent owner defense may nevertheless violate the Constitution. In making this point, Appellee draws the distinction between the legislature’s intention to protect innocent property owners and the constitutional protection of an individual against excessive punishment.</p>

Rather, Appellee claims the excessiveness inquiry requires a subjective proportionality analysis specific to the crime committed and the property’s role therein.

In doing so, a court must consider the essence of the crime—that is, the nature of the underlying offense. Related thereto, the relation of the offense to any other illegal activity and whether the offender fit into the class of persons for whom the offense was designed should be considered. Further, the court should take into account the maximum penalty as compared to the penalty imposed upon the criminal offender. In making this assessment, the actual penalty imposed (sentence, fine) upon the offender giving rise to the forfeiture is compared to the maximum authorized sentence for the underlying offenses for which the offender was convicted. Moreover, the regularity of the criminal conduct must be considered, including whether the illegal acts were isolated or frequent, constituting a pattern of misbehavior. Finally, a court must take into account the harm resulting from the crime charged. Contrary to the Commonwealth’s argument, we find generic considerations of harm to be largely unhelpful in this regard, as all crimes have a negative impact in some general way to society.</p>

Forfeiture thus serves as an incentive to responsibly manage one’s property.

By contrast, neither the commencement of criminal proceedings nor a conviction is required for a civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture.

While a forfeiture may be especially troubling for a completely innocent property owner, contrary to the Commonwealth’s assertions, the degree of culpability is significant even if the trial court determines that the property owner did not satisfy a statutory innocent owner defense. Constitutional protections are independent from statutory safeguards. Indeed, the legislature’s desire to protect an innocent property owner is not necessarily co-extensive with the constitution’s protection against excessive sanctions. As a constitutional matter, we find that assessing the gravity of the offense includes a determination of the degree of knowledge of a property owner. Even a property owner, while not wholly without knowledge or granting consent, may lack full knowledge of criminal activity, or may bear only nominal or token blame for the illegal conduct serving as the foundation for the forfeiture.</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth Court remanded the matter to the trial court for consideration of these circumstances. In particular, the Commonwealth Court focused upon Appellee’s contention that she did not have knowledge of or give her consent to the criminal activity which served as the basis for the government’s forfeiture of her house and vehicle. Specifically, the Commonwealth Court found that, because the police officers informed Appellee that her son was selling marijuana from her house and provided her with a search warrant, she acquired knowledge of the illegal activities. However, the court first reasoned that Appel-lee was not required to believe the police allegations regarding her son when they executed their search warrant at Appellee’s house, and that the trial court made no reference to specific allegations contained in the search warrant. Ultimately, the Commonwealth Court concluded that the trial court failed to consider all of the circumstances surrounding Appellee’s actions, or lack of action, in determining knowledge and consent to the underlying criminal activity, and whether Appellee’s <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>actions were reasonable. Elaborating, the Commonwealth Court determined that it was not necessarily reasonable, as proffered by the Commonwealth, for a parent to evict a child, even an adult child, in order to show a lack of consent to the child’s illegal activities. Related thereto, the court rejected the Commonwealth’s assertion that Appellee should have invited the police to her residence, as a property owner does not have to become a <em>de facto </em>police officer to establish a lack of consent. Thus, finding it not enough for a court to dismiss an innocent owner defense by simply disbelieving the property owner, the Commonwealth Court instructed the trial court, on remand, to identify the circumstances justifying a reasonable inference that the property owner had actual knowledge of and consented to the criminal activities underlying the forfeiture.</p>

Here, the Commonwealth offers that Appellee claimed that she did not know about the sale of drugs, but the court disbelieved that assertion based upon the warnings offered by police. According to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Court, in rejecting the trial court’s ability to simply find Appellee’s testimony to be incredible as a basis to dismiss Appellee’s innocent owner defense, improperly reversed the burden of proof by placing the burden on the Commonwealth to establish by affirmative evidence the lack of an innocent owner defense. Rather, the Commonwealth submits that the burden to establish an innocent owner defense is on the property owner, that incredible testimony does not establish an affirmative defense, and that the trial court was within its authority to make a negative credibility finding to reject that defense.</p>

As the trial court’s ruling was consistent with the record evidence, and testimony was presented that police informed Appellee that her son was selling illegal drugs from the premises, the Commonwealth contends Appellee was required to establish that she expressed a lack of consent to selling the drugs, and that she failed to do so. Further, the Commonwealth accuses the lower court of creating a <em>per se </em>rule that a parent is never required to evict a drug dealing child, and submits that Appellee’s innocent owner defense failed because she knew of the drug dealing and yet failed to take any action to stop it. While in some circumstances eviction could be an appropriate expectation, the Commonwealth offers that it was unreasonable for Appellee to do nothing, and the Forfeiture Act requires a property owner <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>who knows of drug dealing to do all he or she reasonably can under the circumstances.

Yet, according to Appellee, the trial court failed to consider whether either option was reasonable, ignored her testimony that she feared inviting the police back into her home after their November encounter, and did not address what steps she did take, including ejecting her son from her home when he was a teenager, asking the police for evidence of his drug dealings, and confronting him about the November investigation. Thus, Appellee counters that, rather than the Commonwealth Court creating a <em>per se </em>rule that a parent is never required to evict an adult child from her home, as asserted by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Court here merely followed our Court’s prior precedent that a trial court must consider all the circumstances in determining whether it was reasonable for a parent to evict a child to demonstrate non-consent to the use of his or her property for the illegal sale of drugs.</p>

Such absence of knowledge or consent must be reasonable under the circumstances.”). Thus, in its analysis, a trial court must, as relevant, speak to both the knowledge of the property owner, and his or her consent (if placed at issue by the owner, and the court finds knowledge). Knowledge does not establish consent.

However, on October 9, 2013, on appeal before the Commonwealth Court, Appellee applied for extraordinary relief on the basis that Officer Walker, whose testimony had been credited by the trial court, had been indicted on corruption charges that involved planting drugs on suspects, As Officer Walker had conducted the April 25, 2011 search of Appellee’s house, the court believed that "fairness” required a remand so that the trial court could re-examine its prior decision. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>1997 Chevrolet, </em><a href="/a3d/106/0836-01" class="citation" data-index="238" data-cite="106 A.3d 836" data-case-ids="6897717" data-case-paths="/a3d/106/0836-01">106 A.3d 836</a>, 847 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014). The Commonwealth opposed the application for extraordinary relief, claiming that the testimony of Officers Billups and London regarding Graham’s seven controlled buys was sufficient to warrant the forfeiture of Appellee's house. On February 19, 2014, the Commonwealth Court listed the appeal for an <em>en banc </em>oral argument and, thereafter, the court denied Appellee's application for extraordinary relief. Before our Court, the Commonwealth takes the position that it is not relying upon the events surrounding the third investigation involving Officer Walker, who pled guilty in federal court to crimes committed while on duty as a police officer.</p>

We recognize that, in <em>Austin, </em>the Court indicated that the property at issue was not an "instrument” of the underlying crime, but nevertheless remanded the matter for consideration of constitutional excessiveness. As emphasized by the Commonwealth, this contemplation of other factors suggests that the question of whether property subject to civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture is an instrumentality is not dispositive of the excessiveness inquiry. We disagree. First, the <em>Austin </em>Court expressed no opinion on the constitutional requisites of civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture, expressly limiting its decision to its conclusion that <em>in rem </em>forfeitures could be subject to an Excessive Fines Clause challenge. Moreover, in offering that the property at issue was not an instrumentality, it did so in rejecting the government’s argument that statutes which authorized forfeiture of "instruments” of the drug trade were "remedial,” rather than punitive, such that the Excessive Fines Clause should not apply. Thus, the Court was not relying upon the understanding of "instrumentality” as that term would develop in subsequent cases, but was deeming the property at issue—a mobile home and auto body shop—not to be "contraband,” and, thus, subject to an Eighth Amendment challenge.</p>

The Commonwealth revisits the idea of instrumentality being purely remedial, and, thus, not subject to an Eighth Amendment inquiry. In <em>Austin, </em>as noted above, while recognizing that the forfeiture of "contraband” could be characterized as remedial—as such forfeiture removed dangerous or illegal items from society, and, thus, was not subject to Eighth Amendment scrutiny—the Court rejected the assertion that conveyances used to transport illegal liquor were such contraband; accordingly, the Court found that the forfeiture of such property did not escape review under the Excessive Fines Clause. Thus, under the Supreme Court’s case law, forfeiture of both instrumentalities and non-instrumentalities may be punitive and subject to Excessive Fines Clause analysis. <em>See Bajakajian, </em><a href="/us/524/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="264" data-cite="524 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="11182447" data-case-paths="/us/524/0321-01">524 U.S. at </a>331 n.6, <a href="/us/524/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="265" data-cite="524 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="11182447" data-case-paths="/us/524/0321-01">118 S.Ct. 2028</a>. On that basis, we readily reject the Commonwealth’s assertion that a civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture is <em>ipso facto </em>constitutionally permitted where the property is an instrumentality of the criminal offense. <em>See Bajakajian; Austin; In re King Properties; see also United States v. Ferro, </em><a href="/f3d/681/1105-01" class="citation" data-index="266" data-cite="681 F.3d 1105" data-case-ids="3885791" data-case-paths="/f3d/681/1105-01">681 F.3d 1105</a>, 1113-14 (9th Cir. 2012) (finding, in light of <em>Austin, </em>modem forfeiture statutes served to punish the owner at least in part, and, thus, with the exception of the forfeiture of contraband, instrumentalities are protected by the Eighth Amendment).</p>

The Attorney General, as <em>amicus </em>in support of the Commonwealth, offers that the Commonwealth Court’s decision will result in "the impairment of the Commonwealth’s ability to prevail in any forfeiture matter where an innocent owner defense is pursued.” Attorney General’s Brief at 8-9. The Attorney General further contends that, although the burden is on the property owner to establish that he or she did not have knowledge or give consent to use the property in an illegal manner, the Commonwealth Court, required the trial court to identify circumstances that made it reasonable to infer that Appellee had actual knowledge and did not consent to the use of the property for illegal conduct. This, according to the Attorney General, impermissibly shifts the burden to the Commonwealth to demonstrate that the property owner had knowledge of illegal activity. Thus, the Attorney General avers that, contrary to legislative intent, under the Commonwealth Court’s decision, the Commonwealth must now not only establish a nexus between the illegal activity and the property at issue, but also is required to essentially disprove an innocent owner defense.</p>

In requiring such review, we are not upsetting the statutory burdens of proof found in the Forfeiture Act as asserted by the Commonwealth.
