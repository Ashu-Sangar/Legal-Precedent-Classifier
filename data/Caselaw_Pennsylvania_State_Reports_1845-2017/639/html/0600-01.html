Quigley settled five insurance claims totaling $557,705.00 and was therefore entitled to a fee of $185,901.66.

Davis blamed “careless office procedures” for his intentional misconduct. <em>Davis, </em><a href="/pa/532/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="532 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="1835920" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0022-01">614 A.2d at 1122</a>. Keller offered only evidence of a disturbed emotional state, brought on by the dissolution of his business relationship with his brother. <em>Keller, </em><a href="/pa/509/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="509 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1795237" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0573-01">506 A.2d at 877</a>. Monsour and Lucarini presented evidence of an untreated alcoholism condition. <em>Monsour, </em><a href="/a2d/701/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="701 A.2d 556" data-case-ids="11898725,18043" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0556-01,/pa/549/0482-01">701 A.2d at 558-59</a>; <em>Lucarini, </em><a href="/pa/504/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="504 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1787798" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0271-01">472 A.2d at 187</a>. Knepp contended that he was driven to his misdeeds because of “financial difficulties” and “a desire to maintain an image of solvency.” <em>Knepp, </em><a href="/pa/497/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="497 Pa. 396" data-case-ids="1775262" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0396-01">441 A.2d at 1201</a>. In addition, unlike here, these cases involved additional misconduct, such as forging clients’ signatures <em>(Keller </em>and Lucarini), counseling clients to undertake dishonest acts in court proceedings and deceitful use of an affidavit (Davis), disobeying a court order <em>(Mons-our </em>), charging excessive legal fees <em>(Knepp), </em>and failing to act diligently and lying to conceal the transgression <em>(Keller </em>and <em>Knepp).</em>

      <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>In my view, the mitigating factors present here, including Respondent’s immediate efforts to make his clients whole, his length of practice without a disciplinary history, his age (sixty), his cooperation throughout the disciplinary process, and his remorse and recognition of the seriousness and wrongfulness of his conduct, when taken together, provide a substantial counterweight to lessen the severity of his conduct so to justify a form of discipline less than disbarment. As a result, I respectfully dissent from the learned Majority’s decision to impose this sanction, and would instead suspend Respondent from the practice of law for a period of five years.</p>
