According to Appellee, however, such prescription clashes with the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct promulgated by this Court, which authorize attorneys to advance good faith arguments for <em>“extension, modification or reversal </em>of existing law.” Pa.R.P.C. § 3.1 (emphasis added).

He contrasted such subjectivity with the more objective litmus established under Rule of Professional Conduct 3.1. Pa.R.P.C. 3.1 (“A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless <em>there is a basis in law and fact </em>for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.” (emphasis added)). Appellee opined that the statute’s focus on subjective motivation “means, as a practical matter, that summary disposition is exceedingly difficult.” Defendant’s Memorandum at 12.

In this regard, Appellee explained that the Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, also promulgated by this Court, establish the procedures for addressing violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, encompassing all stages from the investigation of an allegation of inappropriate conduct to the final disposition of a complaint by this Court, as well as delineating all available forms of discipline. <em>See </em>Pa.R.D.E. 204-208. Appellee commented that: “Nowhere do the disciplinary rules permit an opposing party to seek monetary damages from an attorney.” Defendant’s Memorandum at 12.

Both of these aspects may bear closer review in future cases that are framed more narrowly. For example, there may be an argument to be made that punitive damages awards should not be available against attorney-defendants in Dragonetti cases, given that this Court has specifically provided for sanctions to deter violations. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. No. 1023.4(a)(1). And it may also be that, in an appropriate case, the Court might invoke Article V, Section 10(c)—in a fashion more restrained than according blanket immunization to lawyers from the effects of a substantive-law statute—to construe Dragonetti Act liability as unwarranted in instances in which a claim was pursued based on a good faith argument that the existing law should be changed. Potentially, the principle that statutes should be afforded a constitutional construction might come into play in such a case. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3).</p>

In terms of the arguments pertaining to the legislative decision to adjust the liability standard to subsume gross negligence, this Court’s rules are not intended as a safe harbor for attorneys who cause harm to others via such elevated heedlessness. Similarly, while the Rules of Professional Conduct may describe lawyers' ethical obligations in a more objective fashion than is reflected in the Dragonetti Act's liability threshold, the interests of justice do not favor immunizing conduct undertaken with a subjectively wrongful state of mind. Indeed, the common law liability standard of malice certainly has subjective attributes.</p>

Because the present challenge concerns a claim that attorneys have <em>generalized </em>immunity to Dragonetti Act claims—an assertion we reject—and because neither of the above more narrow issues are implicated by the facts of this case, the majority appropriately does not address them. Yet, these questions focus on aspects of the Dragonetti Act which, in my view, are most starkly in tension with our exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law under Article V, Section 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution and will deserve close review when properly before our Court.</p>

However, regardless of whether we might, in a future case, construe “developing law” to encompass claims for an “extension, modification or reversal of existing law” and, thus, preclude Drago-netti Act liability under Section 8352(1) on that basis, subsection (3) would appear to provide a safe harbor to attorneys in such situations (as well as in other situations). It specifically protects an “attorney of record” who believes “in good faith that his procurement, initiation or continuation of a civil cause is not intended to merely harass or maliciously injure the opposite party.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 8352(3). To Appellee’s concern, I <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>would be hard-pressed to envision a scenario in which an attorney who seeks, in good faith, the reversal of governing law would be liable under the Act because he or she is nonetheless found to have “intended to merely harass or maliciously injure the opposite party.”</p>

The Majority’s attempt to carve out constitutional space for the Dragonetti Act by virtue of it being substantive and remedial in nature is unavailing. These traits do nothing to mitigate the fact that it sets forth rules of conduct and discipline governing each and every attorney admitted to practice in the courts of this Commonwealth. I do not question the Legislature's authority to create substantive laws, generally, but any such laws must withstand constitutional muster. See <em>Stern, </em><a href="/a2d/701/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="701 A.2d 568" data-case-ids="11898815,17650" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0568-01,/pa/549/0505-01">701 A.2d at 572</a>. As described herein, a legislative enactment that regulates the conduct of attorneys, regardless of its substantive (as opposed to procedural) features, is unconstitutional.</p>
