In my view, the <em>sua sponte </em>scouring of trial records to identify waiver concerns—when all litigants agree that an important issue is presented that should be resolved by this Court—can be disruptive. In this regard, I have often commented on the prudential roots of the waiver doctrine, and, from my perspective, its proper application through discerning judgment.</p>

For instance, it may be that the Court would find tolling appropriate <em>only </em>if the statute runs from the date of injury, as the intermediate-court precedent holds. Tolling, in this regard, could be viewed as compensation for an underlying approach to commencement with which the Court disagrees. Were the Court to proceed on such a basis, it would issue a decision having application only within an underlying framework of the Superior Court’s design, which could later be rejected by this Court. Our decision, of course, would need to be carefully crafted with all the necessary disclaimers to avoid adoption of a regime that this Court has never previously addressed.</p>

Bristol’s Answer to Erie's Motion for Summary Judgment at 4, 9 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Notes of Testimony, 3/11/2015, at 14 (counsel for Bristol arguing that Bristol would have been required to file a petition to compel arbitration if Erie had not appointed an arbitrator), Bristol’s contention that "there was no need for and no legal or contractual requirement that [he] file a Complaint, Petition to Compel Arbitration^] or any other pleading” is entirely consistent with his argument that the parties’ <em>extra-judicial </em>acts tolled the statute of limitations. Bristol’s Answer to Erie’s Motion for Summary Judgment at 6-7. Chief Justice Saylor seems to suggest that this vague sentence "subsume[s] the commencement issue.” Concurring Statement at 190-91, 160 A.3d at 124. Respectfully, it does not. Lest there be any doubt, the language appears just two pages after Bristol’s concession that the statute of limitations began to run on July 22, 2005, and three pages before Bristol takes the position that his claim is not time barred because he informed Erie that he was pursuing an uninsured motorist claim "within four years of the date of the accident.” <em>Id. </em>at 2, 9.</p>

It is trae that Bristol, in his brief to this Court, now takes the position that his cause of action against Erie never even accrued. <em>See </em>Brief for Bristol at 10. But that does not mean that the Court should decide an unpreserved issue. If anything, rewarding Bristol for briefing an issue outside the scope of our <em>allocatur </em>grant will only encourage future litigants to do the same.</p>

This is, of course, distinct from the situation in which the Court rephrases an appellant’s issue statement at the <em>allocatur </em>stage, usually in an effort to promote clarity or to discourage the parties from briefing extraneous matters.</p>
