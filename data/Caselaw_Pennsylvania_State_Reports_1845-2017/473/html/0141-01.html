Post-verdict motions were denied and a sentence of four to eight years imprisonment was imposed. This direct appeal followed. Lesher advances several assignments of error in support of reversal of the judgment and the grant of a new trial. A new trial is required because the trial court’s charge to the jury failed to clearly assign to the Commonwealth the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt Lesher did not act in self-defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

There is, however, a sharp conflict between the testimony presented by the Commonwealth and that presented by the defense as to the circumstances surrounding Eisenhart’s death.</p>

On the night of October 13, 1974, Eisenhart was in the company of William Hillegas and Michael Wasser at a Freemansburg tavern, where they were shooting pool and drinking beer for several hours. At approximately 1:30 a. m. on October 14, 1974, the trio left the tavern and, at Eisenhart’s suggestion, drove to Lesher’s apartment. Upon their arrival, Eisenhart and Hillegas, <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>each with several bottles of beer, went up to Lesher’s door, followed by Wasser. Eisenhart knocked on the door; when Lesher’s wife answered, he told her they had come to “party” with Lesher and he handed her “a beer or two.” Mrs. Lesher informed them Lesher was asleep, but she would awaken him. She told them to wait and closed the door, leaving them outside. A few minutes later she returned and again instructed them to wait and closed the door. When the door opened a third time, Lesher was coming down the stairs with a pistol in his hand. Pointing the weapon, Lesher told the three to “Get the f---out of here.” Hillegas then tugged on Eisenhart’s arm and said something to the effect of “let’s get out of here.” A shot was then heard. Hillegas testified that he heard the shot as he turned to leave and that he threw a beer bottle at the doorway before running for cover. Wasser testified he heard the shot and saw Eisenhart “blown off the porch.” He then ran for his truck. Hillegas and Wasser attempted to retrieve Eisenhart’s body, but abandoned their efforts after they saw Lesher standing at the apartment window with the pistol. They drove to a friend’s house and had him notify the police that a shooting had occurred at Ramblewood Lane.</p>

At approximately 1:30 p. m. a group of three or four officers knocked at the front door of 118 Hamilton Street and announced they had a search warrant and an arrest warrant for Lesher. At that same time, Lesher was apprehended by another group of three officers stationed at the rear of the Hamilton Street address. Lesher was running from the back of the house in his stocking feet.</p>

    <p id="b189-4" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[185,507,1151,1503]]]'>Lesher’s version of the incident was substantially different, although he admitted shooting Eisenhart. Lesher’s testimony tended to show the following. On October 13, 1974, Lesher went to bed at approximately 10:00 p. m. Some time later, he was awakened by loud yelling and banging at the front door. Lesher looked out his bedroom window and saw Eisenhart, Hillegas and Wasser outside his door. He recognized these three as members of the Pagans Motorcycle Club, archrivals of the Warlocks, the motorcycle club to which he belonged. (Lesher also testified Eisenhart and Hillegas had confronted him at a hill-climb approximately three weeks prior to October 13, 1974, and stated they would have shot him if they had seen him “a couple days earlier.”) Lesher further observed Hillegas smash a beer bottle by throwing it against the building. He told his wife to go downstairs and tell their house guest not to open the door for the three Pagans. Lesher then obtained a loaded pistol from his nightstand and proceeded downstairs. As he descended the stairs, Lesher observed his wife holding the open door and Eisenhart standing at the threshold. Eisenhart pushed the door completely open and said to Lesher, “Come down here or we’ll come in and get you.” Lesher responded, “Get the f — out of here.” As Eisenhart stepped across the threshold, Lesher struck him with the pistol and the weapon accidentally discharged, knocking Eisenhart backwards through the doorway and off the porch.</p>

He also instructed his wife to leave their apartment and take their children to a friend’s house in Quakertown. Lesher and his family later went <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>to Norristown, where he was subsequently arrested. Several days after the shooting, Lesher cut his hair, shaved off his beard and obtained a pair of sunglasses to disguise himself.

Rather than utilizing the <em>Rose </em>rationale, however, <em>Cropper </em>was grounded on an analysis of the legislature’s intent in enacting the new Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq., which became effective June 6, 1973. The Court reasoned that since the section of the Crimes Code relating to self-defense, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 505, contains no indication that a defendant bears the burden of proving that defense, while other sections of the Code specifically require a defendant to prove certain defenses to various crimes by a preponderance of the evidence, “it must be assumed that the legislature intended not to impose on defendants the burden of proving that they acted in self-defense.

Now, <em>the commonwealth does not have to disprove self-defense </em>— that <em>is, they do not have to prove a negative </em>— but evidence of self-defense or evidence of accident, as I said, either standing alone or with all the other evidence, may be sufficient in your minds to create a reasonable doubt which might not have existed without the evidence of accident or self-defense.” (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>

Furthermore, even though the trial court instructed the jury it was the Commonwealth’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime charged, at no point in the charge was the jury explicitly informed a determination that Lesher was not acting in self-defense was essential to a finding of guilt. Under these circumstances, when the trial court made the statement that the Commonwealth did to have to disprove self-defense, the jurors could have been confused and led to infer that the question of self-defense was not an essential issue as to which the Commonwealth had the burden of persuasion. We cannot assume the jury applied the court’s general instructions to its deliberations with respect to self-de<a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>fense, since the court gave a seemingly contradictory instruction specifically directed at that issue. We are also not persuaded this shortcoming was corrected in another part of the trial court’s charge. As noted above, the jury was instructed that evidence of self-defense could create a reasonable doubt as to Lesher’s guilt. And while the logical implication of this instruction might be that a determination Lesher was not acting in self-defense was necessary for conviction, see Annot. <a href="/citations/?q=48%20A.L.R.%203d%20221" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="48 A.L.R. 3d 221">48 A.L.R. 3d 221</a>, 224 (1972), the fact remains there was no direct statement covering this point of law other than the instruction that the Commonwealth did not have to disprove self-defense. We are not convinced the potential confusion attendant upon this latter direct statement was eliminated or even clarified by the implication of other portions of the charge. Compare <em>Commonwealth v.
