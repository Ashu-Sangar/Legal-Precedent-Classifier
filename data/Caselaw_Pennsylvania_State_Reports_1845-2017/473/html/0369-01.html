On November 17, 1972, while in the employ of appellee, Overmyer Mold Company, appellant, William H. Collier, suffered a work-related injury to his lower back.

The section plainly starts out by requiring the employer to pay for services rendered by any duly licensed practitioner of the healing arts. It then provides that the employee may select any duly licensed practitioner of the healing arts he or she chooses. These portions of the section would clearly entitle appellant to the payment of the $210.00 bill.

Appellee would have us read this clause to mean that when five physicians have been designated, the employee shall select a physician <em>and no other practitioner of the healing arts. </em>Even were we to concede that such an interpretation is plausible, it is not the only reasonable interpretation. As appellant has argued, it is also reasonable to interpret the <em>unless </em>clause to mean that the employee must choose one of the designated physicians <em>if </em>the employee chooses to use a <em>physician. </em>If the employee does not choose to use a physician, the <em>unless </em>clause is not applicable.
