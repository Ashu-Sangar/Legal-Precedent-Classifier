On August 11, 1978, the remains of Senen Garcia were discovered in a burnt automobile in Wayne County. An investigation revealed that the victim had been killed before the car caught fire.

During Mrs. Garcia’s trial, appellant was named as the actual killer of the victim and this fact was reported in the local newspapers. Appellant moved for a change of venue and an evidentiary hearing was held on September 9, 1974. Appellant presented evidence that Mrs. Garcia’s trial was the first murder trial to be held in Wayne County in twenty years. Wayne County has a population of approximately 30,000 people. Furthermore, appellant presented numerous articles from the four newspapers circulated in the county which had a combined circulation of 24,000 copies. Appellant produced witnesses who testified that a widespread belief existed that appellant was guilty. Following the hearing, the court denied appellant’s motion without prejudice to renew the motion at trial.</p>

The three areas of “inherently prejudicial” pretrial publicity referred to in <em>Frazier, </em>and summarized in the majority opinion here, were not intended to be all inclusive however. The potential for prejudice results from the jurors’ exposure, outside of the judicial process, to evidence which points the finger of guilt at the accused.

I believe that the nature of the pretrial publicity here, although different in content than the pretrial publicity in <em>Frazier, </em>was such that appellant was denied a fair trial by an “impartial and indifferent” jury, and I therefore dissent.</p>
    <p id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[225,1294,1155,1036]]]'>In the present case Wayne County, a relatively small, primarily rural county with a population of approximately 30,000, was saturated with news coverage concerning the crime for which appellant was tried and convicted. On August 15, 1974, less than two weeks before appellant’s initial request for a change of venue, and approximately one month before the commencement of jury selection for appellant’s trial, one of appellant’s co-defendants, Irma Garcia, was found guilty of murder and conspiracy for the slaying of Senen Garcia (the other two persons indicted had already plead guilty). Irma Garcia’s trial was the first murder trial to take place in Wayne County in over twenty years. It received widespread notoriety throughout the county; particular attention being focused on the four persons accused of the homicide. Testimony taken at the trial of Irma Garcia, which testimony was thoroughly reported by the news media, repeatedly implicated appellant as the person who actually killed Senen Garcia.</p>

This fact was dramatically illustrated during the <em>voir dire </em>examination of prospective jurors held prior to appellant’s trial. Of a total of 228 prospective jurors who were interviewed individually, 111 were asked if they had read of the case in the newspapers or had seen or heard news coverage on television and radio. One hundred and one replied “yes”. Fifty-three were asked if they had discussed the case with their families or friends; forty-one replied that they had. Twenty-two were asked if they were familiar with the facts of the trial of appellant’s co-defendant, Irma Garcia, and if they knew the result of that trial; nineteen responded affirmatively. Sixty-four challenges for cause were made relating to the prospective jurors’ formation of fixed opinions of guilt which resulted from their exposure to the pretrial publicity; sixty-one of these challenges were granted.</p>
