Had the order been directed only to the latter point, certainly the correct' disposition of an appeal therefrom would be to quash as interlocutory. As it is, however, it seems to me that the Court is being more technical than practical in isolating the jury trial portion of the order and quashing it. All agree that the principal part of the order of the Commonwealth Court, that which denies Wheeling the opportunity to present evidence relevant to a complete defense, is a final order and hence properly before us. <em>See, e. g., Posternack v. American Casualty Co. of Reading, </em><a href="/pa/421/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="421 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1900422" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0021-01">421 Pa. 21</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20350" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="218 A.2d 350">218 A.2d 350</a> (1966). Because of this I can see no jurisprudential purpose to be served by our delaying a decision on the jury trial question; we are still obliged now to entertain the appeal from that portion of the order below which is final, and a decision now on the jury issue might avoid a later appeal and a duplicative trial proceeding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>
