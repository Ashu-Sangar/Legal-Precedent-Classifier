The instant appeal was filed with this Court on December 20, 1974, a date beyond the thirty day appeal period (as measured from the date of entry of the lower court’s order dismissing the appeal, or October 3, 1974) mandated by the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970.

The opinion implies that nothing occurred between the dates of October 7, 1974 and December 4, 1974. As we have indicated, however, in the recitation of the history of the case, after the appellant filed its petition for reargument on October 7, 1974, the Court of Common Pleas issued its order of October 8, 1974, which is not referred to in the Commonwealth Court opinion. Following the October 8, order, briefs were submitted and oral argument heard pursuant to the October 8 order. Only after the consideration of the briefs submitted and the oral argument did the Court of Common Pleas issue its order of December 4, 1974.</p>

That order requested the filing of briefs and scheduled oral argument to consider whether or not “the Opinion and Order of October 8, 1974” (dismissing Hospital’s petition) should be “reconsidered and revised pursuant to the Petition for Reargument and Reconsideration.” Although the October 8, order does not specifically use the words “petition granted”, a litigant reading that order would reasonably conclude that the petition for reargument had been granted.</p>
    <p id="b456-5" data-blocks='[["BL_456.5",456,[233,1717,1155,644]]]'>Moreover, briefs were submitted and reargument actually took place prior to the December 4, 1974 order. That order indicates that the court did reconsider its original order of October 3, 1974, but decided to affirm it. Although the December 4, 1974 order states that the Petition for Reargument and Reconsideration “is dismissed”, a consideration of all the circumstances allows only the conclusion that the Petition for Reargument was granted, reargument and reconsideration took place and the trial court reaffirmed its earlier position. Any other result would involve an unreasonably technical approach interpreting the word “dismissed” out of context.</p>
