Peters <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>had been stabbed eight times. The investigation further revealed that Peters had been robbed and that one of the items stolen was the decedent’s automobile, a 1973 Oldsmobile which was green with a white vinyl roof. On August 28, 1974, police questioned Thurgood Moore regarding an unrelated incident. Moore told the police that on the night of August 24, he saw two friends, known as “Chinaman” and “Hav-gun,” driving a 1973 green Oldsmobile with a white vinyl roof. Moore also told the police that “Chinaman” told him that “we stabbed a guy and took his car”. Moore identified police photographs of David Jones and Robert Perkins as “Chinaman” and “Hav-gun”, respectively.

(5 hour delay unnecessary where purpose of delay was interrogation). In addition, appellant’s statement, obtained during this period, was the product of the unnecessary delay. Appellant initially denied involvement in the crime. He admitted complicity during a later interrogation session only after undergoing a polygraph examination and being informed of its results. This is sufficient to establish a nexus between the delay and the statement elicited. See e. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Sanders, </em><a href="/pa/458/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="458 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="479757" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0281-01">458 Pa. 281</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=327%20A.2d%2043" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="327 A.2d 43">327 A. 2d 43</a> (1974).

Sanders was arrested at 3:45 p. m. and denied knowledge of the crime during the initial period following his arrest. At approximately 9:00 p. m., he took a polygraph examination. Following the examination, he was informed of the test results and incriminated himself at about 10:30 p. m. This Court ruled that Sanders’ admissions were the product of unnecessary pre-arraignment delay and granted him a new trial. Accord, <em>Commonwealth v.
