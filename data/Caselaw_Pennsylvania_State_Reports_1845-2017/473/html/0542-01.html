This reason in support of Grace’s assertion has no support in the record. The record shows that while the officer could not recall exact times during which specific questions and the like were asked, he did testify as to the facts and circumstances, including the general time frame of the interview.</p>

At this point the Commonwealth interposed by asking the court to take judicial notice of the fact that “at all times at all lineups at the prison there is a voluntary defender and an assistant district attorney present . . . .” Defense counsel responded by asking the court not to do so.

During the trial defense counsel, who is also appellate counsel, asserted at side-bar the representations were that no out-of-court identification procedures occurred. He was challenged in this connection by the assistant district attorney, who represented the Commonwealth at trial and said he only told counsel that he knew of no such procedures. While what was told to defense counsel by the other two assistant district attorneys at the preliminary and suppression hearings is not of record, since counsel now says he was told by these assistant district attorneys they “were not aware of any out-of-court identification procedures,” we accept this as correct for the purposes of this appeal.</p>

During the interval following arrest and before trial appellant’s counsel was led to believe, by the prosecution, that there were no out-of-court identification procedures. It was reasonable, therefore, for appellant’s counsel to rely on there not being any evidence in the form of out-of-court identification and not moving to suppress the same. Accordingly, I cannot conclude that the issue of the admissibility of out-of-court identification testimony was waived.</p>
