    <p id="b223-7" data-blocks='[["BL_223.7",223,[200,788,1152,801]]]'>During the course of his employment, Donald John Nath, Jr., appellant, sustained injuries while working on a machine which had been leased to his employer by the National Equipment Leasing Corporation. Nath instituted suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to recover damages from National. One of the theories of recovery set forth in the complaint was based on Section 402(a) of the Restatement of Torts, 2(d).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Specifically, the complaint alleged that appellee leased or rented to Nath’s employer, under a contract entitled “Equipment Lease”, a wire and cable stripper, which had been manufactured by Rigby Manufacturing Company and which was “unreasonably dangerous” in that it failed to have a guard to protect the user’s hands from the tool’s cutting edges.</p>

The trial court, recognizing the uncertainty of the issue, certified the matter to the Superior Court as involving a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion. <em>See, </em>Appellate Court <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>Jurisdiction Act of 1970, July 31, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. V, § 501(b), 17 P.S. § 211.501(b). The Superior Court affirmed per curiam. A petition for allowance of appeal was subsequently filed with this Court and granted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
