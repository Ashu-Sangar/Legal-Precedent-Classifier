On February 10, 1975, while represented by counsel, Moore entered a plea of guilty to a general charge of murder in the Court of Common Pleas, Indiana County. At the degree of guilt hearing, the Court upon hearing a portion of the testimony determined that the offense might rise to murder of the first degree.

Mrs. Graham, age 61, knew appellant and permitted him to enter the residence. Once inside, appellant demanded money which Mrs. Graham gave him. As Moore prepared to leave the premises, the deceased grabbed him by the arm and threatened to call the police. Appellant drew a knife, whch he had purchased the previous day, and slashed the victim across the throat. He continued to stab Mrs. Graham an additional twenty-eight times in the neck, back and chest. Moore then took a handbag, later identified as belonging to the deceased, which contained her wallet and personal check book. Later that day, appellant cashed one of these checks by forging Mrs. Graham’s signature.

This testimony, although conceding that appellant was legally sane and not psychotic, did indicate that he was impulsive and had limited control over his emotions and feelings. The findings suggested that appellant experienced difficulty in maintaining a conventional attitude, especially when faced with stressful situations. It was theorized that the victim’s threat to contact the police <em>could </em>have presented such a stress situation as to have produced an impulsive response.</p>

The mere introduction of evidence designed to refute the inference of a specific intent to kill does not necessarily prevent the finder of fact from concluding that the killing was in fact intended.
