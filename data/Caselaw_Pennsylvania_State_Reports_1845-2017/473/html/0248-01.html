At that time, Mr. Nickoloff was left with the “impression” that this sequence was unobjectionable to defense counsel since he was then engaged in the trial of another case. (Mr. Nickoloff could not recall with assurance the date of this conversation, but supposed it had occurred sometime near January 27, which had been the original trial date.) Thereafter, on February 14, Nickoloff drafted a document in the nature of a stipulation of the parties consenting to an extension of trial. In an attempt to procure appellant’s consent, Nickoloff telephoned his lawyer’s office, but found him to be unavailable. Sometime between February 18 and March 4 (Nickoloff was unable to be more precise), he chanced upon appellant’s lawyer in a courtroom hallway, the latter apparently on his way to court. In this brief encoun<a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>ter, Nickoloff brought up the matter of the stipulation. Counsel’s response, according to a vague recollection of Nickoloff, was to ask whether his client’s attention was necessary or whether his own signature might do. There was no further exchange between the two men.</p>
    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[200,602,1149,640]]]'>For his part, appellant’s counsel testified that he could not recall ever discussing with Mr. Nickoloff the scheduling of his client’s trial.

While we must resolve this conflict in testimony in favor of the prosecution, <em>Commonwealth v.

As to the alleged consent of counsel to the delay, the evidence shows only that one month prior to the expiration of the Rule 1100 period, Lamonna’s attorney had no quarrel with the prosecution’s decision to try a codefendant ahead of his client. That acquiescence, without more, cannot be taken as a consent to non-compliance with Rule 1100. Compare <em>Commonwealth v. Myrick, </em><a href="/pa/468/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="468 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1719722" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0155-01">468 Pa. 155</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="468 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1719722" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0155-01">360 A.2d 598</a> (1976).

The next step in the proceedings was the random selection from jury lists of a.panel of 65 veniremen, accomplished out of the presence of the judge. Sometime during the recess for this purpose and for lunch, certainly no later than the court’s reconvening at 1:30 p. m., the motion to dismiss was filed. N.T. pp. 6, 29. Upon reconvening, the panel of 65 “was examined upon their voir dire generally,” N.T. p. 6, and thereafter the court refused the motion to dismiss and directed that individual voir dire examination begin. N.T. pp. 12, 52-53. (See Pa.R.Crim.P. 1106(e) which provides, in pertinent part, that “[i]n capital cases, the individual voir dire method must be used, unless the defendant waives that alternative.”) The following day, after selection of the petit jury, the trial judge vacated his order refusing the motion to dismiss for violation of Rule 1100 and conducted a hearing thereon. Subsequently, the motion was again refused. It is clear from these events that, unlike the situation in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em><a href="/pa/473/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="473 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1730266" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0116-01">473 Pa. 116</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="473 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1730266" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0116-01">373 A.2d 1076</a> (1977), decided this day, Lamonna’s submission of a motion to dismiss occurred prior to the venire panel’s being sworn and addressed by court and counsel.</p>

We shall assume, however, that the Commonwealth means to argue that delay in excess of 180 days was consented to by appellant.

The Commonwealth does not argue that the trial court’s order of February 19, 1975, changing the trial date from January 27, 1975 to March 10, 1975, remedies non-compliance with Rule 1100(a)(2). The.text of the order does not state the ground for the action, but assuming good reason may have existed for the order, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>there is no provision for such a <em>sua sponte, ex parte </em>procedure within the framework of Rule 1100.

    <p id="b303-7" data-blocks='[["BL_303.8",303,[205,1070,1147,693]]]'>Initially, it should be noted that Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(b) provides: “For the purpose of this Rule, trial shall be deemed to commence on the date the trial judge calls the case to trial.” The plain language of this section indicates that a trial commences for purposes of Rule 1100 when the case is literally called to trial. However, it is obvious that the purpose of Rule 1100 will not be served, nor its requirements met, by a proceeding in which all that transpires is that the case is literally called to trial. Hence, we must first interpret what the language of the Rule “calls the case to trial” means, and second, whether Lamonna’s motion to dismiss was filed before the instant case was “called to trial” in compliance therewith.</p>
    <p id="b303-8" data-blocks='[["BL_303.9",303,[205,1788,1147,315]]]'>Although the explanatory comments to the Rules of Criminal Procedure are not part of the Rules and have not been officially adopted or promulgated by this Court, they nevertheless are useful tools for the resolution of questions of interpretation under the Rules. The comment to Rule 1100 provides, in pertinent part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b303-9" data-blocks='[["BL_303.10",303,[252,2126,1101,204]],["BL_304.1",304,[282,292,1101,202]]]'>“It is not intended that preliminary calendar calls should constitute commencement of a trial. A trial commences when the trial judge determines that the parties are present and directs them to proceed to voir <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>dire, or to opening argument, or to the hearing of any motions which had been reserved for the time of trial, or to the taking of testimony or to some other such first step in the trial.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[231,517,1150,1230]]]'>The words “some other such” immediately preceding “first step in the trial” clearly indicate that the events specifically referred to in the comment are to be considered first steps in a trial for purposes of Rule 1100, see <em>Commonwealth v. Boyle, </em><a href="/pa/470/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="470 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1723815" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0343-01">470 Pa. 343</a>, 354, <a href="/pa/470/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="470 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1723815" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0343-01">368 A.2d 661</a>, 666 (1977), even though not all of these events are, strictly speaking, directly involved with the determination of guilt or innocence. For example, if a case were called to trial and, after determining the parties were present, the trial judge held a hearing on a suppression motion which had been reserved for the time of trial, presumably the trial would have commenced for purposes of Rule 1100. This leads to the conclusion that the principal concern behind Rule 1100 is simply that the commencement of trial be marked by a substantive, rather than pro forma, event. Moreover, each of the events specifically referred to in the foregoing portion of the comment represents a degree of commitment of the court’s time and resources such that the process of determining the defendant’s guilt or innocence follows directly therefrom. Accordingly, the beginning' of any stage which leads directly into the guilt-determining process is a “first step in the trial” for purposes of Rule 1100.</p>
    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[227,1775,1148,418]]]'>There is no question instantly that it had been determined the parties were present when the Rule 1100 issue was first raised. But, apparently none of the events specifically listed in the comment were underway at that time. Thus, in determining whether Lamonna waived his Rule 1100 claim, the relevant inquiry indicated by the comment is whether “some other such first step in the trial” had begun before the motion to dismiss was made.</p>
    <p id="b304-6" data-blocks='[["BL_304.6",304,[225,2224,1144,99]],["BL_305.1",305,[194,331,1149,367]]]'>Trial was originally scheduled in the instant case for January 27, 1975.

On February 19, 1975, the date for commencement of Lamonna’s trial was extended to March 10, 1975. On that date the case was called to trial and Lamonna was formally arraigned. The trial court then recessed for the purpose of selecting a venire panel and for lunch. The motion to dismiss was filed during the recess.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[196,719,1149,477]]]'>In my view these facts do not present a situation where a first step in the trial had begun before the motion to dismiss was filed. Arraignment does not lead directly into the guilt-determining process, see Pa.R.Crim. P. 317(b), nor does it represent a degree of commitment of the court’s time and resources equivalent to the stages referred to in the comment. For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the conclusion Lamonna did not waive his Rule 1100 claim by failing to raise it before trial.</p>
