Subsequently, Lynch denied negligence and filed a complaint naming appellant Newton M. Weir as an additional defendant. Pursuant to the Arbitration Act of 1836, as amended,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and its local rules the court referred the matter to an arbitration board consisting of three members of the county bar. At the arbitration hearing the plaintiffs <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>presented eleven witnesses, including two doctors who had examined and treated Mrs. Weber subsequent to the collision, but a Dr. Mallory, who had been the first to treat her subsequently, did not testify. After the hearing, the arbitrators awarded Mrs. Weber $3,000.00 and Mr. Weber $1,000.00 and found both defendant and additional defendant equally liable. The Webers perfected a timely appeal from the award of the arbitrators and requested and received a jury trial in the court of common pleas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The Webers proposed to call Dr. Mallory, who would have testified that he had examined Mrs. Weber less than two weeks after the collision, at which time he diagnosed “traumatic bursitis due to injury in auto accident,” and that in connection with this condition he had treated her left shoulder then and as recently as the month of the trial. The defendants, invok<a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>ing Rule 303 J, objected to Dr. Mallory being permitted to testify. The plaintiffs argued that the doctor’s testimony was within the “good cause” exception to the rule, since he had been scheduled to testify at the arbitration hearing but on the day it was held he notified counsel he could not appear because of urgent medical appointments, and that, in any event, the rule was invalid because it improperly restricted their right of de novo appeal. The judge, however, took the position that the rule was a valid one, and that the testimony of Dr. Mallory did not come within the “good cause” exception because the plaintiffs might have subpoenaed the doctor to appear at the arbitration hearing but did not. Accordingly, he refused to allow Dr. Mallory to testify, and he also refused to permit Mrs. Weber to testify about the diagnosis and treatment she had received from this doctor.</p>

The Webers did present the testimony of the two doctors who had testified at the arbitration hearing, one of whom had first treated Mrs. Weber’s left shoulder in October of 1970 and the other in October of 1972, and both expressed the opinion that her shoulder ailment was caused by the collision of July 5, 1970; there was also evidence, however, that she had suffered other accidents affecting her shoulder.
