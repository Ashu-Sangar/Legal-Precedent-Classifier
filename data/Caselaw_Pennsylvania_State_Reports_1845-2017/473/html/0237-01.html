Section 2403 not only consolidated the Commonwealth’s purchasing authority in the Department, but it also set forth a comprehensive scheme directing the exercise of that responsibility. For illustration, Subsection (a) provides that the Department has the obligation “[t]o formulate and establish standards or specifications” for the articles or materials to be purchased and conditions the adoption of these standards or specifications upon prior approval of a “majority of the departments, boards and commissions using the <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>article.” Subsections (b) and (c) of Section 2403 impose the requirement of competitive bidding when articles are supplied for state requirements. If we were to accept the interpretation given to Subsection (h) by the majority of the Commonwealth Court (that it represents an autonomous grant of authority to the Department to purchase goods other than those required by the Commonwealth), we would be presented with anomaly of having the Department acting as a purchasing agent for the exclusive needs of a political subdivision <em>without </em>the restraints of competitive bidding, but requiring this procedure where the Department is acting on behalf of its prime principal, i. e., the state government.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Equally inexplicable is the fact that this interpretation would deny the political subdivision any voice in the terms and conditions set by the Department.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Thus, the construction <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>urged by appellee and embraced by a majority of the Commonwealth Court would require a finding that the Legislature has expressed diametrically opposed policies in the same subsection. In one instance, it would appear to favor the political subdivision over the state agency by releasing the former from the requirements of competitive bidding and yet, at the same time, deny the political subdivision any voice in a determination as to the terms or specifications of that contract, a power which is expressly given to state agencies for whom the Department otherwise acts as a purchasing agent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> It is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that the General Assembly does not intend an absurd or unreasonable result. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1) (Supp.1976-77). <em>Commonwealth v.

It would therefore follow, under the appellee’s view, that a political subdivision has the right to have any agency of state government act on its behalf as purchasing agent for goods or supplies which that agency is authorized to purchase directly, even where the purchase is solely for the benefit of the political subdivision and not for the agency in question. Such a conclusion is obviously absurd since it would, in fact, transform state agencies into purchasing agents for the private benefit of political subdivisions.

To reach this result the meaning of the word “participate” must be distorted.

The fallacy of this argument is apparent on its face. The mere transmittal of a requested purchase through a state agency does not mean that either the transmitting agency or the requesting agency is, in fact, participating in the actual contract. The Department of Public Education is not “receiving” or “sharing” in the goods to be purchased but merely acting as a conduit through which the political subdivision communicates its needs to the Department.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

It merely sought to allow the political subdivisions the opportunity to share in transactions inspired initially by state governmental needs where those needs happened to coincide with the needs of the political subdivisions. Equally as manifest is the distinction between the terms “purchase off” and “participate in”. In the former instance, the Legislature intended to describe a situation in which the State, after acquiring supplies and articles for its own needs, accumulates a surplus which can be presently utilized by the political subdivisions. In such a case the political subdivisions are given an option under Subsection (h) of purchasing a portion of the surplus to satisfy their own requirements. In counter-distinction the term “participate in” gives to the political subdivision the opportunity, subject to Department permission, to have its requirements included initially when the Department is negotiating the purchase of an item otherwise needed by the state government.</p>
