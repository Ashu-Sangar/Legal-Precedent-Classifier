(hereinafter “Ludlow”), Leonard Edelman, and Joseph C. Mogil. Commonwealth Court sustained the preliminary objections because of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, but granted appellants leave to file new pleadings. Such new pleadings would allow the defense of “recoupment” to be put forth by appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">1</a>

    <p id="b345-8" data-blocks='[["BL_345.8",345,[212,1541,1149,425]]]'>The facts surrounding this appeal are as follows: On February 27, 1975, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Public Welfare, filed a four-count complaint against Ludlow Clinical Laboratories, Inc., and against Leonard Edelman and Joseph C. Mogil, both in their capacities as officers of Ludlow Clinical Laboratories, Inc. and as individuals. Counts I and II of the Commonwealth’s complaint were filed in assumpsit.</p>

Ludlow was also certified by the Commonwealth as a participant in the Pennsylvania Medical Assistance Program. The Commonwealth provided a maximum fee schedule for billing of laboratory services. This maximum fee schedule was, however inoperative if the certified laboratory charged its private client a lesser fee for the same service. The Commonwealth would then pay only the amount charged the private client rather than the maximum fee provided for in the schedule. The Commonwealth contends that Ludlow overbilled by $1,301,579.44 and seeks recovery in that amount.</p>

The Commonwealth contends that Ludlow fraudulently altered the age records to lower ages to under sixty-five, thereby making the Commonwealth initially liable. The Commonwealth seeks damages in the amount of $43,263.50 as a result of the alleged improper payments.</p>

Appellants’ claim has been authorized by the Legislature; sovereign immunity has been waived.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">1</a> See Act of May 20, 1937, <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>P.L. 728, §§ 1 et seq., 72 P.S. §§ 4651-1 et seq. (1968). Thus, the question is not whether appellants’ counterclaim is barred by sovereign immunity but whether the Commonwealth Court has jurisdiction over appellants’ counterclaim. The resolution of this issue requires construction of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. I, §§ 101 et seq., 17 P.S. §§ 211.101 et seq. (Supp.1976), and the Act of 1937 which created the Board of Arbitration of Claims. 72 P.S. §§ 4651-1 et seq. (1968). Interpreting these statutes, I believe that when the Commonwealth brings an action in the Commonwealth Court, the defendant is entitled to assert a counterclaim, based on a contract with the Commonwealth, which arises out of the same transaction as the Commonwealth’s claim.</p>

We have recently relied on the policy against a multiplicity of suits in construing the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970 to permit resolution of all claims arising out of the same transaction in the same suit.

This Court construed section 401(a) (1) to allow joinder of defendants who were not officers of the Commonwealth, and therefore not within the specific language of section 401(a)(1), but who were alleged to share joint and several liability with defendants who were officers of the Commonwealth. In <em>Freach, </em>we construed the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970 to perm joinder of additional parties not specifically covered by the Act in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits. Similarly here, the Act should be construed to allow a defendant to assert a counterclaim arising out of the same transaction as the Commonwealth’s claim, especially since appellants may assert their claim as a basis for recoupment.</p>
