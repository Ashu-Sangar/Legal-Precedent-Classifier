    <p class="author" id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.4",471,[249,418,367,41]]]'>O’BRIEN, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b471-5" data-blocks='[["BL_471.5",471,[200,482,1149,204]]]'>Appellant, George Gray, was tried by a judge and jury and convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to a prison term of five to ten years. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b471-6" data-blocks='[["BL_471.6",471,[198,708,1151,582]]]'>The facts of the crime are as follows. On May 26, 1974, two Philadelphia policemen were approached by Herbert Gibbs, who expressed concern for Patricia Courley, the victim. Gibbs told the officers he had not seen the victim for a few days. Gibbs and the officers went to the victim’s residence in South Philadelphia, but they found the door locked. Gibbs and one officer left to find a pass key while the other officer stayed at Ms. Courley’s door. He was approached by appellant, who asked if anything was wrong. Appellant started crying and walked away.</p>
    <p id="b471-7" data-blocks='[["BL_471.7",471,[193,1312,1154,529]]]'>When the officers obtained a pass key, they entered the building and discovered the victim’s partially decomposed body lying face down on the sofa. During their investigation, police discovered that appellant had been dating the victim. Further, a witness saw appellant fighting with the victim outside her house at 1:00 a. m. on May 24, two days earlier. The victim’s nextdoor neighbor told police that she heard the victim and a man fighting at 1:80 a. m. on May 24. With this information, police arrested appellant.</p>
    <p id="b471-8" data-blocks='[["BL_471.8",471,[194,1898,1149,147]]]'>Appellant first alleges that the indictment in the instant case contained a fatal defect. He believes this defect entitles him to a new trial. We do not agree.</p>
    <p id="b471-9" data-blocks='[["BL_471.9",471,[192,2068,1154,259]],["BL_472.1",472,[224,299,1150,152]]]'>The indictment in the instant case charged appellant with killing Ms. Courley “on or about May 26, 1974.” At trial, the medical examiner testifed that the victim had been dead from one to four days when he examined the body at 1:00 p. m. on May 26. Appellant argues that <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>he believed the offense was committed on May 26 and prepared his defense on this basis. We believe, however, that appellant’s argument is unpersuasive.</p>
    <p id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.4",472,[226,471,1150,97]]]'>Rule 213(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:</p>

    <p id="b472-8" data-blocks='[["BL_472.8",472,[226,1257,1150,90]]]'>The Rules make clear that the precise date of an offense need not be known in all cases.</p>
    <p id="b472-9" data-blocks='[["BL_472.9",472,[224,1384,1149,631]]]'>At the preliminary hearing, appellant was put on notice that the Commonwealth had no intention of trying to prove the offense was committed on May 26. The Commonwealth’s proof consisted of appellant’s statement that he slept in the apartment after returning with the victim, and on the morning of May 24, he found the victim dead on the sofa. From all of this, appellant and his attorney should have known that the Commonwealth would attempt to prove the killing occurred in the early morning of May 24. While the Commonwealth should have amended the indictment, we find no prejudice to appellant.</p>

If it is, if he has willed to confess, it may be used against him. If it is not, if his will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, the use of his confession offends due process. The line of distinction is that the governing self-direction is lost and compulsion of whatever nature or however induced propels or helps to propel the confession.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[211,773,1151,150]]]'>Appellant argues that two statements introduced were not admissions of guilt and thus, not confessions and the use of the latter term implied an admission of guilt.</p>

Applying this standard, we find no error. The charge concerning the statements covers four pages of the notes of testimony. The complained of portion was in the middle of the charge and was preceded and followed by the use of the word “statement” over twenty times. Reading the entire charge in context, we find no merit to appellant’s contention.</p>
    <p id="b473-7" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[209,1498,1150,204]]]'>Appellant finally claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to object to the introduction of the above two statements. The facts surrounding the statements are as follows.</p>

Appellant was first given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which he waived at 6:50 p. m., by Detective Hopwood. During forty-five minutes of questioning, appellant denied any knowledge of the facts or circumstances of the homicide. Appellant was left alone from 7:35 p. m. to 9:05 p. m., when Detective Carty began to interrogate him. No <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given, because the officer relied on the warnings given at 6:50 p. m.
