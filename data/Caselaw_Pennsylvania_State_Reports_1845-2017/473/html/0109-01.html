Thereafter, defense counsel sought to support the claim of self-defense by calling numerous witnesses who testified that Miles had a reputation for violence and aggression. Defense counsel also supported the claim of self-defense by asking Darby, if at the time of the killing, he was aware that Miles had been convicted of certain criminal charges; Darby indicated he was aware of three such <em>convictions. </em>But when counsel asked Darby if he was aware of instances (prior to the killing) in which Miles had been <em>arrested </em>for being an accessory after the fact to murder and for assault with intent to kill, the court sustained objections by the Commonwealth to the questions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>The same reasoning would apply in the instant case had the arrest record of Miles been offered merely “to prove the allegedly violent propensities of the victim to show that the victim was in fact the aggressor.” But the arrest record and testimony of Darby regarding his knowledge of such arrests were also offered “to corroborate [Darby’s] alleged knowledge of [Miles’] quarrelsome and violent character to show that [Darby] reasonably believed that his life was in danger.” In this context whether Miles was guilty or innocent of the charges for which he was arrested is immaterial because it is the fact of the arrests having been made and Darby’s knowledge of them which would have caused Darby to formulate a belief that he was in danger when confronting Miles. Thus, Darby should have been allowed to testify that he knew Miles had been arrested previously for violent crimes and the arrest record should have been admitted to corroborate his testimony that he believed his life was in danger at the time involved.</p>
