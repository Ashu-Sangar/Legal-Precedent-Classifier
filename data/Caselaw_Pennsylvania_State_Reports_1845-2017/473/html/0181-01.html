The court en banc granted appellant a new trial, but refused to arrest judgment. The Superior Court, by a four-three vote, affirmed the order of the court en banc denying the motion in arrest of judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Upon arrival at the trailer park, the sheriffs found the trailer locked and had to wait until 10:20 p. m., when appellant’s roommate arrived with his girlfriend.

The car, however, belonged to appellant’s attorney. Appellant had picked up the car to repair it. Appellant was the only individual charged with possession of the contraband.
