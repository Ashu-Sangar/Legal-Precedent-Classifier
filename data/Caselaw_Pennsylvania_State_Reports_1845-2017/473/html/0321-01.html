Relying on this evidence the chancellor and the court en banc found no dedication or irrevocable offer to dedicate had been made by Company at the time of sale to Reed. But it was indicated that if Reed had asserted merely a private right of use or easement, rather than a use as a park or interest greater than an easement, relief would have been proper because an easement would have arisen from Reed’s deed incorporating the unrecorded 1956 Plan which designated a park area.</p>

Instantly, Reed asserts the dedication and/or private right of use resulted from either oral representations made at the time of sale or from Reed’s deed incorporating the 1956 Plan which designated a park area. The latter theory, that the dedication and/or private right resulted because of the deed, was not asserted in <em>Coffin, </em>supra, because the plan there did not designate a park area. In dealing with the former theory in <em>Coffin, </em>supra, that is, oral representation, we said no dedication resulted because the evidence thereof was not clear and convincing. But, we then stated that no private right of use or easement <em>could </em>result since a úse as a park was an interest greater than an easement because it was “inconsistent with a general property in the owner.” <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>

Moreover, the language in <em>Coffin, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/408/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="408 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1308437" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0487-01">408 Pa. at 494</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.2d%20906" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="186 A.2d 906">186 A.2d at 910</a>, quoting from <em>Clements v.

The language quoted in <em>Coffin, </em>supra, was originally set forth in <em>Clements v. Sannuti, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/356/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="356 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="470708" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0063-01">356 Pa. at 65</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20A.2d%20697" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="51 A.2d 697">51 A.2d at 698</a>. In that case, the asserted use or easement was for the <em>exclusive use </em>of a portion of a garage. The reason that the use there could not be an easement was the asserted use was claimed to be exclusive and as such would have deprived the servient owner of any possession and use. This would indeed be “inconsistent with a general property in the [servient] owner.” But in <em>Coffin, </em>supra, and instantly, the right of use asserted was not and is not asserted as exclusive and a claim for use as a park is not inherently a claim for exclusive use. Thus, the servient <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>owner in <em>Coffin, </em>supra, would not have been deprived of all possession and use, nor would the servient owner instantly.</p>
    <p id="b372-5" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[271,532,1151,366]]]'>We, therefore, rule that a use as a park, where not claimed by the dominant owner to be exclusive of any use and possession by the servient owner, can be, and is a claim for a right of use or easement. Moreover, our ruling is in accord with general principles of property law, with other decision of this Court, and rulings of numerous other jurisdictions.</p>
    <p id="b372-6" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[269,954,1152,962]]]'>Where a use as a park is asserted under such circumstances as prevail here, the servient owner is not deprived of possession and use. His possession and use as to that portion of the property designated a park is only limited to the extent his use does not interfere with the dominant owner’s use as a park. And although such a limitation may be greater in degree than a limitation resulting from an easement in a street, it does not differ in kind. Clearly an easement for a right of way limits the servient owner’s use and possession to practically no use for himself, other than as a street or right of way. Likewise, the servient owner of land subject to a use as a park is practically also limited to use the area as a park. But, it still allows the servient owner possession and, at least one use, that is, as a park. Furthermore, any use the servient owner can devise that is not inconsistent with a use as a park by the dominant owner may also be engaged in.</p>
    <p id="b372-7" data-blocks='[["BL_372.6",372,[268,1935,1149,421]]]'>A comparison with the limitations on possession and use by a servient owner in a park situation with an easement recognized by the Restatement of Property, Servitudes, Ch. 39, § 477, Illustration 1, emphasizes the point. There a right of use to flood the servient owner’s land is recognized as an easement. Clearly such a use is a more substantial interference with possession and use by the servient owner than is a use as a park.</p>

Reed clearly established and the chancellor found that Company conveyed a lot of land to Reed and the deed, which was recorded in 1962, made reference to an unrecorded plot plan of lots upon which the lot sold is designated and which plan designates a park area. Since the use of a park area is an easement, what we have said in other instances concerning streets, applies to parks as well. <em>Morrow v. Traction Co., </em>supra. Moreover, in this regard, Pennsylvania’s law is clear: a sale of land and a conveyance by deed making reference to an unrecorded plan which plan includes streets or parks is sufficient to create an enforceable interest, or private right of use, mainly an easement, in the buyer and will normally create an irrevocable offer to dedicate such streets and parks.

The rights in dedicated streets acquired by a purchaser of lots by a deed referring to a plot are private contract rights [more correctly, property rights], and are not affected by the failure of the municipality to act upon the dedication: 3 Dill, on Mun.Corp. (5th Ed.) § 1083. The owner of real estate, so long as he infringes no law, may do with it as he pleases; he has the right to dispose of it in any legal way which he may choose; he may sell it as a whole, or in parts; he may lay it out in lots intersected by streets and alleys, and sell the lots <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>with or without a grant to the purchasers and the public of an easement over the streets and alleys. If he lay the property out in lots, according to a plan disclosing such streets and alleys, and sells a lot, the law implies a grant or covenant on his part that all the streets and alleys on the plan shall remain open for the use of the public. The price paid for a lot is enhanced by the value of the easement in the streets and alleys appurtenant to the lot. The consideration is not only for the lot but for the easement as well. The proprietor of the plan therefore cannot revoke the implied easement or dedication; nor can the owner of any lot or lots, having purchased with a knowledge of the plan in accordance with which the lots were sold, obstruct or deny to the public the right to use any of the streets or alleys shown on the plan. The easement over the streets is appurtenant to every lot and becomes a property interest in the purchaser of the lot which may be protected by appropriate legal process.”</blockquote>
