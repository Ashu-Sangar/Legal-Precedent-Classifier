Appellant asserts, and the Commonwealth concedes, that he was not properly advised of his right to appeal from the 1965 proceedings. Appellant is not entitled to relief, however. Because he was convicted of second degree murder after a plea of guilty to murder generally, the only issues he could contest on appeal would be the jurisdiction of the trial court, the validity of his plea, and the lawfulness of his sentence. See <em>Commonwealth v. Skurkis, </em><a href="/pa/465/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="465 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1712688" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0257-01">465 Pa. 257</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="465 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1712688" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0257-01">348 A.2d 894</a> (1975). Appellant was given the opportunity to raise these issues in the post-conviction proceedings, and challenged only the validity of his plea.
