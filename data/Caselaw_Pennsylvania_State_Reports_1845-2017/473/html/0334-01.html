From 1969 to 1972, Norris-town took some steps to effectuate its desegregation plan but made no efforts to desegregate grades kindergarten through the fourth grade. On December 5, 1972, Norris-town advised the Commission that it refused to correct the racial imbalance in grades kindergarten through fourth grade. The Commission interpreted Norristown’s refusal to desegregate as an amendment to Norristown’s May 11, 1969 plan. The Commission then disapproved Norristown’s desegregation plan. After numerous attempts at conciliation, the Commission filed a complaint on March 6, 1973, alleging, inter alia, that Norristown discriminated against pupils in its school system in that it sanctioned racially segregated schools by failing to adopt and implement an acceptable plan to reduce the <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>amount of racial segregation.

The argument that an agency must follow rulemaking procedures when it elects to formulate policy by a substantive rule has no application in this case. Order No. 467 does not establish a substantive rule. Although the Commission is free to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish a binding substantive rule, the Commission apparently intends to establish its curtailment policies by proceeding through individual adjudications.

The Pennsylvania Human Relations Act outlaws various discriminatory practices if such practices are based on a person’s race, color, religious creed, ancestry, age, sex, national origin and in certain cases a person’s handicap or disability. Every <em>imbalance </em>does not, per se, establish discriminatory practices. If it did, we would in effect be sanctioning a quota system. No public institution can have or is legally required to have a <em>perfect balance. </em>Therefore, a racial imbalance, or a sex imbalance, or a national origin imbalance does not in and of itself establish a discriminatory practice. If it did, then every institution would be required to have, in relation to the community’s population, the same ratio of Catholic, females, blacks, Italians, Jews, blind persons and so on. I, therefore, object to the use of the word <em>imbalance </em>as implying a result brought about by unlawful practices.</p>

Such guidelines are obviously helpful, indeed desirable. Regardless of the guidelines, however, the inference drawn by the Commission in this case that the degree of <em>imbalance </em>was sufficient to conclude that the Act had been violated was a reasonable inference to be drawn. If it were not, it could of course be struck down. Since the evidence before the Commission, however, indicated a substantial degree of imbalance, the Commission properly concluded that discriminatory practices existed and it could properly order a remedy.</p>

At the time of the adoption, May 15, 1968, by the Human Relations Commission of the document entitled “Recommended Elements of a School Desegregation Plan” which contained its segregation definition here in dispute, the applicable law relative to effectuation of administrative regulations by publication was Sec. 21 of the Administrative Agency Law, 71 P.S. 1710.21. If compliance with this section was requisite and not performed, Sec. 21 provided that the document had “no effect”. The Commission, presumably because it did not consider the document a regulation, did not comply. The Commonwealth Documents Law, 45 Pa.C.S.A. § 1101, et <em>seq., </em>(Supp.1977-1978), was adopted July 31, 1968 and became effective generally on July 1, 1969, with the effective date of several sections being controlled by the date of publication of the first issue of the Pennsylvania Bulletin. Under the Documents Law it was obligatory on an agency to deposit with the Legislative Reference Bureau certified copies of all unfiled administrative regulations in effect on the effective date of the Documents Law, “in default of which such administrative regulations shall become invalid”. 45 Pa.C.S.A. § 1402 (Supp.1975). The current validity of the unfiled document here challenged must be determined in light of the Commonwealth Documents Law. The Court’s reliance, <em>ante </em>at 680, n. 31, on Section 208 of the Documents Law for the proposition that that act is here inapplicable is misplaced. Section 208, 45 Pa.C.S.A. § 1208, provides that a regulation announced after the effective date of the Documents Law is not valid for any purpose until filed by the Legislative Reference Bureau, as a prelude to publication; the section does not speak to the current validity of a regulation which has had “no effect” under prior law.

In <em>Pickus, </em>the Federal Board of Parole argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that its rule establishing factors which it would consider in exercising its discretion to parole eligible prisoners was merely a general statement of policy, not a regulation.
