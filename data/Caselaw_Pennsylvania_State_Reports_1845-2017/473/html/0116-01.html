Following the denial of post-verdict motions, a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed on the murder conviction. Prison sentences were also imposed on the robbery conviction (10-20 years) and the conspiracy conviction (5-10 years), these sentences to run concurrently with the life sentence, but consecutively to one another. Sentence was suspended on the conviction of possession of an instrument of crime. Perkins filed a direct appeal to this Court from the judgment of sentence on the murder conviction. The judgments of sentence on the robbery and conspiracy convictions were appealed to the Superior Court, which certified that appeal to this Court.</p>

On August 25, 1974, at approximately 8:17 a. m. the body of one Garvin Peters was discovered amidst the rubble and debris of an abandoned property at 1636 <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>North Franklin Street, Philadelphia. According to the testimony of Detective Robert Flannery, the officer who found the body, the victim’s hands were tied and the body was lying in a pool of blood; also the victim’s trouser pockets, one of which was torn, were turned out. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene and the cause of death was later established as multiple (eight) stab wounds of the chest and back. The medical examiner estimated the time of death as between 6:30 p. m. and 11:30 p. m. the previous night, August 24, 1974. The medical examiner also testified that the victim had cuts and bruises about his lips and that the victim’s wounds were consistent with the type of wound which could be inflicted with a kitchen knife. He further opined that the victim was intoxicated at the time of death since the toxicology report indicated the alcoholic content of the victim’s blood was .21 percent.</p>

This automobile was located that afternoon at a parking lot at 15th Street and Columbia Avenue. The automobile’s front fenders were damaged and the left front tire was flat.</p>

According to Page’s testimony, Perkins and another individual named Thor were having a discussion concerning whether Thor was sober enough to drive a certain automobile, which Page identified as a green white-topped 1973 Delta 88, parked on 15th Street near the corner of Columbia <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>Avenue. The result of the discussion was that Perkins took something<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> from his pocket and handed it to Thor, who then drove away in the. car. Page further related that the same vehicle was parked in the parking lot at 15th Street and Columbia Avenue at 7:45 a. m., August 25, 1974, and that he observed the police photographing this automobile at 4:30 p. m. the same day.

The first statement, made to Detective Raymond Dougherty between 7:15 a. m. and 8:53 a. m., was exculpatory in nature. The second statement, however, made to Detective William O’Brien between 9:02 a. m. and 9:50 a. m., was incriminating. The substance of the second statement was as follows: On the night of August 24, 1974, Perkins and an individual named Chinaman<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> decided to go to a party. After picking up a knife<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> at Chinaman’s house (“in case there was any trouble at the party”), the pair had proceeded on their way, when it began to rain. They stopped at a Gino’s restaurant where Chinaman asked “this old guy” [Peters], who was “drunk or something” for a ride to the party. Peters indicated he would give Chinaman a ride and went out to his car; Perkins and Chinaman followed. When Peters realized Perkins was also coming, <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>he refused to take them; a fight ensued during which Chinaman punched Peters in the face and Perkins stabbed him in the back a number of times. The two put Peters, who was “still moving around,” in the back seat of the car, tied his hands, went through his pockets and took his wallet. At Chinaman’s direction, Perkins drove the car to a “little street” where they dumped Peters, who was “still moving around,” behind some houses. At this point, Perkins gave Chinaman the knife to dispose of and they then drove to the party at 11th and Huntington Streets. Following the party, the two again took the car, with Chinaman driving. After Chinaman “crashed two times,” Perkins took control and drove the car down to 15th Street, where “everybody else was driving it around.”</p>

(1975), the following facts were established at the suppression hearing: Perkins was arrested without a warrant on August 29, 1974, at 6:50 a. m. at his residence by Detectives Doyle and Dougherty. He was transported to the Police Administration Building and placed alone in an interview room at 7:01 a. m. At 7:15 a. m. he was questioned by Detective Dougherty who initially identified himself and informed Perkins he was being questioned “concerning the homicide by stabbing of Garvin Peters, fifty three, Negro male, residence — 1922 West Willard Street, found on the highway in the rear of 1636 North Franklin Street <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>on Sunday, August 25th, 1974.” Dougherty advised Perkins of his rights as mandated by <em>Miranda v.

Perkins’ answers to those questions indicated an awareness of his rights and a willingness to waive them. Perkins denied any knowledge of the killing, but expressed a willingness to take a polygraph examination. This interview was concluded at 8:53 a. m. and Perkins was left alone until 9:02 a. m., when the questioning was continued by Detective O’Brien. O’Brien identified himself and Detective Doyle, who was also present, and again informed Perkins he was being questioned in connection with Peters’ death. O’Brien also advised Perkins of his constitutional rights and asked the accompanying questions from the police interrogation card. Perkins again indicated his willingness to answer questions without the presence of an attorney. Almost immediately after the interview began Perkins made an incriminating statement, which was recorded on a typewriter by O’Brien as Perkins spoke. This statement was concluded by 9:50 a. m. Perkins was then allowed to use the lavatory and at 10:10 a. m. he was given a sandwich, coffee and cake. Between 10:35 a. m. and 10:50 a. m. Perkins read and signed each page of the statement. The suppression hearing record further establishes that Perkins was alert and responsive throughout both periods of questioning, he exhibited no signs of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he made no complaint of any physical discomfort, and he was not threatened, harassed or physically abused. He was arraigned at approximately 1:30 p. m.</p>

The court went on to elaborate upon this principle in terms of negating specific intent to kill, as requested, and the facts of the instant case. Perkins now argues the trial court’s intoxication instruction was insufficient and confusing because it did not include the statement that if Perkins was so intoxicated as to be incapable of forming the specific intent to kill, the jury could find him guilty of no more than murder of the third degree.

On February 25, 1975, the 180th day from the date of the complaint, Perkins appeared with counsel before the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. The court announced the case of “Commonwealth versus Robert Perkins” and asked the parties if they were ready to proceed. Defense counsel responded affirmatively and the assistant district attorney moved for trial on the bills of indictment against Perkins. Perkins was then brought before the bench, sworn, and questioned by the court as to whether he understood the charges against him, whether he was satisfied with his counsel’s representation, and whether it was correct he was requesting a jury trial. Perkins responded affirmatively, whereupon the court made the <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>following statement with respect to the availability of a jury panel:</p>

On February 26, 1975, court reconvened with the jury panel present. Perkins was again brought before the bench, sworn, informed of the charges against him; after indicating his intention to plead not guilty to all charges, Perkins was also informed of his right to challenge the members of the jury panel. After the trial court, defense counsel and the assistant district attorney next addressed the jury panel, and the panel was sworn, defense counsel made an oral motion to dismiss the charges against Perkins on the basis that the 180-day rule had been violated. The thrust of Perkins’ argument is that trial did not “commence” on February 25, 1975, because the trial court did not direct the parties “to proceed to voir dire, or to opening argument, or to the hearing of any motions which had been preserved for the time of trial, or to the taking of testimony or to some other such first step in the trial.” Pa.

Even assuming trial did not commence until February 26, 1975, Perkins waived his Rule 1100 claim by failing to raise the issue in a timely fashion. Pa.R. Crim.P. 1100(f) provides that a defendant or his attorney may apply for dismissal of the charge on the ground Rule 1100 has been violated, “[a]t any time <em>before </em>trial.” (Emphasis added.) The record shows Perkins did not assert his Rule 1100 claim until <em>after </em>the jury panel had been sworn and addressed by both counsel and the court, as well as after Perkins had again been sworn, informed of his right to challenge members of the jury panel, and read the charges against him, to which he indicated an intention to plead not guilty. Under these circumstances, we are of the view Perkins failed to raise the issue of an alleged violation of Rule 1100 until after his trial had commenced and thus, the issue is waived.
