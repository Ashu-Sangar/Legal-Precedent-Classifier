Appellee, William Henry Brown, was indicted by a grand jury on December 16, 1975, for murder and voluntary manslaughter in connection with the death of one Robert Maloney. The grand jury also returned an indictment against Brown on January 12, 1976, for conspiracy to commit murder in connection with Maloney’s death. On May 26, 1976, Brown filed a motion to quash the indictments<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and the trial court issued a rule upon the Commonwealth to show cause why the motion should not be granted.

Brown urges us to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel to the instant case and thus, limit the effect of section 306(g) in the circumstances here presented.

See generally Annot., <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.L.R.%203d%20203" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 A.L.R. 3d 203">9 A.L.R.3d 203</a> (1966). Traditionally, collateral estoppel has been limited by, <em>inter alia, </em>the rule of mutuality; that is, collateral estoppel does not operate unless the party seeking to take advantage of it would have been likewise bound by an adverse judgment in the prior adjudication. In the context of civil litigation, this mutuality requirement has been eroded in recent years and the modern trend has been for courts to abandon it.
