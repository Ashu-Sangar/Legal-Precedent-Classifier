    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[258,780,1149,1420]]]'>It is questionable whether Sweeney’s interest in his office is a property interest. Sweeney fails to articulate why his interest in his office should be considered property within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment. It is clear, though, that if he has a property interest, it is a highly circumscribed one. See <em>Gordon v. Leatherman, </em><a href="/f2d/450/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="450 F.2d 562" data-case-ids="793653" data-case-paths="/f2d/450/0562-01">450 F.2d 562</a> (5th Cir. 1971). An elected office is a public trust, not the private domain of the officeholder. A member of the Legislature has a profound responsibility to represent his constituents in the formulation of public policy in this state. He holds office for the benefit of his constituents and cannot justifiably rely on a private need or expectation in holding office. He is periodically accountable to his constituents through the electoral process. Due to the paramount public interest in the integrity of the legislative process, the Pennsylvania Constitution provides for expulsion by two-thirds vote of the representatives of the people of the entire state. A member of the Legislature is thus subject to the political process at all times. See generally <a href="/f2d/450/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="450 F.2d 562" data-case-ids="793653" data-case-paths="/f2d/450/0562-01">id. at 565</a> (an elected official is “subject to the conditions imposed by the terms and nature of the political system in which he operates”).

Given the circumscribed nature of a legislator’s private interest in his elected office and the overriding need for the Legislature to protect its integrity through the exercise of the expulsion power, it may be that the requirement of a two-thirds vote to expel by itself satisfies procedural due process.

Nothing in the opinion states, for example, whether in judging the qualifications of its members, the Legislature can add qualifications to those enumerated in the Constitution, see Pa.Const. art.

In both <em>Auchenbach </em>and <em>Harrington-, </em>the municipal council had not yet passed on the qualifications of the person elected. The issue whether the councils’ rulings on qualifications were subject to judicial review was not before the Court.
