Rather, they maintain that a physician’s entire office is a “place.” Since a physician’s office is organized primarily for the examination and treatment of patients, they argue that a physician’s office laboratory, which is only operated as an incident to that purpose, cannot be regulated under the Act.

We find the Department’s interpretation to be more reasonable than appellants’ interpretation. The use of the word “place,” in addition to the words “establishment” or “institution,” is consistent with the legislative intent to focus on the primary purpose for which a particular area is used, in addition to the primary purpose of the larger organization or institution of which it may be a part. By its common usage, <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>the word “place” may refer to a particular room or area within a larger building or facility,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> and certainly could be used to refer to the part of a physician’s office set aside for tests.

The Act was enacted to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from faulty laboratory testing. The issue whether office laboratories of private physicians come within the Act does not involve the interpretation of a penal provision and there is no need to construe the Act narrowly.</p>

Originally the Act was primarily directed at independent commercial laboratories. In 1972, the Legislature decided that the purposes of the Act could only be achieved if all clinical laboratories performing tests which affect the treatment of patients in the Commonwealth were regulated. Therefore, the Leg<a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>islature deleted all previous exemptions to the Act except laboratories operated by the federal government and those operated solely for research or teaching. The deletion of the specific exemption for office laboratories of private physicians operated solely for the treatment and diagnosis of their own patients manifests a legislative intent to subject office laboratories of private physicians to regulation under the Act. The Department’s regulation including clinical laboratories of private physicians within the Act is a valid exercise of the Department’s rule-making power and is necessary to implement the Legislature’s intent in amending the Act.</p>

Rather, the legislature has accorded to the Department an “interpretative” rule-making power in aid of and limited to its enforcement function. The question, then, is whether the regulation purporting to extend the Act’s coverage to private physicians’ offices “in fact tracts the meaning of the statute it interprets.” Given the factual premise that physicians’ offices are not organized and operated primarily for purposes of clinical laboratory testing, it seems to me manifest that the answer must be in the negative.

With respect, this seems to me a disingenuous argument which distorts the plain meaning of the quoted section.
