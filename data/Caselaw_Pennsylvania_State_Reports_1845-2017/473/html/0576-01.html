Suffice it to say that pursuant to a retrenchment program, the appellee-College discharged two full-time faculty members; the propriety of this action is not here questioned.

This fact-finding function exercised by the court is denominated a “question of law,” therefore, not because analytically it is a question of law but rather to indicate that it is the trial judge, not the jury, to whom the law assigns the responsibility for deciding the matter.

The union, in reply, makes what is in our view an argument equally reasonable. It points out that Article XXX actually does grant to part-time teachers recall rights with respect to part-time positions. That fact, it is argued, suggests two corollaries: first, that the statement in Article X that the agreement does “not apply to those employed under special term appointments” cannot be taken literally; and second, that the explicit limitation of the recall rights of part-time teachers to part-time positions bespeaks an indication (through the use of the negative pregnant) that full-time teachers on the preferred rehiring list are to have recall rights with respect to both kinds of positions. Because either of these views advanced by the parties is “reasonable,” i. e., can be ra<a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>tionally derived from the agreement, neither can be said to be “against the law” within the meaning of Section 11(d) of the Arbitration Act. It follows that the Commonwealth Court erred in substituting its view of the proper construction of the agreement for the view of the arbitrator selected by the parties. <em>International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers, AFL-CIO Local 1201, <a href="/pa/465/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="465 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1712643" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0356-01">supra.</a></em>

Judicial review of arbitration awards does not depend on whether or not certain language in an act, or in a particular case, can be interpreted with different shades of meaning. The majority opinion points out that no conflict exists between the standard of review in the Arbitration Act of 1927 and that recognized by federal decisional law in the field of labor relations. Likewise, the majority properly notes that the Act of 1927 does not dictate a “different <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>scrutiny” of an arbitration award than required in the federal decisions.</p>
    <p id="b643-4" data-blocks='[["BL_643.4",643,[184,439,1148,590]]]'>The important point about judicial review of arbitration awards is that the arbitration is, except in limited situations, “the court of last resort.” The arbitrator may make a mistake just as any court of last resort, including this one, may do. A mistake, however, is not a sufficient basis to take away the arbitrator’s role as the court of last resort. Thus, if the arbitrator’s award is derived from the agreement between the parties, it can not be upset by the courts, whether or not the arbitrator erred. To hold otherwise would frustrate the whole concept and purpose of binding arbitration.</p>
