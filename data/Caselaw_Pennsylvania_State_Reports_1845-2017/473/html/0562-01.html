The first day, two police officers went to Banks’ home and asked him to accompany them to police headquarters. Banks was released after being questioned at police headquarters. The next day, Banks was again taken to police headquarters, after being informed that the police desired “to further interview him concerning information he had stated in the first interview.” Banks was then questioned at police headquarters for two hours before he was warned of his rights. This Court held that the questioning at police headquarters on the second day constituted custodial interrogation. Here, we are presented with an even clearer case of custodial interrogation than in <em>Banks. </em>While Banks was told the police wished to interview him further about information he had given earlier, appellant was informed that there were “discrepancies” between his statements and those of the other security guard, and therefore had greater reason to believe the suspicions of the police had been aroused. The decision by the police to move the interrogation from the Koppers Building to the Public Safety Building further underscored the seriousness of the situation, and the control exercised by the police. Finally, appellant had been questioned over an extended period the day before. As in <em>Banks, </em>we must conclude that the interrogation at the Public Safety Building Monday evening constituted custodial interrogation.</p>
