An investigation ensued and authorities learned that Peters and other persons, including Motto, had been at Peters’ apartment on July 22 or 23, 1969. The police proceeded to interview these persons. Each was requested to come to the Bristol Township Police Station to be interviewed. Peters, pursuant to the request, appeared there voluntarily on July 30, 1969. The police did not at that time suspect Peters was involved in Motto’s death and he was free to leave the police station at any time he desired. No warnings of constitutional rights were given. The interview was recorded on tape. It was subsequently transcribed and was read into evidence at trial. This statement [hereinafter referred to as C-l] recounted in substance the following:</p>
    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[176,1846,1151,530]],["BL_122.1",122,[273,335,1148,418]]]'>Peters and other persons met Motto at a bar in Bristol Township late in the day on July 22, 1969. Peters and his group left and went to Peters’ apartment. Motto accompanied by another person thereafter arrived at the apartment, but both left after a short time. Motto returned alone a short time later with a gun which he “flashed . . . around.” William Simmons requested the gun and Motto gave it to him. Simmons unloaded the gun and returned it to Motto. Motto reloaded it and again “flashed [it] around.” Simmons requested that <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>Motto leave. Motto left escorted by Simmons, and Peters followed them to the doorway where he stood and watched Motto go to the parking lot area to a “broken down” car. Peters and Simmons then returned to the apartment. Later in the evening or in the early morning hours of July 23, 1969, Peters went to Motto’s apartment and knocked on the door some five times in order to get beer, but Motto did not answer.</p>

The police phoned Peters and requested him to come to the courthouse. When Peters arrived he spoke with a receptionist who called Rice. Rice spoke with Peters in the hallway and informed him that Sullivan was attempting to obtain his release from prison on reduced bail and to help accomplish this, he had informed Rice that Peters had information about Motto’s death. Rice then told Peters that the information received from Sullivan was why he wished to speak with him. Rice also said to Peters that <em>“The most that would happen to him </em>would be that he would be picked up or held as a material witness on dollar bail.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> [Emphasis added.] Rice could not re<a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>call whether this remark was made prior to or subsequent to the interview of March 8, 1971, but since the Commonwealth has the burden of proof, we will assume the remark was made prior to the interview.</p>

Peters again met Motto at the same bar at about 11:00 p. m. a couple of days prior to his body being discovered. Motto was accompanied by another person and Peters was with a group, including Simmons. Peters and Simmons left first and went to Peters’ apartment, arriving at about midnight. At about 1:00 a. m., Motto, accompanied by his friend, arrived at Peters’ apartment and was invited in to “drink some beer.” Motto’s friend was the first to depart and was followed by Motto at about 2:30 a. m. or 3:00 a. m. During the visit a few “small squabbles” occurred. Motto returned about fifteen or twenty minutes later and began to “flash around a gun and a knife.” An argument resulted between Motto and Simmons. In Peters’ opinion, he, Motto and Simmons were intoxicated but, despite having taken other drugs earlier in the day, they were not under the influence of drugs.</p>

Peters and Simmons told Motto there was a party taking place there. Upon arriving and finding no one else there, the three were “horsing around” until an argument began between Simmons and Motto. Motto then went for a swim. Peters thought Motto was about to drown so Peters swam out to him and pulled him back to the shore. Motto was lying half on the beach and half on the shore when he began referring to Peters and Simmons in vulgar terms. Simmons told Motto to “shut up,” but Motto kept “mumbling and talking, and he started hollering.” Simmons picked up a rock and hit Motto on the head with it rendering him unconscious. Peters and Simmons remained at the Cove for about a half-hour smoking a few cigarettes. Peters then walked over to look at Motto who was still uncon<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>scious but was not bleeding.

He came voluntarily to the Bristol Police Township Station to be interviewed during the normal course of an investigatory fact-finding process. Although he was requested to do so, he was not “deprived of his freedom of action” nor was he placed in a situation where he could have reasonably believed “his freedom of movement [was] restricted.” Furthermore, we are unwilling to adopt a requirement that warnings must be given merely because the police request an interview and it occur at a police station.

The suppression court’s opinion rejected this argument by stating: “Collateral conversations between [Peters] and the district attorney or police preceding or incidental to C-2 pertaining to the subjects either of [Peters] being held as a material witness and release on nominal bail . . . were not coercive and did not procure or bring about [Peters] giving the statement C-2 involuntarily or against his will.” That court ruled the evidence was admissible, but did not specifically address the effectiveness of Peters’ waiver of his right to remain silent and other constitutional privileges.</p>

That need applies with equal force to both defense counsel and prosecutors.

Jury selection occupied the entire day of February 6, and was completed by noon February 7, 1973. The taking of testimony began that afternoon and continued through February 8. The prosecution’s theory was that appellant and Simmons had taken Motto to the “Cove” for the purpose of taking his money and other valuables. The prosecution however, failed to support this theory, and appellant’s demurrer to the robbery, larceny, and associated counts was sustained by the trial court. All evidence had been entered, and the closing arguments of both sides were completed before noon on February 9, 1973. The case was submitted to the jury on counts of murder, assault with intent to commit murder, aggravated assault and battery, simple assault and battery, and related conspiracy counts after instruction by the trial court. These instructions were completed at approximately 2:45 p. m., February 9, 1973. At 4:20 p. m., the jurors were brought back to the court room for further instructions, having requested that the trial court answer certain questions regarding the definition of the crime of mur<a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>der. Such instructions, occupying ten pages of the transcript, were given. At 6:20 p. m., the court reconvened, without the jury, to announce a recess until 7:45 p. m., and to direct court attendants to provide the jury with an evening meal. The evening meal was given to the jurors in the jury room so that they could continue their deliberations while dining. At 9:15 p. m., the jurors sent another note to the trial court indicating their failure to reach a verdict and adding, “ [we] cannot see any chance of coming to a verdict.” Upon receiving this note, the trial court had the jury brought into the court room and questioned them, in the presence of counsel and the appellant, as to the possibility of their reaching a verdict upon further deliberation. After pointing out the importance to all concerned of the jurors’ using every reasonable effort to reach a decision, while at the same time making clear that it was not intended to coerce any juror into giving up his or her individual beliefs, the trial judge again inquired as to the possible productiveness of further deliberations, and one of the jurors responded affirmatively. Another inquired as to the possibility of rendering a verdict on less than all counts, and the trial judge replied that such could be done but that he hoped that that would not be the result. With this, the jury was sent back for further deliberation.</p>

The jurors had <em>not </em>requested that their deliberations be interrupted, nor had they given any further indication of an inability to reach a verdict. Inquiry by the trial court revealed that in the intervening hour, the jury’s deliberations had yielded agreement as to some of the counts. The counts to which the jury had reached agreement were conspiracy to commit murder, assault with intent to commit murder, assault and battery, and conspiracy to commit assault and battery. The counts to which the jury had not reached agreement at this point included the murder <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>charge, the aggravated assault and battery count, and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and battery. The trial judge, having thus ascertained the state of the jury’s deliberations, turned to counsel and asked if there was “any point in taking the verdict on the ones they have agreed on.” The assistant district attorney answered in the affirmative; defense counsel answered in the negative. Without further comment, the trial court declared a mistrial, “by reason of the failure of the jury to be able to agree to a unanimous verdict on all of the charges.” The case was continued, a new trial date subsequently fixed, and appellant was released upon existing bail pending a new trial.</p>

Furthermore, the murder count included all degrees of murder as well as voluntary manslaughter.
