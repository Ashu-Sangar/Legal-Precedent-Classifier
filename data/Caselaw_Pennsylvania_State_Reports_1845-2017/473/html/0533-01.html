On August 19, 1975, a petition seeking post-conviction relief was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. A hearing began on November 13, 1975, but was not concluded until March 10, 1976, because five different sessions were needed to conclude the testimony. On April 19, 1976, relief was denied.

Initially, Humphrey was represented by “trial counsel” who concluded his representation of Humphrey following the filing of post-verdict motions. Thereafter, new counsel, “post-verdict motions counsel,” was appointed. She filed new post-verdict motions which included an allegation that trial counsel was ineffective, and, during argument on the new post-verdict motions, she requested a hearing on this issue, but the request was denied. The direct appeals to this Court from the judgments of sentence were filed by still new counsel, “appellate counsel.” Appellate counsel also filed the petition for remand. On remand, Humphrey’s petition for post-conviction relief was filed by still different counsel, who is also “present counsel,” for Humphrey. The petition asserted that trial counsel was ineffective for numerous reasons and that post-verdict motions counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a certain issue in post-verdict motions. In any event, the issue of trial counsel’s effectiveness has been raised at each stage of the proceedings since his representation of Humphrey ceased.

Had counsel thought such a claim was the “same” as a claim of error based on the introduction of evidence of a tacit admission, he clearly should have objected because we forbade the use of evidence of a tacit admission as early as 1967.

Haideman, </em><a href="/citations/?q=284%20A.2d%20757" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="284 A.2d 757">284 A.2d 757</a> (1971) (“Haideman I”). I am therefore enabled to conclude that, absent adequate explanation to the contrary, a lawyer in the situation of trial counsel in this case should raise the issue, inasmuch as it possesses at least <em>“arguable </em>merit.” (Emphasis added.) I cannot accept, however, the additional rationale advanced by the majority that Humphrey’s trial lawyer must be held to have been aware of this Court’s order granting a petition for reargument in <em>Haideman I </em>entered some five months prior to trial in this case.</p>

While ideally the well-prepared lawyer will make inquiry to the prothonotary of this Court as to whether reargument of another case important to him has been sought, I think it is asking too much to charge him with constructive notice of the filing and disposition of such a petition, and to hold him constitutionally ineffective for not making an argument based on the supposition that the reargument effort will be successful. Furthermore, holdings such as today’s will, in my judgment, only serve to make more difficult and complex than they now are the standards for passing judgment on effective trial advocacy. Thus, while I am convinced the result the Court reaches is correct, I do not join in the opinion.</p>
