At a meeting of the Board of Directors, defendants Como, Laupheimer and Weinstein agreed that in order to induce Fried to remain with the corporation, the corporation would offer him a 5% commission on major leases which Fried negotiated, so long as Fried used the commissions to reduce the debt which Fried owed the corporation. In addition, directors Como and Laupheimer agreed to compensate Fried for supervising the renovation and reconstruction of the Farmers Market and to pay him 10% of construction costs for acting as general manager and supervising contractor. Fried remained with the corporation on these terms. Pursuant to these agreements, Fried received approximately $77,375 during 1967 and 1968 in addition to his regular salary. These amounts were used to reduce the debt which Fried owed to the corporation.</p>
