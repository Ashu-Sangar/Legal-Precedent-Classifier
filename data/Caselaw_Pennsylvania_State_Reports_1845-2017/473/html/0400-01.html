Appellant maintains that the notice which was given of the July-25 hearing afforded insufficient time (less than twenty-four hours) to prepare an adequate response. Beyond this general assertion, Taylor does not specify how counsel was hindered in representing him. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Hill, </em><a href="/pa/450/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="450 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1947073" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0477-01">450 Pa. 477</a>, 481, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="301 A.2d 587">301 A.2d 587</a>, 590 (1973) (“shortness of time per se in the preparation of a defense does not constitute ineffective assistance [of counsel]”).</p>
      <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[293,1542,1115,411]]]'>It is of course true that notice of intention to apply to a court for a particular form of relief can be so short as to be no effective notice at all, and that <em>ex parte </em>action pursuant thereto would arguably amount to a denial of procedural due process. Such was not the situation in the case at bar. Here, as not infrequently happens, the entitlement of the Commonwealth to an extension of time under Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(c), required the making of legal argument from facts not in dispute, thus minimizing the necessity for extensive preparation. If, however, appellant’s attorney thought otherwise, it was incumbent upon him to move the hearing court for a continuance to give him more time to prepare.</p>

On September 30, Taylor added a “supplement” to his petition to dismiss, filed the previous day, in which he sought, <em>inter alia, </em>h rehearing on the Commonwealth’s application for extension. In this request, which came nine weeks after the July 25 hearing and seven weeks after the running of the prescribed 180 day period, no explanation was proffered for counsel’s non-appearance at the scheduled hearing. At the subsequent oral argument on the petition to dismiss it was stated in general terms that one day’s notice was insufficient.
