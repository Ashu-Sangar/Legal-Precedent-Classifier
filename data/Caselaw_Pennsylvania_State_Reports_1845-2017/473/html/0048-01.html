    <p id="b96-6" data-blocks='[["BL_96.6",96,[257,1330,1149,419]]]'>The trial court found the will ambiguous in two respects. First, the appellant’s construction of the will which would allow her to take all and leave nothing for the residuary taker would make the residuary clause “pointless” and “impossible of the application.” Second, the failure of the decedent to identify, in the will, the relationship which Mary Hay bore to him constituted an ambiguity.

A divorce, for instance, would have altered the family relationship. Because of the very reasons pointed out by the trial court in its opinion, we are unable to agree with its conclusion that the residuary clause was “pointless” and “impossible of application.”</p>

    <p id="b97-8" data-blocks='[["BL_97.7",97,[185,1277,1151,1060]]]'>We first note that it was undisputed that, except for the testator’s wife, Imelda, no other intestate heirs were alive. Under these circumstances, it was unnecessary to admit any extrinsic evidence to determine the widow’s share. Moreover, even if it had been necessary to admit and consider extrinsic evidence as to what relatives survived the testator in order to ascertain the widow’s share, it does not follow that the door was open for the use of different extrinsic evidence for another purpose. Evidence as to what persons survived the testator is entirely different from evidence to show that the testator intended a disposition other than that plainly provided in the will. Under the trial court’s reasoning, a testator’s will could be changed any time there was a use of terms such as “all my real estate,” “the money in my savings account,” “my issue,” “my surviving children,” “my wife,” “my heirs.” In each of the enumerated cases, extrinsic evidence would be necessary to give effect to the will as written, but that extrinsic evidence would not be admissible to rewrite the will.</p>
