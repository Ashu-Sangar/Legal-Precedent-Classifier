However, both cases are distinguishable.

Appellant also asserts that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor’s representation to the jury during his opening remarks that they would later see a knife that was employed in the first altercation between appellant and the victim. The prosecutor stated that the knife was found in the pocket of the victim. The trial court later ruled that the knife and reference to its discovery in the victim’s pocket were inadmissible. The record indicates, however, that the prosecutor had a reasonable basis to believe that the knife would be admitted. See generally <em>Commonwealth v. Yount, </em><a href="/pa/455/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="455 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="582186" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0303-01">455 Pa. 303</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20242" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="314 A.2d 242">314 A.2d 242</a> (1974). Thus, reference to the knife in the opening statement was not impermissible. See <em>Commonwealth v. Farquharson, </em><a href="/pa/467/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="467 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1717363" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0050-01">467 Pa. 50</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="467 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1717363" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0050-01">354 A.2d 545</a> (1976). Moreover, we fail to see how appellant was prejudiced. There was ample evidence from which the jury could have found that the knife referred to in the opening remarks was taken from appellant by the victim during their first skirmish. This is not a case in which the prosecutor brought a matter to the jury’s attention which is damaging to the accused even though the prosecution fails to substantiate its assertions. If anything, the prosecution’s failure to produce the knife was prejudicial to the Commonwealth in this case.</p>

In post-trial motions, appellant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict, but did not specifically raise the denial of the demurrer as error. In this appeal, appellant argues that his demurrer should have been granted. The test to be applied in ruling on either a demurrer or a claim that the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction is whether accepting as true the prosecution’s evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom, it is sufficient to support a finding by the jury that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em><a href="/pa/443/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="443 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="1936919" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0518-01">443 Pa. 518</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=278%20A.2d%20898" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="278 A.2d 898">278 A.2d 898</a> (1971) and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em><a href="/pa/436/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="436 Pa. 114" data-case-ids="1926051" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0114-01">436 Pa. 114</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=259%20A.2d%20160" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="259 A.2d 160">259 A.2d 160</a> (1969) with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em><a href="/pa/465/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="465 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1712679" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0458-01">465 Pa. 458</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="465 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1712679" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0458-01">350 A.2d 855</a> (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em><a href="/pa/465/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="465 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="1712684" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0442-01">465 Pa. 442</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="465 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="1712684" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0442-01">350 A.2d 847</a> (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em><a href="/pa/448/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="448 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1944656" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0282-01">448 Pa. 282</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20921" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="292 A.2d 921">292 A.2d 921</a> (1972). A demurrer and a claim of insufficiency of the evidence differ only with respect to the stage of the proceedings at which they are raised. Appellant did not offer a defense and his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in post-trial motions was the equivalent of an assertion that the denial of his demurrer was error. To find a waiver because appellant’s brief now frames the issue to be whether the demurrer should have been granted would elevate form over substance. Accordingly, we reject the Commonwealth’s contention that the issue has been waived.</p>
