Mr. <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>Justice White, writing for the Court, held the statute invalid for the same reasons as the replevin statutes considered in <em>Fuentes. </em>The Georgia statute impermissiblyauthorized the seizure of property without notice or hearing. After the seizure, issued by the clerk based only on a conclusory affidavit, the owner was deprived of the property through the course of the litigation. Unlike the Louisiana statute upheld in <em>Mitchell, </em>it did not require a bond by the attaching party, the writ was issued by a clerk based on conclusory allegations, rather than by a judicial officer after review of an affidavit clearly setting forth facts justifying the attachment, and it failed to provide for an immediate hearing after seizure at which the defendant could challenge the grounds on which the writ was issued. <a href="/us/419/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="419 U.S. 601" data-case-ids="6177891" data-case-paths="/us/419/0601-01">419 U.S. at 608</a>, <a href="/us/419/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="419 U.S. 601" data-case-ids="6177891" data-case-paths="/us/419/0601-01">95 S.Ct. at 722</a>.</p>

Act of June 13, 1836, P.L. 568, as amended, 12 P.S. §§ 2861 et seq. (1967), suspended by Pa.R.C.P. 1461, effective October 1,“ 1954. We find this argument unpersuasive. The statutory provisions were suspended by Pa.R.C.P. 1461; the invalidation of the present rules does not revive the suspended statutory provisions. Cf. 1 Pa.C. S.A. § 1956 (Supp.1977) (repeal of an amendatory statute does not revive the corresponding provision or section of the original statute or of any prior amendment); 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1977 (Supp. 1977) (repeal of a repealing statute shall not be construed to revive the statute originally repealed).</p>

See n. 7, supra. Appellees assert that they do not have minimum contacts with Pennsylvania sufficient to justify its exercise of jurisdiction over them. Our disposition renders consideration of this question unnecessary.</p>
