        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellant Jonathan C. Williams was convicted of murder of the third degree on January 28, 1975 after a bench trial. Post-verdict motions were denied and he was sentenced to a term of six to twenty years imprisonment. This appeal followed.\nAppellant claims: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict; (2) the evidence establishes that the killing was in self-defense; (3) the trial court erred in admitting certain testimony under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule; and (4) the trial court erred in admitting certain testimony because its prejudicial nature outweighed its probative value.\nWe have reviewed the record and conclude that appellant\u2019s claims are without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nJONES, Former C. J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nWe hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P. S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1976).",
