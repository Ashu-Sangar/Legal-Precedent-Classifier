        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Clinton Jones a/k/a Clinton Dupree, was tried by a judge and jury and found guilty of murder in the first degree, robbery and criminal conspiracy in connection with the death of Otis Johnson. Postverdict motions were denied and on May 12, 1975, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment in a state correctional institution for the conviction of murder in the first degree, with a concurrent sentence of not less than ten years nor more than twenty years on the robbery conviction, and a suspended sentence on the criminal conspiracy conviction. This appeal from the conviction of murder in the first degree followed.\nAppellant first argues that the charges and indictments against him must be dismissed and he must be discharged because of the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to bring him to trial within two hundred seventy days of the filing of the complaint, pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(a)(1). We do not agree.\nPa.R.Crim.P. 1100(a)(1) provides:\n\u201c(a)(1) Trial in a court case in which a written complaint is filed against the defendant after June 30, 1973 but before July 1, 1974 shall commence no later than two hundred seventy (270) days from the date on which the complaint is filed.\u201d\nThe Comment to Rule 1100, when discussing the method of counting, provides:\n\u201cIt is intended that the number of days set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) be calculated as prescribed by the Act of November 25, 1970, P.L. 707, No. 230, as amended by the Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1339, No. 290, \u00a7 3,1 P.S. \u00a7 1908.\u201d\nSection 1908 of the Statutory Construction Act, supra, provides:\n\u201cWhen any period of time is referrred to in any statute, such period in all cases, except as otherwise provided in section 1909 of this title (relating to publication for successive weeks) and section 1910 of this title (relating to computation of months) shall be so computed as to exclude the first and include the last day of such period. Whenever the last day of any such period shall fall on Saturday or Sunday, or on any day made a legal holiday by the laws of this Commonwealth or of the United States, such day shall be omitted from the computation.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn the instant case, a written complaint against appellant was filed on May 7, 1974. Appellant\u2019s trial was commenced on Monday, February 3, 1975. The two hundred and seventieth day was Saturday, February 1, 1975.\nApplying \u00a7 1908 of the Statutory Construction Act, supra, Saturday, February 1 and Sunday, February 2, 1975, must be \u201comitted\u201d from the computation. Therefore, appellant\u2019s trial commenced within the time limit as set forth in Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(a) (1).\nAppellant next argues that the court below erred in denying his requested point for charge that voluntary manslaughter was a permissible verdict. We agree.\nIn Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 563, 319 A.2d 142 (1974), this court required: \u201cthat henceforth a defendant under indictment of murder will be entitled upon request, to have the jury advised of its power to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d (Opinion in support of affirmance by Mr. Justice Nix, joined by Mr. Justice Eagen, now Mr. Chief Justice, and Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien.)\nIn the instant case, appellant\u2019s trial began on February 3, 1975, nine months after the mandate of Jones, supra.\nAppellant requested that the court charge that murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter were permissible verdicts in the instant case. The court refused this point for charge. The court did, however, \u201cdiscuss\u201d voluntary manslaughter in two portions of its charge wherein it stated:\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s clear from the evidence and I believe it\u2019s clear from counsel\u2019s arguments to you, that there is no manslaughter in the ease. Although I will simply define voluntary manslaughter to you when I get to it. But it\u2019s clear under the facts that it doesn\u2019t apply, and it certainly doesn\u2019t apply to involuntary manslaughter, which I will not even cover.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\u201cThere is another definition which I will give you, although I believe that it\u2019s clear that it does not apply to the facts of this case. But there is some belief in the law that since this is part of the definition of criminal homicide, that the jury should have the definition anytvay. And that is voluntary manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter is defined as follows: A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation, either by the individual killed or by another whom the actor endeavors to kill, or if he had \u2014 well, I\u2019ll stop with that. That is the definition of voluntary manslaughter, which is part of the definition of criminal homicide, but I believe it is clear that it does not apply to this case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThe above charge does not advise the jury that voluntary manslaughter is a permissible verdict and, therefore, such an omission by the trial court constitutes reversible error. The mere mentioning of voluntary manslaughter to a jury without defining the elements of crime and without informing the jury that it has the power to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter is in direct contradiction of our mandate in Commonwealth v. Jones, supra.\nThe instant case is distinguishable from Commonwealth v. Gaddy, 468 Pa. 303, 362 A.2d 217 (1976) and Commonwealth v. Yount, 455 Pa. 303, 314 A.2d 242 (1974). The trials in both Gaddy, supra, and Yount, supra, were conducted prior to this court\u2019s mandate of Commonwealth v. Jones, supra. Moreover, in both cases, the trial dourt did instruct the jury that voluntary manslaughter was a permissible verdict but then proceeded to express its opinion as to whether the facts could support a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\nAppellant raises other allegations of error which we need not discuss because of our resolution of the above issue.\nJudgment of sentence reversed and case remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia for a new trial.\nJONES, former C. J., took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nROBERTS, J., files a concurring opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joins.\nPOMEROY, J., joins in the opinion of the Court and files a separate concurring opinion in which NIX, J., joins.\n. No appeal has been taken to this court from the robbery or criminal conspiracy convictions and they remain.",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\nconcurring.\nI agree with the majority that the trial court improperly denied appellant a jury instruction that voluntary manslaughter was a permissible verdict. See Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 563, 319 A.2d 142 (1974). In addition, I believe that the trial court exceeded the permissible bounds of judicial comment and improperly impinged upon the exclusive province of the jury when it expressed its opinion that voluntary manslaughter was clearly not applicable to the case. This expression of opinion as to the degree of appellant\u2019s guilt deprived him of a fair trial. Commonwealth v. Archambault, 448 Pa. 90, 290 A.2d 72 (1972). Thus I agree with the majority that appellant is entitled to a new trial.\nAppellant requested the court to charge the jury that murder of the first degree, murder of the second degree, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter were permissible verdicts. Although the court refused this charge, it did discuss voluntary manslaughter in its charge to the jury. The court stated:\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s clear from the evidence and I believe it\u2019s clear from counsel\u2019s arguments to you, that there is no manslaughter in the case. Although I will simply define voluntary manslaughter to you when I get to it. But it\u2019s clear under the facts that it doesn\u2019t apply, and it certainly doesn\u2019t apply to involuntary manslaughter, which I will not even cover.\u201d (emphasis added)\n* \u2021 * $ * $ $ *\n\u201cThere is another definition which I will give you, although I believe that it\u2019s clear that it does not apply to the facts of this case. But there is some belief in the law that since this is part of the definition of criminal homicide, that the jury should have the definition anyway. And that is voluntary manslaughter. Voluntary Manslaughter is defined as follows: A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation, either by the individual killed or by another whom the actor endeavors to kill, or if he had \u2014 well, I\u2019ll stop with that. That is the definition of voluntary manslaughter, which is part of the definition of criminal homicide, but I believe it is clear that it does not apply to this case.\u201d (Emphasis added)\nContrary to the trial court\u2019s charge, voluntary manslaughter would have been an appropriate verdict in this case. First, our cases establish that voluntary manslaughter is by definition a lesser included offense of murder. Second, a jury pursuant to its inherent mercy dispensing power, may, from sympathy or awareness of extenuating circumstances, find a defendant guilty of a lesser offense than the evidence could support.\nThus, in every prosecution for murder, a jury may return, and the court must accept, a verdict of voluntary manslaughter even in the absence of any evidence of voluntary manslaughter. Although voluntary manslaughter is defined in terms of provocation, heat of passion and imperfect self-defense, the defendant has no burden to introduce such factors before a voluntary manslaughter verdict is permissible. Voluntary manslaughter is a permissible verdict whether or not the defendant presents a defense.\nIn Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 568, 319 A.2d 142 (1974), all six Justices who participated agreed that after the date Jones was filed, a trial court must give a requested charge on voluntary manslaughter in every murder trial, even though there is no evidence of voluntary manslaughter. Two opinions were filed. In the Opinion in Support of Affirmance, three Justices reasoned that this Court, pursuant to its supervisory power, should adopt the \u201crule that henceforth a defendant under indictment of murder will be entitled, upon request, to have the jury advised of its power to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d 457 Pa. at 573-74, 319 A.2d at 148 (emphasis in original). In the Opinion in Support of Reversal, three Justices asserted that the failure to give a requested charge on voluntary manslaughter worked a deprivation of due process and equal protection in view of the jury\u2019s unquestioned power in all murder prosecutions to return a voluntary manslaughter verdict. 457 Pa. at 577, 319 A.2d at 150.\nAppellant\u2019s trial occurred after Jones. He requested a charge that voluntary manslaughter was a permissible verdict. The court\u2019s instruction that \u201cthere is some belief in the law that since this is part of the definition of criminal homicide, that the jury should have the definition anyway\u201d did not adequately inform the jury that voluntary manslaughter was a permissible verdict. The Court\u2019s statements that \u201cthere is no manslaughter in this case\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s clear under the facts that it [voluntary manslaughter] doesn\u2019t apply\u201d indicate that the court was of the opinion that voluntary manslaughter was not a permissible verdict. Thus, the import of the jury instructions, read in their entirety, was that voluntary manslaughter was not a permissible verdict. I therefore agree with the majority that appellant is entitled to a new trial.\nNot only did the trial court fail to inform the jury that voluntary manslaughter was a permissible verdict, but its expression of personal opinion concerning the degree of appellant\u2019s degree of guilt exceeded the bounds of proper judicial comment.\nAlthough this Court has recognized the duty of the trial judge to aid the jury in understanding and clarifying the issues to be resolved, his or her charge should be a calm and dispassionate one. Commonwealth v. Trunk, 311 Pa. 555, 565-66, 167 A. 333, 337 (1933). The jury depends on the trial judge for guidance and it will undoubtedly give great weight to any expressions of personal opinion that he or she makes. Commonwealth v. Archambault, 448 Pa. 90, 290 A.2d 72 (1972); Commonwealth v. Myma, 278 Pa. 505, 123 A. 486 (1924). Thus, in order to preserve a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, the trial judge must be careful to remain absolutely impartial, and not invade the province of the jury in reaching its ultimate decision. Commonwealth v. Archambault, supra; Commonwealth v. Myma, supra.\nThe trial judge\u2019s instruction here, that voluntary manslaughter clearly did not apply to the case, communicated to the jury that if it determined that appellant committed the homicide, it should find that the appellant committed murder and that it should not exercise its power to lessen the crime to voluntary manslaughter because no extenuating circumstances existed to justify such action. This improperly impinged upon the exclusive province of the jury.\nIn Archambault, this Court, after considering the need for judicial impartiality, held that a trial judge must never express to the jury his or her personal view of guilt or innocence no matter how overwhelming the evidence of guilt. We stated:\n\u201cAn expression by the judge that in his opinion the accused is guilty leaves an indelible imprint on the minds of the jury. The jury is undoubtedly going to attribute to the judge, because of his experience in criminal cases, special expertise in determining guilt or innocence. As Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Kephart stated for this Court: \u2018The judge occupies an exalted and dignified position; he is the one person whom the jury, with rare exceptions, looks for guidance, and from whom litigants expect absolute impartiality. An expression indicative of favor or condemnation is quickly reflected in the jury box. .\nTo depart from the clear line of duty through questions, expressions or conduct, contravenes the orderly administration of justice. It has the tendency to take from one of the parties the right to a fair and impartial trial, as guaranteed under our system of jurisprudence.\u2019 [Commonwealth v. Myma, 278 Pa. 505, 508, 123 A. 486, 487 (1924).]\u201d\n448 Pa. at 95, 290 A.2d at 75; see Commonwealth v. Motley, 448 Pa. 110, 289 A.2d 724 (1972); ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Function of the Trial Judge \u00a7 5.6(a) (Approved Draft, 1972) (\u201cThe trial judge should not express or otherwise indicate to the jury his personal opinion whether the defendant is guilty or express an opinion that certain testimony is worthy or unworthy of belief.\u201d)\nThese same considerations apply with equal force to trial judges\u2019 opinions concerning a defendant\u2019s degree of guilt. The jury\u2019s verdict necessarily includes not only a determination of guilt or innocence but also a determination of the degree of guilt if the defendant is found guilty. The latter decision is often as important as the former, particularly in murder cases. As Mr. Justice Powell, speaking for a unanimous Supreme Court, recently stated:\n\u201cThe safeguards of due process are not rendered unavailing simply because a determination may already have been reached that would stigmatize the defendant and that might lead to a significant impairment of personal liberty. The fact remains that the consequences resulting from a verdict of murder, as compared with a verdict of manslaughter differ significantly.\u201d\nMullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 698, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 1889, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). Our constitutional system of trial by jury is founded upon the firm belief that the highest quality of criminal justice is achieved when the jury retains the sole power to determine both guilt or innocence and the degree of guilt if guilt is found.\nThus, because of his or her influence over the jury, an opinion by the trial judge that a voluntary manslaughter verdict is clearly not applicable effectively removes that potential verdict from the jury\u2019s deliberations. This is a prohibited invasion of the province of the jury and denies appellant his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury. See Commonwealth v. Archambault, supra.\nX agree with the majority that the judgment of sentence should be reversed and a new trial granted.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this concurring opinion.\n. I also agree with the majority\u2019s resolution of appellant\u2019s Rule 1100 claim.\n. The Commonwealth contends that appellant is not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction because he did not request such an instruction as required by Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 563, 319 A.2d 142 (1974). The Commonwealth concedes that appellant requested a charge that murder of the first degree, murder of the second degree, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter were permissible verdicts. I think that this request is sufficient to require an instruction that voluntary manslaughter is a permissible verdict. In post-trial motions and in this appeal, appellant asserts that the trial court\u2019s comments that voluntary manslaughter was not applicable to the case were improper. In light of his prior request for an instruction, I believe that appellant has preserved the claim that he was entitled to an instruction that voluntary manslaughter was a permissible verdict under Commonwealth v. Jones, supra.\n. Commonwealth v. Cain, 471 Pa. 140, 174, 369 A.2d 1234, 1251 (1977) (Opinion in Support of Reversal); Commonwealth v.

A voluntary mar slaughter defense must be carefully distinguished from ordinary affirmative defenses. In the latter, although the defendant has no burden to show the defense is valid, some evidence must be presented to place the defense at issue before he or she is entitled to any instruction. See Commonwealth v. Kichline, 468 Pa. 265, 361 A.2d 282 (1976); Commonwealth v. Rose, 457 Pa. 380, 321 A.2d 880 (1974). Here appellant is entitled to an instruction that voluntary manslaughter is a permissible verdict, and appellant has no burden to present evidence of provocation, heat of passion or imperfect self-defense.\n. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, ten judges sitting en banc over a single dissent (Kalodner, J.), held in United States ex rel. Matthews v. Johnson, 503 F.2d 339 (3d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 952, 95 S.Ct. 1336, 43 L.Ed.2d 430 (1975), that due process requires that voluntary manslaughter instructions be given, if requested by the defense, in every murder trial:\n\u201cTo hold otherwise is to expose a defendant to the idiosyncracies of the trial judge to whom the case has been assigned, or the \u2018whim and caprice\u2019 of a given judge on a given day.\u201d\n503 F.2d at 346.\n. Section 6.4 of the ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Function of the Trial Judge (Approved Draft, 1972) states that \u201c[tjhe trial judge should be the exemplar of dignity and impartiality.\u201d The Commentary, at 81, notes:\n\u201c \u2018It is a matter of common knowledge that jurors hang tenaciously upon remarks made by the court during the progress of the trial, and if, perchance, they are enabled to discover the views of the court regarding the effect of a witness\u2019 testimony or the merits of the case, they almost invariably follow them.\u2019 \u201d\nQuoting State v. Philpot, 97 Iowa 365, 369, 66 N.W. 730, 732 (1896).\nMany commentators have noted the importance juries place on the opinions and attitudes of the trial judge. See e. g., Conner, The Trial Judge, His Facial Expressions, Gestures and General Demeanor \u2014 Their Effect on the Administration of Justice, 6 Am. Crim.L.Q. 175, 176 (1968); Frankel, The Search for Truth: An Umpireal View, 123 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1031, 1041-45 (1975); O\u2019Mara, Standard Jury Charges \u2014 Findings of Pilot Project, 43 Pa.Bar Ass\u2019n.Q. 166, 173 (1972).\n. The majority states that this case is distinguishable from Commonwealth v. Gaddy, 468 Pa. 303, 362 A.2d 217 (1976) (plurality opinion) and Commonwealth v. Yount, 455 Pa. 303, 314 A.2d 242 (1974) because the trials in Gaddy and Yount occurred prior to our opinion in Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 563, 319 A.2d 142 (1974). I cannot agree that this distinction has any significance. Even before Jones, in every prosecution for murder, the jury could return, and the court had to accept, a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, even in the absence of any evidence of voluntary manslaughter. E. g., Commonwealth v. Hill, 444 Pa. 323, 326, 281 A.2d 859, 860 (1971); Commonwealth v. Hoffman, 439 Pa. 348, 356-57, 266 A.2d 726, 730-31 (1970). Although a majority of this Court, prior to Jones, accepted the view that a trial court had discretion whether to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter in the absence of any evidence of voluntary manslaughter, e. g. Commonwealth v. Kenney, 449 Pa. 562, 297 A.2d 794 (1972), our cases established that voluntary manslaughter was a permissible verdict in every murder trial. Commonwealth v. Hill, supra. Therefore, if a trial judge expresses his or her opinion to the jury that voluntary manslaughter is not applicable or that it is not a permissible verdict, it is improper whether the trial occurred before or after Jones.\nHowever, I agree with the majority that this case is distinguishable from Commonwealth v. Gaddy, 468 Pa. 303, 362 A.2d 217 (1976) and Commonwealth v. Yount, 455 Pa. 303, 314 A.2d 242 (1974). In Yount, the trial judge commented that, assuming the jury found that appellant maliciously killed the victim, he could not recall any evidence of extenuating circumstances to reduce the crime to voluntary manslaughter. The judge, however, stated that voluntary manslaughter was an \u201centirely permissible verdict\u201d and \u201cdid not . . . suggest that the jury return any particular verdict.\u201d Id. at 319, 314 A.2d at 251. We noted:\n\u201cThe court . . gave the jury a full, complete, adequate and correct charge . . . . The charge read in its entirety, removed nothing from the province of the jury nor did not contain any judicial expression of guilt.\u201d\nId. Thus, the comments in Yount, unlike the comments here, did not amount to an opinion that voluntary manslaughter was not an appropriate verdict which effectively removed that permissible verdict from the jury\u2019s deliberations.\nIn Commonwealth v. Gaddy, 468 Pa. 303, 320, 362 A.2d 217, 225 (1976), the plurality opinion found that the charge was undistinguishable from Yount:\n\u201cWhile informing the jury that in his opinion no facts existed to support a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, the trial court fully informed the jury on its ability to return such a verdict; specifically told them that only their recollection of the facts controlled; and stated that they were the sole finders of facts.\u201d\n. In Commonwealth v. Archambault, 448 Pa. 90, 92, 290 A.2d 72, 73 (1972), we held that the trial court\u2019s comment that \u201cit would be a miscarriage of justice to find [the] defendant not guilty\u201d was improper even though it might arguably aid the jury in its deliberations. However helpful the judge\u2019s comments may be, he or she may not express his or her opinion concerning the guilt or degree of guilt of the defendant, decisions which must be left to the jury.",

In doing so, however, the court must make it clear that voluntary manslaughter is nevertheless a permissible verdict. See Commonwealth v. Gaddy, 468 Pa. 308, 317-320, 362 A.2d 217, 224-225, and cases there cited. As we there stated,\n\u201cWhile informing the jury that in his opinion no facts existed to support a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, the trial court fully informed the jury of its ability to return such a verdict; specifically told them that onlyotheir recollection of the facts controlled; and stated that they were the sole finders of facts. Such a circumscribed statement cannot be said to have impermissibly infringed upon the jury\u2019s function. See American Bar Association Standards Relating to Trial by Jury, \u00a7 4.7 (Approved Draft, 1968).\u201d\nAs the opinion of the Court states, the trial judge in the case at bar nowhere told the jury that a voluntary manslaughter verdict was within its power to return. Indeed, he implied the contrary. This was error which requires that this appellant be granted a new trial.\nNIX, J., joins in this concurring opinion.\nMr. Justice ROBERTS filed a dissenting opinion on another ground, in which he was joined by Justices NIX and MANDERINO. Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) EAGEN concurred in the result.",
