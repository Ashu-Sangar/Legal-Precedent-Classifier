He asks that the Court change the law so as to substitute a subjective test rather than an objective test in determining whether there was \u201cserious provocation\u201d.\nAfter the court below gave consideration to psychiatric evidence it concluded that the objective standard had to be used, referring to the statutory definition of \u201cserious provocation\u201d as \u201cConduct sufficient to excite an intense passion in a reasonable person,\u201d Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2301, and citing Commonwealth v. McCusker, 448 Pa. 382, 292 A.2d 286 (1972), and Commonwealth v. Outlen, 447 Pa. 195, 290 A.2d 253 (1972).\nThe statute is clear and unambiguous. No constitutional issue has been raised. The statute must control.\nJudgment affirmed.\nThe court below also expressed the view that, even if the subjective test were used, the evidence was insufficient to show the requisite degree of passion.",
