Appellant relies on the words “demised premises” and argues that this refers to the land and land alone. These words are subject to a variety of meanings depending on the context in which they are employed, though ordinarily they connote both the land and the building and improvements thereon. The construction urged by appellant would interpret the words “demised premises” to mean the land itself. But one cannot “tear down” land or “remove” land, though one can remove soil <em>from the land. </em>And while one may “alter” the grade of land or excavate upon the land, it is an awkward usage at best to speak of altering land qua land when what is meant is altering the contour, grade or other characteristic <em>of </em>land.</p>

The words “tear down and remove” clearly have reference to buildings or structures as the subject matter to which the prohibition of Section 2.4 applies. Inasmuch as the word “alter” is used in association with them, it, too, is to be construed as having the same reference; that is to say, that those things which could not be substantially altered were the very same things that could be neither torn down nor removed. The ancient maxim “noscitur a sociis” summarizes the rule that the meaning of words may be indicated or controlled by those words with <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>which they are associated.

We note that the lease is a long term one of which forty-five years still remained at the commencement of this proceeding. We note further the absence of any “purpose” clause stating any specific purpose or purposes for which the premises are to be used. On the contrary, the lease contains a clause stating for what purposes the premises may <em>not </em>be used. Section 2.8 provides: “Tenant will not use or occupy, or suffer or permit any person or body to use or occupy the said premises, or any part thereof, for any purpose or use in violation of any law, statute or ordinance whether Federal, State or Municipal, during the term of said Lease or any renewal thereof.” Since the lease expressly states the purposes for which the premises can not be used, and since it is silent as to the specific purposes for which the premises were to be used, it is clear that the premises can be used by the tenant for any and all lawful purposes. Indeed this is the general rule even if we ignore Section 2.8. “Where a lease is general in its provisions and terms and expresses nothing as to the mode in which the lessee is to use or occupy the premises, he is clothed with full power and right to occupy and use the land demised in the same manner that the owner might have done and for any lawful purpose or business which does not injure the reversion . . . .” 32 Am.
