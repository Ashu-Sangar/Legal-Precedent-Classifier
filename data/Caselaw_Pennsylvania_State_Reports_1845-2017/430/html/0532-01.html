The police officer testified that after hearing Hughes’s statement implicating Jefferson, Jefferson “stated that he was glad it was all over; he was glad that he was apprehended. He said he was tired of running—he was afraid every minute.”</p>

Jefferson contends that his reply was an equivocal one and therefore at most could only be regarded as a tacit admission quoting from 112 U. of Pa. Law Review 226: “. . . the tacit admission rule may also be invoked if the accused responds not with silence but with words somewhere between a denial and an express acquiescence.”, and adding that such a tacit admission was proscribed by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>. In making this argument, Jefferson relies on <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Shadd v. </em>Myers, <a href="/pa/423/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="423 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="1903178" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0082-01">423 Pa. 82</a>, where this Court held that an accused’s failure to deny, or his silence in the face of accusatory statements made <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>in his presence, could not, under the <em>Miranda </em>decision any longer be used against him, “previous decisions of this Court to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[132,580,1149,958]]]'>However, this Court also stated in that case that the proscription against the use of tacit admissions as evidence was not to be applied retroactively. To this Jefferson answers that the proscription, if applied in his case would not amount to a retroactive application because the judgment in his case was not finalized as of the date of the <em>Miranda </em>decision—June 13, 1966— because he still had the right to appeal since he had been unlawfully deprived of that right, as found by the lower court which had allowed him to appeal nunc pro tunc. In support of this argument, Jefferson cites <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Staino v. Cavell, </em><a href="/pa/425/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="425 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1906736" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0365-01">425 Pa. 365</a>, where this Court stated: “Hence it logically follows from Tehan that the ruling banning the evidentiary use of ‘tacit admissions,’ first explicated in Miranda, need only be applied to those cases wherein the judgment was not finalized as of the date Miranda was announced.”</p>

A phrase applied to acts allowed to be done after the time they should be done . . . with the same effect <em>as if it were done when it should have been done.” </em>Thus, whatever Jefferson is entitled to on appeal is what he was entitled to, had the appeal been taken at its proper time. The delay in the taking of his appeal, even though not the result of his own fault, however, cannot enlarge <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>those rights so as to permit him to obtain an advantage which would not have been his to attain, had the appeal been taken at its proper time. Jefferson’s rights must be determined by the law that existed when appeal was open to him.

On appeal, this Court remanded the record “for a hearing solely to determine if the appellant effectively waived his right to. the assistance of counsel in the prosecution of the new trial motion and appeal from the judgment,” stating (p. 88) : “Therefore, after consideration of the purpose of the rule announced in Miranda, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">supra,</a> concerning evidence of Tacit admissions,’ the reliance placed upon this Court’s rulings in regard thereto for nearly a century and the obvious effect of its retroactive application on the administration of justice, we rule that it need not and will not be applied retroactively in Pennsylvania.” It was thus clearly indicated that even if the lower court had determined Shadd had the right to appeal, the appeal could not be governed by the <em>Miranda </em>decision.</p>

In this connection he cites <em>Commonwealth v. Dravecz, </em><a href="/citations/?q=424%20Pa.%20588" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="424 Pa. 588">424 Pa. 588</a>. However, the term “tacit admission” in that case was limit<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>ed to an admission implied from silence in the face of an accusatory statement; the entire reasoning of the opinion demonstrates that it was based on the injustice of having a man’s silence create evidence against him. At that time this Court was not faced with the definition of “tacit admission” as including an equivocal reply. Thus, the defendant cannot ask us here to expand that meaning to include an equivocal reply and then also ask us to apply a decision, the reasoning of which was clearly based on a meaning not so enlarged.</p>
    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[134,1034,1146,368]]]'>An equivocal reply cannot be equated with a forced confession by reason of silence. In the latter case, the accused’s silence should not be permitted as evidence of a confession because by his silence he clearly does not intend a confession. However, when an accused makes an equivocal reply which is a voluntary act on his part, the reasoning is bound to be different.</p>

Any action short of a denial made the accusation admissible. <em>Commonwealth v. Vallone, </em><a href="/pa/347/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="347 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1217339" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0419-01">347 Pa. 419</a>, 421, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20889" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="32 A.2d 889">32 A. 2d 889</a>, 890 (1943) leaves no doubt that this failure to deny was the basis for evidentiary use of a confederate’s inculpatory statement: “The rule of evidence is well established that, when a statement made in the presence and hearing of a person is incriminating in character and naturally calls for a <em>denial </em>but is not challenged or contradicted by the accused although he has opportunity and liberty to speak, the statement and the fact of his <em>failure to demy </em>it are admissible in evidence as an implied admission of the truth of the charges thus made. The justification of this rule is to be sought in the age-long experience of mankind that ordinarily an innocent person will spontaneously repel false accusations against him, and that a failure to do so is therefore some indication of guilt.” (Emphasis supplied.) See Developments in the Law—Confessions, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20935" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="79 Harv. L. Rev. 935">79 Harv. L.

That Jefferson said something short of admitting the truth of his alleged conspirator’s declarations rather than nothing is immaterial for, so long as he did not deny the accusations, the tacit admission rule applied. What Mr. Justice <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>Musmanno has said is that Jefferson would have been better off had he remained silent. Why this should be true when the basis for admitting Hughes’ statement was Jefferson’s failure to deny it, not his failure to remain silent, is nowhere explained.
