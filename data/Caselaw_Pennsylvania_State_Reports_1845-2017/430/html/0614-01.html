Alenovitz, Jean E. Alenovitz, his wife, Clement Alenovitz and Elizabeth Alenovitz, his wife, in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, praying for an injunction enjoining the defendants from operating, establishing or constructing a trailer park on three tracts of land (about twenty-three acres) located in the Township of Honey Brook and to remove all facilities and equipment placed on the premises. A preliminary hearing was <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>held on November 7, 1966 and a preliminary injunction was granted that same day. A final hearing was held on February 14, 1967 and a decree nisi granting the permanent injunction was ordered on September 29, 1967. Exceptions were filed and the decree nisi was entered as a final decree on January 25, 1968. From that final decree this appeal was taken.</p>

The petition expressed opposition to the enactment of the proposed zoning ordinance and requested that it not be enacted into law. On the evening of June 2, 1966, between 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., the supervisors, despite the filing of the protest, enacted the zoning ordinance. By virtue of that zoning ordinance, the land owned and leased by appellants, the subject of this action, was zoned “Farm Residential.” Under the ordinance, trailer parks were permitted only in districts zoned “Neighborhood Commercial”, when allowed by special exception.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

However, by June 2, 1966, appellants had spent only $2,000 on construction of the proposed trailer park, although the total contemplated cost was between $300,000 and $400,000. On April 7, 1966 appellants applied to the township supervisors for a trailer park license. By letter dated October 11, 1966, the township supervisors, through their duly authorized agent, advised appellants that the application was denied. The reasons assigned in the letter for the refusal were the failure to comply with §7(k) of the trailer park ordinance, the failure to pay the license fees on other parks owned by appellants, and in general, a lack of good faith. Section 7(k) requires, in the case of trailer parks not established prior to the adoption of the comprehensive plan for the preparation of a zoning ordinance for Honey Brook Township, that a statement accompany the application for establishing a trailer park stating that the premises proposed to be occupied by the trailer park are located entirely within a district in which the establishment of trailer parks is to be permitted.</p>

In the first place, we are of the opinion that the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance cannot be raised in this equity proceeding. In <em>Jacobs v. Fetzer, </em><a href="/pa/381/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="381 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1258890" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0262-01">381 Pa. 262</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20356" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="112 A.2d 356">112 A. 2d 356</a> (1955), this Court indicated that questions involving the constitutionality of zoning ordinances should not be heard by courts of equity, but should be tested through the ordinary zoning channels— application to the board of adjustment, in the first <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>instance, for relief, followed by an appeal to the common pleas court from the board’s denial of relief. It is true that <em>Jacobs v. Fetzer, </em>supra, was a case in which the aggrieved property-owner, rather than the municipality, brought the equity action. Nonetheless, it expressed the view that the property owner should proceed through normal zoning channels. Here, appellants took no appeal from the denial by the board of supervisors of their application for a trailer park permit, and thus failed properly to raise the issue of the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance.</p>

The same presumption of constitutional validity that attends an act of the legislature is equally applicable to municipal ordinances whether they be enacted by the council of a city, town, or borough or by the commissioners or supervisors of a township. <em>Nat. Land &amp; I. Co. v. Easttown Twp.

That presumption has been expressed as follows: “An Act of Assembly will not be declared unconstitutional unless it <em>clearly, palpably, </em>and <em>plainly </em>violates the Constitution.” <em>Daly v.

Appellants have come nowhere near meeting this burden. They rely heavily on <em>Exton Quarries, Inc. v. Zoning Bd. of Adj., </em><a href="/pa/425/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="425 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="1906748" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0043-01">425 Pa. 43</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=228%20A.2d%20169" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="228 A.2d 169">228 A. 2d 169</a> (1967). That case is inapposite here. In <em>Exton, </em>we held that a zoning ordinance which <em>totally excludes </em>a particular business from an entire municipality must bear a more substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare than an ordinance which merely confines that business to a certain area in the municipality. Even in <em>Exton, </em>we stated that the ordinance was still presumed to be con<a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>stitutional. In the instant case there is no total exclusion. On the contrary, the trailer parks are permitted in four “Neighborhood Commercial” districts. The mere assertion that these areas are small hardly overcomes the presumption of constitutionality. Nor is there any showing that appellants’ land is unsuited for the purposes for which it has been zoned. Appellants’ proof falls far short of establishing any claim of unconstitutional spot zoning.</p>

As to the first contention, we again agree with the chancellor’s reasoning. Under The Second Class Township Code, supra, §702, cl. xxix, 53 P.S. §65729, the township is empowered: “To make such regulations, by ordinance, not inconsistent with State laws and regulations, as may be necessary for the promotion of the health, cleanliness, comfort and safety of the citizens of the township.” The chancellor held, and we agree, that the trailer park ordinance is a valid health and safety ordinance wholly independent of zoning.</p>

Once again appellants have failed to meet that burden. The instant trailer park ordinance is a valid exercise of the police powers in regulating sewage, water supply, fire hazards, electrical hazards, roadways, minimum lot sizes, and similar matters. In fact, the ordinance is remarkably similar to that upheld in <em>Palumbo Appeal, </em><a href="/pa-super/166/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="166 Pa.

A similar ordinance was considered by our own Court in <em>Cloverleaf T. S. Co. v. Pleasant Hills Boro., </em><a href="/pa/366/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="366 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="8845158" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0116-01">366 Pa. 116</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20872" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="76 A.2d 872">76 A. 2d 872</a> (1950), where all parties conceded that the trailer park ordinance was a regulatory measure in the interest of public health, safety, morals and welfare and a valid exercise of the police power. It is.virtually inconceivable to us that at this late date appellants and the mobilehome industry could contend that trailer parks are not a proper classification to regulate and that an ordinance like the instant one is not a valid exercise of the police power.

They point to the reason stated in the denial of the permit that appellants had been uncooperative in the past, and to the fact that a permit for a trailer park was granted on May 6, 1966, after the date of appellants’ application. Actually, uncooperativeness was only one of a number of reasons given for the denial, and a perfectly valid reason was failure to comply with §7(k) of the trailer park ordinance, which required the statement that the proposed use was not violative of proposed zoning. Section 7(k) was only applicable, however, after a comprehensive plan had been adopted. The application granted on May 6, 1966 was made on March 4, 1966, whereas appellants’ application was <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>made on April 7, 1966. The comprehensive plan was adopted between March 4 and April <em>7, </em>thereby distinguishing the two cases. Since the cases are clear that a municipality may properly refuse a building permit for a land use repugnant to a pending and later lawfully enacted zoning ordinance even though the application for the permit is made when the intended use conforms to existing regulations, <em>Aberman, Inc. v.

As the chancellor pointed out, such a principle could only apply with regard to the zoning ordinance, for it is totally in-apposite to enforcement of a trailer park ordinance. The court below held, and appellee argues, that on the authority of dictum in <em>Philadelphia v. Budney, </em><a href="/pa/396/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="396 Pa. 87" data-case-ids="1284856" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0087-01">396 Pa. 87</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.2d%20780" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="151 A.2d 780">151 A. 2d 780</a> (1959), the defense of nonconforming use cannot be raised at all in an equity action. <em>Budney </em>was a case where the City brought an action to enjoin the operation of a junkyard as violative of a zoning ordinance. Defendant set up the defense of nonconforming use. The Court held that he had already litigated the matter when he applied to the board of adjustment for a variance or a permit for a nonconforming use, and appealed from the board to the court of common pleas. Yet the court pointed out that it would have made no difference even if the defendant had not sought the variance or permit. The Court stated, at page 89: “. . . However, even if appellant had never sought a variance, he could not raise the defense of a nonconforming use in a proceeding in equity. The legislature has provided that zoning matters are to be heard exclusively by administrative tribunals which were created for that express purpose. Baederwood Center, Inc. v. Putney, <a href="/pa/390/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="390 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1275689" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0053-01">390 Pa. 53</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=133%20A.2d%20836" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="133 A.2d 836">133 A. </a><a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a><a href="/citations/?q=133%20A.2d%20836" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="133 A.2d 836">2d 836</a> (1957); Pittsburgh Outdoor Advertising Company v.

After determination by the administrative agency, the most effective way a zoning ordinance can be enforced is through an equity action. If we were to permit a person, sought to be restrained from violating the ordinance, to introduce testimony of a nonconforming use, we would have equity courts replacing boards of adjustment. Instead of people seeking to enforce their rights through the proper administrative procedures, we would have them continue to violate the ordinances waiting for the city to bring an equity action . . .”.</p>

      <em>Budney, </em>however, is not controlling in the instant case. The precise issue involved here was considered in <em>Buckingham Township v.

D. &amp; C. 2d 274</a> (1960). The court in that case pointed out that the Buckingham Township Zoning Ordinance, unlike that involved in <em>Budney, </em>contained no provisions for the registration of nonconforming uses, and required permits only for new uses or changes in use occurring after the effective date of the ordinance. The Buckingham ordinance provided no administrative machinery whereby the defendants’ right to continue the same nonconforming use might be determined. Thus, the court concluded that the property owner was entitled to raise the defense of nonconforming use in the equity action, for there was no other way for the matter to be litigated. The instant ordinance, like that in <em>Buckingham, </em>also contains no provisions for registration or permits for nonconforming uses.

He told the board of supervisors he was going ahead with the work regardless of whether he got the approval or whether he didn’t. He testified that when he came in with the application on April 7, 1966, there was no hurry and that he was not going to do any work <em>for a feto years. </em>He further said that he realized the township was putting in zoning or trying to and that he wanted a permit before this was done. Further, that he had no intention of starting any of the work for a few years if he got the permit and that if he did not get the permit he was going to rush in and move on the trailers. George Alenovitz’s father, Olement Alenovitz, one of the appellants, testified that “We wanted to establish it. We wanted permit or license, whatever you call it, to establish it. And after we establish it we are not going to go at it too fast.” He further testified that he wanted to get that license so he could get in before any zoning was passed.</p>
