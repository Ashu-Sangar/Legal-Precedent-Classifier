The defendants are Glenshaw Glass Company, manufacturer of the bottle, Pittsburgh Brewing Company, the bottler of the beer, and Abraham Kronzek, the distributor who sold the beer to-plaintiff. Suit was begun in assumpsit, based on breach of warranty, and in trespass, based on Section 402A of the Restatement 2d, Torts, which was adopted by this Court in <em>Webb v. Zern, </em><a href="/pa/422/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="422 Pa. 424" data-case-ids="1901701" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0424-01">422 Pa. 424</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20858" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="220 A.2d 858">220 A. 2d 858</a> (1966). Before trial, plaintiff was required to elect between the two forms and he proceeded to trial on the trespass action. The jury verdict favored defendants. Plaintiff’s motion for a new trial was denied. Judgment was entered on the verdict and this' appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.8",209,[130,1514,1156,766]]]'>Plaintiff testified that about one month prior to the accident four cases of Iron City Beer, bottled by Pittsburgh Brewing Company, were delivered to his tavern by Abraham Kronzek. Kronzek stacked them in a storeroom at the rear of the tavern. On the afternoon of July 2, 1964, plaintiff went to the storeroom to get a warm bottle of Iron City Beer for a customer. He lifted the cardboard top on one of the four cases and picked up a bottle. According to plaintiff’s testimony, the bottle spontaneously exploded in his hand. He denied striking the bottle in any way. After the alleged explosion, plaintiff dropped the bottle fragments, took a handkerchief from his pocket, held it over his injured eye and went for medical treatment.</p>

He considered this variation so extreme that in his opinion the bottle was defective. Then the following exchange occurred between Dr. Anderson and plaintiff’s counsel: “Q. Doctor, have you been able to determine an actual cause of the fracture of this bottle? A. I can’t do it <em>positively </em>because in my opinion -that fracture initiated in the region of the glass that is now missing. But the surfaces,—well, I shouldn’t say all the surfaces, but most of the surfaces, these three in particular, are the type of surface that you get when it has been broken by an exterior force. Because when something is-—when a piece of glass is broken— let me illustrate this. That is considered a flat piece of glass which is being broken by force at this point (indicating). The glass breaks like so (indicating). A chunk of glass comes out so that on the side away from the force, you have a bigger area removed. And remove that piece of glass and we have the remaining pieces. These pieces will be beveled back, beveled toward the inside. Now that is the case on these three, these three fractured pieces. This surface is beveled toward the inside. That one is beveled towards the inside. This one up here, however, is beveled the other way. So this is why I say that I don’t think the fracture took place right there. It took place over here someplace (indicating). And once the piece of glass breaks, if it is in a bottle like this, then the rules are all off as far as whether the stresses are—-Because the thing, the fluid starts coming out and the forces just go all haywire. And this is why I would need the <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>glass right at the point of origin in order to be able to <em>positively </em>say that was broken by an interior force or an exterior force.

    <p id="b211-7" data-blocks='[["BL_211.7",211,[103,1791,1157,535]]]'>We disagree. Dr. Anderson testified only that he was unable to give a <em>positive </em>opinion on the cause of the bottle’s failure. This is not inconsistent with his ability to form an opinion based on less than certain evidence. A precise scientist who bases his opinion on an appraisal of probabilities is nonetheless an expert. In our view his opinion deserves jury consideration.

The <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>severity of the prejudice is best demonstrated by the lower court’s reasoning with respect to the second ground on which plaintiff asks for a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b212-4" data-blocks='[["BL_212.4",212,[205,563,1152,929]]]'>The trial judge charged the jury as follows: “. . . the first question you should ask in analyzing this testimony is: Was this blow, this severe blow that caused the breakage of the bottle caused by the plaintiff or someone not a party to this action? That is number one in your approach. Was this severe blow that caused the breakage of the bottle caused by the plaintiff or someone else not a party to this action? This is the first question. ... if the answer to that first question that we quote, that is to say, was [t]his severe blow the cause of breakage of the bottle, was that caused by the plaintiff or someone not a party to this suit. Now if the answer to that first question is yes, that is to say that the plaintiff or someone not a party to this action, caused the blow, caused the breakage of the bottle, then the plaintiff can not recover.

    <p id="b212-5" data-blocks='[["BL_212.5",212,[203,1503,1152,766]]]'>Plaintiff submits here, as he did below, that this assumes the main disputed fact, i.e., whether the bottle’s failure was caused by internal pressure, resulting in an explosion, or by an external force. The lower court concluded that the charge does not assume a disputed fact because it was undisputed that the cause of the bottle’s failure was an external blow. To support this conclusion, the lower court opinion cites two passages from Dr. Anderson’s testimony which are interpreted to mean that the bottle’s failure was caused by an external blow. The appellee’s briefs adopt this argument, citing other passages from Dr. Anderson’s testimony and construing them similarly. It might be expected that a jury would have the same impression.</p>
    <p id="b212-6" data-blocks='[["BL_212.6",212,[204,2278,1150,94]],["BL_213.1",213,[102,397,1154,201]]]'>Actually the lower court’s suggestion that Dr. Anderson testified to the effect that the bottle’s failure <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>was caused by an external blow not only is inconsistent with its position that Dr. Anderson said he could not express an opinion, but also is a distortion of what Dr. Anderson said.</p>
    <p id="b213-3" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[97,619,1159,866]]]'>Specifically, Dr. Anderson testified on cross-examination that the bottle’s fracture was <em>“initiated </em>by an <em>external force" </em>First, although a severe blow is an “external force” not every external force is a severe blow. In fact, a hand gripping a bottle is an external force. Second, to say that the bottle’s fracture was “initiated” by an external force is not equivalent to saying that it was <em>caused </em>by an external force. Another passage from Dr. Anderson’s testimony suggests how he used the word “initiate.” Speaking of a hypothetical bottle, Dr. Anderson said: “In an actual case, you frequently have several things operating. You can have pressure and the pressure on the inside is almost at the limit at which this container can stand. And then a relatively slight external blow initiates a fracture.”</p>
    <p id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[93,1508,1156,321]]]'>In such a hypothetical case, the slight external blow no more causes the fracture than the proverbial straw causes the camel’s back to break. Although the last straw precipitates the break, certainly the break can be said to have been caused by factors other than the last straw, notably the remainder of the burden.</p>
    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.6",213,[88,1841,1157,312]]]'>The lower court quoted another passage from Dr. Anderson’s testimony: “Q. And isn’t that typical of the type of crack produced by external force? The crack leading to the inside surface? A. It is definitely typical of the thing that is being hit from the outside.”</p>
    <p id="b213-7" data-blocks='[["BL_213.7",213,[88,2176,1155,210]],["BL_214.1",214,[210,397,1153,873]]]'>This question and answer appear not to refer to the particular bottle involved in this case. The exchange occurred during cross-examination in the midst of a long series of questions concerning a Glenshaw <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>Glass exhibit of a bottle broken by external force. The answer appears to refer either to the Glenshaw Glass exhibit or to a hypothetical bottle broken by external force. Even if this appearance is incorrect and the answer does refer to the particular bottle involved in this accident, other parts of Dr. Anderson’s testimony indicate that after the fracture begins and the enclosed fluid starts to escape “the forces just go all haywire.” That is to say, glass in regions other than where the fracture began may show characteristics of a break caused by external force although the region where the fracture actually began broke because of internal pressure. Consequently the fact that the bottle in the case shows evidence of external force does not compel the conclusion that in Dr. Anderson’s opinion the bottle’s failure was caused by external force.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[209,1281,1153,543]]]'>Not only was Dr. Anderson’s testimony consistent with his holding an opinion that internal pressure on the defective bottle caused an explosion, his carefully qualified answers actually suggest that this was his opinion. If Dr. Anderson had been permitted to give his opinion, he might well have clarified the trial judge’s and the jury’s understanding of his other testimony. Thus the importance to plaintiff of Dr. Anderson’s opinion was clearly great and its exclusion can only be considered severely prejudicial.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[207,1835,1154,544]],["BL_215.1",215,[125,395,1152,267]]]'>Quite apart from what Dr. Anderson would have given as his opinion, whether favorable or unfavorable to plaintiff, it certainly was improper for the trial judge to assume in his charge to the jury that the cause of the bottle’s failure was a severe blow. Contrary to the lower court’s opinion, this central point was not undisputed. Both plaintiff and Leon Dorsey testified that the bottle exploded spontaneously. Their testimony alone, given the fact that an explosion was not a physical impossibility, was sufficient to make the issue a jury <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>question.

This evidence tends to show that when the bottle involved in this accident left the control of Pittsburgh Brewing Company, it was not defective or unreasonably dangerous, an issue clearly relevant under Restatement, 2d, Torts, §402A. Because the evidence also tends to show due care, which is irrelevant under §402A, plaintiff contends that its admission misleads the jury into believing that the plaintiff must show negligence on the part of the defendants. The objection is not sufficient to bar the admission of this evidence. It is elementary that evidence admissible for one purpose is not rendered inadmissible because it would be inadmissible for another purpose and because the jury might improperly consider it for that other purpose. I Wig-more, Evidence §13 (3d edition 1940). To avoid improper use by the jury, the trial court should clearly instruct them, as it did in this ease, that plaintiff is not required to prove that the defendants were negligent, that the defendants can be liable even if they exercised all possible care and that no consideration should be given to negligence.</p>

(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

      <p id="b217-6" data-blocks='[["BL_217.6",217,[104,1991,1155,350]]]'> Comment c, and to some extent comment f also, indicates that §402A is based on the theory that a seller is a “better risk bearer,” i.e., can spread the cost of accidents resulting from his product through its price and liability insurance. Strict liability itself indicates that liability is not based on fault. To require that plaintiff prove that the seller caused the defect would be inconsistent with the “better risk bearer” theory and would revert to fault as the basis of liability.</p>
