The alleged basis of the action is that the named defendants as agents of the plaintiffs fraudulently and in breach of their fiduciary duty procured the sale of the said premises at an inadequate price, and that the agents profited from such acts.</p>
    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.7",448,[209,929,1150,692]]]'>It is undisputed that appellant, Salvatore Onorato, along with the other two named plaintiffs, his brother Michael Onorato and his sister Anna T. Onorato Roth-man, were on July 28, 1962, the owners as tenants in common of the land in question. On that date they executed an exclusive multiple listing sales contract with Kenneth G-rosse, Incorporated, brokers. The land was then zoned A-l residential, and the listing price was set at $125,000. One offer of $80,000 was received and refused. Then an offer from Walker-Murray Associates for $100,000 was accepted, contingent upon a zoning change from A-l residential to apartment use.</p>

An agreement of sale was drawn with a straw party, one Robert Nuss, named as buyer so that Walker-Murray Associates need not be identified with the zoning change due to their diverse dealings with municipal planning commissions and zoning boards. On September 18, 1962, the agreement between plaintiffs and Nuss, contingent upon the zoning change, was executed. The agreement called for settlement on or before December .17, 1962, with time of the essence, but provided for a 90-day extension if the zoning change were not obtained before the original settlement date, with settlement in no event to occur <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>beyond 60 days after <em>written </em>approval of the zoning change.

He was so listed on a brochure printed by Walker-Murray Associates for submission to the Lansdale Borough Council in support of the petition for the zoning change, as well as on a scale model of the plan. He was so described in the North Penn Reporter, a daily paper. In testimony before the council, he referred to himself as equitable owner.</p>
    <p id="b449-4" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[146,1132,1150,363]]]'>Kenneth Grosse, Jr. was also involved in negotiations in which the buyers of the entire tract agreed to deed back fifty feet of front land to Salvatore Onorato in return for fifty feet of back land. Grosse told Onorato he had authority to deed the fifty feet of front land to Onorato because, as he put it, “I was one-third.”</p>

The DePauls obtained a construction loan of $1,080,000 and began construction of apartments in December of 1964, and by March of 1965 had spent $100,000 for construction. This suit was filed on March 2, 1965.</p>

P. 2227(a) provides: “Persons having-only a joint interest in the subject matter of an action must be joined on the same side as plaintiffs or defendants.” An action by tenants in common to recover the entire lot is joint. Goodrich-Amram, §2227(a)-2; cf. <em>Axe v. Potts, </em><a href="/pa/349/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="349 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="458864" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0345-01">349 Pa. 345</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.2d%20572" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="37 A.2d 572">37 A. 2d 572</a> (1944). It seems that two of the three plaintiffs, Michael Onorato and Anna T. Onorato Rothman, objected to their joinder in this suit. Rule 2227(b) provides for that contingency, stating: “If a person who must be joined as a plaintiff refuses to join, he shall, in a proper case, be made a defendant or an involuntary plaintiff when the substantive law permits such involuntary joinder.” Appellees contend that the joinder is improper because, among other reasons, no proceedings were instituted under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure to join the two involuntary plaintiffs. However, although cases on this subject are few and hoary, it appears that nothing need be done save include the involuntary plaintiffs on the caption of the complaint. <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>

All of these cases predate the adoption in 1940 of Rule 2227(b), but the requirement of joinder of all having a joint interest has long been the law in Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[138,1069,1150,963]]]'>Thus, the joinder issue in the original posture of the case was whether, in the language of Rule 2227 (b), “the substantive law permits such involuntary joinder” in the case before us. The note of the Procedural Rules Committee to Rule 2227(b) states that under present rules of substantive law, proper cases for joining a party as an involuntary plaintiff exist in only the four instances where: “(1) The action is in rem. [citations omitted throughout] (2) The unwilling person can be regarded as estopped by his conduct from objecting to the prosecution of the suit without his consent. (3) The willing plaintiff and the unwilling person are joint tenants or tenants by the entireties and the action is brought to preserve or recover the jointly owned property or damages for injury to such property. (4) The action is equitable in nature and no recovery of money damages is sought.” Clearly, only the third instance could be applicable here.</p>

    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[180,885,1147,531]]]'>We thus turn to the merits. The suit is based upon the alleged dual capacity of Kenneth Grosse, Inc. as an agent for both the seller and the buyer. We are unable to accept defendant’s contention that no conflict could exist because the seller’s agent was Kenneth Grosse, Inc., while Kenneth Grosse, Jr. was the buyer’s agent. Surely the corporate form cannot be permitted to protect the defendants, when the buyer’s agent was both a valued employee of the seller’s agent and the son of its principal shareholder.</p>

However, as the opinion of the chancellor points out, two time-honored exceptions exist to the maxim that an agent cannot represent two principals. Contrary to the view of the chancellor, we are certain that the instant case is not one meant for application of the exception for situations where there is no conflict between the duties owed <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>to the respective principals. Certainly the real estate transaction, unlike the insurance transaction in <em>Rossi v. Firemen’s Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/310/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="310 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1144256" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0242-01">310 Pa. 242</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%2016" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="165 A. 16">165 A. 16</a> (1932), represents the typical situation in which the duties owed the respective principals conflict violently. We have stated that the very reason for the general rule against a double agency is that “it is the duty of an agent for a vendor to sell the property at the highest price, and it is the duty of an agent for a purchaser to buy it at the lowest price. An agent, to a certain extent, occupies a fiduciary relation, and, to permit him to be placed in a position where he inevitably must be subjected to the demands of conflicting duties, is not only harmful to the business in which he is engaged, but also against sound morals and public policy. Such transactions must be viewed with more than suspicion for, where the relations are concealed, we have held that it amounts to fraud.” <em>Sarshik v. Fink, </em><a href="/pa/292/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="292 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1109643" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0256-01">292 Pa. 256</a>, 260, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.%2039" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="141 A. 39">141 A. 39</a> (1928). The question for our determination is thus whether the second exception, i.e., where the principal is aware of the situation and has consented to it, <em>Warner Co. v. MacMullen, </em><a href="/pa/381/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="381 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="1258844" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0022-01">381 Pa. 22</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%2074" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="112 A.2d 74">112 A. 2d 74</a> (1955), applies here.</p>

However, as a matter of law, he who asserts that he falls within tbe exception when the principal knows and consents has a heavy burden. In <em>Sarshik v. Fink, </em>supra, we discussed this burden: “In Mitchell v. Schreiner, <a href="/pa-super/43/0633-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="43 Pa.

The court below in that case charged the jury that the double representations would not prevent the agent from recovering where the principal had knowledge that his agent was acting for the purchaser. President Judge Rice states that this exception exists where both parties expressly agree that a person may act as the agent for both and recover, yet, as that learned jurist observes, ‘It is well settled that such agreement cannot be inferred either from knowledge of the fact that the rule has been violated or from mere silence or failure to dissent at the time, or from all these combined. Nothing short of “clear and satisfactory proof of an agreement” to waive the rule can be regarded as sufficient for this purpose: Rice v.

The evidence presented to Salvatore Onorato that Kenneth Grosse, Jr. was a developer does not rise to consent on Salvatore Onorato’s part to Grosse’s dual agency. Even if that evidence could be termed knowledge of a dual agency (Grosse’s actions as “Developer” might well be as compatible with his representation of plaintiff as it was with his representation of the purchaser), it cannot be termed agreement to the dual agency. Nor can the mere knowledge at the settlement of Kenneth Grosse, Jr.’s role be termed agreement on Salvatore Onorato’s part. This is especially true where the chancellor could only say that Salvatore Onorato “should have known” of Kenneth Grosse, Jr.’s role.
