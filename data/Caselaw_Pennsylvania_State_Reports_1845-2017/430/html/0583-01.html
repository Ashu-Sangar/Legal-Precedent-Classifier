R.C.P. 1252(1). That rule provides in pertinent part: “A foreign attachment may be issued to attach property of a defendant . . . when (1) the defendant is an individual who is a nonresident of the Commonwealth, even though he is present in the Commonwealth; . . .” Appellants attack the issuance of this writ, contending that the court below lacked jurisdiction by virtue of the fact that appellants were Pennsylvania residents. However, since appellants did not raise the jurisdictional issue by either preliminary objections<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> or answer, Pa. R.C.P. 1032 mandates that they have waived any jurisdictional objection unless that objection can be properly classified as one involving “subject matter” jurisdiction. The question thus posed is whether appellants’ now asserted<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Pennsylvania residency vitiates the subject matter jurisdiction of the court below.</p>

In <em>Jones Memorial Baptist Church v.

The question is whether the court has power to enter into the inquiry and not whether it is able to grant the <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>relief sought in the particular case.” It cannot be doubted that the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County is competent to entertain writs of foreign attachment, the general class of eases here involved. The question of appellants’ residency, on the other hand, involves <em>only </em>whether the court below can grant the writ sought.</p>

Beginning with the Blackstonian era<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and continuing to today a writ of foreign attachment is the equivalent of a summons for the commencement of a personal action and the means employed to compel an appearance by a nonresident.

XIX, §1 (6th ed. 1954) ; Restatement, Judgments, §32 at 128-29 (1942). Given the fact that a writ of foreign attachment is merely a method for compelling an appearance when <em>personal </em>service cannot be obtained, to hold that appellants’ residency is a question of subject matter jurisdiction is a clear contradiction in terms. Simply, had appellee brought its action in the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County, an objection to that court’s jurisdiction on the grounds of subject matter would have been well taken; but the common pleas courts do have subject matter jurisdiction to issue writs of foreign attachment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Therefore, since any <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>objection based upon appellants’ residence is not one of subject matter, failure to assert this objection timely under Pa. R.C.P. 1032 works a waiver and appellants cannot attack the lower court’s decision to issue the writ on this ground.</p>

Accepting appellants’ contention that residency is a subject matter jurisdictional issue, we can agree that to give the pleadings <em>conclusive </em>effect would be to allow the parties to confer subject matter jurisdiction where none existed. Yet that does not mean that admissions in the pleadings have no <em>evidentiary </em>value and cannot be used as the basis for a finding that appellants have a New Jersey residency. An examination of the lower court opinion convinces us that the lower court concluded on the basis of this admission, combined with those made in prior pleadings in related litigation,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> see footnote 3, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.2d%20522" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="194 A.2d 522">supra,</a> that the assertion of Pennsylvania residency contained in one of the appellants’ depositions was not credible.

An identical statement of residency was contained in appellants’ notice to take depositions. There is thus considerable merit in the following observation of the court below: “It is time the preliminary skirmishing is brought to an end. The plaintiff has been chasing an agile will-o-the-wisp for four years. Now we are asked to grant further delay and allow further roadblocks because one of the principals suddenly changes his mind as to where he has lived all along.”</p>

R.C.P. 1032 works a waiver of the opportunity to attack the lower court’s decision in issuing the writ on this ground. It is a fundamental principle of law that a litigant can challenge at any time a court’s lack of power or authority to act. Therefore, whenever and however the absence of a nonresident defendant is brought to the attention of the court, it is mandatory that the court dismiss the cause of action in foreign attachment. <em>Dulles v.

To accept a claim of residency as determinative, based on pleadings which subsequently are denied, is to permit the parties themselves to create jurisdiction where none exists and in effect is tantamount to a finding that a party may waive a jurisdictional prerequisite. The majority opinion, while recognizing that <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>to give the pleadings conclusive effect would be to allow the parties to confer jurisdiction where none existed, nevertheless takes the position that the court below in considering the entire record rendered a finding of fact that appellants’ residency averments in subsequent depositions were not credible. In my opinion, the court’s ultimate responsibility is to determine the actual residency of appellants in order to determine its jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[205,875,1148,1019]]]'>It is inconceivable to me that the court below had all the necessary information at its disposal when it made this so-called finding of fact that appellants were nonresidents of this Commonwealth. In fact, all the court below had before it were the various pleadings which obviously cannot be sufficient to make a proper finding of fact with respect to appellants’ residency or nonresidency.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> In order to properly dispose of a suggestion that a court lacks jurisdiction to proceed with an action of foreign attachment for want of a nonresident defendant, a court should require that depositions be taken and other forms of evidentiary proof be submitted in order to aid a court in determining the true residence of the defendant. This would be a simple and expedient method by which a court could determine whether or not it had the necessary jurisdiction and the only way in which a court could properly discharge its judicial responsibilities in arriving at the truth.</p>

Its character as an individual form of action is recognized by the rules in that the group of rules on foreign attachment is included in the sequence of ‘actions at law.’ Moreover, the form of writ refers to the commencement of a ‘foreign attachment,’ rather than the commencement of an assumpsit or an equity action by a writ of foreign attachment.”</p>
