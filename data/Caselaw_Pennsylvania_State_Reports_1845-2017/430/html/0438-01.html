    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.7",469,[127,750,1150,802]]]'>This is an appeal from a denial, after hearing, of appellant Coleman’s application under the Post Conviction Hearing Act. Appellant’s post-conviction application attacked his 1965 guilty plea to murder (after a certification by the Commonwealth of guilt in the second degree, a sentence of 5 to 10 years was imposed) on six grounds: (1) the admission of a statement obtained at a time when representation by counsel is required; (2) a plea of guilty unlawfully induced; (3) incompetency of trial counsel; (4) suppression of evidence ; (5) newly discovered exculpatory evidence; and (6) abridgement of a right not recognized at the time of appellant’s trial but applicable retroactively. Only the first two of these allegations has been pressed upon appeal.</p>
    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.8",469,[120,1566,1153,737]]]'>Coleman’s plea was entered after the date of the decision in <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">378 U.S. 478</a>, <a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">84 S. Ct. 1758</a> (1964) and thus the protections there announced would be available to him. However, since appellant did plead guilty, he can collaterally attack that plea on the basis of a confession violative of <em>Escobedo </em>only if he is able to prove that his plea was primarily motivated by the existence of his confession. See <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/430/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="430 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1915723" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0188-01">430 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=242%20A.2d%20266" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="242 A.2d 266">242 A. 2d 266</a> (1968). At his hearing, appellant testified that when the plea was entered he did not realize that he was pleading guilty to murder. Under appellant’s own version, therefore, ignorance prompted his plea not the existence of a confession.</p>

See <em>Commonwealth v. Grays, </em><a href="/pa/428/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="428 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1912350" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0109-01">428 Pa. 109</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=237%20A.2d%20198" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="237 A.2d 198">237 A. 2d 198</a> (1968).</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[202,676,1145,803]]]'>Finally, appellant contends that the hearing itself was defective in that the hearing judge permitted the Commonwealth to cross-examine Coleman on certain aspects of the crime for which he was convicted. Placed in context, these questions were aimed primarily at determining whether appellant’s plea was voluntary. Furthermore, although any question of guilt would not be relevant to the determination of whether appellant’s confession was constitutionally infirm, there is no indication that the findings of the court below were in any way influenced by appellant’s response to these questions. Given the careful and dispassionate consideration of appellant’s contentions as reflected in the opinion below, we conclude that admission of the testimony is not reversible error.</p>
