In dismissing appellant’s exceptions to the chancellor’s decree nisi, the court below specifically held that the occupation tax violated the uniformity clause and that the valuation of occupations could not be made by the school district tax director.

The school district points to a section of the 1947 “Tax Anything Act,” §3 (53 P.S. §6853), and to a corresponding section of the 1965 act, §6 (53 P.S. §6906), both of which establish a statutory appeal route for challenging this occupation tax. The district argues, therefore, that equity is without jurisdiction to enjoin the enforcement of a tax not challenged at law under the applicable statute. While we agree with the general proposition that equity will not entertain an action where plaintiff has an adequate, statutory remedy at law, we also acknowledge the presence of an exception to that doctrine, existing where a taxing statute is made the subject of a <em>constitutional </em>challenge.</p>

Moreover, that this rule applies even in eases where there is a <em>specific </em>statutory remedy at law is shown clearly by <em>Studio Theaters, </em>a case involving the very statute at issue today, the “Tax Anything Act” of 1947. Finally, we note that the equity court, having once obtained jurisdiction because of the presence of a constitutional challenge to a taxing statute, may also dispose, as did the lower court here, of non-constitutional challenges as well. This procedure was followed in <em>Plymouth Lanes, Inc. v. Plymouth Twp., </em>82 Montg. Cty. L.

The case was affirmed by this Court as to the chancellor’s findings on the constitutional as well as non-constitutional issues. See <em>Plymouth Lanes, Inc. v.

Since it is undisputed that the present case involves, inter alia, a constitutional challenge to the district’s occupation tax, we agree with appellees that the court below had jurisdiction.</p>

The controversy centers about the proper meaning to attach to the word “assess,” for the language of various legislative pronouncements gives the power to “assess” at one point to the county assessor, yet at another to the local taxing body, in this case the school district.</p>
    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.5",496,[196,2260,1147,103]],["BL_497.1",497,[142,417,1150,928]]]'>In order to better appreciate the following discussion, we shall first set out the crucial language of the <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>three statutes here involved. 1. In 1943, the Legislature declared: “It shall be the duty of the chief assessor [i.e., county assessor] to assess, rate and value all subjects and objects of local taxation, . . .” Act of May 21, 1943, P. L. 571, §602, as amended, 72 P.S. §5453.602(a). 2. In 1947, the “Tax Anything Act” was passed with this provision: “The duly constituted authorities of . . . school districts of the third class . . . may . . . levy, assess and collect or provide for the levying, assessment and collection of . . . taxes ... on . . . occupations. . . .” Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145, §1, as amended, 53 P.S. §6851. 3. Finally, in 1965, the “Tax Anything Act” of 1947 was given a new face, and a new title, “The Local Tax Enabling Act,” although the language germane to this discussion was left unchanged. Act of December 31, 1965, P. L. 1257, §2, 53 P.S. §6902 (Supp. 1967).</p>
    <p id="b497-4" data-blocks='[["BL_497.4",497,[140,1358,1153,1090]]]'>Although our semantic discussion must center about the word “assess,” we note initially that the controversy really involves the “valuation” of property (more precisely occupations), i.e., given the fact that a certain item is a proper subject for taxation, how much is that item worth? We must decide whom the Legislature directed to place a value on an occupation for purposes of taxing this occupation. Little help is received from examining the dictionary definition of the word “assess,” except to note that the word is defined by Webster’s International Dictionary to mean, inter alia, either the valuation of property for purposes of taxation or the determination of the actual amount of tax owing on that property. This latter task, a ministerial computation whereby the taxing authority couples the value of the property or occupation to be taxed with the percentage or millage of the tax itself to determine the exact amount due from the taxpayer, is not here at issue, since all the parties concede that this function <em>may </em>be performed by the school district.</p>

      <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>The parties lock horns however on the valuation aspect of the word “assess,” the district claiming that “assess” as used in the “Tax Anything Act” means to place a value on property, the taxpayers arguing that it means only to compute the amount of tax owing on that property. Taxpayers, of course, claim that the <em>valuation </em>of the property can be done only by the county assessor. We agree with the taxpayers that the word “assess” as used in both The Fourth to Eighth Class County Assessment Law of 1943 (taxpayers live in Chester County which is a fourth class county) and the “Tax Anything Acts” of 1947 and 1965 means merely to compute the amount of tax due and does not include the task of valuing the objects of taxation.</p>
    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[182,1229,1149,1148]],["BL_499.1",499,[148,411,1149,104]]]'>If we examine the language of the County Assessment Law, it appears that the county assessor shall “assess, rate and value” the <em>subjects </em>of taxation, i.e., he must, in the present case, value the <em>occupation. </em>On the other hand, the school district is empowered by the “Tax Anything Act” to “levy, assess and collect” <em>taxes. </em>It can therefore be easily seen that if “assess” as used in the “Tax Anything Act” meant “value” rather than “compute” the language would be nonsensical, for one cannot “value” a tax. One can only “levy” a tax, “compute” a tax, and “collect” a tax. On the other hand, no such problem exists with the language of the County Assessment Law. If we ascribe to <em>its </em>language the “computation” meaning of “assess,” the statute still makes sense. For it <em>is </em>grammatically correct'to compute the amount owing on a given “subject” of taxation; and in fact this task is frequently done by the county assessor in the case of county-wide taxes. Thus, the word “assess” can mean the act of computing an amount due, and make sense in <em>both </em>statutes; however, for the word to mean the act of valuation, one <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>must ascribe an absurd meaning to tbe language, of tbe “Tax Anything Act.”</p>
    <p id="b499-5" data-blocks='[["BL_499.4",499,[150,525,1151,1482]]]'>Moreover, only in the County Assessment Law does the actual word “value” appear. From this we may draw two conclusions. The first is that the Legislature meant to indicate clearly that valuation of property was a function of the county assessor. The second is that “assess” cannot mean “value” as used in the County Assessment Law; for to so define the word, we would have to hold that the Legislature intended the word “value” itself, also appearing in the same clause, to be mere surplusage, or vice versa. It is a well established doctrine of statutory construction that a statute must be read to give effect to <em>all </em>of its language. <em>Whitemarsh Twp. Auth. v. </em>Elwert, <a href="/pa/413/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="413 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="1888558" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0329-01">413 Pa. 329</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.2d%20843" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="196 A.2d 843">196 A. 2d 843</a> (1964); <em>Daly v.

L. 1019, §51, 46 P.S. §551. And the Legislature is presumed not to have intended its laws to contain surplusage. <em>Daly v. Hemphill, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth v. Mach Bros.

Having thus concluded that “assess” could not mean value as used in the County Assessment Law, we do not think it advances the cause of logic or justice to give that word a different meaning when used in a closely related statute, the “Tax Anything Act,” especially when those two statutes, as evidenced by the present controversy, frequently arise together in connection with the same taxing ordinance.</p>

This may be done only by the county assessor, who bears the responsibility for valuing all the subjects and objects of taxation in his county. We believe that public policy is better served by insuring that a subject of taxation, be it property, occupation, or any other legitimate taxable, have but a single value fixed to it— and this requires a single valuing officer. It follows that, in the present case, since appellees’ occupations were not valued by the county assessor, but instead by the school district’s tax director, appellant was properly enjoined from collecting its tax.</p>
