Plaintiff asked the court to set aside a real estate conveyance as a violation of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, Act of May 21, 1921, P. L. 1045, 39 P.S. §§351-363, to declare void a supplemental agreement allegedly induced by fraud, and to grant plaintiff a money decree for work done under both the supplemental agreement and the basic contract as well as for loss of profits and punitive damages. Defendant denied that there was fraud involved in either the real estate conveyance or the supplemental agreement, denied that it owed plaintiff any sum under the basic contract and supplemental agreement, claimed a set-off for uncompleted work and counterclaimed for delay damages. The court below refused the request for a reconveyance under the Fraudulent Conveyance Act, supra, refused to declare the supplemental agreement void, dismissed plaintiff’s claims for lost profits and punitive damages, denied defendant a set-off for uncompleted work, dismissed the counterclaim for delay damages and decreed that defendant should pay plaintiff $127,759.54 (the balance due on the basic contract price together with extras) plus interest. Defendant appeals.</p>

On August 16, 1961, the plaintiff, Universal <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>Builders, Inc. (hereinafter Universal), entered into a written contract with the defendant, Moon Motor Lodge, Inc. (hereinafter Moon), for the construction of a motel and restaurant in Allegheny County. The contract provides, inter alia, that all change orders must be in writing and signed by Moon and/or the Architect and that all requests for extension of time must be made in writing to the Architect. The contract specifications also required that a certain proportion of a re-inforcing substance be used in the building walls. The masonry sub-contractor failed to use the specified proportion. When this defect was discovered, Moon magnified its importance, withheld from Universal a progress payment to which Universal was entitled, threatened to expel Universal from the job and thereby induced Universal to enter into the supplemental agreement. The supplemental agreement, dated March 27, 1962, provides, inter alia, that Universal will pay Moon |5000 as damages for the absence of the reinforcing material, that Universal will perform certain additional work at no additional cost to Moon, that the date for completion of the project is extended from April 1, 1962, to July 1, 1962, and that liquidated damages at a specified rate per day will be assessed for delay.</p>

The attribution of one party’s unclean hands to another party is not based on simple agency principles. The applicable law has been outlined by the late Judge Learned Hand: “Whenever the question has come up, it has been held that immoral conduct to be relevant, must touch and taint the plaintiff personally; that the acts of his agents, though imputed to him legally, do not impugn his conscience vicariously. Vulcan Detinning Company v. American Can Company, <a href="/nj-eq/72/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="72 N.J. Eq. 387" data-case-ids="163709" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/72/0387-01">72 N.J.

On principle, so far as there is any principle about the whole matter, it seems to me that a plaintiff should not be so charged. The doctrine is confessedly derived from the unwillingness of a court, originally and still nominally one of conscience, to give its peculiar relief to a suitor who in the very controversy had so conducted himself as to shock the moral sensibilities of the judge. . . . The reasons which justify imputing liability to a principal for his agent’s acts, whatever they are, have nothing in common with such a notion. It would be monstrous that a man’s conscience should bear the sins of those he employs, however liable he may be for their acts, and a doctrine which stands upon moral wrongdoing must clear itself of that confusion, or adopt another form. While it stands upon the court’s repugnance to the suitor personally, it must confine itself to his personal delinquencies.” <em>Art Metal </em>

Where the rights of innocent parties are involved, the doctrine should be applied cautiously. See <em>Zweifach v.

If Pizzuti’s testimony is completely disregarded, Universal’s case against Moon collapses. Moon’s argument that Pizzuti should be disqualified as a witness completely ignores the Act of May 23, 1887, P.

The evidence indicates that William Berger, the agent of Moon, requested many changes, was informed that they would involve extra cost, and promised to pay for them. In addition, Berger frequently was on the construction site and saw at least some of the extra work in progress. The record demonstrates that he was a keen observer with an extraordinary knowledge of the project in general and the contract requirements in particular. Thus it is not unreasonable to infer that he was aware that extra work was being done without proper authorization, yet he stood by without protesting while the extras were incorporated into the project. Under these circumstances there also was an implied promise to pay for the extras.</p>

Thus the effectiveness of a non-written modification in spite of a contract condition that modifications must be written depends upon whether enforcement of the condition is or is not barred by equitable considerations, not upon the technicality of whether the condition was or was not expressly and separately waived before the non-written modification.</p>

When it became apparent that plaintiff was not entitled to any equitable relief, however, defendant’s failure to assert its right to jury trial was a waiver. See <em>Carelli v.

Yet the agreement specifically provides that, except in an emergency endangering life or property, no claim for an addition to the contract price was to be valid unless the work was done pursuant to the owner’s written, signed order, and after written notice given by the contractor before proceeding with the work. I am disturbed that the Majority could have reached its conclusion when the record shows that <em>there toas no such writing.</em>

The most that the plaintiff has shown are oral modifications of the work called for under the contract, which is exactly what is prohibited by the solemn agreement entered into between the parties.

Pizzuti, plaintiff’s secretary-treasurer and only full-time officer, testified that the extra costs were incurred in the amounts shown on change order forms which were not signed by the defendant and which were prepared by the plaintiff away from the job site and presented for the first time during court conciliation attempts. The evidence failed to show that the work charged for was actually performed and that an extra cost was incurred thereby, nor was there a showing of the exact amount involved. Further, there was no evidence as to what labor and material were used in excess of what was required under the original plans. There was no breakdown whatever with accompanying proof to support the plaintiff’s claim for extras or that its figure had awarded the defendant proper credit for the items charged in the original contract and later changed and charged as extras.</p>

The court below held that the figure of $15,564, testified to by defendant’s expert, did not take into account the 1962 rates of labor and material which were 15% lower; but even if the $15,564 was reduced by 15%, the defendant would still be entitled to a $13,229 credit.</p>

Therefore, even if the 76 days are deducted from the $68,869 (which figure was not contradicted by any testimony to the contrary) defendant would still be entitled to $35,620.-26 less the $5,000 agreed to as delay damages in the supplemental agreement, or a net of $30,620.26.</p>
