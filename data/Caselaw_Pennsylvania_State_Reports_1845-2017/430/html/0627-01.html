On that date, at approximately 9 :30 p.m., one Samuel Barron, a bar patron, was shot and killed by Peterman, the bullet having been fired at a range of 6 to 8 inches. Peterman was indicted for murder and manslaughter, <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>convicted of voluntary manslaughter and, upon refusal of motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, sentenced to a prison term of not less than 3 nor more than 10 years.</p>

Arthur Fleming, a bartender at “Roberts Bar”, testified that Barron with others entered the barroom and, after some period of time had elapsed, he engaged in an argument with Fleming concerning the amount of change due him; that Barron created a disturbance and Peter-man, after some effort, momentarily quieted Barron; later, as Barron and Peterman were standing on the patron’s side of the bar with Peterman wedged between the bar stools, Barron appeared to be reaching for a gun and Peterman then instructed Fleming to give him a gun; that Fleming took a pistol from behind the bar and placed it within Peterman’s reach; while Fleming’s attention was directed elsewhere, he heard a shot but he did not actually see the shooting. Thomas Bates testified that he and Barron, prior to their arrival at “Roberts Bar”, had purchased and consumed a bottle of gin; that they arrived at the bar between 6:45 and 7:00 p.m.; that, after he and Barron had consumed some beer, an argument arose between Peter-man and Barron concerning a girl; that, prior to the shooting, Peterman knocked Barron to the floor, and as he was getting up said to him “M. F. I told you I would kill you sooner or later.”; that, although Fleming had twice refused Peterman a gun, Fleming finally placed a pistol on the bar within Peterman’s reach; that he, Bates, remonstrated with Peterman saying “You don’t need the pistol. You already won the fight with the fellow”; that he saw the actual shooting; that Peterman, holding Barron by the back of the neck, pointed the pistol at him and discharged it.</p>

Several police officers testified as to circumstances subsequent to but collateral to the shooting. A medical examiner testified that the cause of death was a gunshot wound at close range, the bullet travelling upward at a 30° angle, and that, at the time, Barron was in a state of acute alcoholism.</p>

See: <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>supra. But where a jury, in order to refresh their recollection, requests a reading of a portion of the testimony actually given at the trial, it is a matter within the discretion of the trial court whether to grant such request. If the trial court does grant the request, the review of testimony must be conducted in open court in the presence of parties and their counsel and, if the resultant review does not place undue <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>emphasis on one witness’ testimony, no reversible error is committed.

As was said in <em>Commonwealth v. Fontaine, </em>supra (at p. 47) : “Although under our system of jurisprudence the jury is the ultimate trier of facts, it does not follow that in all instances and at all times men and women called for jury duty are endowed with infallible powers of retention. Juries may not take notes on the progress of testimony and not infrequently they may retire with confused recollection of the evidence. Par<a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>tieularly may this human failing present itself in lengthy trials involving many complex issues of fact. <em>When, therefore, such admission is frankly disclosed, </em>the trial court must have discretion in determining how best to resolve the confusion or misapprehension of facts in the minds of the jury. This discretion is an incident to the mode and manner of trial and, in the absence of flagrant abuse, should rest with the trial court.” (Emphasis added). In the matter of reviewing testimony, it is the jury’s request which is the basis upon which a reading back of the reporter’s notes or a transcription of them may be justified. To go beyond the limits of such request is to enter an area where the personal feelings of the trial judge may be subtly interjected into the proceedings by emphasizing only that testimony which is either favorable or unfavorable to one of the parties. Such, in our view, was the inadvertent result in the present case.</p>

We can well understand that the failure of Peterman to take the stand could well have been motivated by the implication of the trial court that he would allow the introduction of the prior conviction for unrestricted purposes. The trial court should not have permitted this implication to arise. Unfortunately, the implication was given, the defense trial strategy may well have been fashioned thereby and Peterman was withheld from the stand.
