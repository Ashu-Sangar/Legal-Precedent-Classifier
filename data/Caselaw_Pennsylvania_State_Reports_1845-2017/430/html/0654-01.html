Appellant, the lessee of a drive-in movie owned by appellees, contends that appellees failed at the termination of the lease to permit him to remove car heaters valued at $3,750 which appellant claims are his property. Appellees, on the other hand, cite two provisions in the lease as establishing their right to retain the heaters. The court below agreed and, on this count of the complaint, entered judgment for appellees.</p>
    <p id="b685-10" data-blocks='[["BL_685.13",685,[89,1750,1162,536]]]'>The two provisions in question provide: “Sixth: It is further specifically understood that the Lessee does not have the right to expand or remove from the leased premises any of the facilities and improvements located thereon, unless the specific written permission of the Lessors has been given, and the Lessee agrees that at the termination of the within lease ... to return the aforesaid premises in the same condition and repair as when received by him, subject only to reasonable wear and tear.</p>

See, e.g., <em>339-41 Market Street Corporation v. Darling Stores Corporation, </em><a href="/pa/355/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="355 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="468928" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0312-01">355 Pa. 312</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20686" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="49 A.2d 686">49 A. 2d 686</a> (1946); <em>Lindsay Brothers, Inc. v.

In <em>Market Street, </em>a large air conditioning unit was placed upon a concrete foundation which the lessee constructed to support the unit. The lease in question provided: “‘[A] 11 alterations or improvements made by either of the parties hereto upon the premises, except movable office furniture put in at the expense of Lessee, <em>shall be the property of Lessor, </em>and shall remain upon and be surrendered with the premises at the termination of this lease without molestation or injury.’ ” (Emphasis supplied.) The lessor contended that under this clause it was entitled to retain the air conditioning unit after the termination of the lease. This Court rejected such an argument (<a href="/pa/355/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="355 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="468928" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0312-01">355 Pa. at 318</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20686" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="49 A.2d 686">49 A. 2d at 688</a>): “Aside from that limited reference to personal property [the reference to office furniture], the lease does not purport to, nor does it,. deal with the ownership of other chattels or personal property placed upon the demised premises by the tenant. With respect to the ownership of such personal property, the lease is silent. Consequently, any chattel, such as the air conditioning unit, not having been made a part of the demised premises and being readily removable therefrom without the destruction of the chattel and without non-compensable damage to <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>the premises, remains personalty and, therefore, the property of the installing tenant.”</p>
    <p id="b687-4" data-blocks='[["BL_687.4",687,[122,514,1157,647]]]'>I think it clear that the heaters in controversy which plug into electric outlets would be removable without damage to the premises. Furthermore, the lease in this litigation is as silent as the lease in <em>Market Street </em>on the <em>ownership </em>of personal property brought to the demised premises by lessee. In fact, the <em>Market Street </em>lease did provide that improvements were to belong to the lessor while the provisions here relied upon merely state that lessee shall not remove property without lessors’ consent but certainly do not provide that at the termination of the lease this property shall become the lessors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>

Darling Stores Corporation, </em>supra at 316, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20686" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="49 A.2d 686">49 A. 2d at 688</a>, quoting from <em>Lindsay Brothers, Inc. v.

This lease does not, in my opinion, contain a clear expression that all property used by lessee in the operation of the drive-in shall become the property of lessors and I thus conclude that on this issue it was error for <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>the court below to enter judgment on the pleadings for appellees.</p>
