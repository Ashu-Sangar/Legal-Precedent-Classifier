The particular project for which the Authority was created was abandoned in 1951 and the Authority’s activities remained dormant until 1958. On November 5, 1958, the Township reorganized the Authority for the purpose of handling sewer projects and, on January 6, 1959, the Township transferred whatever sewer facilities it owned, for the nominal consideration of $1.00, to the Authority.</p>

It must be noted that, prior to reorganization of the Authority, the Township had constructed certain sewer feeder lines in the Colecrest area of the township to connect with its then existing sewage lines but, after the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (Alcosan) had constructed a larger sewer trunk line, the sewage from the Colecrest area was thereafter handled by the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority at a rate of 30&lt;/; per 1,000 metered gallons of water used. Moreover, prior to the time of reorganization of the Authority, the Township had maintained sewage <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>lines only in certain sections of the Kirwin Heights area of the township.</p>
    <p id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[223,517,1154,431]]]'>In December 1959, the Township caused certain engineering studies and an investigation to be made covering all the sewage facilities of the Township save those in the Colecrest area. At that time the Cole-crest, Kirwin Heights and Woodville State Hospital areas of the township all were within the service area of the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, but the remaining portions of the township were not.</p>
    <p id="b322-5" data-blocks='[["BL_322.5",322,[220,961,1156,705]]]'>On April 9, 1959, the Authority had no construction of any nature under way, there were no outstanding Authority bonds, and the Authority’s sole indebtedness was in the amount of $15,000, which represented the cost of engineering services and the construction of the sewer feeder lines in the Colecrest area. On that date, the Authority, by an appropriate resolution, fixed a sewage rate at 80^ per 1,000 metered gallons of water used up to 400,000 gallons, and a slightly reduced rate for water used in excess of 400,000 metered gallons. Several months after fixing such sewage rates, the Authority sent out bills to all users of sewage service in the township.</p>

Fourfold relief was sought: (1) an injunction restraining the Township and the Authority from collecting sewage fees in excess of the rates charged prior to April 9, 1959, i.e., in excess of 30^ per 1,000 gallons; (2) a declaration that the Authority resolution which fixed the rates at 80^ per 1,000 gallons was <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>invalid; (3) a refund of excess charges paid by the plaintiffs since the date of the Authority’s resolution; and (4) a revision of the rate structure. Upon issues joined and after hearings, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County decreed that: (1) it had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action; (2) the Authority resolution was invalid and inapplicable to the plaintiffs beginning January 1, 1961; (3) the reasonable rate should be <em>55‡, </em>not 80^, per 1,000 metered gallons of water used; (4) the Authority and the Township be restrained from collecting rates in excess of <em>55 ‡ </em>per 1,000 gallons of water used after January 1, 1961.

On this appeal, the Authority now questions, despite it previous agreement, the jurisdiction of the court below sitting in equity to entertain this action.</p>
