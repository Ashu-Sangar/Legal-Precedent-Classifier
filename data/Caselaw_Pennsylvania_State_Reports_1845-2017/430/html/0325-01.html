Seated behind him on the rear seat of the motorcycle was Helen Case, a young girl employed as a helper in the Yurechko household. At Simpson Hollow Road and Round Hill Church Road there is a “T” intersection and, at this intersection, Yurechko made a left turn and proceeded along Round Hill Church Road, a county highway. When approximately 350 feet from the in<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>tersection and while traveling at about 25 miles per hour, the front wheel of the motorcycle struck a pot hole and upset.

The County filed an answer raising, as an affirmative defense (under the Act of July 1, 1937, P. L. 2547, §1, 53 P.S. §5301) Yurechko’s failure to file notice of his claim in the office of the clerk or secretary of the County within six months from the date of origin of his claim and Yurechko’s failure to obtain leave of court to file an action upon a showing of a “reasonable excuse” for failure to file such notice. At the outset of the trial, the court ruled that “the [County] may raise this question of notice as an affirmative defense, that [it] may introduce testimony and the issue as to whether or not proper notice was given to the [County] will be left for determination by <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>the jury.” The jury returned a verdict in favor of Yurechko and against the County in the amount of $35,000 and, after entry of judgment thereon, the CounJ ty filed this appeal.

But, while we find it necessary to dispel any confusion regarding the language of the Act of 1937, <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>supra, in this regard, we do not think that the fact that the trial court in this case allowed the jury to make the determination necessitates a new trial. Considering the record below, it is apparent, as a matter of law, that the trial court, had it made an independent determination could have arrived at no other conclusion but that the County suffered no undue hardship as a result of Yurechko’s failure to file notice and that Yureehko had shown “reasonable excuse” as required' by the Act of 1937. The tardiness of Yureehko did not work a hardship upon the County. Prior cases construing this provision of “reasonable excuse” have developed two basic elements: (1) negligence of counsel in failing to give the required notice coupled with (2) a determination that the want of notice was not unduly harmful to the defendant: <em>McBride v. Rome Township, </em><a href="/pa/347/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="347 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1217424" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0228-01">347 Pa. 228</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20212" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="32 A.2d 212">32 A. 2d 212</a> (1943); <em>Eisenhauer v.

Certainly if ignorance of counsel is a reasonable excuse for the failure to give the required notice, ignorance of a layman plaintiff is also a reasonable excuse, unless the defendant has been prejudiced or harmed by the failure to give notice.” Where the ignorance of a claimant or the negligence of his counsel is coupled with a determination that no undue hardship resulted to the municipality from the failure to file a claim within the six month period, then a “reasonable excuse” has been established, and the trier of fact, be it judge or jury, may render its decision based upon the merits of the case.</p>

      <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>Since the Act of 1937 is considered an affirmative defense, the burden of proving such defense rested with the County and it was for the County to show that no written notice was filed with the appropriate municipality “clerk” under the Act. However, having so shown, there does not then arise a presumption that, because such notice was not filed, the municipality suffered undue hardship as a result thereof. If the rule were otherwise, then the claimant would be required to show a set of circumstances ordinarily solely within the knowledge of the municipality. As was done in this case, it is a fairly simple matter for a defendant municipality to elicit testimony from a person, such as the municipal “Director of Investigation, Claim and Records Department”, or other appropriate official, to show that no written claim was forwarded or referred to that department within the six months period. But having done so, to then require that the claimant show that the failure to file such notice did not put an undue hardship on the municipality would be to require him not only to prove a negative but also to prove facts ordinarily not within the scope of his knowledge.</p>

The statute is not a sword provided to municipalities by the legislature whereby they might cut down the rights of <em>all </em>tardy litigants, <em>including </em>those whose claims are validly based upon negligence of that very municipality <em>and </em>whose tardiness has not caused any prejudice. Rather the Act of 1937, supra, serves as a shield by which municipal governments might protect themselves against claims <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>of those who have tarried so long that they have made it insurmountably difficult for the municipality to conduct a proper investigation into the circumstances of the accident. To avail itself of this defensive shield, the municipality must show not only that the claimant failed to file written notice of his claim within the six months period, but, further, that, as a result of his tardiness, the municipality has been unduly pressed to delve into the circumstances of the case and is unable to discover properly the events and conditions which led to the mishap and has <em>thus </em>suffered <em>undue hardship. </em>Having done so, the municipality will have shown that it was in <em>fact </em>severely prejudiced by the delinquency of the claimant, and, even though such delinquency was founded upon ignorance of the Act of 1937 or negligence of counsel in filing notice of a claim with the proper authorities, the resultant prejudice will bar claimant’s recovery. If no harm or prejudice has befallen the municipality as a result of a claimant’s tardiness, then such tardiness is based upon a “reasonable excuse”.</p>

The County in its brief states: “Although the Act of 1937 has been liberally construed, this case must be distinguished from the liberal construction applied in other cases to relax the legislative rule, because in every one of those cases, the claimant sought recovery against a borough or other small municipality and some actual notice had been given to some responsible <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>official so that the respective municipalities were not prejudiced. Here, recovery is sought against the second largest county in the Commonwealth as a result of an isolated motorcycle accident which admittedly occurred in one of the County’s most removed and isolated areas ...” We are not particularly concerned with the size of the municipality involved, nor are we constrained to look upon the municipalities dealt with in other reported cases as “borough(s) or other small municipalities).” Hous<em>ley v.

Moreover, the County would lessen the importance of the accident here involved by placing it “in one of the County’s most removed and isolated areas”. The remote location of the road in question is a two-way sword for it is just as reasonable to assume that the County would neglect to properly maintain this remotely located road as it-is to assume that the County is prejudiced simply because the accident happened in a remote section and no actual written notice was received within the six months period. The residents of this remote section of the County do not have any less right to come into a court of law simply because they reside in the hinterland of the County, nor does the County’s duty to maintain its roads decrease in proportion to the distance from the more populated and less isolated areas of the County.</p>

There would be no hole to be seen and no measurements to take, and it is doubtful if there would be any indication that a hole had ever existed at the accident scene if the above testimony were taken at its face value, for traffic would have erased the newness of the patch by its daily passing. Of further note is the testimony of the investigating police officer of Elizabeth Township who admitted that on his report neither the blank spaces for weather conditions nor road conditions were filled in. If the investigating officer for the township which has police jurisdiction over the area in which the accident happened failed to compile a report complete in all of its’ essential details, then Yurechko should not be made to suffer thereby.

And the resurfaces they put on kept cracking on the newest layer put on; break down old surface that had been covered over, and generally it was pitted and in some places had holes of considerable size. ...

It might have been directly in the middle, it might have been a little bit this way; it might have been a little bit that way but it was there. <em>There was a lot of pot holes there. </em>(Emphasis added). Q. Now, you have been very specific about a big hole that you showed us with your hands. Are you telling us—A. Like this here (indicating)—Mr. Schauffler: If the Court please, she has marked this. It’s in evidence. This is exactly where it is and he’s back to the middle of the curve again. Do you mean the middle of the road? Mr. Grigsby: Just a moment. If the Court please, I don’t think it’s for Mr. Schauffler to lead this witness in the course of my cross-examination and I object to it. Mr. Schauffler: You seemed to be confused. The Court: I think we ought to drop the entire subject. I believe. Mrs. Bowers had given you every explanation possible about a hole or holes and1 the condition of that road. I think it’s up to the jury to evaluate her testimony. Mr. Grigsby: All right, <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>sir. I will certainly abide by yonr instructions, your Honor. Can we approach the bench, your Honor?”</p>
    <p id="b369-5" data-blocks='[["BL_369.4",369,[138,511,1157,654]]]'>At this point, the County’s counsel, after a short side bar conference, dropped the entire matter. It is obvious that the trial court was more than fair in allowing extensive and, in fact, repetitious cross-examination on the question of the existence of and location of the <em>pot holes </em>in the road, and the County’s counsel’s agreement to abide by the court’s request that the subject be dropped with no objection raised to the trial court’s ruling, precludes the County complaining of a fancied denial of the right of cross-examination. In the light of the record this contention borders on frivolity.</p>
