Between August and November 1965, decedent stayed with his daughter, a Mrs. Gross, at 10406 Haldeman Avenue, Philadelphia, and, thereafter, stayed with the same daughter until the early part of May 1966 at an apartment house in Philadelphia. At that time, he returned to live at 2716 North Ruth Street, Philadelphia, and remained there until July 8, 1966. The record reveals beyond any question that, until July 8, 1966, decedent’s “family or principal residence” was in Philadelphia.</p>

On July 8, 1966, several of decedent’s children took him to the home of one of his daughters, a Mrs. Frisch, who lived at 3596 Glen Way, Huntington Valley, Montgomery County, and he remained there until July 13, 1966, at which time he was removed to a nursing home in Philadelphia. He remained at that nursing home until July 16, 1966 when he was again taken to Mrs. Frisch’s home in Montgomery County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After remaining there approxi<a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>mately six days, he was admitted to the Jean.es Hospital, Philadelphia, wherein he was a patient until his death, five days later, on July 27, 1966.

Approximately four months later, Mrs. O’Brien and Mrs. Rothsching, two children excluded under decedent’s will (contestants), filed a petition for an appeal from the probate of the will alleging (a) lack of testamentary capacity, (b) undue influence, and (c) that decedent’s residence at the time of death was in Philadelphia and not Montgomery County. The latter allegation was the only one considered in the court below, and, on this appeal, is the sole question before us.</p>

The question at issue is whether the decedent had changed his domicile to Montgomery County and the burden of proving that such a change of domicile had been effected was not upon the contestants, as the court below held, but upon the proponents of the probate of the will: <em>Price v.

That the procedure involved in this litigation was an appeal from the probate of the will did not shift the burden to the contestants. Unlike an appeal from probate which challenges the validity of the will, i.e., lack of testamentary capacity, forgery, undue influence, etc., wherein we review the <em>manner </em>in which the court below arrived at its determination, the instant appeal attacks the <em>competency </em>of the court below, by reason of lack of jurisdiction, to make <em>any </em>determination. The status of the register of wills as a quasi-judicial officer does not alter the result as the court below implies in its opinion. The present attack is not on the manner in which the register exercised his judicial functions but whether he had the right, under the circumstances, to exercise <em>any </em>judicial function. The case law, in our view, mandated that the will proponents, on the appeal to the court below, carry the burden of establishing that the register of wills had <em>jurisdiction </em>to probate this will.</p>

The burden of persuasion has a different function—it determines which party must produce that quantum of evidence neces<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>sary either to take his case to a jury or to convince a judge that a fact has been established. Although in many cases the same party will have both the burden of first production and the burden of persuasion, this is one case in which these burdens are properly allocated to different parties. To the appellants falls the burden of first production but to appellees is given the burden of persuasion.</p>
    <p id="b74-4" data-blocks='[["BL_74.4",74,[205,829,1162,1097]]]'>- In’ the context of this case, we should be initially concerned with what impact the probate of decedent’s will by the register has upon the burden of first producing evidence. Although the majority seems to distinguish between the burden of first producing evidence when the issue is the validity of the will and the burden of first production when the issue is the jurisdiction of the register, our cases support no such distinction. Stemming primarily from the doctrine that the grant of letters of administration is a judicial act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> our cases have evolved the rule that the party seeking reversal of a register’s action has the burden of first production. Perhaps the best clarification of this rule is contained in <em>Geho’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/340/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="340 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1203318" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0412-01">340 Pa. 412</a>, 415-16, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20342" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="17 A.2d 342">17 A. 2d 342</a>, 344 (1941) : “Proof of the fact of the probaté of a will does not upon an appeal from the probate have any <em>evidential </em>value . . . but it does have <em>procedural </em>value, for it raises a presumption of the will’s validity and this presumption becomes a challenge for <em>proof </em>addressed to the challenger of the will.</p>

Then the burden of coming <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>forward with proof shifts to the contestants. [Citation omitted.] This burden of proof does not shift back to the proponents until the contestants have offered evidence of such probative value in support of their allegations against the will, that if it stood uncontradicted it would upon an issue being awarded support a verdict against the will.” (Emphasis in original.) <em>Geho </em>gives not an inkling that the burden of first production turns upon the nature of the issue involved; and it does not for the reason that this burden is a function not of the nature of the issue but of the fact that a quasi-judicial tribunal has already decided that the will should be probated. The nature of the issue raised is thus irrelevant and the party appealing the register’s decision always has the burden of first production.</p>
    <p id="b75-4" data-blocks='[["BL_75.4",75,[88,1278,1159,761]]]'>Once the burden of first production has been met (I believe that the evidence offered by the appellants was sufficient to meet this burden), the court must then allocate the burden of persuasion. If one envisions the evidentiary scales equally in balance, the burden of persuasion would dictate which party prevails—and that party would be the party on whose shoulders the burden of persuasion does <em>not </em>fall. Placed in context, which party here had the burden of persuading the trial court that decedent died domiciled in Montgomery County? I agree with the majority that the appellees had this burden, and therefore also conclude that the court below erroneously placed the burden of persuasion upon the appellants.</p>

It is here that I must dissent. There is testimony in this record by two of the appellees, both daughters of the decedent, that he intended to make Montgomery Coun<a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>ty his domicile. If the trial judge believed these two witnesses, even with the burden of persuasion properly placed upon the appellees, they should prevail. The trial judge did not make any assessment of the credibility of the witnesses other than Mrs. Kucher because his misallocation of the burden of persuasion rendered this assessment unnecessary. In my view, this record should be remanded so that the court below may evaluate the testimony presented in light of a properly allocated burden of persuasion, and I therefore conclude that a reversal without remand is improper.</p>
