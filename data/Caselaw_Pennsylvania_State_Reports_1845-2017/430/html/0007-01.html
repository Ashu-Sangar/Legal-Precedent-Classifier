Appellant in this post-conviction proceeding requests the right to file new trial motions and appeal from a possible denial thereof, both to be done nunc pro tunc; his request is premised upon an allegation that he was not advised of the rights mandated by <em>Douglas v. California, </em><a href="/us/372/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="372 U.S. 353" data-case-ids="1765282" data-case-paths="/us/372/0353-01">372 U.S. 353</a>, <a href="/us/372/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="372 U.S. 353" data-case-ids="1765282" data-case-paths="/us/372/0353-01">83 S.

We are thus faced with a record identical to that faced in <em>Wilson; </em>an identical disposition will therefore be made. We remand this record to the court below with directions that the Commonwealth be permitted to offer testimony that appellant was informed of the rights accorded by the <em>Douglas </em>decision. If the hearing court finds that the Commonwealth is able to demonstrate that appellant knew of his right of appellate counsel, it shall enter an order denying relief. If, however, the Commonwealth fails to make such a demonstration, the court shall appoint counsel for the purpose of filing and arguing post-trial motions and, if necessary, prosecuting an appeal. In <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>the event post-trial motions are denied, this Court will permit, upon motion of counsel, an appeal to be docketed as if timely filed and thereafter orally argued.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> We suggested in the <em>Wilson </em>case that an on the record inquiry at trial would be appropriate.

Defense Counsel: Hay we consult with our client for a moment? The Court: You may. Defense Counsel: We waive the four days, your Honor. The Court: All right. Was that waiver made with the consent of your client, the Defendant? Defense Counsel: It has been, your Honor. The Court: Very well. It is on the record then. You may stand.” At the hearing, defense counsel testified that their consultation with appellant spanned a period of approximately two minutes. In light of the eases cited above in which the record discussions were of greater particularity than the one which here occurred and in which this Court held that the record examination was not sufficient to demonstrate a waiver, this discussion certainly is not.</p>
