Under the Act of June 28, 1895, P. L. 408, §2, as amended, 72 P.S. §2262, there must be paid annually to the treasurers of the various municipal subdivisions in Pennsylvania a portion of this tax money corresponding to the amount of foreign fire insurance written in the receiving municipality. This same Act of 1895 further requires the recipient municipality to pay over the amount received to the designated firemen’s relief or pension fund which serves the specific area. The City of Washington and the Township of Canton, having designated the Firemen’s Relief Association of Washington as the authorized recipient of its share of tax money, have been collecting funds from the state and disbursing them to the Association since 1931.</p>

They further contend that the Legislature did not intend to bestow Commonwealth funds upon any pension association which would use this money to provide medical and/or death benefits for its members. We are unable, however, to find any such limitations in the language of the Act of 1895, and thus agree with the court below that mandamus properly issued.</p>

Since the statutory language quoted above fails to so limit the words “pension fund,” we have, pure and simple, this classic problem of administrative law: To what extent may an administrative body or officer, under the guise of its regulatory power, actual<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>ly amend a legislative pronouncement?

The Auditor General sought to withhold funds from the Firemen’s Relief Association of Reading on the ground that this association planned to use part of the money for certain death benefits that would not be available equally to all members of the association. This, said the Auditor General, was not permitted under the Act of 1895. The controversy first reached our Court on the issue of whether mandamus was the proper remedy to compel payment of the funds to Reading. <em>Volunteer Firemen’s Relief Association v.

It was there held that mandamus would lie. The Court read the Act of 1895 as being a non-discretionary directive to the Auditor General that he <em>shall </em>pay this money to the municipality and that these funds may be used “by the latter <em>for any lawful purpose.” </em>Id. at <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>307, <a href="/citations/?q=203%20A.2d%20476" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="203 A.2d 476">203 A. 2d at 478</a>.

As we there recited, “while we concede the authority of the Auditor General to make regulations in connection with his statutorily imposed duties, we believe <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>that in tbe present ease the rules laid down by him have no sound basis in tbe statute and therefore are not in furtherance of bis auditing duties.” Id. at 89, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20632" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="227 A.2d 632">227 A. 2d at 635</a>.</p>

Not only is the Washington Firemen’s Relief Association administered completely independently of that act, but that act, as indicated by its very title, “Optional Retirement System for Officers and Employes” is not even intended to govern all the relief, retirement and pension associations in Pennsylvania’s third class cities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In sum, it is one thing to say that the Auditor General is charged with the duty of inspecting the financial records of the associations to which he disburses Commonwealth funds; but it is quite another thing to urge, as do appellants, that an administrative body can amend a statute and then conclude that a given municipality has not conformed to this new, administratively created statutory language.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

I cannot agree.

    <p id="b109-4" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[111,851,1159,1541]]]'>The majority, while agreeing that a pension fund was intended to be created pursuant to the Act of 1895, nonetheless takes the position that the Auditor General cannot read into, alter, or amend the statutory provisions so as to provide for a minimum age requirement, citing <em>Volunteer Firemen’s Relief Association of the City of Reading v. Minehart, </em><a href="/pa/425/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="425 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="1906744" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0082-01">425 Pa. 82</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20632" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="227 A.2d 632">227 A. 2d 632</a> (1967), as its authority. In the <em>Reading </em>case, over my dissent, we held that since the statute failed to contain language that the Special Death Benefit Fund should be made available equally and to all members of the Relief Association, the Auditor General had no sound basis in the statute to promulgate rules and regulations providing such limitations. Here there is a sound basis in the statute for the Auditor General’s interpretation. The Act of 1895 specifically refers to a “pension fund” and the Auditor General by requiring a minimum age to be present in order to receive benefits under the fund is doing nothing more than interpreting the words “pension fund” in accordance with sound principles of law enunciated on several occasions by our Court. This distinction, in my view, takes the instant case completely out of the framework of the <em>Reading </em>case. The Auditor General is not reading into or amending the statute to provide age qualifications, but on the contrary is only interpreting and giving meaning to the obvious legislative intent and purpose as indicated by the statutory words “pension fund.”</p>

I agree with the majority that certain statements made by the Court in that opinion do in fact shed light on the present problem, but, unfortunately, not for the majority’s position. Our holding in the first <em>Reading </em>case was that “mandamus will lie to compel action by an official where his refusal to act in the requested way stems from his <em>erroneous interpretation of the law.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <a href="/pa/415/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="415 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1891832" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0305-01">415 Pa. at 311</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=203%20A.2d%20476" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="203 A.2d 476">203 A. 2d at 479-80</a>. In the instant case the Auditor General’s interpretation of the law is not erroneous since the law in Pennsylvania, as I will later indicate, clearly requires the presence of a minimum age as a condition for eligibility to receive any benefits under a pension system. It is my view that the legislature by specifically using the language “pension fund” intended that the moneys appropriated for such purpose would be expended in accordance with applicable principles of law. To conclude otherwise would amount to a presumption that the legislature intended an unreasonable result. Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019 §52, 46 P.S. §552.</p>

Since the type of pension sys-i tern created by the Association is unlawful and invalid, the funds in dispute cannot possibly be expended for the purpose for which the funds were paid.

To hold otherwise would permit the legislature to do indirectly that which “the Constitution prohibits it from doing directly.” To permit “A” and “B” Association to be a proper recipient of state funds and not “A” and “B” individually, would make a mockery of our Constitution.</p>

In <em>Philadelphia Association for the Relief of Disabled Firemen v. Wood, </em><a href="/pa/39/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="39 Pa. 73" data-case-ids="996415" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0073-01">39 Pa. 73</a> (1861), the first case dealing with appropriations of public moneys to Firemen Relief Associations, it was determined that legislative <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>action designed to make a charitable appropriation to such associations was of doubtful constitutionality. While the problem involved in <em>Wood </em>was somewhat distinct from the problems involved here, it nevertheless labeled and categorized these appropriations and associations as charitable and benevolent in nature. Thereafter, in 1895, the legislature promulgated an act imposing a two per centum tax upon premiums received by foreign insurance companies doing business within the Commonwealth. Pursuant to that Act the funds collected by the state treasurer had to be paid over to the treasuries of certain cities and boroughs within the Commonwealth. Our Court in <em>Firemen’s Relief Association v. Scranton, <a href="/pa/217/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="217 Pa. 585" data-case-ids="953682" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0585-01">217 </a></em><a href="/pa/217/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="217 Pa. 585" data-case-ids="953682" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0585-01">Pa. 585</a> (1907), held that Act to be constitutional on the basis that the statute did not make it mandatory on the part of the municipalities to appropriate those funds for the benefit of any private corporation, association or individual. Since the funds could be used for any lawful purpose within the discretion of local authorities, there could be no constitutional objection sustained on the basis of Article 8, §18. However, the Court again categorized the discretionary appropriation as an “executory <em>gift” </em>for benevolent and charitable purposes. The present Act of 1895, as amended, makes it mandatory on the city treasurers to pay over the funds to the associations. There is no longer any discretion whatsoever vested in the local authorities and, furthermore, our Court has reiterated on several occasions that an action of mandamus will lie to compel the payment of the funds to the associations. This historical analysis leads irresistibly to the conclusion that the associations are virtually in the same position today as they were in 1861 when the <em>Wood </em>case was decided and consequently of doubtful constitutionality.</p>
