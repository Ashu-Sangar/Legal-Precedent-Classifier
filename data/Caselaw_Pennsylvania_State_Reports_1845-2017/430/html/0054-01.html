Corbett, died September 7, 1956 leaving a holographic will dated December 22, 1925. Two small pecuniary bequests were followed by the presently contested residuary clause: “All the remainder of my estate, of whatever nature, I give and bequeath to my two sisters, Catherine Corbett, and Julia Corbett, and to my brother, John Corbett—two parts to each of said sisters, and one part to said <em>brother—who are instructed as to my charitable wishes.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.)

Since the lapsed bequests to testator’s sisters were contained in a residuary clause, subsection (10) dictates that appellee, whose father’s be^ quest did not lapse, is entitled to the entire residue.

Thus, in other jurisdictions some cases hold that testator’s desire to disinherit an individual or a clause expressing an intention to exclude from participation persons not mentioned in the will is sufficient to indicate that the anti-lapse provisions should not be applied to the putative beneficiaries of the statute.

Under §14, the gift to the predeceased sister did not lapse but rather passed to her surviving daughter. It was contended, however, that the interlineation at least demonstrated that Wright intended that only his two surviving sisters should share in the residue and that, therefore, he manifested an intent that the anti-lapse provisions not apply.

Obviously, the purpose of employing the phrase “who are instructed as to my charitable wishes” was sufficient to indicate that testator intended that at least part of the residue of his estate should be used for charitable purposes. It is also clear ■that the only persons advised and instructed as to these charitable wishes were those beneficiaries named in the will, all of whom predeceased the testator. Nevertheless, in the guise of the rule concerning precatory language, and the application of the anti-lapse statute, the majority opinion permits someone who was not informed or instructed as to testator’s charitable desires to be the recipient <em>under the will </em>of the entire residue of his estate.</p>

(8) Lapsed and void devises and legacies.—Substitution of issue. A devise or bequest . . . to . . .

The majority in concluding otherwise, relies almost exclusively upon <em>Wright Estate, </em><a href="/pa/380/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="380 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1255955" data-case-paths="/pa/380/0106-01">380 Pa. 106</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.2d%20198" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="110 A.2d 198">110 A. 2d 198</a> (1955), which case I find inapplicable to the present situation. In <em>Wright, </em>we held that an illegal revocation or invalid substitutionary gift could not affect or operate to show an actual intent to defeat a prior valid bequest, nor could it be used to show a contrary intent that the anti-lapse statute should not apply. However, the <em>Wright </em>ease can be distinguished from the instant case in several respects. First, the anti-lapse statute by its terms did not apply in <em>Wright, </em>since it could not be successfully argued that the word inserted (“two”) evidenced a contrary intent <em>appearing in the will. </em>Since the insertion was deemed an invalid substitutionary gift, the will had to be read as if testator provided “the rest to be divided between my sisters.” Consequently, no expression of a contrary intent actually appeared in the will. Here the words “who are instructed as to my charitable wishes” were not invalidly inserted in the will, but rather were merely incapable of enforcement. Although unenforceable, the words quite properly appear in the will and should be used, unlike in <em>Wright, </em>for the purpose of ascertaining testator’s intent. Secondly, in <em>Wright </em>we only proscribed the <em>use </em>of an invalid bequest to demonstrate a contrary intent and not <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>as the majority suggests that the invalid bequest failed to sufficiently manifest the necessary contrary intent. Here no such situation exists. Appellants are not offering an invalid bequest or devise so as to affect or operate to defeat a prior valid disposition of testator’s property, but on the contrary offer an expression of intent appearing in the will which for reasons other than its invalidity cannot be enforced. Morever, our Couid in <em>Wright </em>was faced with a very practical problem due to the fact that if we were to have held that the invalid insertion could be used to indicate a contrary intent we would have simply arrived at the same result as if we allowed the invalid substitutionary gift to be an effective disposition of Wright’s property. This practical problem also fails to exist in the instant case.</p>
