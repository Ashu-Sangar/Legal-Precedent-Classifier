Haut in the amount of $12,490. The dispute involves the proper construction of a policy of life insurance and the proper actuarial computations under that policy.</p>

Hant (Hant) purchased from the Company a life insurance policy with a principal sum of $10,000. The policy called for premium payments for twenty years with the first policy year beginning on June 24, 1959. Pursuant to an election offered by the Company, Haut decided to pay premiums monthly. It is agreed by all that the monthly premium required to be paid was $45.80 and that each premium payment, to be made on the 24th of each month, was to cover the period beginning on the date payment was due and ending on the 24th day of the following month.</p>

He did not pay the premium due on that date. However, the policy contained an automatic premium loan provision which stated as follows: <em>“Automatic Premium Loan: </em>If proper written request for the operation of this provision has been received at the Home Office of the Company before default in payment of any premium or within the grace period, any premium due on this Policy remaining unpaid on the last day of grace for payment of same will be advanced by the Company, provided the cash value of this Policy at the end of the period which such premium would cover exceeds the total indebtedness to the Company hereon by an amount sufficient to pay such premium with interest thereon. The amount of such advanced premium with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annum to the next succeeding anniversary of this Policy shall constitute a loan against this Policy and thereafter such loan shall bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum payable in advance. If such interest is not paid when due it shall be added to such loan and bear interest at the same rate. If the cash value of this Policy at the end of any period for which a premium is due and unpaid does not exceed the total indebtedness hereon <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>by an amount sufficient to pay such premium with interest thereon, then such due and unpaid premium shall not be advanced as a loan but the provisions of this Policy entitled ‘Non-Forfeiture’ shall apply. The Company shall have a prior lien on this Policy and its proceeds for any loans made hereunder together with interest thereon. At any time before default in payment of premium, the payment of premiums in cash to the Company may be resumed in accordance with the provisions of this Policy. The request for the operation of this provision may be revoked at any time by proper written request to the Company at its Home Office, provided, however, that such revocation shall not affect any loan which may have been previously made hereunder.”</p>

The remaining cash value was used to purchase paid-up extended term insurance for the principal amount of the policy. It is agreed, if the Company’s computations are correct, that this insurance expired on April S, 1961.</p>

At the end of the first policy year (June 24, 1960), the parties agree, these nineteen unmatured coupons had a value of $1080.10.

However, in computing the present value of unmatured coupons at the end of the second policy year (June 24, 1961), the Company treated the first coupon as matured (since it became due upon payment of the second annual premium in full—an event which would have occurred under Haut’s method of payment on May 24, 1961), subtracted its matured value of $59.60 from the June 24, 1960, unmatured value of $1080.10 and multiplied the difference of $1020.50 by the .03450 factor. This resulted in a present value for eighteen unmatured coupons on June 24, 1961, of $1055.70. In its subsequent computations the Company gave credit for the first coupon by adding 5/12ths of $59.60 to the November 24, 1960, cash value.</p>

This produced a present value of $1117.40 for <em>nineteen </em>coupons on June 24, 1961.

Put another way, to conform to the Company’s method of computation, if the coupon value of $59.60 is increased to $61.70 by application of the increment factor and we take 5/12ths of this increased value and add it to the interpolated November 24, 1960, cash value computed by the Company ($36.63), we shall obtain the sum of $62.30, the November 24, 1960, value computed by plaintiff.</p>

For reasons which we hereinafter explain, we rule against Company on this issue.

The record is silent as to why this was done. Company’s actuaries failed to explain it in their testimony at trial. Apparently, the tabular schedule set forth in the policy was computed on the assumption that premiums would be paid annually, or on their due dates. However, the premiums on the policy involved were paid monthly. If the second year premium had been paid in full on its due date (June 24, 1960), the coupon would have been paid for on said date and perhaps the withdrawal of this coupon would then have been proper, even if in fact it was not payable until June 24, 1961.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> However, the second year premium <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>was not paid in full on June 24, 1960, or at the time said coupon was withdrawn from the present value of the coupons. In fact, at most, only l/12th of the second year premium was paid on this date. Charging monthly premiums on a policy containing tabular values set up on the assumption that premiums will be paid annually in advance rendered the policy ambiguous on the question of Avhether the first coupon should have been Avithdrawn from the present value of the coupons as of the first year. It may well be that such withdrawal is a sound actuarial practice, but this is not controlling. It is the policy which governs and if an ambiguity exists it must be resolved in favor of the insured. <em>Papadell v.

It is undisputed that such value at the end of the first year (June 24, 1960) was minus ninety dollars and fifty cents (f—90.50). This date having passed at the time of default, no one seems to have difficulty in understanding or accepting the computation. In computing cash value a year later.; however, we must assume existence of a state of facts which never actually existed in the context of this policy (i.e. the actual arrival of June 24, 1961, while the policy was in <em>force); </em>and in so doing, we must make a computation based upon the situation which actually would have existed on June 24, 1961.</p>

In fact, since the second annual premium would have been paid in full upon remittance of the monthly premium due May 24, 1961, this first coupon would have been a matured one for a month prior to June 24, 1961. While one may call anything “ambiguous” if he wishes to do so, such an appellation does not necessarily make it ambiguous. What difficulties the majority find in use of the word “unmatured” and in the monthly, rather than annual, payment of premiums elude me. A coupon is unmatured if, by its terms, it is not presently payable (i.e. it represents a future benefit); conversely, it is matured if it is presently payable. The monthly payment of premiums (a convenience to the policy<a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>holder, by the way, not to the company) does not create confusion in the table of annual cash values any more than a quarterly or semi-annual payment would. It means only that the payment of the annual premium <em>in full </em>will not occur as early as it would if the premium were paid only once a year. Thus, here, this payment in full occurred on May 24, 1961, when the twelfth monthly payment for the second year was made.</p>

The first year’s premium plays no part in the accrual of value in the first coupon; the second year’s premium, like every succeeding year’s, is wholly responsible for this: This fact also disposes of the majority’s third contention that the entire $59.60 value of the first coupon might be includible in the November 24, 1960, cash value on the theory it was fully earned upon payment of the first year’s premium. As we have shown, none of the value of this coupon was earned until commencement of payment of the second year’s premium.</p>

The Company contends that if one accepts plaintiffs computations, the conclusion is inescapable that there would have been sufficient cash value in the policy on December 24, 1960, to advance the payment of the full monthly premium due November 24, 1960, and that once this was done the remaining cash value on December 24, 1960, would have been insufficient to purchase term insurance for more than several days. Its reasoning is based upon accepting plaintiffs determination that the December 24, I960,' cash value would be $92.90 and upon interpreting the automatic premium loan clause in a certain way.</p>
    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[185,1062,1155,818]]]'>This clause, supra, <em>requires </em>the advancement of an automatic premium loan upon default in payment of a premium if the cash value of the policy at the end of the period for which the premium is to be advanced would be sufficiently in excess of the “total indebtedness” to the Company to cover the premium. On the computations of both parties here this determination was first made upon default in the payment of the premium due October 24, 1960; and both agreed that the indebtedness to the Company on November 24, 1960, would be $46.00 (the premium of $45.80 plus $.20 interest for the one month). Since this indebtedness of $46.00 was less than the November 24, 1960, cash value found by each party, both agree that this premium was properly advanced.</p>
    <p id="b280-5" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[182,1891,1154,492]],["BL_281.1",281,[133,416,1153,211]]]'>Upon default in payment of the November 24, 1960, premium, a similar determination was required by the automatic premium loan clause. The cash value a month later, according to plaintiff, would be $92.90. The indebtedness on that date, according to the Company, would be the above $46.00 plus another $.20 interest for that October 24, 1960, premium advance: The available cash value on December 24, 1960, therefore, would be $92.90 less $46.20 or $46.70. Since the <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>amount of the November 24, 1960, premium plus interest would be another $46.00, the available cash value would cover advancement of this premium with $.70 to spare. Therefore, it had to be advanced.</p>
    <p id="b281-4" data-blocks='[["BL_281.4",281,[134,638,1154,712]]]'>Plaintiff says this is wrong, that “indebtedness” means the premium amount plus interest to the next succeeding policy anniversary (June 24, 1961). If interest is so computed, the December 24, 1960, cash value would then be insufficient to provide a premium loan for the November 24, 1960, premium. Plaintiff contends this view is correct because the automatic premium loan provision goes on to say that the amount of an advanced premium with interest to the “next succeeding anniversary” of the policy shall constitute a loan against the policy and, therefore, an insured’s indebtedness can only be computed at a given date by adding full interest to the next succeeding anniversary.</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[132,1363,1156,1098]]]'>I disagree. The proximity of these two sentences in the premium loan provision should not becloud the fact that they speak of different things. It is the first-sentence only that governs a determination of whether a premium loan must be made; and consistent with the proper view that all of the benefits of a life insurance policy should be preserved for an insured by making such a loan where possible, this sentence allows interest to be computed only to the end of the period for which the premium is being advanced. Thus, as plaintiff herself indicated in determining whether or not the October 24, 1960, premium could be advanced, interest should be computed only to November 24, 1960. In determining whether the November 24, 1960, premium should be advanced, interest should be computed to December 24, 1960. As the Company thus points out, plaintiff’s calculations would require advancement of this November 24, 1960, premium and would leave insufficient cash value thereafter to purchase term insurance beyond the end of 1960.</p>

The policy either did or did not require an automatic premium loan to be made on November 24, 1960. If it did (i.e., plaintiff’s computation being correct), no “election” by the Company is possible; the loan had to be made. Therefore, as the Company correctly notes, there remained insufficient cash value to purchase term insurance for more than a few days after December 24, 1960, on this basis. This is so clear that plaintiff did not advance this “election” argument before us, and I fail to see how the majority can reasonably do so.</p>

It first found the decrease in value of the unmatured coupons <em>for an entire year </em>and then added back only a five months prorated value for the matured coupon. This procedure naturally distorted the computation and produced a much lower increase than a proper computation would reveal. Moreover, it is not consistent with the Company’s actual computation since the values of the unmatured coupons on the two dates (June 24, 1960 and June 24, 1961) each entered into the computations of the cash values on those dates and then into a single proportion to determine the November 24, 1960, cash value.

This first coupon does play a role in the computation of cash values and does enter into the determination of the nonforfeiture benefit but not because it was unmatured at the time of default. The coupon enters into these items because both the policy and the State statute require such a result. The policy’s cash value provision, supra, says that the excess of the life insurance benefits’ present values over the adjusted premiums’ present value is to be supplemented by the present value of any “coupon . . . additions” in determining the cash value at the end of any policy year. The statute, subsection (b), 40 P.S. <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>§510.1 (b), supra, says the cash value shall include “any existing paid-up additions. . . .” Therefore, consideration of the first coupon as an element in determining cash value is required because the policy and statute so state, not because this coupon had not matured.</p>

Subsection (e), 40 P.S. §510.1 (e), of the statute, supra, requires that “allowance” be given under circumstances like those present here; and we believe that, taken as a whole, the policy and statute provide ample procedures for determining what this means in any particular case.</p>
