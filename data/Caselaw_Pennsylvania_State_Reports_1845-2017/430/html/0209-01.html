He received two 1 to 2 year sentences for the burglary and a six to twelve month sentence for the prison breach; these sentences were consecutive making appellant’s aggregate sentence 2 1/2 to 5 years. Blose was paroled in January of 1964 and then, in October of 1965, recommitted as a parole violator. He now attacks his 1961 guilty plea in this Post Conviction Hearing Act proceeding. After relief was denied without hearing by the trial court, the Superior Court affirmed without opinion. See <em>Commonwealth v.

This necessitates that he be informed or know not only of his right to consult with an attorney, but also if he is indigent that a lawyer will be appointed to represent him. In short, he cannot intelligently waive a right of which he is not fully aware.”</p>

      <em>Mullins </em>then discusses the problem of the burden of proof, concluding that where the record does not show that the accused was informed or knew of his right to counsel <em>and </em>that counsel would be appointed for him if he was indigent,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the burden is placed upon the Commonwealth to establish that the accused was fully aware of his rights at the time the alleged waiver occurred. “[T]he record must show in the case of an indigent defendant that he is informed of or fully understands that the court will provide him with counsel <em>without charge </em>if he so desires.

      <em> </em>Under these circumstances, the burden was upon the Commonwealth to demonstrate that appellant knew that free representation was available. The only suggestion made as supportive of a conclusion that appellant did possess the requisite knowledge is a statement in the post-conviction court’s opinion that appellant had prior criminal experience. An identical suggestion was made and expressly rejected in <em>Mullins. </em>See <a href="/pa/428/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="428 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="1912420" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0195-01">428 Pa. at 200</a>, 286 A. 2d at 785.</p>

It appears that Blose’s 1965 commitment as a parole violator was the result of the perpetration of an unrelated burglary. When recommitted in 1965, his maximum sentence on the 1961 convictions was scheduled to expire on October 29, 1967 and thus apparently Blose’s sentence for the 1961 offenses has now expired. Since Blose is still in custody, we assume it is by virtue of the sentence imposed in 1965 on the unrelated burglary. Our cases now establish that, where a prisoner is presently serving a valid sentence the term of which is computed from the date he completed a constitutionally invalid sentence, he may attack that invalid sentence. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Ulmer v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/421/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="421 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1900315" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0040-01">421 Pa. 40</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20233" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="218 A.2d 233">218 A. 2d 233</a> (1966); <em>Commonwealth, ex rel. Ackerman v. Russell, </em><a href="/pa-super/209/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="209 Pa. Super. 467" data-case-ids="778097" data-case-paths="/pa-super/209/0467-01">209 Pa.

The proper procedure in such a situation is to grant the prisoner a new trial on the constitutionally invalid convictions and direct the trial court to compute the expiration date of the prisoner’s sentence on the valid, subsequent conviction as if he had been committed on the date he began to serve the balance of, his invalid sentence (in this case, October 29, 1965, the date appellant was recommitted as a parole violator).</p>
