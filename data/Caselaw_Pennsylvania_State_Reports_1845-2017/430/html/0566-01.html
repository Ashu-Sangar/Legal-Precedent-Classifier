The resolution states that the taking is “for the public school purposes of providing necessary, useful and convenient parking facilities for school district employees and visitors to the School Administration Building, adequate facilities not being otherwise available, and for the additional public school purpose of acquiring a building site for desired and necessary future expansion of administrative facilities, in order to avoid excessive cost and waste of public funds if acquisition is delayed.” After the filing of the declarations of taking, the condemnees filed preliminary objections which were answered by the Board. The condemnees then served written interrogatories on the Board and later secured an order for discovery by deposition. In answer to the interrogatories, the Board stated that no plans had been drawn for future buildings on the involved <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>properties and that the Board had not formally authorized the drawing of any such plans. The depositions of the Board’s long range planning committee also indicate that plans for building expansion are unformed and only in the conversational stage. No hearing was held and no evidence was taken on the issues of fact raised by the preliminary objections. Oral argument on the preliminary objections was limited, with the Board’s consent, to the question of whether or not the Board has the power to condemn property for parking facilities. The lower court sustained the preliminary objections solely because it concluded that the Board’s condemnation power does not extend to the acquisition of land for parking facilities for administrative employees.</p>

To deny the Board this power is serious not only because off street parking usually is desirable for buildings located in congested urban areas, but also because this Court has held that a school board may be compelled to comply with a zoning ordinance requiring provision for off street park<a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>ing in the erection of a new building. <em>School District of Philadelphia, v.

    <p id="b601-3" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[116,588,1155,752]]]'>In approaching the question of whether or not the legislature intended to deny the Board this power, it is significant that the phrase “proper school purposes” in §703 of the Act of March 10, 1949, supra, replaced the phrase “school buildings and play grounds” in §602 of the Act of May 18, 1911, P. L. 309. This substitution, fairly read, not only left the Board’s power less precisely defined, but also broadened it somewhat. Thus the acquisition of a building to be used solely for administration undoubtedly is for a proper school purpose<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> although an administration building may not be unquestionably within the term “school building,” which could be read to imply a school house where classes are held.</p>

First, superintendents and supervisors who have central of-' fices in an administration building must have occasions when duty requires their presence in scattered parts of the school district. The availability and effectiveness of these professionals, no doubt, is greatly enhanced by their use of automobile transportation. <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>Second, teachers, principals and other staff scattered throughout the school system must have occasions when they are required to attend meetings together in the central administration building. To do so without an excessive investment in time, they frequently will have to use automobile transportation. With reference to any school district facility, automobiles will be incident to its operation for other reasons. For instance, professionals, as well as secretarial, clerical and maintenance staff, may not accept employment unless they can commute to and from work by automobile. This might be common in areas where public transportation does not serve either the employee’s home or the school district’s facility. Even where public transportation is available, we must recognize that today a great part of the public is unwilling to use it because they are almost addicted to the convenience and independence provided by the automobile. Since automobiles are a necessary incident to the operation of school district facilities, off street parking is a practical necessity. The streets simply are not adequate and sometimes are not available for parking. Consequently, the acquisition of land for off street parking, which is a practical necessity to the effective and efficient operation of a school system, is certainly a “proper school purpose.” To interpret the statute any more narrowly would be to frustrate its obvious" intent to delegate to the Board authority to discharge the legislature’s constitutional obligation to provide for an efficient public school system.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

A logical corollary of this right is that one of the condemnor’s motives for presently acquiring land needed for future expansion may be to avoid excessive costs and waste of public funds if acquisition is delayed. Indeed, in some circumstances, a foresighted concern for avoiding excessive cost can <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>properly be the major motive.

    <p id="b604-4" data-blocks='[["BL_604.4",604,[202,553,1151,981]]]'>Of course the acquisition of land not presently needed cannot be for real estate speculation and future sale. Unless the property is acquired for an authorized public use, and after a suitable investigation leading to an intelligent, informed judgment by the condemnor, the condemnation is invalid. <em>Winger v.

The last group of condemnees’ preliminary objections invoke these principles. The condemnees charge that the Board has rented land adjacent to their property to a third party for use as a public parking lot which shows that their own properties are not needed by the Board for parking; further, the condemnees charge that the Board is not condemning their property for school purposes, but for undisclosed speculative purposes and for the benefit of undisclosed parties who do not have the power of condemnation; finally, the condemnees charge that the action of the Board is arbitrary and capricious.</p>

L. 84, Art. IV, §406(e), 26 P.S. §1-406(e). The condemnees failed to come forward with any evidence.
