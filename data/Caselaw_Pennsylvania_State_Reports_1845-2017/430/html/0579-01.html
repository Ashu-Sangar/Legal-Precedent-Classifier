    <p id="b610-11" data-blocks='[["BL_610.17",610,[205,1658,1149,371]]]'>Appellee, Borough of Hanover, enacted Ordinance No. 1164, effective for the fiscal year 1963, Ordinance No. 1207, effective for the fiscal year 1964, and Ordinance No. 1254, effective for the fiscal year 1965. Each of said ordinances levied a tax, inter alia, upon the sale of admissions to amusements at the rate of five per cent of the amount charged or paid.</p>

    <p id="b611-4" data-blocks='[["BL_611.4",611,[131,523,1153,981]]]'>The only real issue is whether the instant case can be distinguished from the recent case of <em>Swatara Twp. v. Auto. Bowling Center, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/419/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="419 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1896923" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0482-01">419 Pa. 482</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=214%20A.2d%20725" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="214 A.2d 725">214 A. 2d 725</a> (1965).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The court below held that it could not, and we agree. In <em>Swatara, </em>we held that the ordinance therein involved was not in violation of the “Tax Anything Act”, Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145, as amended, 53 P.S. §6851, et seq. That Act prohibits local municipalities from imposing any tax upon, inter alia, personal property that is subject to state taxation. Appellants in <em>Swatara, </em>as do appellants here, contended that the tax imposed upon the sale of bowling admissions was actually a tax upon the privilege of employing the personal property, i.e., the bowling equipment, that was subject to state taxation. We rejected that argument, holding that the stated burden of the ordinances was upon the patron rather than upon the bowling concern.</p>

Yet very similar duties were imposed on the proprietor in <em>Swat ara, </em>and we held that such duties were “consistent with a construction which views the one conducting an amusement as the collector of the tax and not the intended or true taxpayer.” The minor variations between the language of the <em>Swatara </em>ordinances and that of the instant ordinances cannot serve as the basis for a distinction between the two situations. Language referring to the proprietor “paying” the tax is certainly consistent with the view of the proprietor as the collector, transmitting or paying over the tax to the municipality. Although it is true that taxing statutes are to be strictly construed against the taxing authority, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, §58, 46 P.S. §558, it is also true that the polestar for construction of a statute (or ordinance) is the intention of the legislative body, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, §51, 46 P.S. §551. When the words are not explicit, it behooves the interpreter to consider the purpose of the law. Surely the Board of Commissioners is presumed to intend an ordinance that is valid, rather than one that is invalid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We therefore hold that <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>tbe instant ordinances, like tkose in <em>Swatwa, </em>place tbe burden of tbe tax on tbe patron, not tbe proprietor, and affirm tbe decrees of tbe court below.</p>

Equity is a permissible forum, but not because of a constitutional challenge to a taxing statute as in <em>Lynch v.
