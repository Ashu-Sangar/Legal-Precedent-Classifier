(3) No permit to erect or maintain any sign in the above area shall be granted unless the sign for which such permit is sought: (a) complies in every respect with all other applicable requirements of this Code and with the regulations of the Fairmount Park Commission; (b) has been approved by the Art Commission.”</p>

When this was discovered, plaintiff was requested to seek the necessary approvals. Plaintiff then sought approval of the Art Commission which determined that the signs are aesthetically unacceptable and disapproved them. Thereupon plaintiff instituted a complaint in equity, requesting the court to restrain the city from interfering with the signs and to order it to issue the sign permits. On preliminary objections, the court ruled that plaintiff had not exhausted its administrative remedies and accordingly dismissed the complaint.</p>

The Commissioner refused to issue the permits on the ground—later reaffirmed in an opinion of the City Solicitor to the Board—that the Board’s decision was illegal since approval of the Fairmount Park Commission had not been obtained. Plaintiff then requested the approval of the Fairmount Park Commission which disapproved the signs because they do not comply with Fairmount Park Regulation 14-2003 (3) which provides: “Billboards: Approval for the erection, alteration, use, location and display of billboards will be granted provided they are to be unilluminated and not more than twelve by twenty-five feet in size, <em>are set bach not less than one hundred fifty feet from the said boundary Unes </em>and upon any individual lot of ground are not less than fifty feet apart.” (Emphasis added.) This decision also was appealed to the Board which again ordered that the sign permits be issued. The Commissioner again refused to issue the permits on the ground that, in the opinion of the City Solicitor, the Board’s decision is contrary to law.

      <em>Merchants’ Warehouse Go. </em>is different from this case in this crucial respect: the Board in this case does not exercise judicial power as it was exercised by the Auditor General and State Treasurer in <em>Merchants’ Warehouse Go. </em>The Auditor General and State Treasurer were granted judicial power by the state legislature. They constituted a court under Pennsylvania Constitution Article V, §1. On the other hand, the Board derives its power from the First Class City Home Buie Act of April 21, 1949, P. L. 665, 53 P.S. §13101 et seq. That enabling legislation provides: “Subject to the limitations hereinafter prescribed, the city taking advantage of this act . . . shall have complete powers of <em>legislation and administration </em>in relation to its municipal functions.” 53 P.S. §13131 (Emphasis added.) Clearly judicial power under Pennsylvania Constitution Article V, §1 is absent from this legislative grant. Moreover, the Philadelphia Home Buie Charter, adopted pursuant to the First Class City Home Buie Act, clearly does not purport to grant the Board a court’s power to independently malee decisions on matters of law. Section 3-100 of the Charter provides: “The <em>executive and administrative </em>work of the City shall be performed by: . . . (f) The following departmental boards and commissions, which are either created or placed, as the case may be, in the respective departments as follows: ... In the Department of Licenses and Inspections . . . Board of License and Inspection Beview.” (Emphasis added.) The Charter <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>clearly provides that with reference to legal matters the position of the City Solicitor binds “officers, department, <em>board </em>or commission.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thus, as a municipal agency whose function is defined by the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, the Board is granted only executive and administrative powers and is required to apply the law as it is determined by the City Solicitor. Nowhere does it appear that the Board is empowered to make binding determinations of law. Consequently in treating the Board’s decision as binding, regardless of its correctness, the lower court erred.</p>

L. 680, §20, 53 P.S. §14808 and Rule 90 of the Philadelphia Plumbing Code where the Department, whose refusal <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>of a permit was being appealed had no such power.

Since in this case the Department similarly has no power to issue a permit unless the sign “complies in every respect . . . with the regulations of the Fairmount Park Commission,” Philadelphia Code §14-2003, the city reasons that the Board which reviews the Department’s action also lacks the power.</p>

In the past this Court has ruled that aesthetic considerations alone do not justify police regulation. E.g., <em>Norate Corp., Inc. v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/417/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="417 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1893983" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0397-01">417 Pa. 397</a>, 406 n. 8, <a href="/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20890" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="207 A.2d 890">207 A. 2d 890</a>, 895 n. 8 (1965); <em>Rogalski v.

The vitality of this position under both the federal and state constitutions has been challenged here, but the question need not be reached.</p>
    <p id="b50-5" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[193,1872,1154,490]],["BL_51.1",51,[104,396,1159,598]]]'>It is elementary that a law or legislative enactment is presumed to be constitutional and the parly who asserts that such is unconstitutional has the burden of proof. E.g., <em>Anstine v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/411/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="411 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1886002" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0033-01">411 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20712" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="190 A.2d 712">190 A. 2d 712</a> (1963); <em>Hadley’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/336/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="336 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1195629" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0100-01">336 Pa. 100</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20874" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="6 A.2d 874">6 A. 2d 874</a> (1939). We are unpersuaded that the challenged ordinance regulates private property solely for aesthetic purposes. For instance, the prohibition of signs within 150 feet of Roosevelt Boule<a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>vard, one of the most highly used highways in the City of Philadelphia, may be intended to prevent the distraction of drivers and the obstruction of their view, thereby promoting safety. We are unpersuaded that this regulation is an unreasonble means to accomplish this or other goals within the police power. The ordinance is not unreasonable on its face and the stipulations on which this case was tried do not present grounds on which we can find the ordinance unreasonable. In short, the plaintiff has not satisfied its burden of proof.</p>
    <p id="b51-4" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[102,1008,1157,478]]]'>Plaintiff submits that the Fairmount Park Commission disapproved the signs partly because of a policy against signs unassociated with the site and argues that such a policy is invalid as an attempt to enact a zoning ordinance without a comprehensive plan. Since plaintiff’s signs do not conform with a valid regulation, it is unimportant that the signs were disapproved for an additional reason which may or may not be valid.</p>
