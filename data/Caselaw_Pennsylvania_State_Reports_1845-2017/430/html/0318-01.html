Mary Townsend Cochran, decedent’s niece by marriage, has appealed to this Court from the several decrees (actually one decree which covered several subjects) of the Orphans’ Court, which sustained decedent’s will and her inter vivos Trust and the three amendments thereto. The <em>final </em>Decree, from which these appeals have been taken, is as follows:</p>

    <p id="b351-4" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[126,680,1158,1099]]]'>Decedent’s inter vivos revocable Deed of Trust of 1963 provided a life estate for appellant as well as a remainder interest for her and for her issue. This 1963 Trust was first amended on February 20, 1964; this amendment substituted certain charities in lieu of several gifts to appellant and her issue. Settlor’s charitable intent was continued in the March 6, 1964 amendment to the Trust, which merely substituted different charities for the previously named charitable beneficiaries. By June 14, 1965, decedent had transferred a substantial portion of her property to her inter vivos Trust and, as a result, her existing will was changed to the one here under attack, namely, her will dated June 14, 1965. Certain legacies were eliminated from the will because they were inserted into the inter vivos Trust amendments, and the principal change was the reduction of contestant-appellant’s $100,000 legacy to a legacy of $10,000. Decedent died, we repeat, on October 1, 1965, and her will of June 14, 1965 was thereafter probated.</p>

Appellant first contends that the Orphans’ Court erred in refusing to permit the deposition of '27 (sometimes alleged to be more than 30) individuals and in limiting the testimony and depositions to six; persons, who had testified or had been deposed for eight days in a transcript of over 1,000 pages. The names of these 27 desired deposing persons were culled by appellant from the answers to interrogatories served <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>on appellees, as well as from the many documents. Appellant contends that these 27 persons are individuals “who <em>might be able to shed light </em>on the issues.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Appellant further complains that she was not given copies of “all memoranda, correspondence and writings relating to [decedent’s testamentary writings] and/or other dealings of the said [executors] with the said decedent,” and “was denied access” thereto. This contention was made after appellant had been furnished with copies of all of decedent’s testamentary instruments subsequent to December 3, 1960, as well as with the originals of the five instruments she attacks. In addition, a multitude of other writings and records relating to many aspects of decedent’s affairs had been tendered to appellant.</p>
    <p id="b352-4" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[195,1211,1152,539]]]'>Appellant relies upon <em>Thompson Will, </em><a href="/pa/416/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="416 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="1893048" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0249-01">416 Pa. 249</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%2021" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="206 A.2d 21">206 A. 2d 21</a>, to support her first contention. • In <em>Thompson </em>Will&gt; the Court appropriately said (page 261) : “. . . Nothing in this opinion shall be construed as a bar to the allowance of discovery if the matters sought are relevant to the issue of the cause. While ‘fishing expeditions’ are not to be countenanced under the guise of discovery, requests for discovery must be considered with liberality as the rule rather than the exception.”</p>
    <p id="b352-5" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[193,1766,1152,307]]]'>Under the facts in the instant case, the Orphans’ Court committed no abuse of discretion or error of law in disallowing appellant’s demand for a further sweeping discovery which in reality amounted to a “fishing expedition,” and these contentions of appellant are devoid of merit.</p>
    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.6",352,[191,2096,1152,207]],["BL_353.1",353,[151,390,1157,989]]]'>2. Appellant next contends that she has been denied her fundamental right of cross-examination because she was prevented by the hearing Judge from pursuing the questioning of Philip Price, Esq.—who <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>was a witness to the Trust amendment dated February 20, 1964—concerning his whereabouts on that date. Price, one of Philadelphia’s outstanding lawyers, had testified on direct examination that he witnessed the' settlor sign the Trust amendment on that date. Appellant cross-examined Price, and during the cross-examination Price was unable to remember the exact date he went on a cruise in 1964, or the name of the boat. From this, appellant argues that Price could not have witnessed the settlor’s signing of the Trust amendment on February 20, 1964, and that that proves, or tends to prove, that the Trust amendment of February 20, 1964 was a forgery. It was appellant’s expressed intention to prove that Price was not in Philadelphia on that date and, therefore, could not have witnessed the signing of the Trust amendment, and this supports her contention that the said Trust amendment must have been a forgery.</p>
