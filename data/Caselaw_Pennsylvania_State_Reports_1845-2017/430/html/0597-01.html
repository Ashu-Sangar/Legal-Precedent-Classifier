Evidence that one of the deceased passengers in plaintiff’s automobile had been drinking heavily before the accident was clearly inadmissible apart from the contradiction. See <em>Wentworth v. Doliner, </em><a href="/pa/399/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="399 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1290602" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0356-01">399 Pa. 356</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.2d%20562" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="160 A.2d 562">160 A. 2d 562</a> (1960). The evidence introduced during plaintiff’s case in chief indicating that there had been little intoxicants at the picnic also was inadmissible unless and until evidence of drinking on the part of the plaintiff sufficient to raise the issue of contributory negligence had been introduced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Therefore, since the contradiction concerned a collateral matter, it should have been excluded.</p>
    <p id="b631-2" data-blocks='[["BL_631.3",631,[124,401,1157,1152]]]'>
      <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>The lower court ruled, however, that since the question of the presence of intoxicants at the picnic was introduced on direct examination, the rule proscribing contradiction on collateral matters does not apply. With this we cannot agree. While dictum improvidently employed in <em>Bruno v. </em>Brown, <a href="/pa/414/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="414 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="1890372" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0361-01">414 Pa. 361</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.2d%20405" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="200 A.2d 405">200 A. 2d 405</a> (1964), lends support to the position that contradiction is permissible on collateral matters first introduced on direct examination, a scholarly reading of the opinion clearly reveals that the decisional ruling in <em>Bruno </em>was that the evidence there involved was not directed to a collateral matter. This is why it was admissible. The decision in <em>Bruno </em>in no way rested on the exception advocated by the defendant and accepted by the lower court. Nor are we aware of any appellate decision in Pennsylvania in which such an exception has been recognized. Moreover, highly respected authority strongly disapproves of such an exception. 3 Wigmore, Evidence, §1007 (3d ed. 1940). Therefore the general rule prohibiting the contradiction of a witness on collateral matters should have been applied.</p>
    <p id="b631-3" data-blocks='[["BL_631.4",631,[134,1564,1151,815]]]'>Although application of the rule prohibiting contradiction on collateral matters normally should be left to the discretion of the trial court, 3 Wigmore, Evidence, §1003 at pp. 659-60 (3d ed. 1940), where the contradiction concerns a matter which is collateral because it is unreasonably prejudicial to one of the parties, the trial court abuses its discretion by permitting the contradiction. That is the case here. The evidence of heavy drinking by one of the passengers in plaintiff’s automobile unreasonably prejudiced plaintiff and the trial court’s instruction to the jury that the evidence was not to be considered as proof that the plaintiff himself had been drinking intoxicants prior to the accident was insufficient to overcome this prejudice. See <em>Wentworth v. Doliner, </em>supra.</p>

About midnight, the group departed in two automobiles, one of which was owned by plaintiff. Plaintiff’s car was occupied by himself and four of his friends. They intended to go to Chinatown for something to eat. As plaintiff’s car was proceeding north on Delaware Avenue at Pier 98 South, it collided with defendant’s switching engine, which had entered Delaware Avenue from a lead extending from Pier 98 to the defendant’s tracks on the west side of Delaware Avenue. Plaintiff did not prove why he did not see defendant’s engine and testified that he had no recollection of the occurrence of the accident. It is to be noted that following the accident plaintiff told the accident investigation officer that he had been driving his car. However, at the trial he claimed that he could not remember whether he was driving his car or was simply a passenger therein.</p>

The engine was visible from at least 400 feet, and plaintiff’s automobile (1) was operated in excess of 60 miles per hour and (2) was neither braked nor (3) did it swerve prior to the collision.

This evidence was admitted for the <em>sole and restricted purpose of rebutting the testimony of one of plaintiffs witnesses </em>who had testified in direct examination that he did not see any whisky at the picnic but saw about two bottles of beer, and did not see plaintiff drink any beer.
