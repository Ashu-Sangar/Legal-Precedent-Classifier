Section 4, on the other hand, focuses upon whether the opportunity to challenge an alleged constitutional deprivation is now foreclosed by a failure to assert that deprivation in earlier litigation. This is a rule of procedural finality, not one governing whether an accused has decided to forego a substantive constitutional right to which he would otherwise be entitled. Such a distinction has received explicit recognition in our cases. Discussing whether failure to ob<a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>jeet to the admission of an allegedly coerced confession at trial precluded, under the doctrine of waiver, a collateral attack upon that confession, we said: “Waiver is here used not in the sense of whether the right itself was waived, a standard which is part of the constitutional right and thus a constitutional imperative for the states, but rather whether the opportunity to litigate an asserted denial of the right was waived by failure to do so in a prior proceeding.” <em>Commonwealth v. Snyder, </em><a href="/pa/427/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="427 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1910414" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0083-01">427 Pa. 83</a>, 87 n.1, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20530" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="233 A.2d 530">233 A. 2d 530</a>, 533 n.1 (1967).</p>

The waiver it is concerned with is based upon the post-conviction applicant’s failure to raise the now claimed constitutional deprivation in a prior proceeding; and to the extent that a <em>record </em>is required, all that need be shown is a prior post-conviction proceeding conducted with the assistance of counsel. It is now well established that §4’s standard of waiver, i.e., whether the post-conviction applicant has deliberately bypassed state procedures available for litigation of his claim, is identical to that employed by the federal courts. Compare <em>Commonwealth v. Cheeks, </em><a href="/pa/429/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="429 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1913547" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0089-01">429 Pa. 89</a>, 97, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20793" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="239 A.2d 793">239 A. 2d 793</a>, 797 (1968) and <em>Commonwealth v.

Ct. 564</a>, 570 (1965). Two issues are thus posed: (1) is the Post Conviction Hearing Act an available state procedure and (2) can a prisoner, who fails to raise an issue in a prior post-conviction proceeding during which he was represented by counsel, be deemed to have deliberately bypassed an available state procedure. As §2 of the act proclaims, it is available to a prisoner to assert any claimed constitutional denial: “This act establishes a post-conviction procedure for providing relief from convictions obtained and sentences imposed without due <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>process of law. The procedure hereby established shall encompass all common law and statutory procedures for the same purpose that exist when this statute takes effect, including habeas corpus and coram nobis.”</p>
    <p id="b478-4" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[200,602,1152,699]]]'>Given the availability of this procedure to assert any of the prisoner’s claims and assuming that the prisoner was represented (as was appellant) during the proceedings connected with his first petition, failure to assert in that first proceeding claims which were then available would constitute a deliberate bypass of an available state procedure thus foreclosing later litigation of that claim. See <em>Commonwealth v. Stevens, </em><a href="/pa/429/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="429 Pa. 593" data-case-ids="1913468" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0593-01">429 Pa. 593</a>, 601, <a href="/citations/?q=240%20A.2d%20536" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="240 A.2d 536">240 A. 2d 536</a>, 540 (1968); <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

      <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>The facts proven before subsection (c) applies would be that a post-conviction applicant participated in a prior post-conviction proceeding at which time he was represented by counsel. The ultimate fact presumed would be that failure to assert the now claimed constitutional denial in the prior proceeding was knowing and understanding. We find in <em>Norvell v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">373 U.S. 420</a>, <a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">83 S.

Ct. 585</a> (1956); his transcript was no longer available because of the death of the court reporter. Stressing that Norvell had trial counsel, the Supreme Court denied Norvell relief: “For, where transcripts are no longer available, Illinois may rest on the presumption that he who had a lawyer at the trial had one who could protect his rights on appeal.” <a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">373 U.S. at 424</a>, <a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">83 S.

If Illinois can rest on the presumption that trial counsel was available to protect an indigent’s right to a free transcript, we believe Pennsylvania can rest upon the presumption that post-conviction counsel informed his client of all the available grounds of attack.

In either case a dismissal without giving leave to amend would be a dismissal for want of particularity and such a dismissal is prohibited by §7.
