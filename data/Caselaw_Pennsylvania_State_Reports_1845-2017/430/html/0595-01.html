    <p id="b626-8" data-blocks='[["BL_626.10",626,[200,1061,1146,533]]]'>This is an action in equity filed by appellants, residents of Birmingham Township, Delaware County, seeking to (1) enjoin appellee, James Julian, Inc., owner of a tract of land in said township from removing earth from said land as an improper commercial enterprise within an area zoned for solely residential purposes, and (2) void a contract negotiated between James Julian, Inc. and appellee, Birmingham Township, which contract permitted the enterprise complained of by appellants.</p>
    <p id="b626-9" data-blocks='[["BL_626.11",626,[200,1607,1145,261]]]'>James Julian, Inc. is a general contractor engaged in the construction of a federal highway known as Interstate 95. The earth which Julian was removing from its tract in Birmingham Township was being used as “fill” in the construction of this highway.</p>

Hence, since the alleged unlawful conduct <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>on the part of appellees lias ceased to exist, and since there remains nothing for this Court to enjoin, the issues involved in this appeal are now moot. Our action in refusing to review the merits of the present controversy should in no way he interpreted by the parties to be an approval or disapproval of the lower court’s failure to grant an injunction. Likewise, this should not be construed as a sanctioning or licensing of the alleged unlawful conduct on the part of appellee, James Julian, Inc.</p>
