Approximately seven months later, an arbitration panel made an award in favor of Spinelli and against Schlessinger and Maxwell in the amount of $1300 and, upon payment of this award, a judgment was entered of record on May 31, 1967 in favor of Spinelli and against Schlessinger and Maxwell and then marked satisfied.</p>

      <em>Saber v. Supplee-Wills-Jones Milk </em>Co., supra, effectively answers the first two contentions of Spinelli, i.e., as to the insurance carrier being the real party in interest and the “subrogation receipt”. In <em>Saber, </em>Saber had received from his insurance carrier payment for the property damage to his motor vehicle, less a $50 deductible amount and had executed a “loan receipt” upon payment to him by his carrier.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Saber first instituted a suit for his personal injuries and in that action recovered a judgment. His insurance carrier later brought suit in Saber’s name for the amount of the property damage including the $50 deductible <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>loss not paid by the carrier. The trial court granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the judgment in the prior suit barred recovery in the second action and from the entry of such judgment Saber appealed. In affirming the entry of such judgment, the Superior Court held that the rule prohibiting the splitting of a cause of action was unaffected by the presence of the insurance carrier in the action as a “subrogee”. The distinction which Spinelli’s counsel seeks to draw between <em>Saber </em>and the case at bar to the effect that <em>Saber </em>was under a “loan receipt” rather than a “subrogation receipt” was considered by the Superior Court and rejected. A reading of <em>Saber </em>clearly reveals that it was not only argued but determined by the Court upon the theory of a subrogation <em>in fact </em>and not upon the theory of a “loan receipt”.

Providence Washington Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/383/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="383 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="1261925" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0542-01">383 Pa. 542</a>, 545, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.2d%20495" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="119 A.2d 495">119 A. 2d 495</a> (1956).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> That Maxwell, Schlessinger and their carrier <em>knew </em>Spinelli’s carrier was a subrogee in the first action does not render the <em>Fields </em>rule inapplicable.</p>

In my view, there is substantial justification for a different rule when an insurance company has been subrogated to its insured’s property claim against the alleged tortfeasor and the company has commenced suit and obtained judgment prior to the institution of an action for personal injuries by the insured. Despite the fact that the insurance company’s claim was brought in the name of appellant, our Court has consistently held that a subrogee is the real party in interest. <em>Franz Tractor Company v. Providence Washington Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/383/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="383 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="1261925" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0542-01">383 Pa. 542</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.2d%20495" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="119 A.2d 495">119 A. 2d 495</a> (1956); <em>Spires v. Hanover Fire Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/364/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="364 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1223512" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0052-01">364 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.2d%20828" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="70 A.2d 828">70 A. 2d 828</a> (1950). There is no question that appellant was merely a formal party without any control over the prosecution of the insurance company’s action, and without any proprietary or financial interest in the resolution of that action except appellant’s possible right to .$100 which represents the deductible feature of the insurance policy. Notwithstanding this <em>de minimis </em>pecuniary interest, the real party in interest is the person who controls an action to enforce rights and who is legally entitled to give a complete discharge to the defendant upon performance. See <em>Spires v. Hanover Fire Insurance Company, </em>supra. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to understand why appellant should be barred from recovering in the instant case when he had absolutely no control over the course of action which his insurance company pursued. Moreover, such an exception to the general rule against splitting a cause of action, while it does permit a multiplicity of suits and subjects the alleged tortfeasor to two suits instead of one, nevertheless, in my opinion, promotes the ends of justice. The law ought to permit <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>an injured party to collect that which his insurer has bound itself to pay without jeopardizing and prejudicing his rights against the actual wrongdoer. With the substantial backlog of cases in our courts, and the attendant delay in finally litigating the parties’ rights and liabilities, we ought to encourage an expeditious procedure whereby one who has suffered harm will be recompensed with as little delay as possible by his own insurance company. It seems to me that this policy should take precedence over the policy of protecting a defendant from possible multiple litigation. For these reasons, I would permit appellant to maintain this action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of appellees alleged negligence.</p>
