On Saturday, October 19,1963, the Freemans, their son-in-law, Donald Bauman, several other relatives and a few neighbors, including the plaintiff Glass who volunteered to help without compensation, were engaged in blacktopping this parking lot. The blacktop was delivered to the premises by truck, then spread with shovels and rakes and finally rolled by a nine hundred pound tractor with steel wheels.</p>

However, the plaintiff himself testified that on the morning of the accident Jimmy was riding on a wooden plank extending from the rear of the roller then being operated by his father; that he warned Bauman it was dangerous for the child to ride on the roller, and that Bauman responded by thumbing his nose at the plaintiff.

In <em>Liney, </em>we held that a complaint was properly dismissed on preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. In that case, an automobile parked with its keys in the ignition was stolen from in front of the defendant’s garage which was located in an area where car thefts were rather frequent. The thief later negligently injured the plaintiff. In holding that the complaint failed to state a cause of action, this Court reasoned that “assuming . . . the defendant should have foreseen the likelihood of the theft of the automobile, nothing existed in the present case to put it [i.e., the defendant] on notice that the thief would be an incompetent driver.”- And we went on to distinguish a similar case, <em>Anderson v. Bushong Pontiac Co., </em><a href="/pa/404/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="404 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1301483" data-case-paths="/pa/404/0382-01">404 Pa. 382</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.2d%20771" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="171 A.2d 771">171 A. 2d 771</a> (1961), in which the opposite result had been reached. We noted that in <em>Anderson </em>“several salient facts . . . clearly put the defendant in .that ease on notice, not only that the automobile was likely to be stolen, but also that it was likely to be stolen ... by an incompetent driver.” For precisely this reason, <em>Anderson </em>controls this case. Since it was foreseeable that the boy might attempt to drive the tractor, it also was foreseeable that he would drive it negligently. A seven year old hardly can be expected to have the ability or judgment to operate a piece of heavy equipment safely.</p>

The Free-mans knew or should have known of their ability to control Bauman, because he was acting on their land for their benefit. See Restatement 2d, Torts §318, comment a. They knew or should have known of the opportunity to control him, because they were present on the blacktopping site. See Restatement 2d, Torts §318, comment b. They knew or should have known of the need to control him, because the operation of construction equipment around working men creates apparent risks. With respect to the second duty, all that is necessary for its existence is that plaintiff be a business invitee. He was. Plaintiff testified that Mrs. Freeman expressly invited him to help blacktop the tavern’s parking lot, a business related activity.

By failing to provide supervision, the Freemans breached both their duty to prevent a third person permitted to conduct an activity on their land (i.e., Bauman) from creating an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to plaintiff and their duty to discover the negligent acts of third persons (i.e., Bauman and Jimmy) and to warn or otherwise protect plaintiff.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

It is argued that plaintiff’s construction experience makes him an expert in dangers associated with heavy equipment and that plaintiff’s expert knowledge together with his observation of Jimmy playing around the unattended tractor should have alerted him to danger. Viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, however, he did not have reason to foresee danger from what he observed. Plaintiff testified that when he saw Jimmy playing around the unattended tractor he did not know <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>its motor was running because a victrola on a porch near him was playing loud music. Thus a jury could reasonably find that plaintiff’s attention to his work was not negligent while the father’s conduct in leaving the tractor unattended, knowing that its engine was running, was negligent. Similarly, a jury could reasonably find that lack of vigilance by the plaintiff was not negligent while lack of supervision by the Free-mans was negligent. The workers who were too busy to look out for themselves could assume that the one in charge would take reasonable steps to protect them from moving vehicles. Plaintiff testified that Freeman was in charge of the job.

Additionally, although at the conclusion of the charge the trial judge specifically invited counsel to state any objections they entertained thereto, Bauman’s counsel remained silent and failed to enter even a general exception. Failure of trial counsel to manifest any disagreement with the court’s instructions pre<a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>eludes, in the absence of fundamental and prejudicial error, a subsequent contention that it was erroneous. <em>James v.

The question of whether or not Bauman had an affirmative duty to warn plaintiff is not without difficulty. See generally, 2 Harper <em>&amp; </em>James, The Law of Torts §18.6 (1956) ; Restatement 2d, Torts §321 (1965). It is unnecessary to decide this question, however, since Bauman clearly could be found to have otherwise breached a duty by acting negligently in leaving the tractor under the circumstances.</p>

However, the trial judge charged the jury that Bauman was not the agent, servant or employee of the Freemans. And the Freemans submit that even if Bauman was their servant, the plaintiff is barred from recovery by the fellow servant rule. It is unnecessary to decide the correctness of these positions since the Freemans’ liability is supportable on a completely independent theory, i.e., their own negligent failure to prevent or discover dangers to plaintiff’s safety.</p>
