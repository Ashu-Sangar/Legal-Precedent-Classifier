Douglas Minnay, aged 15, had been invited by Gaskins to live temporarily with him in his grandmother’s home. During the evening of May 18, 1966, an argument concerning a watch developed between the two boys. According to the testimony of witnesses, Minnay had been pushing Gaskins in front of his grandmother’s home. Gaskins then went inside, picked up a knife which he placed in his pocket, and told his grandmother that <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>Minnay was bothering him. Gaskins’s grandmother came outside and told Minnay to leave Dwight alone. While Dwight was standing on the porch,' after his grandmother had gone inside her house, Minnay rah up the steps and pushed him. Gaskins then jumped down the steps, took the knife from his pocket, and fatally stabbed Minnay in the chest.</p>

Deceased: Douglas Minnay. . . .” The proceedings were continued, in order to enable Gaskins. to obtain counsel, and the Assistant District Attorney, when asked whether the Commonwealth would request certification of the case, answered, “I have not discussed it with anyone.

Indeed, the record discloses that Judge Wright considered that he was sitting both as a magistrate and as a Juvenile Court Judge when he made the following statement during the course of the May 27th hearing: “Now, before cross-examining, there is a complete summary of the statement given to you by this young man, Dwight GasMns; is that correct or is there something else in the statement which you feel would be of interest to this Court sitting <em>either as a Magistrate </em>or a Juvenile Judge that relates to this incident?” This statement, coupled with customary local practice, clearly shows that Judge Wright was sitting, inter alia, as a committing magistrate.</p>

'To hold otherwise would in effect transfer the responsibility for and the power of disposing of murder cases from the Courts of Oyer and Terminer, which are Constitutional Courts that have been given exclusive jurisdiction in murder cases, to the Juvenile division of the County Court, which was created by the Legislature, and in the creation of which the Legislature specifically limited its jurisdiction <em>to exclude “jurisdiction in the trial of indictments for murder, voluntary manslaughter. . . ” </em>Act of July 12, 1913, supra.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[198,1004,1155,596]]]'>We, therefore, hold that when a juvenile has been charged with murder, and a prima facie case has been made out by the Commonwealth in Juvenile Court proceedings, such juvenile must be held for further criminal proceedings. If a Court of proper jurisdiction should thereafter determine that it is in the best interests of both the child and Society that the criminal prosecution should not be pursued, that Court shall thereafter have the right to transfer jurisdiction to the Juvenile Court.

I have ruled on it, I don’t want to hear anymore. Mr. Ostrow: If your Honor please—The Court: I don’t want to hear anything more about it.
