In 1964, E. State Street was widened from 33 feet, 16.5 feet of which was south of the center line, to 70 feet, 35 feet of which is south of the center line. The board of viewers, appointed by the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County on appellants’ petition, determined that the appellants are not entitled to damages because the 18.5 additional feet south of the center line had been dedicated to the public for highway purposes. On appeal, the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County agreed with the board of viewers that there liad been a dedication which barred appellants from collecting direct damages and dismissed the appeal, but referred the case bach to the board of viewers to assess consequential damages, if any. This appeal followed.</p>

The original plan was recorded in Mercer County on April 4, 1923, and a revised plan was recorded on December 31, 1929. Inasmuch as more than 21 years elapsed between the time when the plans were recorded and the time when the highway was widened and the land offered for dedication was first used by the public, the appellants contend that acceptance of the offers to dedicate<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> is barred by the Act of May 9, <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>1889, P.

But every statute is an expression of public policy to some extent. If the exception is not to swallow the rule, “public policy” must be limited to the clearest cases. Compare <em>Mamlin v.

    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[205,1051,1151,1148]]]'>The Act of May 9, 1889, supra, does not embody a rule so clearly in the public interest that a court is justified in calling it an expression of “public policy” with the effect that the Commonwealth is bound by its operation without being named therein or included by necessary implication. This conclusion is supported by a glance at the consequences of constructions which include or exclude the Commonwealth. To include the Commonwealth obviously will increase the cost, borne by the public, of condemnation. To exclude the Commonwealth will reduce the cost of condemnation to the public and will not work a hardship on the owners of land offered to the public because they are adequately protected apart from the statute. For example, unless an offer to the Commonwealth has been made irrevocable for special reasons, it can be withdrawn before acceptance. And, in circumstances where injustice would otherwise result, an offer cannot be accepted after an unreasonable delay even though it has not been revoked. See <em>Rung v. Shoneberger, </em><a href="/watts/2/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="2 Watts 23" data-case-ids="1840039" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0023-01">2 Watts 23</a> (1833).

The Act of May 9, 18S9, supra, appears to us to provide that acceptance of an offer to dedicate a street is ineffective if it does not occur within 21 years of the offer. The same public use of an existing street which preceded the offer of a strip to widen that street is not an unequivocal act manifesting an acceptance of the supplemental strip. See <em>Milford Borough v. Burnett, </em><a href="/pa/288/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="288 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="1100795" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0434-01">288 Pa. 434</a>, 438, <a href="/citations/?q=136%20A.%20669" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="136 A. 669">136 A. 669</a>, 671 (1927). The question of <em>whether </em>there has been an acceptance, which is the relevant inquiry under the Act of May 9, 1889, supra, should be distinguished from the question, which arises only after a decision that there has been an acceptance, of <em>what </em>has been accepted. Thus after it has been determined that public use of part of the width of a strip dedicated for street purposes constitutes an acceptance, then it also may be determined that it constitutes an acceptance of the entire width of the strip.

A decree confirming, modifying or changing the report shall constitute a final order.” In its definition of final order the Code conspicuously omits one of the four alternatives open to the common pleas court, i.e., referring the matter back to the viewers.

The Act of May 16, 1891, P.

No appeal is allowed from a decree referring the case back to the board for further proceedings. That the omission was intentional on the part of the legislature is apparent from the fact the same section of the act gives the Court of Common Pleas the power on exceptions not only to confirm, modify, change or correct the report, but also to refer it 'back to the same or new viewers.’ Had the legislature intended to allow. an appeal from such an order, it would have expressly so provided.” I think it evident that the legislation construed in <em>Trasoff </em>and the relevant provisions of the Eminent Domain Code are in all material particulars identical. See generally, Snitzer, Pennsylvania Eminent Domain §517-3 (1965).
