      <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Stevens v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/419/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="419 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1896928" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0001-01">419 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20613" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="218 A.2d 613">218 A. 2d 613</a> (1965) provides an indication. We there said that the hearing should elicit sufficient information to enable the post-convietion court to make the following determination: (id. at 23, 213 A. 2d at 625) : “The hearing court shall then determine whether, directly or indirectly, petitioner was denied the assistance of counsel in perfecting his appeal, whether a denial of counsel was a factor in the failure to take an appeal or whether some other reason was involved which amounted to an intelligent and knowing waiver of the right to appeal <em>and </em>the assistance of counsel.” (Emphasis supplied.) To intelligently waive a right, the accused must first know what that right is. <em>Douglas </em>makes clear that an essential ingredient of the right of an appeal (assuming, of course, that the now convicted accused is indigent) is the assistance of court appointed counsel to perfect and prosecute that appeal.</p>

      <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>It is evident from this record, however, that the Commonwealth contends that all an indigent accused must be told is that he can appeal. The error in this belief lies in the implicit assumption that the right of appeal can be segregated from the <em>Douglas </em>right of assistance of counsel for that purpose. Such conceptual segregation is not permissible for the reason that an accused’s decision to appeal may well be influenced by whether he knows that court appointed counsel is available. Certainly, the Commonwealth would not contend that an accused has waived the right to contest the voluntariness of a guilty plea if all the accused has been told is that he can protest the validity of that plea, but has not been told that the protest, if successful, will result in the award of a new trial. By the same token, an accused cannot waive his right to appeal and the concomitant <em>Douglas </em>right to assistance of appellate counsel unless he is told of his right to such court appointed counsel.</p>

Given the Commonwealth’s burden in this type of case, on this record we could conclude that it has not met that burden. However, it is at least arguable that our prior cases considering <em>Douglas </em>have not made it sufficiently clear that the Commonwealth must demonstrate, where the record is silent, that the post-conviction applicant was aware of <em>both </em>his right to appeal and his right to court appointed appellate counsel. Under these circumstances, we believe that the proper disposition of this litigation is a remand to the court below with directions that the Commonwealth be permitted to of<a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>fer testimony that appellant was aware of the rights accorded by the <em>Douglas </em>decision. If the hearing court finds that the Commonwealth is able to demonstrate that appellant knew of his right of appellate counsel, it shall enter an order denying relief. If, however, the Commonwealth fails to make such a demonstration, the court shall appoint counsel for the purpose of filing and arguing post-trial motions and, if necessary, prosecuting an appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In the event post-trial motions are denied, this Court will permit, upon motion of counsel, an appeal to be docketed as if timely filed and thereafter orally argued.</p>
