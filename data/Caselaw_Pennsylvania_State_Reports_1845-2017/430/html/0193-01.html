As a corollary to this oft-stated rule, it is also the law that where the amount due is not apparent from the face of the instrument but may be calculated from information which the instrument itself furnishes, then too can the prothonotary assess damages and enter judgment: <em>Noonan, Inc. v.

Superior Ct. 116</a>, 118 (1923), in an able opinion by the late Judge Henderson, who stated: “. . . the statute must be strictly followed for it does not give general authority as in the case of an attorney-at-law to appear and confess judgment. The statute was evidently adopted to enable a creditor to obtain a judgment on an obligation for the payment of money without the expense of the intervention of an attorney. Obviously, such judgment could <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>only be entered for an amount appearing to be due by the terms of the obligation, and this is what the statute expressly declares. The judgment is to be entered for an amount which appears to be due on the face of the instrument. When this amount cannot be ascertained without a resort to evidence outside of the writing, the statute does not support the judgment. Where there is not a fixed and definite amount admitted to be due on the face of the instrument, the prothonotary has not authority to accept evidence on the subject and in the capacity of an arbitrator or referee ascertain facts not appearing in the instrument ■to which the warrant of attorney is attached. Justification for bringing a defendant into court and fixing his liability in the conclusive form of a judgment on a warrant of attorney must be found in the terms of the instrument containing the authority, and, in the case of a prothonotary acting under the statute, is not to be extended beyond the definite power which the law confers.”</p>
    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[207,1506,1152,877]]]'>The authority given to the prothonotary must be strictly construed and the instrument upon which the prothonotaiy acts must contain sufficient definite information, either expressly or by the clearest implication, to allow him to proceed under the Act. The expression “clearest implication” means an implication so clear that only one meaning can be taken from it: <em>Schwartz v. Sher, </em><a href="/pa/299/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="299 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="1122261" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0423-01">299 Pa. 423</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20A.%20731" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="149 A. 731">149 A. 731</a> (1930). In our view, the lease under consideration did not contain sufficient definite information, either expressly or by clear implication, to enable the prothonotary to proceed as he did; on the contrary, it did contain language so express as to <em>preclude </em>him from entering judgment on the instrument. The information provided by the lease could have only one meaning, and it rendered the prothonotary without authority to proceed.</p>

    <p id="b229-4" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[119,1193,1158,1148]]]'>Paragraph 14 (2) of the lease provided that, in the event of a default in payment of the rent, violation of any of the covenants of the lease, a vacating of the premises by the Lessees, or insolvency of the Lessees: “(2) This lease and the term hereby created shall determine and become absolutely void without any right on the part of the Lessee to save the forfeiture by payment of any sum due or by other performance of any condition, term or covenant broken; whereupon, Lessor shall be entitled to recover damages for such breach in an amount equal to the amount of rent reserved for the balance of the term of this lease, <em>less the fair rental value of the said demised premises, for the residue of said term.'’'1 </em>(Emphasis added).

The question before us then is whether in the assessment of damages it was necessary that the amount of rent reserved for the balance of the term of the lease had to be reduced by the “fair rental value of the said demised premises, for the residue of said term.” This lease-provided procedure was not followed when judgment was entered—nor was it attempted until May 21, 1965, when the lessor filed a reply to the petition to strike off judgment and, for the first time, the Lessor gave certain credits to the Lessees, but credits obviously predicated on paragraph 15 (c) of the lease and not on paragraph 14 (2). These credits included “Rent due under existing lease from 10/1/64 to 9/30/69 at $400.00 per month—$24,000.00. Rent 10/1/69 to 1/31/71 at $400.00 per month—$6400.00”. These credits plus certain others totalled $34,934.54, rendering a “balance due on judgment” of $23,497.96. The “existing lease” above referred to a lease entered into between Lansdowne and new tenant for a term of 5 years at a monthly rental of $400.00. An attempt was made to apply this credit to the judgment under the provision of paragraph 15 (c) of the lease which held the lessees “liable for any loss of rent for the balance of the then current term” if the occasion arose that the lessor relet the premises. Since judgment was en<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>ter-ed at a time when the premises had <em>not </em>been relet and damages assessed as of <em>that </em>date, under paragraph 14 (2) of the lease as above, the Lessor, by his reply to the petition to strike off judgment, attempted to proceed under an alternate provision of the lease than the one under which he originally elected to obtain judgment. We are not constrained to allow him to do so, since, having elected to enter judgment by reason of a default before the premises were relet, lessees were thereafter entitled to have the issue of the fair rental value of the premises for the residue of the term decided in a proper proceedings before a jury if they so chose, after the issue of the propriety of the entry of judgment was decided.</p>

Had such been done, it would only have been necessary that the affidavit on which the confession of judgment was based set forth Lessee’s default justifying the entry of the judgment and the amount <em>alleged </em>to be due as a result thereof. The judgment then entered would have been valid and, if Lessees had wished to contest the facts contained in the affidavit and entry of judgment, they could have petitioned the court to open the judgment so that evidence might be presented to mitigate the <em>alleged </em>assessment of damages: <em>Grats Brothers v.

By the very agreement of the parities this factor had to be taken into consideration when assessing damages accruing after default, and it became incumbent on the prothonotary to determine the value of such factor. This he was powerless to do since it would have necessitated that he ai’rive at a value factor whose daily fluctuation and vagaries comprise an entire industry involving specialists who spend lifetimes learning the assessment of market and rental values of commercial buildings.

In relevant part, that paragraph provides: “If rent and/or charges hereby reserved as rent shall remain unpaid on any day when the same <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>ought to be paid Lessee hereby empowers any Prothonotary ... to appear for Lessee in any and all actions which may be brought for rent . . . and in said suits ... or actions to confess judgment against Lessee for all or any part of the rent specified in this lease and then unpaid including, <em>at Lessor’s option, the rent for the entire unexpired balance of the term of this lease . </em>. . <em>and for interest and costs together with an attorney’s commission of 5%.” </em>(Emphasis supplied) The lease further provides in paragraph 21 that all of the remedies given to lessor “shall be cumulative and concurrent.” Clearly, paragraph 16 allows the lessor to obtain judgment for rent for the balance of the term once the tenant defaults in any rent payment. Paragraphs 14(2) and 15(c) are alternative remedies and thus in no way affect the lessor’s <em>power </em>to enter judgment for the balance of the rental due; they do, as the court below properly recognized, have impact on the sum the landlord may recover. The evident purpose of paragraph 16 is to permit the landlord to obtain full protection for any claim he might have with the assurance that, if he is unable to obtain a satisfactory substitute tenant, he has already by virtue of his judgment obtained priority for his claim.</p>

The lease itself contains the length of the term and the amount of rent agreed upon. All that is necessary to calculate the amount of judgment is the date of default and an indication that the landlord is exercising his option to enter judgment for all rent due on the unexpired term. These facts were made available to the prothonotary by the averment of default, a document which, in <em>Roche </em>

I thus conclude that the amount of the judgment could be ascertained without evidence dehors the record. The prothonotary therefore had statutory authority to enter the judgment.</p>

The court below agreed that credit should be given for these items and thus reduced the judgment to $20,715.46, an amount appellants do not dispute is owing. I think it beyond doubt that the judgment entered was not grossly excessive. The bulk of the alleged excess is produced by the credit subsequently given for the fair rental value of the unexpired term. Since the lease expressly authorized a confession of judgment for all rent due for the balance of the term, a judgment entered for that amount cannot be considered excessive. Secondly, although an improperly included item, see footnote 2, supra, the attorney’s fee was authorized by the lease; having been authorized, its inclusion should not make the entry excessive. Finally, the $8,000 error should not vitiate the judgment; not only am I unable to classify an $8,-000 excess in a $66,000 judgment as gross, but I believe that the basis for the “grossly excessive” doctrine, i.e., a method to control abuse of the power conferred in an instrument to confess judgment, does not apply to a mathematical error. See Shuchman, Judgment Notes in Pennsylvania §8.1 (1961). These observations are confirmed by <em>Flomar Corporation v. Logue, </em><a href="/pa/418/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="418 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1896062" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0181-01">418 Pa. 181</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=210%20A.2d%20254" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="210 A.2d 254">210 A. 2d 254</a> (1965), our most recent case involving an alleged grossly excessive judgment. In <em>Flomar, </em>we characterized a $17,500 judgment as grossly excessive when the amount for which it should have been entered was $4,300. What is most important is ¡the fact that the excess in <em>Flomar </em>was the result not of a mathematical error but of an attempt to include rent for the unexpired balance of a term of a lease when the lease, as a matter of law, did not allow entry for that amount.</p>

The court below found, however, that appellee took possession on behalf of the tenant. This conclusion was based upon the fact that the lessor did not avail himself of the ejectment remedy provided in paragraph 17 of the lease.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Although their brief is not clear, appellants apparently premise their argument upon the fact that the landlord made no demand for rent. The cases on which they rely, see, e.g., <em>Elizabethtown Lodge No. 596 v. </em>Ellis, <a href="/pa/391/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="391 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="1276853" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0019-01">391 Pa. 19</a>, 24, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20286" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="137 A.2d 286">137 A. 2d 286</a>, 289 (1958), specifically state that a demand for rent is not necessary where such is expressly waived by the terms of the lease. This lease declares in paragraph 8: “Lessee covenants and agrees that he will <em>without demand </em>(a) Pay the rent <em>. . . .” </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Certainly, this declaration is a waiver.</p>

This is probably a result of a realization that such an attack would not succeed for, although an attorney’s fee is not properly included in a judgment secured under the Act of 1806, <em>it was authorized on the face of the lease. </em>The court below adopted the proper course when it modified the judgment to exclude the attorney’s fee for a striking of the judgment would have been improper.

It is well settled, subject to certain narrow exceptions not here applicable, that a petition to strike cannot be based on matters dehors the record. See generally Shuchman, Judgment Notes in Pennsylvania §44.2, §45.1 (1961). To demonstrate that the landlord took possession on his own behalf when the affidavit of default does not so disclose would require proof by evidence dehors the record.</p>
