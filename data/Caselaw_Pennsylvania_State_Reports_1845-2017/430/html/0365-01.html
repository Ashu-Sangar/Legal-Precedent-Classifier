Said “use and occupancy” loss in the averred amount of $70,392.56 arose by reason of the interruption of Hammermill’s paper-making operation caused by the collapse of the wall through the roof of the Building No. 75 and onto machinery in the operation, and there is an additional averred loss of $11,-757.53 for clean-up, maintenance and reconstruction costs involving machinery and Building No. 75, making a total claimed loss of $82,150.09, which amount was apparently paid to Hammermill by its insurance carrier under a binder to its fire insurance policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Naturally, Hammermill was interested in the result and the cost of attaining such result but the indicia of such interest as delineated in the agreement do not constitute an assumption of responsibility for the <em>manner.in </em>which the work was to <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>be done by Bust.

We fail to find, on the basis of the contract between the parties, that Hammermill was insisting on retaining and reserving such a broad scope of control so as to deprive Rust of the freedom of decision it would normally employ as an independent contractor and to so restrict Rust’s exercise of judgment in construction matters that Rust would be considered an employee.
