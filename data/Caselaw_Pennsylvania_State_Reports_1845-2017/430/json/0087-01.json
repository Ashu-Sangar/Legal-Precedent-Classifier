The proper procedure was to file a petition for certiorari under Supreme Court Rule 68% within thirty days from the date of the order sought to be reviewed. No petition was filed within the thirty-day time limit. Thereafter, a petition was filed by the petitioner-appellant, Harold H. Rape, for allowance of an appeal nunc pro tunc under Rule 68%. We find no merit in this petition.\nPetition denied and appeal quashed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents.",
