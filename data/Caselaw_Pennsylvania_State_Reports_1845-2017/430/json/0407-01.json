The court below determined that such an order was not final for purposes of appeal as required by the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act, Act of June 1, 1937, P. L. 1168, as amended, .43 P.S. \u00a7211.9(b). We agree.\nIn Chapin v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, 356 Pa. 577, 580, 52 A. 2d 568 (1947), we indicated that ordinarily a review of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction at this stage of the proceedings (before an election and before an order certifying a bargaining representative of the employees involved) is not a final order but interlocutory in nature. Cf. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Puritan Cleaners, 376 Pa. 617, 103 A. 2d 904 (1954). Therefore, absent any statutory provision directing that such preliminary jurisdictional questions and determinations are appealable, we affirm the lower court\u2019s action in quashing the appeal.\nOrder affirmed.",
