East End Homestead Loan and Trust Co.\nOomtitutionai law \u2014 Obligation of contract \u2014 Mortgage\u2014Defeasance\u2014Act of June 8, 1881.\nThe act of June 8, 1881, P. L. 84, relating to and defining defeasances, does not violate article 1, \u00a7 10, paragraph 1, of the constitution of the United States-, forbidding states to pass laws impairing the obligation of contracts.\nArgued Oct. 23, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 289, Oct. T., 1893, by plaintiff, -Sidney Fuller, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., Jan. T., 1892, No. 193, sustaining -demurrer to bill in equity.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Thompson, JJ.\nDemurrer to bill in equity.\nThe bill averred that Simpson McClure, who was a member of defendant company, executed a deed to defendant to secure a loan ; that the consideration named in the deed was \u00a72,400, but not more than $50Q or \u00a7600 was paid in cash; that McClure continued in possession of the property conveyed; that on Dec. 31, 1888, McClure gave to plaintiff a judgment note for lumber used in erecting a building on the land in question ; that plaintiff subsequently entered judgment on the note, issued execution and at the sale bought in the property and procured a sheriff\u2019s deed therefor; that he offered to pay the portion of the loan due by McClure to defendant, but that his offer was refused, and defendant claimed an absolute ownership of the land.\nThe defendant demurred to the bill on the ground that the alleged, defeasance was not in writing. The court, Ewing, P. J., entered a decree sustaining the demurrer on the ground that the act of June 8, 1881, P. L. 84, barred plaintiff\u2019s right.\nError assigned was decree, quoting it.\nJ. Charles Dieken, for appellant.\nIf the act of 1881 is constitutional and applies to a loan between a corporation and one of its members, it does not apply to plaintiff.\nJames 0.
