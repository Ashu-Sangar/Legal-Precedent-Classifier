Eckert\u2019s Appeal.\nWill \u2014 Construction of\u2014 Vested and contingent interest.\nTestator charged upon land the sum of two thousand dollars, the interest to be paid his daughter Mary during her life. He further directed: \u201c The principal sum of the said two thousand dollars and all interest that may have accrued thereon and not been used, applied and appropriated to the care, support and maintenance of my said daughter Mary in her lifetime, I give and bequeath upon her death unto my two sons, Gabriel and Peter, their heirs and assigns.\u201d Held, that the sons took vested interests in the sum charged upon the land.\nArgued May 17, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 180, July T., 1892, by Mary Eckert et al., heirs of Peter B. Eckert, deceased, from decree of O. C. Lancaster Co., dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report adjudicating estate of Jacob' Eckert, deceased.\nBefore Stekrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nExceptions to adjudication. Before McMullen, J.\nThe auditor\u2019s report was not printed in the paper books.\nIn the appellee\u2019s history of the case, the following facts were stated:\nJacob Eckert by his will devised two farms to his sons Ga briel and Peter, and further directed as follows :\n\u201c Item. I also charge and create a lien of two thousand dollars upon the said two plantations devised to my sons, Gabriel and Peter, the one half of that sum on each of the said plantations, interest thereon at five per cent per annum to be paid, applied and appropriated by them, their heirs and assigns of the said two plantations, or so much of the said interest as may be necessary, to the maintenance, care and support of my daughter Mary, the wife of Isaac Rife, from time to time as the same may be necessary or required during her life.\n\u201c The principal sum of the said two thousand dollars and\u2018all interests that may have accrued thereon and not been used, applied and appropriated to the care, support and maintenance of my said daughter Mary in her lifetime, I give and bequeath upon her death unto my two sons, Gabriel C. Eckert and Peter B. Eckert, their heirs and assigns; the one half thereof unto Gabriel C. Eckert, his heirs and assigns, and the other half thereof unto my son, Peter B. Eckert, his heirs and assigns.\u201d\nDuring the lifetime of Mary Rife, who had the life interest in this legacy, her brother, Gabriel, died intestate and without issue. Subsequently Peter B. Eckert made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors to Isaac Bair. His assignee put up at public sale his interest in this legacy and sold it to Uriah Eckert, who was the highest bidder, and who bought it for a fair price and to whom an assignment of it was made in these terms:\n\u201c All the right, title and interest, claim, share or portion of the said Peter B. Eckert, under the will of Jacob Eckert, and in all such moneys as were charged (and which are still remaining charged) as a lien by the said Jacob Eckert in and by his said will on certain lands mentioned in the said will, situate in Leacock township aforesaid, the annual interest of which said moneys so charged were by the directions of said will to be applied and appropriated to the maintenance, care and support of Mary Rife, wife of Isaac Rife, during her lifetime,\u201d etc.\nSubsequently Uriah Eckert transferred this interest to John B. Denlinger, appellee. Peter B. Eckert died, leaving appellants as his heirs.\nMary Rife died and the owners of the land on which the charge rests paid it into court. An auditor was appointed to distribute. He found that the interest of Peter B. and Gabriel C. Eckert in this legacy was a vested one; that one third of Gabriel\u2019s interest passed upon his death to Peter and the whole of# Peter\u2019s interest, four sixths of the f2,000, passed by assignment to his transferee.\nExceptions to auditor\u2019s report by heirs of Peter B. Eckert, deceased, were dismissed by the court. Exceptants thereupon appealed.\nErrors assigned were dismissal of exceptions, quoting them.\nB. E. Davis, W. II. Boland with him, for appellants.\nThe time was annexed to the payment of the legacy. The legacy is therefore contingent: Seibert\u2019s Ap., 13 Pa. 501; Eichelberger v. Smyser, 8 Watts, 181; Moore v. Smith, 9 Watts, 403; King v. King, 1 W. & S. 207; Pleasonton\u2019s Ap., 99 Pa. 362.\nBrown Hensel, for appellees, not heard, cited:\nMuhlenburg\u2019s Ap., 103 Pa. 587; Patterson v.
