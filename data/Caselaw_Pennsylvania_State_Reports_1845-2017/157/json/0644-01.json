Curiam,\nIt appears by the record that when the rule for judgment, in this case, was discharged, counsel for both parties were in court, and left without taking any exception to the ruling ox-asking the court to seal a bill. The learned president of the court certifies that after adjournment of court counsel for plaintiff called on him at chambers and requested him to seal a bill of exceptions, which, for reasons stated, he declined to do. He further certifies that no exception has ever been filed by permission of the court or the judge thereof.\nAs was said in Building and Loan Association v. McCombs, 92 Pa. 364, \u201c this court is bound to disregard an assignment of error under the act of April 18,1874, unless the record shows an exception was taken.\u201d The act provides that \u201c plaintiff may except to such decision and take a writ of error to the Supreme Court.\u201d When a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence is discharged in open court, in presence of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, then is the proper time to except and request the court to seal a bill. If counsel are not in court when such rule is discharged, no judge should refuse to allow an exception and seal a bill within a reasonable time thereafter.\nIn the circumstances, we think this appeal should be quashed.

Fleming et al.\nAssignment of error \u2014 Exception\u2014Practice.\nThe Supreme Court is bound to disregard an assignment of error to an order discharging a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, unless the record shows that an exception was taken.\nWhen a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence is discharged in open court, in presence of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, then is the proper time to except and request the court to seal a bill.\nArgued Oct. 11, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 162, Oct. T., 1893, by\nCommonwealth, to use of Caroline E. Porter, administratrix of John J. Porter, deceased, from order of C. P. Beaver Co., March T., 1893, No. 339, discharging rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defence, in favor of defendants, J. Kidd Fleming, Cochran Fleming and M. S. Quay.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Thompson, JJ.\nRule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defence. Rule discharged. Before Wickham, P. J.\nError assigned was discharge of rule.\nIn the Supreme Court the appellee moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the record showed that no exception was taken nor'allowed. Appellant filed the following affidavit and certificate in reply to the motion to quash:\n\u201c Thomas M. Henry and David S. Naugle, attorneys for appellant, being sworn according to law depose and say that the above cause came on for an argument by order of the court on Saturday, June 17, 1893, at which time the motion for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence was overruled; that the aforesaid affiants called at chambers on the evening of June 17, 1893, the day the motion was argued, and asked the court \u2014 Hon. J. J. Wickham, P. J. \u2014 to seal a bill of exceptions, at which time the judge suggested his inability to do so for the reasons that no exceptions had been asked for in open court, that court had then adjourned and that counsel for defendant was not present. Court having adjourned on said June 17th until the 28th following, at which time this cause was fixed for trial, the plaintiff had no opportunity to ask for an exception in open court after the day of argument until the day of trial.\u201d\n\u201c October 5th, 1893. At the request of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, I hereby certify that the facts as set forth in above affidavit, are true. I further certify, at request of defendants\u2019 counsel, that the counsel on both sides were present in open court, when the order refusing judgment, etc., was made, and that no exception has ever been filed to such order by permission of the court, or the judge thereof.\n\u201c John J.
