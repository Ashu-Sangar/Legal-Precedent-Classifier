As shown by the elaborate opinion returned with the record, the evidence thus produced was carefully and exhaustively considered by the learned judge who specially presided at the hearing. In view of this, as well as the manifestly correct conclusions reached by him, further discussion of the evidence is deemed unnecessary. An examination of the record, with reference to each of the six specifications of error, has satisfied us that the issue was rightly refused. The decided weight of the evidence is in favor of the testamentary capacity of the testatrix, and it also fails to disclose that any undue influence, such as the law condemns, was exerted by either William or Adam Pensyl to induce their mother to bequeath her estate to them. Indeed the will is neither unnatural nor unreasonable, in the circumstances. As correctly stated by the learned judge, in the conclusion of his opinion, William, the eldest son, had taken the charge and care of his mother\u2019s estate, and she had lived and been cared for at the house of Adam. The two sons, Samuel and Francis, had attempted to have their mother declared a lunatic and her property taken out of her possession. Under such circumstances, what more natural and reasonable than for the testatrix to regard with favor the two sons who had stood by her in her old days, to the exclusion of the other two sons who had attempted to have her declared insane ? In fact, the testatrix gave as a reason for excluding Samuel and Francis from any participation of her estate, \u201cthat Samuel and Francis had not treated her right.\u201d\nViewing the testimony in its most favorable light, there is nothing in it that would warrant any jury in rendering a verdict against the validity of the will. Neither of the specifications is sustained.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.",

    "head_matter": "Pensyl\u2019s Estate. Pensyl\u2019s Appeal.\nWill \u2014 Issue devisavit vel non \u2014 Testamentary capacity.\nOn an application for an issue devisavit vel non, the contestants, to show lack of testamentary capacity in the testatrix, introduced evidence which tended to show that the testatrix at the time the will was executed was suffering from partial failure of memory, was unable to recognize acquaintances of years before, that she believed her sons were all dead when they were not, that she sat stupid and would not talk unless spoken to, that bsr eyesight was poor, that she was lame and feeble and had a twitch in one of her hands, that her clothing was bought for her by her daughter-in-law, and that she was not capable of waiting on herself at table. Witnesses for the proponent testified that, at the time of the execution of the will, testatrix was able to talk intelligently, that her understanding was good, and that she was able to recognize her neighbors. The three subscribing wituesses to the will, two of Whom were reputable members of the bar, and the third, the family physician, testified that testatrix gave instructions as to how the will was to be drawn, that it was read over to her, and that she understood it. Held, that an issue was properly refused.\nUndue influence \u2014 Evidence.\nTn the above case testatrix excluded two of her sons from any participation in her estate. She stated to the attorney who drew the will that these sons \u201chad not treated her right.\u201d It appeared from the evidence in the case that the two sons thus excluded had instituted lunacy proceedings against their mother, and that these proceedings had failed. Testatrix had two other sons, to one of whom she had intrusted the care of her estate, and with the other she lived until her death. There was no evidence to show that the two sons benefited by the will were present when the will was executed or had dictated the terms of it to their mother. Held, that the evidence was insufficient to justify the court to award an issue on the question of undue influence.\nArgued May 22, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 161, Jan. T. 1893, by Samuel Pensyl, from decree of O. C. Northumberland Co., Feb. T., 1891, No. 13, refusing an issue devisavit vel non to try the validity of the will of Mary Pensyl, deceased.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Williams, Mitchell, Dean and Thompson, JJ.\nPetition for issue devisavit vel non.\nFrom the record it appeared that Mary Pensyl died on or about Nov. 8, 1890, leaving to survive her, four sons, William Pensyl, Adam Pensyl, Samuel Pensyl and Francis Pensyl. By a writing purporting to be a will bearing date May 15, 1888, she bequeathed to Adam Pensyl $160 per year from March 12, 1883, until her death, to pay him for her board and maintenance, and in satisfaction of the arrears of the annual interest of $160 charged against his farm in her favor from that date ; and all the residue of her estate, consisting entirely of personalty, she gave to William Pensyl and Adam Pensyl in equal shares, to the exclusion of her sons Francis and Samuel, and named William Pensyl the executor thereof. The subscribing witnesses to the will were Dr. S. F. Gilbert, W. H. M. Oram, Esq., and C. R. Savidge, Esq. The subscribing witnesses testified that testatrix gave instructions as to how the will was to be drawn, that it was read over to her, and that she understood it. Witnesses for the proponent testified that at the time of the execution of the will, testatrix was able to talk intelligently, that her understanding was good, and that she was able to recognize her neighbors.\nEvidence on behalf of the contestants tended to show that in 1886 Mary Pensyl left the house of her son Adam to go to the house of her Aon Samuel; that Adam missed her and brought her back home, before she got to Samuel\u2019s house, and she wept because she could not go to see her son ; that in 1887, Mary Pensyl was found in the house of Adam Pensyl, in a room with the doors .closed, sitting upon a chair with her head bent down, looking on the floor, waving her hand and moving her lips; that in 1886, she wanted to go with her stepdaughter to see Samuel; Adam made her stay at home. That in June, 1888, she believed that her boys were all dead. She could not be made to understand that they were alive, and when she was asked whether she did not live with her son Adam, and about her other sons, she said they were all dead. That in March, 1888, she was found sitting on a chair in Adam\u2019s house working* her hands. She did not know her niece, who had lived in the neighborhood for years, or be made to understand that the niece was a daughter of her deceased brother, and did not know that her deceased brother had ever lived, and when his name was mentioned, had no memory of him. She sat stupid and would not talk unless spoken to. That in 1887, and the years following, she would \u25a0 remember for an instant when told the name of a person whom she had known in early years and in the next instant forget it and ask \u201c who are you ? \u201d\nIt appeared from the evidence that in 1884, Samuel and Francis instituted proceedings de lun\u00e1tico inquirendo, to have their mother declared a lunatic and incompetent to manage her property. Upon a hearing had before a commissioner and a jury of inquest, it was determined that Mary Pensyl was not a lunatic.\nThe court, in an opinion by Mayer, P. J., of the 25th judicial district, specially presiding, refused the issue.\nErrors assigned were refusal of issue.\nW. H. Rhawn and J. G. Bucher, 8. P. Wolverton and W A.
