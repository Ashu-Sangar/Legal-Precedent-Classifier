Notwithstanding his withdrawal, the stockholders accepted the resignation, declared the office of superintendent vacant and placed this branch of the work in the hands of the chairman, B. F. Jennings. Joseph G. Beale, believing this action of the company to be contrary to law and a subversion of his rights, refused to yield control as superintendent; whereupon a bill was filed by the other stockholders on the 23d of December, 1887, praying that Beale be restrained, first by preliminary injunction and afterwards by final injunction, from interfering in any manner whatsoever with the business and works of the said partnership association, or from, acting or claiming to act in any way as superintendent of manufactory for said association. A preliminary injunction was refused by the court, but on appeal was granted by the Supreme Court [<a href="/monaghan/2/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Monag. 188" data-case-ids="257929" data-case-paths="/monaghan/2/0188-01">2 Mona. 188</a>].

On December 30, 1889, the defendant, Beale, filed his cross bill, praying, first, that his salary as superintendent be paid him <em>; </em>and, second, that the individual plaintiffs be surcharged with any damage or loss which may have been sustained by him by reason of the bad conduct and mismanagement on the part of B.

We have already given a history of the proceedings in equity, and the result of the same. Now, from the facts and the decree entered in that case, we must say who is responsible for these costs. The court entered a decree ordering the plaintiffs to pay these costs. Who is meant by the plaintiffs? Are they Jennings, Beale &amp; Co., Limited, or are they the individuals named as plaintiffs? We confess that the order as to the payment of costs is obscure and indefinite as to who is meant. Had the court meant that the individuals named as plaintiffs should pay the costs, they could have named them in the decree; and with equal force we may say, liad the court meant by the decree that the company should pay the costs, they could have so named it in the decree by saying that plaintiff company should pay the costs. The expression, however, is that plaintiffs pay the costs. The company is composed of individuals, and their names are upon the record as plaintiffs. It is a suit against one of their number, and in making the decree the court uses the word ‘ plaintiffs; ’ that is plural — means more than one. Now, is it not more reasonable to conclude that the court by this expression meant the individuals named as plaintiffs should pay these costs than to conclude that it was meant thereby that the company should pay them ? And this view is supported by the fact that the decree <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>was in favor of the defendant, who was a member of the firm; and if the firm has to pay these costs, Beale would be called upon. to not only defray his own expenses in defending his rights, but would also have to pay an amount, based on shares of stock held by him, of the expenses incurred by the litigation instigated by the other members of the firm to deprive him of his rights. It should not be forgotten that the proceedings were in a court of equity, and it would be inequitable to require Beale, as a member of the firm, to pay costs in a litigation instituted to deprive him of his rights, which the law said were his. We hold, therefore, that the just, correct and equitable meaning of the decree of May 4, 1891, is that the individual plaintiffs should pay the costs incurred in the equity proceedings at No. 69, March term, 1888, and that the liquidating trustees are not entitled to claim credit therefor in their account.</p>

The items which aggregate the credit claimed of $5,381.49, and especially set forth in the 10th exception, and the portion of this credit referring to salaries in its items, amount to $2,862.12. It appears that the liquidating trustees made sale of the prop<a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>erty on October 12, 1889, to B. F. Jennings et al. for the sum of $100,000, sale to take effect as of the date of July 1, 1889. The evidence produced on the hearing of these exceptions shows that the said items, aggregating $2,862.72, are for salaries of persons employed by the liquidating trustees in conducting and caring for the business of the firm of Jennings, Beale &amp; Co., Limited, from July 1,1889, the date at which the sale by agreement took effect, to October 12, 1889, the date at which the sale was really executed, and that the men whose salaries represent this sum were emplo3red by the liquidating trustees in the management and care of the business. It could not be contended that had these trustees performed this service themselves they would not be entitled to be paid therefor out of the assets of the company; and why not pay the men who performed it for them ? The exceptant contends that because the trustees have not accounted for the product of the mill from July 1st to October 12th that they are not entitled to this credit. It is not disputed but that the sale was made to take effect as of the date of July 1st, consequently the purchasers are entitled to the product after that date, and as this item of credit is for expenses incurred by the trustees in managing and settling up the partnership, it should be allowed as, a proper credit in their account as liquidating trustees.
