If its articles give it manufacturing powers and no others, it is exclusively organized for manufacturing purposes within the meaning of the revenue act of 1889; and this would be so, even if a part of its capital was employed in a business which it had no corporate power to conduct: Commonwealth v. William Mann Company, <a href="/pa/150/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="150 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="834390" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0064-01">150 Pa. 64</a>.

(See also the opinion, filed herewith, in Com. v. Thomas Iron Co., No. 464, June term, 1892, Dauphin C. P.) Tried by this test, the defendant is not organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes. Its articles of association give it two distinct powers, one of <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>them a manufacturing power, namely: to produce refined oil and other commercial products from crude petroleum; and the other, a mining and transporting power, namely: to buy and lease land, to mine for and produce crude petroleum therefrom, and to transport the same to its refineries. Clearly, this is more accurately described as mining than as manufacturing. In a qualified sense, oil is a mineral, Stoughton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/88/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="88 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1061199" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0198-01">88 Pa. 198</a>; Dunham v.

In the language of a very recent case, the production of petroleum is ‘ the mere appropriation of an article that is furnished by nature : ’ Commonwealth v. Northern Electric L. and P.

In Commonwealth v. Lackawanna Iron &amp; Coal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=129%20Pa.%20357" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="129 Pa. 357">129 Pa. 357</a>, a closely analogous case, the court, speaking of the union of mining, quarrying and manufacturing powers, say: ‘ Strictly speaking, both of these (namely, coal property and ore property) pertain to mining, rather than to manufacturing corporations. Neither of them has any necessary connection with the latter. True, they are sources from which corporations engaged in manufacturing iron necessarily draw their chief supply of raw materials, but those materials always may be, and frequently are, obtained from <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>parties or corporations independently engaged in mining and supplying the same to manufacturers of iron and others. It is doubtless a great convenience and advantage for an iron manufacturing company to own and operate its own coal and iron ore mines, but the fact that such corporation is also specially authorized to do so, is no reason why so much of its capital as is invested in such mining operations should enjoy the benefit of exemption from state tax designed to relieve manufacturing, as contra-distinguished from mining corporations, from a burden they were supposed to be illy able to bear.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[145,893,1166,1523]],["BL_542.1",542,[264,373,1166,95]]]'>“ ‘ A company incorporated for the exclusive purpose of manufacturing steel rails, for example, is not authorized by its charter to own and operate coal mines, iron ore mines or limestone quarries, and would of course be obliged to procure its supplies of raw material from outside sources. Such mining and quarrying operations are not legally incident to the business of manufacturing, that is to say, they do not necessarily depend upon it, although as a matter of fact, the supplying such raw materials is in one sense incident to the process of manufacturing. If the business of mining and supplying such raw materials is not necessarily incident to a strictly manufacturing franchise, it cannot become so because that franchise is exercised concurrently with the separate franchises of mining and quarrying. As we have seen, the corporation appellee is of a fourfold character. It is a coal mining company, a quarrying company, an iron ore mining company, and a manufacturing company, specifically invested with the distinct rights and privileges pertaining to each, and exercising all of them. In the exercise of its manufacturing franchise, it finds it convenient and profitable to become in the main the consumer of products resulting from the exercise of the other three. In other words, the mining and quarrying departments, so to speak, find a convenient customer in the manufacturing department. But how can it be inferred from this that the capital employed in the mining and quarrying departments of the business is relieved from state tax, because capital employed in manufacturing happens to be exempt ? Such a conclusion would be as unjust as it is illogical. It relieves from taxation capital which the legislature never intended to exempt, merely because it happens to belong to a corporation which owns and controls <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>other capital which for a special reason the legislature has seen fit to exempt.’</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b542-7" data-blocks='[["BL_542.8",542,[262,1395,1171,860]]]'>“ The phrase used by the act of 1889 — ‘ exclusively organized ’ — is confessedly ambiguous. Its meaning in the statute may differ from its meaning in the dictionaries, and evidently depends upon the point of time which is relied upon as fixing the character of the corporation for the purpose of this particular tax. If the time of granting the charter is taken, no other conclusion can rationally be reached than that which has been announced in the cases referred to ; but if the time of imposing the tax is taken, then the actual business of the corporation is the natural test. This, we respectfully submit, may fairly be concluded to have been' the legislative intention, because (the language being doubtful) this construction allows apportionment wherever justice and equity demand it, and thus avoids the inequality of burden which otherwise must result; while the construction now adopted forbids apportionment altogether in a large number of cases, the inevitable result being much friction and unintended injustice.</p>

Here are two iron manufacturing companies, alike in all respects except that the charter of one contains a power to mine ore or <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>coal. This power is not used and never has been used; nevertheless, although their business is precisely similar, one is exempt and the other is taxed. Again, the general corporation act of 1874, under which the majority of charters now exist, gives mining powers in § 88 to certain manufacturing companies. What- is to be done with this class of cases ? Are these mining powers to be considered as written in the charters, although they are not formally expressed? If so — and § 25 of the act of 1874 declares that ‘ the franchises granted shall be construed according to the same rules of law and equity as if (the corporation) had been created by special charter ’ — there is not an iron manufacturing company in the state, incorporated under the act of 1874, which is entitled to exemption. On the contrary, all are already liable for considerable arrears. But, if these powers are not to be considered as written in the charters, with what justice is the tax imposed on a corporation chartered by a special act, merely because the right to mine is specially given ? The right exists as really in the one case as in the other, and ought to affect both corporations alike.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b543-5" data-blocks='[["BL_543.5",543,[168,1348,1165,910]]]'>“ Take also the case of two corporations doing a similar manufacturing business, both of which are usurping a power not given by their charters, but only one of which possesses an unused franchise which is not manufacturing. Surely, both ought to be treated alike; and yet, one is taxed only upon the capital invested in the unauthorized business, and the other is taxed upon its whole capital stock, although the operations of the two companies are identical. And this inequality becomes more conspicuous,- if the case is slightly varied and two corporations are considered, one of which has an exclusively manufacturing charter, but is usurping another franchise, while the other has a similar manufacturing power and in addition possesses the franchise to do lawfully what the other is doing unlawfully. If any discrimination is to be made, it would seem that the violator of law should bear the heavier burden. But the fact is otherwise; the usurper pays tax only upon the capital unlawfully invested, while the other is taxable upon its whole capital stock.</p>

We will only add, that the examples we have given are neither fanciful nor imaginary, and that we would not have made this unusual application if we were not abundantly convinced by our experience (which necessarily embraces a large number of cases that are not brought to the attention of the Supreme Court) that it is hardly possible to apply the present rule without severe and extensive hardship. Unquestionably serious practical difficulties exist and very considerable numbers of corporate taxpayers are either injured or threatened, because of the rule we are now bound to apply. We venture to express the hope, that a reconsideration of the subject will find no serious obstacle to adopting the alternative construction of a doubtful phrase, and may thus permit us to return to the hitherto well-established and equitable rule of taking the actual business as the test of corporate character. This inevitably leads to apportionment in all proper cases, and, with restored freedom of apportionment, these difficulties will disappear. So diverse and multiform are the charters and the powers and the actual business of manufacturing corporations that, without a full power to apportion, they can neither be fairly exempted nor fairly taxed.”</p>

    <p id="b545-7" data-blocks='[["BL_545.12",545,[161,1058,1164,298]]]'>This is another case in which a manufacturing company is attempting to supply itself with the raw material it needs by production instead of purchase. It is ruled by Commonwealth v. Juniata Coke Company, and Commonwealth v. Savage Brick Company, [the preceding cases,] decided at the present term and in which opinions áre herewith filed.</p>
    <p id="b545-8" data-blocks='[["BL_545.13",545,[158,1365,1167,847]]]'>Another question has been raised in this case and urged with earnestness and ability. It is that of the constitutionality of the act of 1889, particularly of that portion of it which makes the capital stock of corporations a distinct class of investments for the purposes of taxation. We have recognized this form of classification for taxing purposes in many cases, particularly in Kittanning Coal Company v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/79/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="79 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="438386" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0100-01">79 Pa. 100</a>; Kitty Roup’s Case, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20211" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="81* Pa. 211">81* Pa. 211</a> ; City of Williamsport v.

Upon the subject of uniformity of burden imposed by a tax law, no better rule can be stated than that laid down in Fox’s App., <a href="/pa/112/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="112 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="546754" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0337-01">112 Pa. 337</a>, viz., that substantial, not absolute, uniformity is what the constitution requires. Exact uniformity is theoretically possible, but it is practically unattainable by any systems of classification and valuation yet devised in this state.</p>
