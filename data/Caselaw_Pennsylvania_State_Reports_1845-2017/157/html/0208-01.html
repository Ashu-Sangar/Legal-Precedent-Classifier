On the tenth day of January, 1779, a warrant was secured, and upon that a survey was made, upon the fourteenth of October, 1793, to Benjamin R. Morgan, for 440 acres, 9 perches and allowance, situate at the head branches of Hunlock’s Greek and Shickshinny, and including South Pond, so called. By that patent the title to that tract passed from the commonwealth to Benjamin R. Morgan. The same proceedings were had so far as the John Watson tract is concerned. The warrant is dated April 10, 1793; it was surveyed on April 2,1794, for 440 acres and allowance; situated on the South Pond on Hunlock’s Greek. By virtue of that patent the Watson tract was con<a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>veyed to John Watson. [By a line of conveyances which it is unnecessary to burden the jury with in this action, the title and possession to a portion of these tracts — secured by Morgan to the Morgan tract, and by Watson to the Watson tract— vested in John Benscoter. So that on the 5th day of September, 1889, John Benscoter had both paper title and title by possession to that part of the Watson and that part of the Morgan now in question, extending north to the Hazlehurst line.] [3] On the 19th of July, 1792, a warrant was issued by the commonwealth to Samuel Hazlehurst, and upon that warrant a survey was made on the 29th September, 1792. By a line of conveyances the title of the Samuel Hazlehurst in question vested and was in Clinton Long, on the 5th of September, 1889. [This not being an action of ejectment, you may assume, for the purpose of arriving at a true verdict in this case, that on the 5th of September, 1889, John Benscoter owned that part of the Morgan and Watson covered by the pond south of the Hazlehurst line, and that the property was then in his possession, so that a trespass upon it makes the trespasser liable in damages.] [4] Clinton Long owned and was in possession of the Hazlehurst, which joins the north line of the Morgan at the point in dispute, on the 5th of September, 1889. In 1843 or 1844, you will recall the year, the predecessor in the title which is held by Mr. Benscoter built a milldam on the outlet of this pond, a short distance below the pond, for the purpose of holding the water in order that a mill near by might be properly run. That dam was not erected for the purpose of making the South Pond a private pond, nor for the purpose of propagating fish in the South Pond, but for milling purposes, and it is conceded on both sides that the height of the dam has not since been changed or altered. You will have before you the original surveys of the Morgan, the Watson and the Hazlehurst tracts.</p>

The plaintiff contends, and the court is of the opinion that it is necessary, that he shall establish that fact by proper credible evidence, to the satisfaction of the jury, that the Hazlehurst line is not in nor across the north end of this pond, but that it is either on the shore above the ordinary level of the water or still further north. The defendant’s contention on that point is, that the Hazlehurst line is in the pond <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>and cuts across the upper end of it, some places one rod, and at other places, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and I believe as high as eight or nine rods.</p>

Does that map show that the Hazlehurst line is in or across any material part of the water of this pond ? Then you may go next to the survey and map of the defendant's witness, Mr. Trescott. Where does that surveyor and his map show the Hazlehurst line is ? Examine the original map or surveys, namely, the surveys of the Watson, Hazlehurst and Morgan. It is proper for the court to call your attention to the fact that there is no direct evidence as to how high the dam built by the Benscoters did raise the water in this pond. You will ascertain, from the credible evidence in this case, whether the dam built by Benscoter at the outlet in 1843 or 1844 did raise the water so as to throw it upon the Long land, and thereby change the actual height of the pond from what it was when the original survey was made, in 1793. If the dam raised the water and thereby backed it upon Mr. Long, and held it there for twenty-one years continuously, Mr. Benscoter would undoubtedly have what is called an easement in that part of Long’s land, that is, a right to enter upon his land by the water of the pond, but plaintiff would not thereby become the owner of the land under it. He would have a right to keep the water at that height for the purpose of supplying the mill, and Mr. Long could not compel him to lower it, but by keeping it there for twenty or any other number of years, Mr. Benscoter would not thereby become the owner of the land under the water. Was the water in 1793, and about that time, at its ordinary height upon the Hazlehurst ? If not, was it put upon the Hazlehurst by the dam built by the Benscoters in 1843 or 1844, and has it been kept there since that time ?</p>

Suppose however you concluded that the Hazlehurst line is on the shore at or above the ordinary height of the water, then, you may find that the pond is private; but you will first inquire whether the pond was used or improved by the owner for the propagation of fish. What evidence is there that it was so improved ? What improvements for the propagation of fish were put upon this pond by Mr. Benscoter? Propagation of fish means the increase and spread, by artificial and natural means, by the spawn and by the placing of fish in the pond. Is there any evidence in the case that Mr. Benscoter did anything to improve the pond for that purpose ? The court does not remember any evidence of that kind. You will then inquire, also, whether it was used by Mr. Benscoter for the propagation of fish? On that branch of the case what was done ? Mr. Benscoter testified that several years ago he purchased and stocked this pond with 115 black bass and other sorts of fish, so that it would seem to a certain extent that he stocked the water. The evidence is that the fish did propagate and that there were black bass and other fish in the pond on the 5th of September, 1889, and for a short time before that. [The stocking of this pond by Mr. Benscoter, and the care which he says he exercised over it afterwards, is perhaps sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that it was used by him for the propagation of fish.] [12]</p>

For further answer to the former, the learned judge said: “ The plaintiff has shown, for the purpose of this case, title to the Hazlehurst line ; ” and, for further answer to the latter, he said: “ I think Mr. Benscoter has shown title and possession, up to the Hazlehurst line, sufficient for the purposes of this case.” Again, in that part of his charge recited in the fourth specification, he said : “ This not being an action of ejectment, you may assume, for the purpose of- arriving at a true verdict in this case, that, on the 5th of September, 1889, John Benscoter owned that part of the Morgan and Watson covered by the pond south of the Hazlehurst line, and that the property was then in his possession, so that a trespass upon it makes the trespasser liable in damages.” From these and other instructions of like import the jury would doubtless understand that sufficient proof, either of ownership or possession, or of both, had been given to entitle plaintiff to maintain an action for the penalty against defendant or any one who was shown to have trespassed on the premises south of the Hazlehurst line.

There was testimony tending to prove that part of the pond in question was north of said line, on land owned by defendant; and his eighth point, for charge, based on that evidence, is as follows : “ If the jury find that a portion of the pond in question is upon the Samuel Hazlehurst tract, their verdict must be for defendant.” The answer of the court was: “If that point simply mean a foot or two in width, the point is not well taken, but if it mean several yards, or any substantial part of the water, the point is affirmed.” What the learned judge meant by “ substantial part,” is further shown by the following sentence, from his charge, recited in the tenth specification: “ If you find as a matter of fact from the credible evidence in the case that Clinton Long owned any substantial part of the land covered by this pond, — and I mean by substantial, two, or three, or four, or five or six rods, as indicated by some of the maps, — then it is not a private pond.”</p>

Referring to plaintiff’s testimony in relation to stocking the pond, etc., the learned judge said: “The care which he says he exercised over it afterwards is perhaps sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that it was used by him for the propagation of fish.” We do not so understand the testimony, nor do we think it justifies any such inference. Again, in speaking of the public notice required by the act, he concedes that if defendant “ were a stranger and had no knowledge of the claim of ownership of this pond, the notice here offered would not be sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover under this section of the act; ” but he held that defendant’s knowledge that plaintiff claimed to own and be in possession of the property was “sufficient warning under the act.” We cannot assent to this as a proper construction of the act. It prescribes the kind of public notice that shall be given, not only to strangers but also to neighbors, and unless its terms are satisfied no right of action for the penalty accrues.</p>
