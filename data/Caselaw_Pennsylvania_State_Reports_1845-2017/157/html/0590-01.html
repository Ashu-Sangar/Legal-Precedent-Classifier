The case shows that that labor was labor which entered into the expense of operating two leases, known and referred to in this case as the Green and Hague leases. That the defendant in that case, seeking an account of the partnership transactions, and alleging that the plaintiff and himself were partners in the operation of those two leases, and in his bill, he set out that it was agreed, in substance, that all the unsettled accounts for labor due from himself to the plaintiff, as well as what he should earn afterwards, above what would be necessary for his support, should be applied upon the bonus and operating expenses of those leases. That was one of the matters which was controverted and litigated in that case.</p>
