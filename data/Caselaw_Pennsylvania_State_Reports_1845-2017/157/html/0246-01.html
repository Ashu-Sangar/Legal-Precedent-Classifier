There was evidence that the daughter, a married woman, took possession, and continued to hold the land for over fifty years. About twenty-two years after the daughter went into possession of the land ejectment was brought by the record owners against her husband, and a verdict rendered in their favor. Judgment was apparently not entered upon the verdict, and the wife remained undisturbed in the possession of the land. Subsequently the land was sold under a judgment against the wife, and was bought in by her daughter, who after her mother’s death took possession of the land. In an action of ejectment against the daughter, the court charged that the circumstances were not sufficient to overcome the legal presumption that the possession of a husband and wife in joint occupancy of premises as a home was the possession of the husband. <em>Held, </em>that the case should have been submitted to the jury to determine whether or not the presumption was overcome.</p>

Presumptively, owing to the legal relation of husband and wife, she had no possession distinct from that of her husband, and therefore acquired no title by possession during his lifetime. Her possession was his possession, and, upon his death, his title by possession, if one had been acquired in that way during their joint occupancy of the premises, would descend to his heirs. We say presumptively this wmuld be the <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>nature of the possession in the absence of any evidence to show that William and Sally Ann held the possession in her right exclusively. The defendant has put in evidence a paper purporting to have been executed in January, 1827, whereby John Shepherd, the father of Sally Ann Collins, conveyed to her his possessory right in the Jesse Fell tract. Without stopping at this time to comment on the question as to the definiteness of this paper, or as to its genuineness, we instruct you, in the first place, that this paper did not give title to the land, because it does not appear that John Shepherd had any title to convey. In the second place, it is not evidence that John Shepherd had any possession or possessory right as against the holders of the recorded paper title: — it does not show that he had any possession of the premises which was transferred to her, to which her possession was tacked. In other words, it does not show that her title by possession, if she has acquired one, had its inception at an earlier date than when she went into the actual occupancy of the premises. In the third place, if the paper is genuine, it is evidence to show the nature and extent of her claim, and, in connection with the oral evidence of witnesses of her declarations while in possession of the land, would tend to show that she claimed to hold possession of the land in her own right, and not in that of her husband. But, on the other hand, while there was some attempt to show that her husband, William Collins, had little to do with the farming operations there, it does appear that he did work upon the land, that he worked at his trade, that he exercised the ordinary acts of ownership which a man does exercise in possession of such property, and it does not appear, so far as we recollect, in the testimony, that he assented to this exclusive claim, set up by his wife. On the contrary, if the testimony of Jacob Weaver, a son-in-law, and a witness called by the defendant, is to be believed, William Collins claimed the land in his own right under a purchase from Henry Drinker, or under some arrangement with Henry Drinker, whatever that may be. In view of this and the other testimony in the case, we instruct you that the circumstances are insufficient to overcome the radical, legal presumption that the possession of a husband and wife, in joint occupancy of premises as a home, is the possession of the husband. This being so, it follows that Sally Ann Collins acquired no title by possession, prior to the title of her husband.] [1]</p>

      <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>“ If Sally Ann Collins did not acquire title by adverse possession during the lifetime of William, did sbe acquire title by adverse possession after his death? It is claimed on the part of the defendant that she did, and that is the question of fact which we purpose to submit to you; namely, was she for twenty-one years after the death of her husband in the actual, adverse, exclusive, uninterrupted, notorious possession of the premises for twenty-one years ? That she was in possession from the time of the death of her husband until the time of her own death is undisputed; but it is claimed, in the first place — and this we submit to you as a question of fact — that there was not twenty-one years of time between the death of her husband and her own death; and it is contended, in the second place, that her possession was not exclusive of the owners of the Wurts title. If the defendant resided upon the premises during the same period of time, if she was there under her mother, recognizing her mother’s claim, then that would not interfere with the exclusiveness of the possession of Sally Ann Collins. [But if during this period between the death of William Collins and the death of Sally Ann Collins, Sarah Ann Lynch was in possession claiming under the Wurts title, it would have the effect of breaking the continuity and exclusiveness of the possession of her mother. This will require you to consider the testimony with regard to the nature of the possession of Sarah Ann Lynch during that period of time. For it does appear that in 1872, sbe, with three of her brothers, took a deed for the Wurts title, which was recorded. It appears also that in 1878 an action of ejectment was brought by these same parties against the mother, Sally Ann Collins. While the bringing of the action of ejectment would not of itself break the continuity of the possession of Sally Ann Collins, it is, nevertheless, a fact to be considered by the jury in determining what was the nature- of the claim which Sarah Ann Lynch was setting up whilst she was in possession ; and, of course, you will take into consideration her testimony, denying any knowledge of that suit or authority to bring it. If she authorized the suit to be brought — and presumptively she did — then it would be a fact bearing upon that question as to whether or not she herself was in the actual possession of the premises, or a portion of them at least, under this Wurts title, and thus adversely to the possession of her mother.] [4]</p>

If, when it was presented to her, she refused to sign it, to have anything’ to do with it, or to recognize the claim which was made under it, then it ought not to have any bearing in your consideration of the question. If, however, this lease which purported to be a lease of the land under the Wurts title, recognizing the title which they had bought from Wurts’estate — if when that, was presented, she acquiesced in its execution by John M. Armstrong, in the manner that it was executed, it would be a circumstance tending to show the nature of her possession during that period of time.] [7]</p>

This makes her an actor, and requires her to show by competent evidence all the ingredients necessary to make a title by possession. She most show an actual, visible possession, exclusive and hostile, and continued without interruption for twenty-one years prior to the bringing of this suit. The first step to be taken is to show when and how her possession, or the possession of those under whom she claims, began, in order to fix the point from which the computation is to be made. Upon this subject she sought to show that her grandfather, John Shepherd, entered upon the tract and made the first improvement upon it some time prior to 1827, and on the tenth day of January of that year sold and transferred his possession to his daughter, Sallie Ann, then the wife of William Collins, by an instrument in writing. Her contention is that Sallie Ann Collins went into possession under this sale to her, and remained with her family, living upon and cultivating the land till her death in 1879. This possession extending over half a century, she claims to have acquired by means of a sheriff’s sale made in 1884 to one Morris, whose title she now bolds. Iu this way she seeks to show a possession beginning prior to 1827, transferred by John Shepherd, her .grandfather, to Sallie Ann Collins, her mother, and, by means of tbe sheriff’s sale of her mother’s title, now vested in herself. As this action was brought in 1889 and the entry and improvement are thus placed as early as 1826, sbe claims to bave shown a possession just three times as long as tbe statute requires. To defeat this title by possession the alleged transfer by John Shepherd to Sallie Ann Collins was attacked. A recovery in ejectment by the holders of tbe legal title against her husband and Truxton Benedict was shown. Declarations of her husband were admitted tending to show that he claimed some title to the land independently of her. The facts that the defendant joined her brothers in purchase of tbe legal title and that she took, or allowed her name to be used in taking, a lease from them for the land, were set up as a recognition by her of the legal title, sufficient to change the character of her possession and defeat her title under the statute.</p>

The first assignment of error calls attention to the following instruction given by the learned judge while speaking of the transfer by John Shepherd to Sallie Ann Collins, and its effect. He said: “We instruct you that the circumstances are not sufficient to overcome the radical, legal presumption that the possession of a husband and wife in joint occupancy of premises as a home is the possession of her husband.” In the absence of evidence upon the subject, the legal presumption supplies the want of evidence, but here, evidence was given tending to show how the possession of the family of Mrs. Collins began and under what right or title it was taken. If the jury rejected this evidence as untrustworthy then resort could be had to the legal presumption. If they did not reject it then they would be justified in finding that possession was entered upon under the title shown. It was a mistake therefore to take this question from the jury by a binding instruction. It is true, as the learned judge said, that it did <em>not </em>appear that John Shepherd had any title to the land. He might have gone further and stated that it was evident he had no title. He had a possession, however, if the testimony on that subject was credited. This possession if undisturbed might ripen into a title under the statute of limitations. A transfer of his possession to another who entered under it would enable the transferee to tack that possession to his own in order to complete the statutory period. It was therefore competent evidence on the subject of how Mrs. Collins and family entered upon the premises, to show that she had acquired the possession of a mere trespasser; and if she did acquire it, and enter under it, she had a right to tack the possession so acquired by her to her own. In the eighth assignment substantially the same error is pointed out. The learned judge was asked to say that if the jury should find that Mrs. Collins entered under the transfer from her father, and continued uninterruptedly in possession claiming the lands as her own for twenty-one years prior to the recovery against her husband and Benedict, then her title was complete at that time and would not be affected by thg/t recovery. This the learned judge answered in the negative. Having told the jury as matter of law that she did not so enter, <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>but was conclusively presumed to have entered under her husband, this answer was consistent; but if, as we hold the question under what right or authority the entry was made and possession taken was for the jury upon all the evidence, then this answer was wrong. Again in the ninth assignment our attention is called to an answer that may have been made upon the same theory. The court was asked to say that if the jury should find that she took possession in her own right and continued it for twenty-one years her title would not be affected by the acts or declarations of her husband. The reply was “ this is answered in the negative.” As applicable to the facts in this case as they are alleged to be by the defendant, this was error. The point assumed a finding by the jury that Mrs. Collins had entered under the transfer from her father, and had continued for twenty-one years after her entry to hold possession. Upon these facts the court was asked to say that her title could not be talked away by her husband. The point assumed a valid title under the statute. We do not see how her husband could talk away this title any more than if his wife had acquired her title by deed from those who held under the patentee. No matter how her title accrued, when once it was vested, neither her husband nor any one else could destroy it by his acts or words. We regret to disturb this verdict and protract this litigation, but we cannot say that the verdict might not have been different had the jury been left to pass upon the evidence relating to the transfer from John Shepherd to his daughter, and the alleged entry under it by Mrs. Collins and her family.</p>
