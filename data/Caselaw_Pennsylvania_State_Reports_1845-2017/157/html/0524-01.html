The taxation of the capital stock of these corporations at a different rate from the taxation of the personal property of individuals does not result in the want of uniformity forbidden by the constitution. While it is true that the capital stock of corporations represents their property, it is not identical with it, and cannot in any real sense be said to belong to the same class of subjects as the personal property of individuals.</p>
