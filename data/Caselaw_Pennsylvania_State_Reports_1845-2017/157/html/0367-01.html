It is the collecting or demanding the excessive fare or price which constitutes the offence. Now the collecting' and demanding the excessive tolls was done each time when the money was demanded and collected, and there were five of these in all. The plaintiff himself testified that he paid the defendant for the first week and after that every two weeks. We do <em>not </em>find any evidence of any demands, but simply of the payment of the money on the five occasions heretofore stated. The plaintiff testified: “ I always went to the tollhouse at the end of the bridge and paid it to the toll keeper or toll girl, whichever one was there. Q. Every two weeks you say? A. Every two weeks ; sometimes it might run a day or two over but would only pay for the two weeks.”</p>

Of course as theré were no 579 payments the defendant could not be convicted of that number of collections. It could only be convicted of the offence of each collection, and of these there were but five. It is idle to say that because there were 579 passages over the bridge for which the money was paid, therefore there were 579 offences for which the penalty was incurred, because the penalty was only incurred by the collection of the money, and there were but five collections in all. If <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>there had been but one collection of the whole amount there would have been but one offence, just as, if there had been no collection at all, there would have been no offence. The statute is penal and must be strictly construed, but it needs no strict construction because there could be no offence without a collection, and therefore there could only be as many offences as there were collections. We take no account of demands as a separate offence because there were none.</p>

The defendant was adjudged guilty of six distinct acts of sale of cigars and other merchandise to six different persons, and the full penalty of four dollars for each offence was imposed. <em>&lt; </em>The court below sustained the convictions and affirmed the judgment. This court, however, reversed the judgment, holding that there„could be but one recovery for all the violations of the act on the same day, although the act provided that, “ every such person, so offending, shall, for every such offence, forfeit and pay four dollars to be levied by distress.” We held that there could be but one violation of the law on the same day, no matter how many or how few were the articles sold. Mr. Justice Gordon said, delivering the opinion: “ Moreover, the offence consists in ‘ performing any worldly employment or business whatsoever on the Lord’s day, commonly called Sunday,’ so that there is no proscription <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>of any one or more distinct act or acts, but of any employment or business, whether the act or acts which constitute such employment are one or many. Friedeborn’s business was that of a vender of tobacco, cigars, etc., and he was not less a vender, though on Sunday, the 5th of October, he sold but one cigar, nor would he have been more so, had he on that day sold all the goods of which he was possessed. In either case he was engaged in his worldly employment, and that employment could not be changed, or its character altered, by the number of articles sold or the time required for its performance.”</p>
    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.5",396,[262,876,1168,753]]]'>It is just so in the present case. The act of collecting the unlawful tolls is the offence prohibited by the statute. Whether that act be the collection of one unlawful toll, or of a hundred, it is but a single act and it constitutes but one offence. There is no law or reason in dividing up the sum collected into as many parts as there were tolls aggregated in the collection, for the mere purpose of multiplying the penalties. The law does not require or justify any such subdivision. What it prohibits is a collection, and a collection is a unit. No matter how many items were included in the collection, if the whole of them were embraced in the one collection but one offence was committed. Just as in the case last cited, the offence was worldly employment on Sunday, but whether the instances of the employment were one or many, but one offence could be committed on the same day.</p>

There a baker was convicted of selling small hot loaves of bread on Sunday, and four separate convictions were had for four separate sales on the same day. But Lord Manseield held: “It is but one offence, whether longer or shorter in point of duration; so, whether it consist of one, or a number of particular acts. The penalty incurred by this offence is five shillings. There is no idea conveyed by the act itself, that if a taylor sews on the Lord’s day, every stitch he takes is a separate offence; or if a shoemaker or carpenter work for different customers at different times on the same Sunday, that those are so many separate and distinct offences. There can be but one entire offence on one and the same day. . . . Here repeated offences are not the object which the legislature had in view in making the statute ; but simply to punish a man for exercising his trade and calling on a Sunday.”</p>

But in the case at bar nothing is an offence but a collection or a demand of the illegal tolls. The several passages over the bridge included in one collection are perfectly lawful in every sense, and there is nothing about them, or that relates to them, that gives rise to any illegality, except the collection of the tolls charged for the passages, and as the collection is the single illegal act done, it is but one offence, no matter how many items it embraces.</p>

The plaintiff paid tlie excessive fare demanded by the company on twenty-six different occasions when he traveled on the defendant’s road. The court below gave judgment for the whole amount claimed by the plaintiff, but the court of appeals reversed the judgment, and held that only one penalty could be recovered for all the violations prior to the bringing of the suit. Ghovee, J., in the course of tlie opinion, after citing a number of authorities, says: “ My conclusion is, that but one penalty can be recovered upon the statute under consideration, for all the acts committed prior to the commencement of the action. . . . The legislature did not intend to open the door to a practice adopted in a ease originating in another part of tbe state, now under advisement in this court, of opening a book account of penalties earned, and delaying suit for a year, when such penalties amounted to between $20,000 and $80,000. A construction permitting this would defeat the intention of the legislature, which was to suppress the extortion by prompt prosecutions, by enabling parties to <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>forebear suing until the aggregate of penalties amounted to a large sum, and induce others to do as one of the plaintiffs in one of the cases nowin judgment was honest.enough to testify he did: that was, to abandon other business, and spend his time for a considerable period in riding back and forth from Tonawanda to Buffalo for the purpose of earning penalties.”</p>

To allow a person to open a book account of penalties at an insignificant way-station, and run up a charge of $24,000 for the failure of the conductor to announce the station or the length of stay, of which no passenger has complained, would shock the conscience, pervert the intention of the legislature, and turn a remedial into a highly punitive statute. If the legislature had in the act before us, in so many words, authorized what the plaintiff has done without any notice to the company, it would be difficult to sustain the constitutionality of the statute. For the effect would be the imposition of an excessive fine.” In this case the court held that only one penalty could be recovered up to the time of the bringing of the action.</p>

The act gave the whole of the penalty, $500, “ to the person thereby injured or aggrieved,” and it prohibited the exclusion of “ any person or persons on account of color, or race.” The persons excluded were a man and his wife. One action was brought and a recovery had for the exclusion of the wife, and another action was brought at the same time for the exclusion of the husband.

Mr. Justice Paxson, delivering the opinion, said: “ The fact that several persons may be aggrieved by the commission of a single offence, affords no ground to justify an inference that each may have his suit for the penalty imposed upon its commission, where the plain object of the law is to punish or repress a public wrong rather than to compensate a private injury. The penalty imposed by the act is so disproportioued to any supposable injuiy in an ordinary case, that we are bound to presume it was intended as a police regulation for the management of railroads, and to have been induced from motives of public policy.”</p>

The number of “violations” charged is 579, and the aggregate of the penalties, with which the defendant is debited, is $5,790. This book account of penalties is the cause of action in this case.
