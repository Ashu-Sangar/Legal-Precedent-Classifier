The state had opened with him four separate accounts : Personal property tax; license tax ; mercantile tax ; loans tax. As to the license and mercantile tax, he acted solely for the state. By the express terms of the act, the taxes on personal property were transmitted through him to the state treasury. While in office, he received large sums of county and state money from both sources, and became a defaulter as to each in the sum of more than half a million dollars. The quarterly returns and payments directed by the act of June 7, 1887, were not demanded or enforced against him by the auditor general, and he was permitted to retain large sums after they should have been paid into the state treasury. He appropriated to his own use, indiscriminately, the money of the commonwealth and county, and both will be losers to the amount of many hundreds of thousands of dollars by his dishonesty. The money claimed in this suit was paid to him by the receiver of taxes for the county and is lost, for he is now in prison for a long term, and is hopelessly insolvent. One hundred and forty-five thousand dollars of the money received for taxes on personal property for the year 1890 was paid by him into the state treasury, and appropriated on another account of the commonwealth by his directions, but the commonwealth’s officers had no knowledge of the fact that it was taken from the personal property tax money. Seventy-five thousand dollars of this sum was paid prior to the settlement by the auditor general, and $70,000 afterwards. The sureties of John Bardsley on his bond to the commonwealth paid the amount of the bond, $120,000, in October, 1891, to the commonwealth, and that sum was applied in part payment of indebtedness of Bardsley on other accounts.</p>

But, while it is plausible, it leads to a conclusion which is not the law. More than thirty years ago, after most careful consideration, both by the court below and this court, of the whole question, in Commonwealth v. Schuylkill County, <a href="/pa/86/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="86 Pa. 524" data-case-ids="1056611" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0524-01">86 Pa. 524</a>, it was decided, under similar facts, the county treasurer was not the agent of the commonwealth, but of the county, until the tax was paid by him to the state treasurer. The act of assembly of 29th of April, 1844, which provided for the assessment, collection, and payment into the state treasury by each county of its quota of state tax, as respects the question before us, is substantially the same in its provisions as the act of 1889. Under each act, the several counties are required to assess, collect and remit the tax to the state treasurer. The same defence was made by the county in that case as in this, and the late Judge Pearson, who presided, answered it thus: “ It is also urged that in collecting state taxes, the county treasurer acts as agent for the state, and not for the count3&gt;-, and no advantage can be taken by the state of the delinquency of her own agent. The law in force since 1834 required the county treasurer to collect state taxes, and to give bond for the faithful performance of his duty. The people of the county alone have authority to select the individual who shall perform that duty, and, when selected, none other can be employed. They must take care whom they choose for that purpose. To our mind, there is not even the semblance of hardship in making the same persons who select the agent responsible for his acts. It is no new duty thrown on the officer after his election ; the people choose him, with full knowledge that he must receive the state as well as the county funds. The liability is not, however, put on that position, but on the positive words of the act of assembly, which holds the county responsible for the taxes until paid into the state treasury.”</p>

      <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>On appeal to this court,-the judgment was affirmed, and it was said by Justice Strong, who delivered the opinion: “We consider it perfectly clear that the county is made responsible to the state for the quota of tax assessed against it, from which it cannot be discharged but by payment into the state treasury. If the collectors fail to collect the taxes due the state, the county treasurer must pay the amount out of any money in the treasury. If the taxes are collected, but not paid over by the county treasurer, he is responsible for the interest which the county may be obliged to pay, not liable to the state, but to the county.”</p>
    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.6",566,[282,944,1168,502]]]'>It was settled by that case, that, as to taxes assessed against the county, the county treasurer, in receiving and paying them over to the state, is the agent of the county. Nothing relieves the county from liability to the state but actual payment to the state treasurer. The decision has been followed since without interruption, and must be considered the law, binding on all the courts of the commonwealth until the legislature, by distinct enactment, establishes a new line at which the duty of a county treasurer ends, and his power and responsibility as an officer of the commonwealth begin.</p>

It is argued that such an appropriation was an embezzlement by him as a trustee of county funds, and that fact now appearing, the commonwealth holds the money on the same trust. Assuming that a knowledge on part of the state treasurer of such misappropriation of the county’s money, at the time it was made, would have turned the commonwealth into a trustee for the county, there is no pretence here that the state treasurer knew from what fund this money was taken when it was paid by Bardsley. It was applied as he directed <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>on an account which showed a large balance against him. Under all the facts developed, it is doubtful if anything would have been gained by either party by identifying misappropriations of the defaulting officer. He seems to have used county money to pay the state, and state money to pay the county, with an impartiality measured only by his necessities and the amount within his reach.</p>

To make it the subject of inquiry here, would, in effect, be to sustain a suit by the county against the commonwealth for the tortious act of the county’s agent in another transaction. Under such a construction of the act of 1811, holding on to taxes when paid, would require greater vigilance than collecting them when assessed; instead of money in the treasury determining the commonwealth’s ability to pay for public purposes, it would only show the amount on hand, subject to depletion for unknown claims. We think the court very properly declined to go into an inquiry which could not have profited defendant. The authorities cited by the learned counsel for appellant are all cases where the suit was by the beneficiary against an individual depositary of the trust fund, and therefore do not rule the case before us.

While it is true, as has been more than once said, “ judicial equity is not as broad as natural justice,” yet it seems to us, judicial equity, having a due regard for the law, can take notice of the facts in this case and so mold its decree as to prevent manifest injustice. Look at the facts as offered to be proven at the trial, and which are really not disputed by the commonwealth. The. county, through its proper officers, before the 1st of January, 1891, had assessed and collected the entire $779,811.22, personal property taxes for the year 1890, and paid them to John Bardsley, the county treasurer; the law required quarterly returns and payments by him to the commonwealth of all moneys received by him for use of commonwealth, and peremptorily enjoined payment of this particular tax, not later than the first Monday of September and second Monday of November. The county had, up to that point, performed its whole duty. But the law is settled, that Bardsley was the agent of the county, and therefore the responsibility of the county did not end until the money reached the state treasurer. The commonwealth had a right to insist on a strict compliance with the law, nay, it was her duty to do so; but, acting through her own officers, she did not so insist; on the contrary, it was proposed to prove that this money was, with the knowledge and consent of her officers, retained by Bardsley. We recognize fully the law, that laches cannot be imputed to the commonwealth, and her rights cannot be destroyed by the neglect of her agents. The United States v. Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheaton, 720, is the leading authority for this principle. It has been followed not only in this, but in all the other states of the Union. Its place in the law of the land is too firmly fixed to be shaken by the hardship of a particular case. But while the commonwealth cannot lose by the neglect of her own officers, and the county must, in this case, lose, it does not follow, under such circumstances, the commonwealth shall be the gainer. She is entitled to have put into her treasury just the amount of taxes which would have been there, if she had rigidly insisted on a compliance with the law. Taking the settlement of the Slat December, 1890, as fixing the rights of the commonwealth and the liability of the county as of that date, then what would <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>have been the situation if the commonwealth had demanded an immediate compliance with its terms?</p>
