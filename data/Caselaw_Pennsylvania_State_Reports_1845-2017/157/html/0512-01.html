    <p class="summary" id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.8",535,[148,746,1168,708]]]'>“ 1. The defendant is a corporation of the state of Pennsylvania chartered January 3,1874, under the act of July 18,1863, P. L. of 1864, p. 1102, entitled ‘ An act relating to corporations for mechanical, manufacturing, mining and quarrying purposes ’ and its various supplements. The purposes of said corporation, as set forth in its certificate of association, are: ‘ Mining of fire clay and the manufacture of fire brick, tiles and other articles made from fire clay, to sell such articles, and buy, lease and hold, such real estate and other property as may be necessary for the purpose of conducting said business.’ Its principal office is at Keystone Junction in the county of Somerset, a branch office also being maintained in the city of Pittsburgh. It is not engaged in the brewing or distilling of spirituous or malt liquors, and does not enjoy and exercise the right of eminent domain.</p>

Its capital stock is $80,000, which was fully paid up at the organization by conveyance to the corporation of certain real estate, mining fixtures, brick works, machinery, etc. During the tax year ending the first Monday of November, 1890, it declared three dividends thereon, amounting to 30 per cent. The settlement in question seeks to collect a tax of fifteen mills upon the whole capital stock.</p>

The real estate of the company consists of the following parcels: (1) Two acres of ground owned in fee, and several tenant houses owned in leasehold at Keystone Junction. On these two acres a brick works is located. (2) About four hundred acres in fee at Williams station, sixteen miles east of Keystone Junction; upon this tract there are several tenement houses, a brick works and a fire clay mine. (3) A leasehold of four hundred acres at Gooseberry, about two miles east of Williams station. In connection with this leasehold, the company owns a railway right, fifty acres of surface right in fee and about five or six tenant houses. (4) Pour acres in fee at Hyndman- station, about two miles east of Gooseberry; upon <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>■this tract a brick works is located, and about one mile distant :is the silica rock quarry, which is leased by the company.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.6",536,[288,739,1176,655]]]'>“ 4. The actual value of the manufacturing plant owned by the company, including buildings, machinery and land, is $65,000. The value of the Williams mine is $10,000. The value of the dwelling houses owned by the corporation is $8,000. These dwelling houses are indispensable to the carrying on the works .at the points where they are situated; almost without exception they are the only houses at said points. The mine is so connected with the manufacture of the brick that if the company did not own it, it would be very difficult to obtain enough clay for the works, and they would be run to such disadvantage .as to destroy all profit on certain grades of brick, thus rendering the works almost valueless and probably compelling the abandonment of the industry.</p>

    <p id="b537-8" data-blocks='[["BL_537.16",537,[138,1453,1166,846]]]'>The appellant company was incorporated under the provisions of the act of 1863. The purpose of its organization as expressed in the certificate of association was the “ mining of fire clay and the manufacture of fire brick, tiles and other articles made from fire clay.” It entered at once upon the business of manufacturing fire brick and other articles made from fire clay which, or the larger part of which, it mined for its own use from land owned or leased by it. Now whether regard be had to the primary legal organization of this company from which it derives its corporate life, or to the subsequent organization of its business plant, and the line of industry entered upon by it, the same conclusion is reached. This is not a mining company. It is a manufacturing company. As such it is attempting to supply itself with materials by the exercise of powers thought by its projectors to be incidental and ancillary, but the exercise of which the legislature has subjected to taxation.</p>
