All the specifications of error may be disposed of by considering whether there was sufficient evidence to leave to the jury the questions whether the testatrix was of sound mind at the execution of the will, and whether the will was procured to be made as it is, by means of undue influence.</p>
    <p id="b289-8" data-blocks='[["BL_289.13",289,[173,1900,1164,502]],["BL_290.1",290,[267,382,1173,1569]]]'>So far as the latter question is concerned it must be observed that the only person who is claimed to have exerted undue influence upon the testatrix is Mrs. Corbin. The contention of the appellant upon this subject is embarrassed by the fact that the will in question gives a much larger proportion of the estate to the appellant than was given to her by any of the preceding wills made by the testatrix, and hence if Mrs. Corbin induced Mrs. Watson to make this particular will her efforts enured to the benefit of the appellant instead of her injury. Mrs. Corbin herself received a moderate legacy under the will, <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>and if the will is to be set aside on the ground that she unduly influenced Mrs. Watson to give her that legacy, there ought to be some evidence that she solicited it, and by undue importunity induced the testatrix to give her the legacy in question. But there is no such testimony in the case. Not a witness testifies to having ever heard Mrs. Corbin solicit or request Mrs. Watson to give her any legacy at all. It is not enough to prove that she and Mrs. Watson were very friendly, or that she nursed Mrs. Watson during her sickness, or that she managed her affairs or that she spoke disrespectfully of the appellant to her, or that Mrs. Watson was fond of her or had a high regard for her or did what Mrs. Corbin asked her to do. The question is did Mrs. Corbin induce Mrs. Watson by undue solicitation, or influence, to give her the legacy -which is bequeathed to her by this will. Moderate solicitation is allowed under all the decisions, but here there is not the least particle of proof that Mrs. Corbin ever solicited, or in any manner requested, or even suggested, to Mis. Watson the idea that she should give her by will, either this legacy, or any legacy whatever. Counsel for appellant do not refer us to any such testimony and there is none such anywhere on this record. How then could the court below refer such a question to the jury for their determination? What evidence would there be for the jury to act upon of to consider? The authorities cited for appellant upon the effect of one occupying a confidential relation taking a large benefit for himself under an instrument which he wrote himself or procured to be written, are inapplicable because Mrs. Cor-bin neither wrote this will, nor procured it to be written, nor induced the testatrix to give her the legacy bequeathed to her in the will, nor even solicited or requested the testatrix to give her the legacjn</p>

That when he called the next morning he asked her as follows: “ Have you looked over the will and is it satisfactory? And she said she had, and that she had signed it, too, so that she wouldn’t have to sign it when the men would be here.” He also testified: “ Q. Who dictated to 3'ou the provisions of this last will? A. Mrs. Watson. Q. Did she understand the business she was engaged in ? A. I presume she did. Q. What was the condition of her mind on the day you took her directions as to the contents of her will ?

Q. Was there anything in her appearance or what she said to you either on the 5th or 6th of November that indicated any mental change in her from the time you first knew her ? A.

Who was in. the room when you took her directions. A. Mrs. Corbin ; Mrs. Watson gave me all the items of the will herself. Q. As you have inserted them ? • A. Of course; all the items are precisely the way she gave them to me.

She said she had signed it, and made the remark that she had signed before the men would come so that she wouldn’t have to write in the presence of men ; that is why I feel sure on that particular point.”</p>
    <p id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[272,1035,1169,745]]]'>The testimony of both the attesting witnesses was fully corroborated by that of Mrs. Corbin, and these three were the only persons present at the execution of the will. Mr. Simpson and Mrs. Corbin were the only persons present when the instructions were given by Mrs. Watson for the preparation of the will. The testimony as to what took place and what was said and done at the time the instructions were given, and at the time the will was attested, is so strong, full, clear and satisfactory that it would require testimony of a very serious, precise and positive character, to overcome it. In the case of Grubbs v. McDonald, <a href="/pa/91/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="91 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="488177" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0236-01">91 Pa. 236</a>, we said : “ Testamentary capacity is the normal condition of one of full age, and the affirmative is with him who undertakes to call it in question, and this affirmative he must establish not in a doubtful but in a positive manner.”</p>

The testimony to charge her with the want of understanding in that regard, which would be necessary to overthrow the will, would have to be of a most precise and specific character and would have to reach to the very vital substance of the adversary contention. The case is of a very unusual and unique character. The contest over the will is initiated and carried on by the per<a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>son who is much the largest legatee under its terms. Usually these contests are conducted by persons who are either entirely left out of the will or who are cut off with a very small provision in their favor. But here Mrs. Oestrich, who has much the largest legacy under the will, is seeking to set it aside, not because she does not get a liberal provision under the will, but because some legacies are given to others, two thousand dollars to a faithful nurse, the same amount to an esteemed and faithful physician, who is to give his services as executor as a partial consideration for his legacy, two legacies of a thousand dollars eaeb to a brother and a niece, with a residuary provision in favor of her brothers and sisters. It is practically tliese legacies to the others that the appellant wants and is seeking to get by this proceeding. The obstacle in the way of lier success is a very serious one. Because, if the testatrix knew what she was doing when she gave to the scrivener the very precise instructions which are written in the will in favor of the other legatees, the will is a good and valid testament, notwithstanding any amount of mere theory in regard to the effect of taking morphia in moderate doses for any length of time, or of a few unimportant and merely temporary delusions, chiefly if not entirely resulting from the use of such a remedy. How can it be said that the testatrix did not know that she was giving these various legacies to the several persons named, when it was she herself who dictated them, and directed them to be expressed in lier will? There is not a particle of testimony to prove that any one of these legatees, or any one else, ever solicited, or requested, or suggested to the testatrix the idea of giving these legacies by her will. Why shall her desire, and her undoubted right, to give them be frustrated and taken from her, when she lias herself clearly and solemnly declared, both verbally in giving her instructions, and in writing by lier will duly signed and sealed, that such was her wish, her desire and intent ? If she did not know what she was doing, of course her testamentary act was nugatory. But who does say, or who can say, and where is the testimony, any testimony, on this record, which shows, or tends to show, that she did not know perfectly well when she gave the instructions for these legacies, and signed, sealed, published and declared the paper in controversy to be her written will, that she did not know what she was doing? There <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>. is no such testimony, not even a fragment of it, anywhere in the case. And in the absence of such testimony it was the duty of the learned court below to withdraw the consideration of such a question from the jury.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[232,571,1176,1822]],["BL_295.1",295,[169,365,1167,297]]]'>Now the kind of testimony by which the appellant seeks to make out the proof which the law requires in this class of cases is, that the testatrix was addicted to the use of morphia, and that in a few instances she had delusions as to seeing objects about her that had no existence. As to the use of morphia, it was most conclusively shown that she took it in moderate quantity, for a considerable time, for the purpose of obtaining relief from excessive pain resulting from most severe and long continued chronic rheumatism, and also at times to quiet restlessness and obtain sleep. It was abundantly shown by the medical testimony that this drug is constantly, and most beneficently given to unfortunate invalids afflicted with this dreadful disease, that it is given with perfect safety, that it always brings relief, and the great preponderance of the testimony was that it does not affect the mental power of the patient unless in extreme cases of excessive use. The dose taken by the testatrix was a pill containing the one eighth part of a grain, and it was testified that she took sometimes two, sometimes three, occasionally four or five, of these pills in a day and night. None of the physicians said that this was an excessive use, and nearly all of them said that, as the system becomes habituated to the use of the drug, it requires an increased quantity to produce the same effect, and the system is able to take it without serious effect upon the mind. One of the physicians for the appellant said, in answer to a hypothetical question, that he should expect a deleterious effect from the continued use of an eighth or a quarter of a grain, in the case of a patient susceptible to the use of an eighth of a grain, when such a patient would use continuously two to three pills of one eighth each, and he would expect the judgment to be impaired, also the will power and the ability to accomplish work. Other physicians thought differently. But the inconsequence of such a mode of proving mental unsoundness becomes at once apparent when it is considered that only actual, real, mental unsoundness at the time of the testamentary act is the important subject of inquiry. While sueft proof may be useful in ascertaining the cause of actual <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>mental unsoundness, it is of no avail to establish its existence, unless the other proof in the ease clearly shows that it was really present. In other words, unless the theory that it ought to exist, or might exist, be followed by proof tliat it actually did exist at the important moment, the theoretical proof is of no practical value in the contention.</p>
    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[169,672,1165,297]]]'>There was also proof that on a few occasions the testatrix imagined she saw about her objects which were not present. An examination of the testimony shows that these occasions were of rare occurrence and of momentary duration, and they were easily accounted for as resulting from the use of morphia, particularly in awaking from its influence.</p>
    <p id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[167,978,1169,1420]],["BL_296.1",296,[273,369,1168,84]]]'>It was also shown that she was of an unusually generous disposition, making frequent gifts of money and specific articles to those about her, and in two instances giving away valuable pieces of real estate. It may be conceded that she was lavish in this respect, but these were gifts inter vivos, which she could make according to her pleasure, and which however unwise they were in a mere worldly point of view, are very far indeed from establishing mental unsoundness. She was at those times estranged from her daughter, and felt a desire no doubt to benefit the donees while she lived. The most important of these gifts, the one made to Lower, was made several years before lier death to a person who bad been kind to her, and for whom she at that time entertained an affectionate regard. The other gift of real estate was to her nurse, who constantly attended her and cared for her, and remained with her day and night and ministered to all her wants. The testatrix was a very great sufferer from a most painful disease, she was obliged to use crutches in walking for many years, and towards the last was confined to lier bed constantly. To sucli persons the continuous presence and unceasing and kindly attentions of a faithful nurse are most grateful and comforting, and it is not at all surprising that a person so unfortunately circumstanced, and having the financial ability to do so, should take pleasure in making valuable gifts to such a friend. Persons who do such things are not therefore to be considered as insane. The foregoing were the leading facts alleged in support of the theory of mental unsoundness at the time the will was executed. They are totally inadequate to establish such a <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>condition, and no verdict could be sustained which avoided a will on such facts.</p>
    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[272,471,1179,1519]]]'>It was fully proved that Mrs. Watson transacted her own business up to the time of her death. She collected her own moneys, caused them to be deposited in bank, drew checks on the banks when she wanted money, emplo3red and discharged her servants, paid them their wages herself, lowered the wages of one of her woman servants from $5.00 a week to $3.00, because she had her boy boarding in the house, settled and paid her taxes, paid her bills, and did whatever other things were required up to the time of her last illness and death. Here is the testimony of a tax collector who collected a bill of taxes from her on November 11,1891, six days after the will in controversy was executed. “ This is an unusual statement; there was her own tax and then half the Hefright and Watson taxes; her own tax was $144.26 and her half of the Hefright and Watson taxes, or the one fourth, was $60, the whole is $204.26 ; this is the receipt and statement. . .

On that day was she in your judgment capable of attending to business ? A. .Yes, sir. Q. Did she understand that business ? A. She certainty did. I called on her frequently for taxes still; I have been collector now since 1888 and I called on her every year; and she just seemed as capable, only that she seemed weak; she was in bed but she understood her business; she said I came for taxes and she talked with me, and told Mrs. Corbin to get the money, — they* had it all prepared and I gave her a statement and the receipt. . . Q. Did you notice any difference in Mrs. Watson on the day she paid you this tax over any other time she paid you taxes, except as to her physical condition ? A. No, sir, not any.”</p>

After saying that she had been in conversation with Mrs. Watson for an hour or an hour and a half she was asked: “ Q. What was the manner of Mrs. Watson’s conversation that day ? A.

    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.5",297,[159,672,1165,962]]]'>There was very much more testimony as to acts, conversations and transactions of Mrs. Watson before, at the time of, and after the execution of the will, exhibiting her as a perfectly rational and responsible person, in the full possession of her faculties, and really nothing to show that she was irrational or incapable, except in the few instances of momentary delusion already referred to. No attempt was made or suggested to have her declared unsound or to take the management of her property out of her hands. No one seems to have thought there was any occasion for it. She was very feeble and weak physically, as a result of her sickness and advancing years, but mentally she was bright, intelligent and thoroughly conscious. There was much testimony in the case of a frivolous character and quite irrelevant to the main contention, and after reading it all over carefully we fail to discover any that would be sufficient to sustain a verdict against the will, and we therefore think that on the merits of the testimony the learned court below was entirely correct in withdrawing the questions of incapacity and undue influence from the jury.</p>
