On the morning of the day of the accident, the coal ears had been left on a side track at a distance of about two rr iles from the place of collision. The cars were properly braked, and a throw-off switch, which would have derailed the cars if left undisturbed, was left open so as to throw the ears from the track if they were moved. The cars remained in this condition during the day. Late in the afternoon a boy got upon the cars, loosed the brake by hammering it with a coupling pin, and closed the throw-off switch. The cars ran down the siding on to the main line, and collided with the train on which plaintiff was riding. It appeared from the evidence that there was another throw-off switch nearer the main line, but that this had not been opened by defendant. It also appeared that there were no locks on either switch. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption of negligence on the part of the railroad company, and that a verdict for the company should be sustained.</p>

It has been testified here and not contradicted, but it is for you to say, however, whether you believe the testimony of the witnesses, that they braked that train of coal cars. I believe two or three witnesses swore that the first car was braked on both ends, the next car was braked on one end, and one witness this morning testified that he braked the empty cars. It is manifest from the sequel that the empty cars were braked, because they remained on the track, while the loaded cars were the runaways which caused the injuries. It has also been testified by several witnesses, those who did the act and others who saw it after it was done, that a certain throw-off switch was left open, so that, if by any means this train could have got loose from its moorings, it could not have been run down to the main track <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>but would have been thrown off and ditched.

Two loaded coal cars which had been standing on a side track, at a distance of almost two miles from the place of collision, were detached from a number of other cars to which they were coupled, a throw-off switch, which would have derailed the cars if left undisturbed was closed so as to lead the cars on the side track down a moderate grade until it joined the main track. There the cars collided with a miner’s train on which the plaintiff was riding as a passenger and killed two persons and injured others, among whom was the plaintiff. The coal cars which had attained a very high speed ran into the miner’s train from behind and drove the forward car, on which the plaintiff was' riding, into the tender and engine. The plaintiff was a passenger and was injured without any fault of his own. As the injury was inflicted by a collision of other cars and on the track of the defendant company, he was entitled to, and received, the benefit of the legal presumption that the injury was the consequence of the defendant’s negligence, which presumption it was the defendant’s duty to rebut or suffer a recovery of damages by the plaintiff. The only substantial question in the case was whether the presumption of negligence was rebutted by the evidence. That question was left to the jury by the learned court below, and the jury found that it was, by returning a verdict in favor of the defendant. It is difficult to see how any other verdict could have been returned consistently with the testimony. The evidence, which was entirely uncontradicted, showed that a small train, consisting of four loaded, and six or seven empty coal cars, was taken up the Northern Central track over on the side track, which belonged to the Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R. Co., but was used by the defendant, at about half past ten o’clock in the morning. The engine was detached from the train and the cars were left standing on the side track and remained there during the day. The loaded cars were in front. There was a throw-off switch on the track upon which the cars were left standing, a short distance below the cars.</p>

The cars were in the same position as when they were left by the crew in the morning at eleven o’clock. The brakes on the two cars in question were in the same condition as then, they were set tight and held the cars. The throw-off switch was open as it was left in the morning, so that if the cars had started they would not have run down the track but would have been derailed on the meadow. The absolute sufficiency of the precautions taken was conclusively proved by the fact that they did prevent the cars from starting, and made it impossible for them to run down the track if they had started. It cannot therefore be argued that they were insufficient. The jury has found that the defendant did its whole duty in the way of precautions and were not guilty of any negligence which led to the collision.</p>

Between five and six o’clock on the same afternoon, a boy named. John McCoskey got on the cars between the second and third cars and was seen hammering at the ratchet wheel of the brake with a coupling pin which he had in his hands. A very few minutes before he got on the cars he turned the throw-off switch in front of the cars so as to close it and let the cars run down on the track. He hammered at the cog which holds the brake for a minute or so, until he got it loose when the cars started on the track. Three boys testified to seeing this, and one of them, Alexander Smoogen, jumped on the cars and tried to stop them with the brakes, but did not succeed, and he then jumped off to save himself. The cars ran on down the side track and on to the main track, where they collided with the miners’ train, and did their dreadful work. There is not the least dispute as to this state of facts, and the jury confirmed it by their verdict.</p>

The learned court below did, with some well founded hesitancy, commit to the jury the question of the defendant’s negligence in the precautions they took. It was argued in the lower court as here that the defendant might have opened the lower switch, or put locks on the switches, and therefore they did not exercise the very highest degree of care which was possible to human skill, prudence and foresight. But this argument overlooks the fact that the upper switch was left open, which made it impossible for the cars to get to the lower switch, and the further fact that any person who would misplace a switch would break a lock, if it were there. But the argument is fatally defective in that it is founded upon the theory that transporting companies are legally bound to take precautions against the criminal acts of strangers, and are responsible for such acts if they do not. We have not been referred to any case, and we know of none, in which such doctrine has ever been held.</p>

The plaintiff was entirely without fault and the accident was the insult of a defect in the axle. Of course the presumption of negligence arose, and the defendant undertook to rebut it by proving that new wheels and axles had been put on a few months before, and that they were of good quality; that they were constantly inspected, that the road was in good order and the train running at proper speed, and that they had employed such appliances as were approved by the most experienced railroad operators and mechanics. The case was tried in the District Court of Philadelphia by the very able and distinguished J udge Thayer, then of that court, who submitted the question of negligence to the jury in a lucid and exhaustive charge which received the full approbation of this court.

The rule does not require the utmost degree of care which the human mind is capable of imagining; but it does require that the highest degree of practicable care and diligence should be adopted that is consistent with the mode of transportation adopted. Railway passenger carriers are bound to use all reasonable precautions against injury of passengers; and these precautions are to be measured by those in known use in the same business which have been proved by experience to be efficacious. The company are bound to use the best precautions in known practical use.

Prima facie, where a passenger, being carried on a train, is injured without fault of his own, there is a legal presumption of negligence casting upon the carrier the onus of disproving it (citing several cases). This is the rule when the injury is caused by a defect in the road, ears, or machinery, or by a want of diligence or care in those employed, or by any other thing which the company can and ought to control, as a part of its duty to carry the passenger safely; but this rule of evidence is not conclusive. The carrier may rebut the presumption and relieve himself from responsibility by showing that the injury arose from an accident which the utmost skill, foresight and diligence could not prevent. . . .

Here the injury was not the result of any defect in any of the appliances used by the defendant, nor by any want of skill, foresight and diligence which was humanly possible. The injury was not the result of any act of carelessness or negligence on the part of anybody. It was the result, exclusively, of a deliberate, intended, willful, affirmative, positive act of criminal trespass. No mere act of carelessness or negligence could have turned over the switch, which was set to derail the cars, so that it would throw the cars on the track instead of off. No mere act of carelessness or negligence could, or would, have taken out the coupling pin which held the cars together. No mere act of carelessness or negligence could, or would, have driven back the ratchet which held the brakes in place, four of them in all, so as to set the cars in motion. All, and every one, of these <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>acts required special physical effort, exerted for the very purpose of releasing the cars from the entirely sufficient restraints which had been imposed upon them by the company’s agents, and these efforts were made each one after the other, in a wicked and deadly succession, until the horrible purpose was accomplished and the work of death and destruction resulted. How can it be said that any human skill, foresight, or diligence could have divined, or believed, or imagined that such acts would have been perpetrated ? It would require a gift of omniscience to foresee them, a gift of prophecy to foretell them, and neither of these qualities is human. 'It is useless to say that additional precautions might' have been taken. So they might, if the possibility of such acts could have been known in advance. A force of men might have been stationed at the cars, to prevent the possibility of another force of men invading them and setting them loose, but such transactions are outside the pale of human experience, and it is simply preposterous to say that the omission to take that kind of precautions is negligence, in any conceivable aspect of the case. Placing blocks under the wheels, and locks on the switches, avail nothing against the deliberate, willful and intended purpose to set free loaded cars in such circumstances as these. The same purpose which would turn over the switch, take out the coupling pin, and then hammer at the brakes until they were opened, would remove the blocks from the wheels and shatter the lock on the switch. But it is not one or another particular act of precaution, the want of which is to be set up as a test of the legal duty of precaution, but the whole criminal purpose sought to be accomplished. If that purpose and corresponding action were such as not to subject the defendant to a duty of precaution against it, the presence of some precautions, and the absence of another, which might or might not have been effective, or might have been more effective than those that were observed, is of- no moment in the consideration of the general question as to the existence of the legal duty. If the purpose and the act were criminal, and were those of a stranger, and could not have been foreseen by any human skill or knowledge, the duty of precaution against such acts does not arise, and negligence does not result from the want of such precautions.</p>

R., 34 N. Y. (Court of Appeals) 9. The plaintiff was a passenger on the railroad of the defendant at night. “ The train was thrown from the track through the culpable act of some unknown person who maliciously or mischievously drew the spikes which fastened the chairs and the rails. Marks were visible on the ties, of a claw bar having been used in removing these spikes. Two trains had passed over this section of the road at the point where the injury happened. . . . The road was in good condition when these trains passed over it in safety and without any obstruction.” Davies, J., in delivering the opinion said: “ The only question upon this appeal is, whether there was any evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants or their servants, sufficient to warrant the learned justice who tried the action in submitting that question to the jury. It is a familiar principle that earners of passengers are not insurers of the safety of their passengers. Their duty is measured by the dangers which attend railroad carriage ; and the utmost foresight as to possible dangers and the utmost prudence in guarding against them are required to exempt them from liability in case of injury to a passenger. . . . There was no evidence in this action of any negligence on the part of the defendants, their servants or agents. This portion of the track was laid with the best and most improved rail. It was in perfect order. It had been passed over by their trackmaster a few hours before the accident. Within two hours before it occurred, three trains of ears had passed over it in safety, and it must then have been in complete order. The proximate cause of the accident was the removal of the spikes which fastened the chairs and rails to the ties and sleepers. It is apparent that, as soon as these fastenings were removed, a superincumbent pressure would displace the rails, and thus inevitably throw the cars off the track. No human care or foresight could guard against such a diabolical <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>act, committed under the circumstances developed in this case. It is clear that these fastenings must have been removed after the last train going east had passed the point where the road was disturbed.”</p>

But in the case at ba,r there was full proof that the cars were uncoupled, and the brakes loosened, and the switch turned back, by a person who was a total stranger and having nothing to do with the defendant company, and for whose acts, therefore, the company was not responsible in any conceivable manner.</p>

Reports, 534, is another instance in which the same doctrine of non-liability was held, although there, the evidence was sufficient to warrant a verdict of negligence. The plaintiff was a passenger and was injured by the car running off the track at a switch at a station, which was misplaced, on the main track. There was no evidence to show how it became misplaced, and as it was at a station there was sufficient evidence of want of care to carry the case to the jury. But the court of appeals in their comments upon the rule of duty applicable in such cases said : “ Carriers of passengers are not insurers ; and many injuries may occur to those they transport for which they are not responsible. They are, for obvious reasons, held bound to exert the utmost care and vigilance to secure the safety of passengers, and are responsible for the slightest negligence. But injuries may often happen through the fault or misconduct of those whose acts are in no way chargeable to them. . . .

But they were detached from the other cars, their brakes were opened and the derailing switch turned back by one who was a stranger, and, within a very few minutes after this was done, the collision occurred. There was no time for the defendant’s agents to discover the mischief, and they cannot be charged with negligence in that respect. So far as this defendant is concerned, it is of no consequence who it was that committed this crime nor what his motives were.

The first of them is Penna. R. R. Co. v.

On the trial the court below instructed the jury that they should start with the presumption that the defendant was guilty of negligence from the mere happening of the accident, and that it thereupon devolved upon the defendant to rebut that presumption and show that they were not negligent. We held that this was error, because the accident occurred from something extrane'ous to the railroad and the appliances of travel, and it would be necessary for the plaintiff to go further and affirmatively prove that there was negligence. The present Chief Justice, in delivering the opinion, pointed out the difference between an accident resulting from the mere operation of the road, and one which was the result of some extrinsic cause. In the former the presumption of negligence arose from the mere happening of the accident, in the latter no such presumption arose, and the fact of negligence for which the defendant was responsible, must be proved <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>by satisfactory testimony, just as in any ordinary case between strangers. Concluding, he said : “ If the case had been submitted to the jury on the evidence, and they had found therefrom that the plaintiff’s injury resulted from something connected with the operation of the railroad, and not from something entirely disconnected therewith, and with which neither the company nor its employees had anything whatever to do, that would have raised prima facie a presumption of negligence on the part of the company, and thrown upon it the burden of proving that it did not exist.”</p>

But the defendant met and rebutted’that presumption by showing conclusively, aud without the least contradiction, that the collision was occasioned solely bjr the criminal act of a stranger with whom neither the company nor its agents bad anything to do. As this was an undisputed fact, it is almost impossible to understand why tbe learned court below would not have been justified in withdrawing the ease from the jury, as was done in the case of Deyo v. N. Y. Cent. R. R. Co., supra, on the ground that, upon the whole testimony, no negligence was shown for which the defendant was responsible.

It is sufficient to say in reply, that, in view of the entirely uneontradicted testimony in this case, it was only necessary to inquire whether the defendant had rebutted the presumption of negligence which arose from tbe mere fact of the injury. There was nothing in the case but the mere presumption. All of the actual testimony as to the real facts of the occurrence, tended, in a most eminent degree, to show that there was no negligence for which the company was responsible, and that the injury was the result of tbe willful criminal trespass of a stranger. In such circumstances tbe highest inquiry that <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>could legitimately be conducted by the jury, was whether there was any negligence on the part of the defendant in the precautions taken against such an accident.

There the evidence showed that shortly before the accident a stone was found inserted under the lever of one of the points, and the defendant claimed that this had caused the accident, and as it was the willful act of a stranger they were not responsible. The judge who tried the case thought there was no evidence of actual negligence, and told the jury that if the defendant’s account was correct they were entitled to a verdict, unless the jury thought there was negligence in not having a person to take care of the points, and he said he did not think there was. A verdict was rendered for the plaintiff, and on a rule for a new trial the case was heard in banc and the rule made absolute. The court said: “ There was evidence that there had been a willful act on the part of a stranger which would have caused the accident, and no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants. None was suggested except their not having a person always at the spot to look after the ‘points,’ which they were not bound to have. The siding had been in that state for months, and no accident had. happened. The verdict was clearly contrary to the evidence, and there must be a new trial.” In this case there was no proof as to who had placed the stone under the lever, and the verdict had found negligence as a fact, but the court set it aside as unwarranted by the testimony.</p>

The facts, and the conclusions of this court, are well stated in the opinion of Chief Justice Paxson. “ On June 5, 1890, the appellant was a passenger on the cars of the defendant company, and in the vicinity of Pottstown was struck on the arm by a missile with sufficient force to cause a fracture thereof. It was not shown what caused the injury; the appellant did not see the missile nor was it found in the car. There was no evidence that any one was near the train on the outside who could have inflicted the injury. This suit was brought to recover damages for the injury referred to. The theory of the appellant was that it was caused by a loose nut, thrown from one of the switches of the defendant’s roadbed, over which the train was passing at the time. This was a mere theory however without any evidence to sustain it. The appellant contended that under such circumstances the question of the defendant’s negligence should have been submitted to the jury. The court took a contrary view of the case and directed a verdict for the defendant. This was the error assigned. . . . There was nothing in the evidence to connect the accident with any defect in the cars or machinery, the movement of the train, or in any of the appliances of transportation. There was nothing therefore to submit to a jury. It would be as reasonable to hold that a bullet fired into the ear from without, by means of which a passenger is killed, is evidence of negligence on the part of the company.”</p>

But he left the question of actual negligence to the jury, who properly decided there was none, and that is the end of the plaintiff’s case.

    <p id="ANS" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[933,370,205,42]]]'>dissenting:</p>
    <p id="b152-4" data-blocks='[["BL_152.5",152,[281,419,1168,195]]]'>If the right of trial by jury, “ as heretofore,” is to “ remain inviolable,” it behooves us, in my judgment, to disapprove of such constraining influence as was improperly brought to bear upon the jury in this case.</p>
    <p id="Abd" data-blocks='[["BL_152.6",152,[280,624,1169,500]]]'>While the learned judge, who presided at the trial, rightly conceded that the case hinged on questions of fact which he could not, in any event, withdraw from the jury, he submitted them with evident reluctance, and with such an emphatic expression of his own opinion that said questions should all be determined in favor of the company defendant that it was next to impossible for the jury to discharge their duty, as the constitutional triers of fact, with that sense of unconstrained freedom which should always characterize the deliberations of every jury in such cases as this.</p>
    <p id="b152-6" data-blocks='[["BL_152.7",152,[277,1133,1171,704]]]'>Referring to the duty which the company as a common carrier of passengers owed to the plaintiff, and whether that duty had been properly performed, etc., he said: “ Under the law applicable to this case I must submit the question to you to determine whether you find the defendant was careless in not opening the lower switch or putting on locks. Personally, if I were a juror, I would say no. If I were a juryman, I would think that the company had done all that any prudent man would do ; it braked its cars, opened the throw-off switch and left them there. But the question must be submitted to you, as jurors, to say whether you find it was carelessness on the part of the defendant to leave those cars there on the decline on which the cars would have run into the main road in case they had got loose.”</p>
    <p id="b152-7" data-blocks='[["BL_152.8",152,[275,1847,1168,553]]]'>Again he said: “ There is another part of the case which is brought out with great strength under the evidence, and proved, I think to your satisfaction, as at least it is to mine, that this accident was caused by the willful misconduct of certain boys ; that those bojrs meddled with those cars and that switch, and that it was their willful misdoing that caused the accident. I leave it to you to say whether you think under those circumstances a company ought to be held responsible for the malicious, willful misconduct of bad boys. My own individual opinion in that case is that they ought not, but as I am bound to leave that question to you, I do leave it to you to determine.”</p>
    <p id="b153-2" data-blocks='[["BL_153.3",153,[128,383,1161,500]]]'>
      <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>Again, in answering defendant’s fifth point, in which he was asked to say, as matter of law, that “ neither the absence of a lock from the throw-off switch in the immediate vicinity of the coal cars, nor the failure to open the double rail switch, used as a throw-off, near the Corbin colliery, can be regarded as any proof of negligence on the part of the defendant,” he again volunteered his own opinion on the question, as one of fact which, as he said, “ mast be submitted to ” the jury, by saying, in substance, that the manifest acts of omission stated in the point could not be regarded as any proof of negligence.</p>
    <p id="b153-3" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[128,891,1164,1263]]]'>But the learned judge’s oft-repeated declarations of his own opinion on questions of fact which were exclusively for the consideration and determination of tbe jury, and wbat he would do if he were a juror, etc., are not all. There are grave errors of law for which alone the judgment should be reversed. In the paragraph first above quoted from the charge, the standard of duty applied to defendant company as a common carrier of passengers is ordinary care merely, viz.: “ If I were a juryman, I would think that the company had done all that any prudent man would do; it braked its cars, opened the thimv-off switch and left them there.” It is no compliment even to an ordinarily prudent man to say that he would not have done more than brake the cars in such a way that even children could at any time start them down grade on their death-dealing errand, or open the throw-off switch and leave the lever unlocked and unsecured, in any manner, so that any thoughtless or mischievious boy could shut it again with perfect ease. But, when we apply to defendant’s conduct, in leaving the coal cars in such an insecure condition, etc., the high standard of care which the law requires carriers of passengers to exercise, how widely different is the case ? The contract to carry implies that every precaution which human skill could suggest has been taken to guard against every apparent danger that may beset the passenger, and that same degree of care will continue to be exercised until he reaches the end of his journey.</p>
    <p id="b153-4" data-blocks='[["BL_153.5",153,[126,2162,1164,247]],["BL_154.1",154,[304,382,1166,654]]]'>The siding or branch, on which the coal cars stood, was of unusually heavy grade, descending rapidly to its junction with the main line, on which was the train in which plaintiff and other passengers were being transported. As a necessary precaution against the danger of cars escaping by accident or other<a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>wise and running down into the main line, the two throw-off switches were constructed, one near the point where the coal cars stood, and the double rail switch further down. The former was opened, as is alleged, but left unlocked and without any kind of fastening. The latter was not even opened. If it had been, the escaping coal cars would have been arrested by it in their downward course. If the upper switch, alleged to have been opened, had been locked or otherwise securely fastened, the danger of its being opened would certainly have been greatly lessened. The omission to even open the lower switch, and to use proper means to prevent the closing of the upper one, were certainly evidence of culpable negligence on the part of the company.</p>
    <p id="b154-4" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[309,1044,1163,299]]]'>The construction of these throw-off switches is proof of their necessity, but if they were not used or not properly secured, of what avail could they be in averting danger ? It is too plain to admit of any doubt that even suggesting to the jury that these acts of omission should not be regarded as any proof of negligence was error.</p>
    <p id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.5",154,[308,1351,1166,1059]],["BL_155.1",155,[139,367,1165,236]]]'>The unqualified affirmance of defendant’s second point was plain error. In affirming that point, without any qualification or explanation, the learned judge instructed the jury, in the words, thereof, thus: “ The uncontradicted testimony on the part of the defendant, shows that the proximate cause of the collision, in which the plaintiff was injured, was the wrongful act of trespassers upon defendant’s cars. For such wrongful act, the company defendant, under the circumstances of the present case, is not responsible; and if the jury believe the said testimony, as to the proximate cause of the collision, their verdict should be for defendant.” The vice of this instruction is that it ignores the question of defendant’s omission to exercise that high decree of care which' the law requires. It was clearly the duty of the company to take every precaution, which human skill and foresight could suggest, to guard against every apparent danger that might beset the plaintiff and other passengers. It foresaw the danger of cars being detached, by accident or otherwise, and running down the heavy grade, uncontrolled, into the main track, and it accordingly provided the two throw-off switches to guard against that apparent danger, but it omitted to properly use the means which it had pro<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>vided expressly for that purpose. It omitted even to open one of the switches, and left the other unsecurely opened. That omission was at least such evidence of negligence as would have warranted the jury in finding that its neglect of duty was the cause of the collision.</p>
    <p id="b155-3" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[138,623,1165,755]]]'>There was also error in affirming defendant’s first point as presented. Other, errors of minor importance might he noted, but those, to which special reference has been made, are sufficient to show that a fair trial was not accorded to plaintiff. The emphatic and oft repeated expressions of opinion, etc., above referred to, were unwarranted, misleading and erroneous. They were an uncalled for invasion of the province of the jury. The line of demarcation between the duty of the court, as expounder of the law, and that of the jury, as the constitutional triers of fact, should be carefully observed. While, on the one hand, the court should not permit the jury to disregard or evade its instructions as to matters of law, it should be equally careful not to invade the province of the jury, and take upon itself the determination of questions of fact about which there is any doubt or dispute.</p>
    <p id="b155-4" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[139,1388,1161,84]]]'>For the reasons above suggested, the judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>
