We declined to accept his opinion as authority, believing our own entitled to equal weight, and believing that the proceedings were not analogous, because, in that case, only officers belonging to the same class or set were joined, whereas, in the case before us, several classes or sets were joined, and with them, also, individual officers. In the case before him the contest was only for councilmen; in the one before us, councilmen, school directors, burgess, and all other borough officers were joined in one proceeding, and we were warranted both by analogy and the precedents then existing in ruling the joinder to be fatal, but since then, in reviewing the opinion of Judge Fin-letter, the Supreme Court have said in plain and unmistakable terms that it is not necessary to file separate petitions to contest the election of several candidates for offices voted for on the same ticket. Promptly, on the filing of the above opinion, counsel for contestants renewed this motion for a rehearing, and feeling that he is entitled as a matter of right to be heard fully on the question of the applicability of the ruling of the Supreme Court to the case before us, and, realizing that it would be binding on us if applicable, we sustain his motion.”</p>

We would not wish to be cited as the first to so rule or to establish the precedent. And it is not necessary to so rule in order to follow the opinion or dictum of Judge Williams in above ease, or the opinion of Judge Fin-letter, which was reviewed by him; their opinion only applied to cases where the election of two or more persons to the same office was contested. The election of four persons returned as elected to councils (there being four vacancies) was contested in one proceeding, and Justice Williams says that in such a case he can see no reason for filing as many copies of the petition as there are persons on the ticket. Neither can we in such a case. Indeed, there is reason for joining all the persons named on the same ticket for councils, because, as Judge Finletter says in his opinion, ‘ if single petitions were presented, single persons must be selected as contestants and the evidence might show that neither was elected.’</p>

Let us see what he says : ‘ Ordinarily a single candidate is presented by each party for each office, and the returns will show the election of one and the defeat of his competitor, but it sometimes happens that two or more candidates for the legislature, for councils, for school di<a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>rectors, are to be cbosen from the same district; in that case each party puts forward its candidates, who are voted for upon the same ballot or ticket, and who are or may be elected or defeated together. When this happens, and the returns show the election of one set of the candidates and the contestants allege fraud or mistake, calculated to affect the entire ticket and to destroy the returns as to each one of the set returned as elected, we can see no reason for requiring the contestants to file as many copies of their petition as there are persons upon the ticket to be elected.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b664-4" data-blocks='[["BL_664.4",664,[262,890,1175,1272]]]'>“Now, it is plain and clear that wherever the word ‘ticket’ is used above it refers to the ticket upon which are. named ‘ two or more candidates for the legislature, councils,’ etc., and who are or may be elected or defeated together, and does not refer to a ticket upon which are named candidates for different offices. He first speaks of the ordinary cases ‘ where a single candidate is presented by each party for each office; ’ then of the extraordinary or unusual cases ‘ where two or more persons are to be elected to the same office, as legislature, councils,’ etc.; then he says: ‘ When this happens,’ <em>i. e., </em>the extraordinary case, ‘ we can see no reason for requiring the contestants to file as many copies of their petition as there are persons upon the ticket returned elected.’ Under the principle of inclusio unius, etc., there must be as many copies of the petition as there are ‘ single candidates ’ for each office returned as elected. Is not the implication or inference plain that where but one person is to be elected to each office there are reasons for requiring as many petitions as there are offices- to be contested ?. All through the opinion of Judge Williams he carries out the thought that he had only in his mind the facts of the particular case before him, and .the inference is plain .to us that he would not have ruled as he did had the facts been the same as in the case before us, where it is sought to contest in one proceeding the election of burgess, school directors, councilmen, constable, tax collector, justice of the peace.</p>
