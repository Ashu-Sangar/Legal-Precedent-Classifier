    <p class="summary" id="b413-8" data-blocks='[["BL_413.13",413,[181,893,1174,1526]],["BL_414.1",414,[257,387,1172,338]]]'>“ The contention of the plaintiff is that the act of 1700, providing for the erection of fences about cornfields, and other inclosures, and naming the kind of fence, height of it, and manner of its construction, was repealed by the act of 1889; that with that act fell the act of 1842, providing for the cost of maintenance and erection of partition fences between adjoining landowners. On the other hand, the defendant contends that, while the act of 1700 was repealed, the act of 1842 is still in force, and that it is still necessary for landowners to keep up the partition fences. Without any act of assembly on the subject, at common law, a man is not obliged to fence against his neighbor’s cattle, and a person is responsible for any damage that his cattle might do on the land of another. The act of 1700 was intended to prevent that in this state, and from that time until 1889 it did so. The act of 1842 we do not think was rendered null and void by the repealing act of 1889, as contended by defendant’s counsel. Between adjoining landowners, the act of 1842 is still in force, and it is now, as it was before the act of 1889, necessary for farmers to build partition fences,’ and to maintain them. That is the principal point which is raised in this case. [Therefore, as between Mr. Barber and Mr. Menseh, this fence being a common fence, they were both bound to see that it was in repair; that is, it was the duty of each of them to keep up every part of the fence, unless there was an agreement between them that one should keep up one part and the other the other, and I believe there was no evidence of any agreement of that kind in this case.] [1] There had been an agreement years before between Barber and Menseh as to the partition fence along the north line and east line of the tract of Menseh; but having sold part of the property to R. W. Barber, <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>this agreement fell between the points A and B on the map. At least, the defendant does not contend that they were not jointly liable to build the fence. Hence, if this fence between the points A and B, and through which the cattle passed, was defective, it was as much the fault of Barber as of Mensch, and being the fault of Barber he could not recover of Mensch on account of its bad condition. . . .</p>

There has never been a time, since man earned hi£&gt;bread by cultivating the ground, that some sort of an artificial separation, defining the limit of right of adjoining owners, has not been recognized as needful; and this not only by the people but by the lawmakers. Long before 1700, in England, separation constructions of some kind were a fruitful source of litigation. The partition fence was seldom wooden rails, as in Pennsylvania, but, if not, it was hedge, ditch, wall, or some other artificial separation.</p>

Although there were very many fence acts passed after the act of 1700, there were just about as many repealing statutes, up to the decision of this court in Gregg v. Gregg, <em><a href="/pa/55/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="55 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="1470741" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0227-01">55 </a></em><a href="/pa/55/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="55 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="1470741" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0227-01">Pa. 227</a>, in 1868, where it is declared, Strong, J., delivering the opinion, after a full consideration of the whole subject, that the result of all the legislation, the last act being that of April 11, 1862, was to leave the first section of the act of 1700 in force in all the counties of the commonwealth. To the same effect is the opinion of President Judge Mayer, of the 25th judicial district, on a case arising in Elk county, part of the original territory of Northumberland, as was Union county, from which comes the present case. The conclusions of the learned judge were based on a most careful examination of every statute oil the subject from 1700 down to 1890. This case is Thompson v. Kyler, 9 Pa. C. C. R. 205. An investigation just as thorough, was made by President Judge White, of the 40th district, in Arthurs v. Chatfield, reported in same book, page 34, in which he arrives at the same conclusions. So without again going into a laborious examination of the acts of assembly for the last 200 years, as urged by counsel for appellee, we treat the question as settled, that the first section of the act of 1700 was in force in Union county, as well as in the other counties of the state, at the date of its repeal in 1889.</p>
    <p id="b419-5" data-blocks='[["BL_419.4",419,[177,1656,1162,133]]]'>The question then is, what was the effect on the act of 1842 of the act of 1889, which repealed the first section of the act of 1700?</p>
    <p id="b419-6" data-blocks='[["BL_419.5",419,[176,1809,1164,605]],["BL_420.1",420,[253,380,1178,1218]]]'>By the repeal, the rights of landowners and owners of cattle are left as they were at common law before 1700. That is, the owner of cattle must now fence them in, or he is answerable in damages for their trespasses. But that affects not the correctness of the assumption in the act of 1842, that between adjoining landowners, a partition fence is needful, and will be built. Nevertheless, by the repeal, the changed purpose of the fence has transferred the liability, in such cases as the one before us, from the one damaged to the owner of the cattle doing the damage. Before the repeal, the complaining plaintiff, to recover, must show that he had maintained a “ sufficient ” fence, for it was his duty to fence out; since the repeal, the responding de<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>fendant, the owner of the cattle, must show, to prevent a recovery, that he, by a “ sufficient ” fence kept them in or tried to. It is the defendant now who is confronted with the act of 1842. The question to be put to him,' is: Under that act, did you construct a division fence sufficient to keep your cattle off your neighbor? If you did not, you must answer in damages; and this without regard to the liability for the cost of a division fence. It was his duty to have a sufficient fence, whether his neighbor built one or half of one. If he wanted his neighbor to share with him the cost, the method of enforcing contribution is yet plainly pointed out to him in the act of 1842. Viewers can still determine whether the fence is “ sufficient ” from the character and purpose of the structure, and can still assess and certify what proportion of the cost should be paid by the delinquent neighbor. As it is clearly right that this act should remain in force, because the assumption that partition fences are needful and will be built, in the act of 1842, was based on known facts which will continue to exist indefinitely in the future, it may be presumed the legislature of 1889 had this in mind when they passed the repealing act. Seeing no such connection or interdependence between the two acts, as called for saving words for the second, and realizing that the act of 1842 would not fall by the repeal of that of 1700, they refrained from saying anything on the subject of partition fences in the repeal.</p>
    <p id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[254,1607,1170,134]]]'>If, as is certain, they will be built, there is every reason why each owner should continue to equitably share the cost, for each shares the benefit.</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[251,1760,1172,451]]]'>So, while the learned judge properly held the act of 1842 was not repealed by the act of 1889, because there is no inconsistency between the two, we think he erred in holding that the liability for damage remained the same. In substance, he instructed the jury that if Barber had not, by a sufficient partition fence, barred out Mensch’s cattle, he could not recover. He should have instructed them, if Mensch had not, by a sufficient partition fence, kept them in, his defence failed, and Barber had a right to recover such damage as he sustained.</p>
    <p id="b420-7" data-blocks='[["BL_420.6",420,[251,2219,1167,94]]]'>This in effect disposes of the whole contention between the parties. The judgment is reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>
