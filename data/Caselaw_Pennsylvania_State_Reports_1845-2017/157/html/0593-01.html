The house was in the middle of a large lot which extended back to a street or road called the Derry road. The company, for the purpose of supplying the two houses of plaintiff and Mrs. Reuben Baker with gas, laid a large pipe, from its general system, into the Derry road, and near the end of this pipe put an elbow with a T, having two openings, one for the service pipe to the house of plaintiff and the other for the service pipe to the house of Mrs. Reuben Baker. Each of these openings at the T was protected by a valve. If these valves remained closed no gas could pass into the service pipes that were to be attached to the T; if they were open, the gas in the main would flow without any obstruction to the house. In preparing his house for the use of the gas, S. H. Baker, husband of plaintiff, had a system of pipes put through it, and this system was connected in the basement of the house where it was to be attached to the service pipe. He then had a two inch service pipe laid from the inside of his cellar wall down through his grounds to a point about ten feet distant from the main on the Derry road. The cellar end of this service pipe was not connected with the general house system and was left without any cap or plug. The family had been using the basement to cook in, and the open stove that always had fire in it stood but a few feet away from the open end of the service pipe. On Nov. 10,1886, Mr. Baker received from the superintendent of the gas company, W. L. Mellon, permission to connect his service pipe with the main in the Derry road. When <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>he went with his plumber to make the connection he found that gas at a high pressure was being discharged from the end of the T intended for Mrs. Reuben Baker’s house. He inquired of one Jerry Dillon, a lineman, and employee of the company, whom he found there, what was being done. Dillon informed him that water had gotten into the line, and he was using the full strength of the gas to blow the water out of the line. Mr. Baker said under those circumstances he would not connect up, but Dillon replied that the valve on his side of the T was closed and would remain so, and consequently no gas could get into his service pipe. Baker, relying on this statement of Dillon, had the connection made. This condition of things remained until the next morning, when Dillon, who was still at work blowing the water out of the line, opened the valve on Mr. Baker’s end of the T. The gas immediately flowed into the service pipe, and escaping through its open end into the cellar took fire at the stove and a heavy explosion followed.</p>

All the material facts of this ease are entirely undisputed, there being absolutely no conflicting evidence as to a single fact. The evidence thus undisputed clearly establishes that on Nov. 10,1886, the defendant company was carrying in its main line, on the Derry road, natural gas at high pressure, and was utilizing the pressure to blow the water out of its line. With full knowledge of both these facts, S. H. Baker, the husband and representative of Amanda M. Baker, on Nov. 10,1886, laid a two inch line from the cellar of his house down to the gas main and connected the two. There was then a single valve between the service pipe so laid and the gas in the main; Mr. Baker having been told, by one Dillon, an employee and lineman of the defendant company, that this valve would remain closed, saw fit to rely upon this statement of Dillon, and neglected to protect his own property by the simple device of capping the pipe in his cellar, and allowed the same to remain open only a few feet distant from the cooking stove. On Nov. 11, 1886, the same Dillon, for the purpose of blowing the water out of the line, opened the valve referred to. The gas was thus allowed to flow into the cellar of the house, and having become ignited at the stove the explosion and fire followed. The evidence further shows that if Mr. Baker had taken the trouble to cap the pipe in the cellar, the accident could not have happened. These facts being undisputed, it becomes the duty of the court to declare the law arising thereon, and we now instruct you that the act of Mrs. Baker in allowing that pipe in her cellar to remain uncapped, amounted to negligence, and, as it unquestionably contributed to the accident, she could not recover in this action, and the present plaintiff, claiming through and <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>under her, cannot recover. <em>Answer: </em>To affirm this point would require the court to take the responsibility of deciding that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, under the circumstances, in leaving the space in the cellar between his pipe and the plumbing. This, under the circumstances, we refuse to do. While the facts in this behalf may be undisputed, yet, in connection with the situation and all the circumstances, it is a case proper to call to the aid of the court the common sense and judgment of the jury, not to pass upon the facts, but to pass upon the question whether there was a want of ordinary care, under the circumstances, shown by Mr. Baker. And in this behalf we quote from Schum v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20Pa.%2012" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="107 Pa. 12">107 Pa. 12</a>: ‘But as we said in McCully v. Clarke, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20Pa.%20406" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="40 Pa. 406">40 Pa. 406</a>, there are some cases in which the court can determine that omissions constitute negligence. They are those in which the precise measure of duty is determined, the same under all circumstances. When the duty is defined, a failure to perform it is of course negligence and may be so declared by the court.’ Now, then, we cannot say what was the determinate duty of Mr. Baker under the circumstances, in view of the conversation had with Mr. Dillon, the lineman of the company, on the 10th of November, 1886, in leaving the pipe disconnected in his cellar. It is a question for the jury, in view of all the circumstances of the situation, to say whether it was negligence or not. If it was, and contributed in any degree to the result, then of course the plaintiff could not recover. Then we cannot say, as a matter of undisputed fact, that if a cap had been put upon the pipe in the cellar, that the accident would not have occurred; and.in this connection all the evidence submitted to us is that of Albert Klingensmith, who says if such cap had been on, the explosion would not have occurred unless the pipe had bursted.” [1]</p>

As to the first, the testimony is such that the jury could not hesitate in finding against the defendant. Indeed, the carelessness of its employees was so gross as to amount almost to criminal negligence. The evidence as to the plaintiff’s contributory negligence is comparatively slight, but it was sufficient to carry the case to the jury. Both questions were fairly and fully submitted to them in an elaborate charge, of over fourteen printed pages, in which their attention was specially called to the facts and circumstances disclosed by the testimony. Presumptively, the verdict is predicated of their finding that defendant company’s negligence was the cause of injury, and that plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence. This appears to be in full accord with the weight of the testimony.</p>

In that point the court was requested to charge, as matter of law, that certain acts of Mrs. Baker, done by her agent, constituted con-i( tributary negligence, and that there could be no recovery. The learned judge’s answer, embodying his reasons for refusing to affirm said point, is in itself a sufficient vindication of his ruling. Some of the allegations of fact bearing on the question of contributory negligence were neither admitted nor proved, and hence it was necessary for the jury to pass upon them. <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>Inferences of fact had to be drawn from undisputed facts and circumstances considered in connection with such other facts as might be found by the jury. Moreover, the case is not one in which the standard of duty is fixed and determinate. As was said in McCully v. Clarke, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20Pa.%20406" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="40 Pa. 406">40 Pa. 406</a> : “ When a duty is defined, a failure to perform it is of course negligence and may be so declared by the court. But, when the measure of duty is not unvarying, where a higher degree of care is demanded in some circumstances than under others, where both the duty and the extent of performance are to be ascertained as facts, a jury alone can determine what is negligence and whether it has been proved.” The principle, thus clearly stated by Mr. Justice Strong, has been recognized in many cases, among which are Schum v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=107%20Pa.%2012" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="107 Pa. 12">107 Pa. 12</a>; Railroad Co. v.

Baker as to the conversation that occurred between him and Dillon,” the nature and character of which are fully set forth in the specification. The testimony was both relevant and competent, and hence there was no error in admitting it. If the evidence tending to show Dillon’s relation to the company defendant was believed by the jury, he was, pro hac, the representative of the company, acting within the scope of his employment, and hence his principal would be affected by his acts and declarations. To have excluded the testimony of the witness would have been error.</p>

The vice of the point, as presented; is that it puts upon the plaintiff the burden of proving a negative, viz.: “ that Mrs. Baker in no way <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>contributed to her own loss by her own negligence.” Contributory negligence is matter of defence, and the onus probandi is on the defendant, unless the plaintiff’s own evidence sufficiently discloses the fact of contributory negligence. In that event, the plaintiff cannot recover, and of course defendant is relieved from the necessity of proving what has already been established by the plaintiff’s evidence. If, however, the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, without disclosing contributory negligence, the defendant must assume the burden of making out his defence: Canal Co. v. Bentley, <a href="/pa/66/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="66 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="432372" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0030-01">66 Pa. 30</a>, 33.</p>
    <p id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[167,901,1162,93]]]'>There appears to be nothing in the record that would justify a reversal of the judgment, and it is therefore affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b623-6" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[213,1003,358,42]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
