The first dated agreement granted to Ralph D. Lacoe and J. B. Shiffer the coal on a tract of land in Lackawanna county, containing about 78 acres, excepting from its operation the upper vein. The term of the lease was for ten years, and such other and further time as the lessees should continue to pay the royalty. The lessees agreed to pay a yearly minimum rental of $500, semi-annually, on the first days of October and April of each year, for which they were granted the privilege of mining and carrying away five thousand tons of coal, “ miners’ weight,” at ten cents per ton, and agreed to pay the same price per ton for all coal mined. The lease granted the usual mining rights, with the right of constructing all shafts, tunnels, slopes and air-shafts, and the using of all the surface deemed necessary. It was agreed that the lease should be forfeited if at any time an installment of rent should be unpaid for a period of six months.</p>

Knapp lot.” The coal company agreed to pay semi-annually a rent or royalty of ten cents per ton, “ miners’ weight,” and in addition to deliver to Drake, his heirs or assigns, free of cost, fifty tons of lump or prepared coal as he might elect, annually, during each year the lessee mined the coal of the lessor, or upon the forty acres adjoining, or in any way passed over or \ised the land to Drake. By its terms, this lease was made subject to the provisions of the lease between Charles Drake and Lacoe and Shiffer, as to its continuance, the payment of taxes and the inspection of books, as well as in the conduct of the mining operations, in a workmanlike manner. Both leases were afterwards assigned to R. D. Lacoe and J. B. Shiffer, who, with one Gaines, leased the coal in the seventy-eight acres to the Glenwood Coal Company, at an advance in royalty payable to themselves, and under different terms as to forfeiture and other provisions from those contained in the lease with Charles Drake. From 1872 to 1876, the Glenwood Company mined from the upper vein and reported the mining to Lacoe and Shiffer, and Lacoe and Shiffer sent a statement of the number of tons of prepared coal to Charles Drake or his devisees. Charles Drake died in 1873. His devisees, who are the plaintiffs in this suit, Thomas Drake, Ebenezer Drake, George K. Drake, have owned since his death and still own their interests in the land. Lyman K. Drake’s interest was conveyed, and his interest in the accrued royalty assigned, to M. W. Morris and Isaac Everett.</p>

Without any testimony on the subject, we would not hesitate to say that the obvious meaning of the term was, such quantity of coal as was computed at a ton in paying the miner who mined by the ton. It did not mean a net ton of 2000 pounds or a gross ton of 2240 pounds, or the parties would have so said. The defendants made returns to plaintiffs of the number of tons of prepared merchantable coal, which they allege embraced the number of tons the miners were paid for digging; the miners mined and brought out in weight, much more, but after eliminating from the weight on the mine wagon all bone, slate, dust, and material that was not marketable as coal, there was left the number of tons reported to plaintiffs.</p>

Full statements of the coal thus mined were rendered by the defendants Lacoe and Shiffer to Charles Drake in his lifetime, and afterwards to the plaintiffs or some of them. No objection to their accuracy was made until shortly before the bringing of this suit. The objection then made was, while they showed the number of tons of prepared coal, they did not show the number of tons miners’ weight, as called for by the lease.</p>

By somewhat rude methods, about 20 per cent of the mine wagon’s contents was deducted as worthless ; the remainder, as coal, the miner was paid for; then the operator returned as representing this, the number of tons of prepared coal marketed by him. Plaintiffs knew this during all the years the returns were being made, yet received them without objection. The parties themselves, having thus interpreted the contract, it is too late now to question its correctness. It is probable that if this accounting had been called for when the accounts were rendered, a detailed statement of the weight of material brought out of the mine, and just what number of pounds of this material was fixed as the miners’ ton, would have been required of defendants; not necessarily for the purpose of charging them with something that was not marketable as coal, but, at least, that the accuracy of the returns of prepared coal might be tested by a comparison with the weight of the material in the mine wagon.</p>

Some of the receipts for installments of the $500, given after the death of the grantor, specify that the money was paid on the first lease ; one, dated April 9,1875, mentions that the payment was on lease of November 28,1863, and u supplement given to Massachusetts Coal Company.” But with the exception of this one receipt, all those given before February 18,1880, used words which could only have reference to the first lease to Lacoe and Shiffer. On this date, however, a sup<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>plementary agreement was made between four of plaintiffs and Lacoe and Sbiffer, which gave to them the right to transport other coal through this laud as well as a license to deposit culm upon it. In consideration, they agreed to pay to the Drakes $600 in cash and 50 tons of coal annually, the 50 tons to be in lieu of that agreed to be delivered under the lease to the Massachusetts Coal Company. Then follows this clause : “ 5. Except as herein altered, amended and supplied, the said recited original leases and all and singular the provisions thereof, shall be and remain in full force and effect.” This is a distinct positive affirmation of the continued existence of the covenants in each of the first two agreements, except in the immaterial particulars wherein they were altered by the third.</p>

This last agreement is a supplement to the first two, because it grants or supplies rights and privileges omitted in them ; the second lease, while referring to the first for description, is in no sense a supplement, for it supplies nothing to the first and is between different parties. All the receipts which adopt the words, “ supplementary thereto,” or words of like import, except the one of April 9, 1875, are dated after this third agreement, and the fair inference is, refer to it. These facts, on which the master bases his finding, are not “ narrow ground,” as stated by the learned court; they are established or undisputed facts in the conduct of the parties, irreconcilable with any other conclusion than that plaintiffs treated the first and second agreements as fixing on defendants the separate liability for the minimum $500, and also the royalty for the coal mined; and the master was clearly right when he found, as a fact, that the evidence failed to show any agreement by plaintiffs, express or implied, that the $500 minimum in the first lease should be applied in payment of coal mined under the second. This finding is also concurred in by the court, although not for the reasons given by the master. We then have the fact established, that there is due and owing to plaintiffs from somebody, $5,864.75 for coal mined on the land described in the two leases ; the master is of opinion that defendants ought to pay this sum, and suggests a decree accordingly; the court <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>is of a different opinion and dismisses the bill, because: 1. There was no privity in contract between the parties. 2. There was no privity in estate, consequently defendants were not accountable to these plaintiffs for the coal mined from their land.</p>

This company, before taking this lease, had acquired by assignment from Lacoe and Shiffer the first one ; then, on November 16, 1869, they re-assigried both leases to Lacoe, in which re-assignment Shiffer and one O. F. Gaines acquired with him an apparent joint interest, for, on May 25, 1871, they lease the coal at an advanced royalty to the Glen-wood Coal Company, which company mined the coal claimed for. In this agreement Lacoe, Shiffer and Gaines covenant to perform punctually the stipulations with reference to payment of royalties to the Drakes under the first two leases ; they assumed, in this contract, to be the lessees under these first grants, and agreed with the Glenwood Coal Company that they would settle with and pay the Drakes as agreed upon in the first leases for the coal mined. There was no pretence of claim to the coal except under the original leases, and a distinct positive acknowledgment of their liability to Drakes for all coal mined. The Glenwood Coal Company proceeded to mine the coal in the upper vein, and took out nearly 28,000 tons ; thej1' made returns of the coal as it was mined to Lacoe and Shiffer, who made returns to Drakes. They had acquired the leases, after the dissolution of the Massachusetts Coal Company, and thereafter both parties, Drakes and Lacoe and Shiffer, by the most significant acts and declarations kept up through many years, treated each other as if lessors and lessees under the original agreements. However comprehensive may have been the assignment to the Glenwood Coal Company, who mined the coal, Drakes were no party to it, and Lacoe and Shiffer made careful provision in the assignment they should not be. The written papers, the conduct of the parties, all show beyond controversy an intention to treat the Glenwood Coal Company, who, by the agreement of 25th of May, 1871, acquired the right to mine, as the mere ‘agents or under lessees of Lacoe and Shiffer, with no interruption to Lacoe’s and Shiffer’s constructive possession un<a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>der the assignment to them of the original leases. It is a waste of time to discuss the question, whether, technically, the privity of estate between the Drakes and Lacoe and Shiffer was, in law, severed by the contract of 25th May, 1871, with the Glenwood Coal Company ; certainly, the relation between the defendants and plaintiffs, created by the first two leases and the assignment, never, in their understanding of it, ceased to exist; neither of the parties intended it should be interrupted; if defendants liad been answerable, had they themselves mined the coal, their liability, so far as concerns these plaintiffs, under this evidence, was not changed by their assignment to the Glenwood Coal Company.</p>

The defendants made request specifically, for fourteen findings of fact and seventeen of law ; in not one do they ask that plaintiffs shall be turned out of court because the privity of estate between them had ended before the coal was mined. Nor do the exceptions before the court distinctly raise the point on which the bill was dismissed. The 24th, 26th, and 31st exceptions to the master’s report are sustained; they are general exceptions, and manifestly, from their connections, the other findings, and the issues raised, are intended to assert defendants were not bound to account because they had already accounted were not bound to pay for they had already paid. It is not conducive to the ends of justice to use a general exception so as to include a question of blended fact and law not raised before the master; both the learned court below and we have a right to the master’s finding of fact and conclusions of law after full hearing. The court has found, because defendants had made the contract of 25th May, 1871, and were not parties to the second lease with Charles Drake, plaintiffs’ ancestor, therefore there was no privity in estate that would warrant a decree for money which both the master and court have found was owing to plaintiffs.</p>

But an assignment for an increased consideration, with wholly new stipulations, with right of re-entry for conditions broken, with an express assumption of continuing liability of the assignors to the owners under the original lease, and a manifest intention to sublet, not only is not evidence of intention to end the privity of estate, but is a positive re-affirmance of it.</p>

If not raised by demurrer, it should at least have been embodied in the answer. To join issue with plaintiffs on their averments, proceed to long and costly litigation, and then, when the questions forming the subject of contention have been decided against them, to raise an entirely new one in oral argument before the court, for it is not found in the record, such new question should either not have been noticed, or it should have been referred to the master for further hearing and a supplementary report on the law and facts. In effect, the master’s conclusions assume, and correctly too, there was a privity of estate between plaintiffs and defendants, and that is the foundation for the decree suggested by him. He rightly concludes that because of plaintiffs’ long delay in asserting a right to forfeit the lease for nonpayment, equity will not decree a forfeiture: Oil Creek R. R. Co. v. Great Western R. R.

After the evidence was heard, it was found that plaintiffs, by long acquiescence in tbe returns made of the weights, had precluded themselves from demanding any further or other accounting, or from giving any other interpretation to the term “miners’ weight” than that indicated by the returns; so, in fact, it was only determined, after hearing-, that the sum due them could have been recovered at law without an accounting; but this does not oust jurisdiction in equity. As is said in Adams’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/113/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="113 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="457581" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0449-01">113 Pa. 449</a>: “ This question should be detex-rnined, not by what may have been shown by tbe answer and testimony adduced in support thereof, but by what appears on the face of the bill itself.

    <p id="b62-4" data-blocks='[["BL_62.5",62,[257,523,1175,1112]]]'>Here, from the averments in plaintiffs’ bill and the copies, of contracts, it appeared as if a final decree could be had only after the investigation of complicated accounts running through many years. It turned out from the evidence that returns had been made and received without objection during the years for which the accounts were asked, and several years elapsed before any other accounting was asked for. Even if the accounting was not such as stipulated for in the contracts, it was practically impossible then for defendants to make any other; therefore, equity demanded that plaintiffs should be content with what they had so long neglected to object to. The sum of tons in the accounts thus rendered, multiplied by ten cents, would have constituted plaintiffs’ claim for which an action at law would have been an adequate remedy. But the evidence and not the pleadings demonstrated this. Besides, the defendants practically conceded the jurisdiction by failing to demur. After full hearing, involving heavy costs, a doubt as to equitable jurisdiction is not sufficient to oust it. The master so decided, and in so doing he is fully sustained by the authorities. The decree suggested by him accomplishes the substantial justice in the cause; that of the court falls quite short of it, because it is not in accord with the evidence.</p>
