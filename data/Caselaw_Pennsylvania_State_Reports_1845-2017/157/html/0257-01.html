In addition to this testimony, there is other testimony on the part of the commonwealth, and for that matter on the part of some of the witnesses for the defendant, that there are old fences upon this land inclosing the fields. One witness, Mr. Africa, testifies that there are <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>some fifteen or sixteen fields and seventeen fences which he crossed in making the survey.

You will notice, in that connection — and I think it is something bearing upon the case — that the application of Mr. Petrikin for 75 acres referred to in this application, and also referred to in the defendant’s testimony, embraces a little piece of land perhaps northeast of the 201 acres. All the witnesses who testified on the subject testified that the stone house of Mr. Griffith is on that piece of land, which is termed vacant here ; and the defendant says that the stone house, therefore, is on the 75 acres and not on the 201 acres. Mr. Griffith, however, occupied that house as his home and dwelling; he claimed and improved, or purchased the improvement from his predecessors, as early as in the fifties ; and his heirs since his death have occupied part of the same laud. If his dwelling house he on the seventy-five acre piece, as contended by the defendant in his testimony, then I do not see how, by the separation of this land into two parcels, it could be said to the jury that the case does not fall within the principles of the law, because, by a similar application for a tract of land, this application puts the dwelling house on that; and then he applies for the balance of this property as vacant land. 1 do not think it can be separated in that way. We must, in other words, regard that land just as it was at the time Mr. Petrikiu’s surveyor went there; and just as it was when Clark made this affidavit.] [14] . . .</p>

He says that, as there was no dwelling houses upon it occupied by any settler, he was therefore advised that it remained unimproved land. To support that defence he testifies that he had the act of assembly before him and conferred with counsel a short time prior to the making of this affidavit. You must remember that the affidavit was made on the 20th of. June; and I think he testifies that he had the pamphlet laws or act of assembly at that time.

Petriken had made application, was “ unimproved.” This declaration was alleged in the indictment to be false. The act of 1874 was amended by an act passed April 23, 1889, P. L. 46. The amendment was to the third section of the act of 1874, but it contained a proviso in the following words, “provided further that settlement and improvement rights shall only be acquired and recognized as such by an actual entry upon vacant land of the commonwealth, with the manifest intention of making it a place of abode, together with an actual improvement of the land by clearing and tilling the soil for the purpose of gaining support thereby, and also defining the limits of such claim by survey and well marked lines.”</p>

If they do not strictly embrace the clear facts of the ease he cannot be convicted of the crime. We understand it to be conceded that there was no dwelling house, or place of abode, within the lines of the 201 acres for which the application was made. There were clearings, cultivation and fences, but no buildings susceptible of occupancy'as places of abode. Now the act of 1889 provided that settlement and improvement rights could only be acquired by an actual entry upon vacant land “ with the manifest intention of making it a place of abode.” It seems to us that such an intention could only be made “ manifest ” by the erection and occupancy of “a place of abode.” There was no such structure within these lines. This is not a trial of the title to the land and we do not now make, or intend to make, any deliverance on the question whether the improvement right claimed by the prosecutors was sufficient to .include this 201 acres. But for the purposes of this criminal prosecution we <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>are of opinion that the improvement of the 201 aeres, necessary to convict the defendant of perjury in his affidavit, must be an improvement within the requirements of the act of 1889 and must include all the essentials prescribed by that act.</p>
    <p id="b285-5" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[158,583,1159,861]]]'>Much stress is placed upon the fact that the defendant testified that he had seen the act of 1889 in the pamphlet laws of that year when he made the affidavit, and that this could not be true because the pamphlet laws for that jmar were not then issued. It is not of the smallest possible consequence whether he had seen a copy of the pamphlet laws then or not. The act of April 23,1889, was the law of the commonwealth from that date, and if the defendant’s affidavit was true, within the meaning of that law, he could not be convicted of perjury in making that affidavit. Mr. Petriken explained in his testimony that he had a copy of the law before him when lie advised with the defendant respecting the meaning of the law and the making of the affidavit, but not a copy of the pamphlet laws. The affidavit on which the indictment was based merely alleged that the land was “unimproved,” and the act of 1874 only requires that the affidavit of the disinterested witness shall specify whether the land applied for “ be improved or not.”</p>

Counsel for the defendant asserts that there was no such proof in the case. Counsel for the prosecutors say there was evidence that “ the land embraced in the Petriken application was cleared, fenced, used and occupied and held by defined boundaries for at least fifty years.” This is not an allegation that the prosecutors or their predecessors in the title ever defined the limits of their claim “ by survey and well marked lines,” as required by the act of 1889, and after having read the whole of <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>the testimony the writer is unable to find any such proof in the ease.
