That if the defendants, by themselves or their foreman, employed competent and reasonably careful men in their boiler shop, and employed a competent foreman, and placed him in charge of the boiler shop, they had discharged every duty they owed to the plaintiff, resulting from the negligence of such foreman, or from his mistake of judgment in assigning one of the employees to different work than that to which he had been accustomed.’ <em>Answer: </em>This is a correct statement of the law in general; but its application must be limited to cases where the work to which the workman is assigned is of the same general nature as that in which he was formerly employed. But where the work, under the charge of the foreman, consists of various operations, each requiring a special sort of skill and fitness in the workman, and the foreman is intrusted by the master with the duty of hiring and discharging the workmen, as well as assigning them their duties; his act in taking a workman from one sort of work and setting him at another requiring different and special qualifications, would be in effect a new employment, and in so doing he would be regarded as acting for the master; for example, if the foreman of a carpenter shop takes a carpenter from planing boards, and sets him to boring auger holes, he acts merely as foreman and fellow employee with the carpenters. The master is not responsible for any error of judgment or neglect in selecting the right men, but if the superintendent of a railroad, hiring and discharging all the men employed upon it, takes an employee ■ from the gravel train, unskilled in machinery, and puts him to running a locomotive, he acts as vice principal; it is in effect, a new employment.

Whether Hammond was acting as vice principal or as co-employee, depends upon how you find the facts in the case. If the machine was of such a character that it required no special skill or experience to operate it with ordinary safety, and it might be so operated by the ordinary men employed in the boiler shop as Pedlow and the plaintiff were employed, then the point would be correct. But if it did require special education and skill, so that its safe operation constituted a special employment, different from the ordinary work of the boiler shop, then it would not be. In the one case the foreman would act within the ordinary range of his duty as foreman, assigning men of equal grade to their respective stations within the grade. But in the other, he would be acting for the principal — practically discharging a workman from one employment, and re-employing him in another.</p>

If it was so complicated in its construction and operation that it required considerable special skill, that no ordinary man employed in the boiler shop, and having acquaintance with the business of making boilers and its various branches, could, with a small amount of instruction, learn bow to operate it; but it required special education, although, perhaps, not so great as would be necessary to run a locomotive ; then the assignment of the laborer to that machine from some other employment would be such an act that the master would be bound to know that the man so assigned was competent,] [8] but if the machine, though powerful, was simple in construction, easily operated, so that any man who had been around the boiler shop and done the work there, and used other machines, was put in charge of it, and receiving instructions as to how it was operated, what levers to pull and how to pull them, how to arrange the boiler, -etc., could operate it with a reasonable degree of safety, then it would not fall within any special class, and the act in assigning such workmen from some other machine to that machine would be within the ordinary duty of the foreman, <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>and any neglect of his would not be negligence of the employer, and would not be a basis for liability in such a case as the present. . . .</p>

If Pedlow was known to have no previous knowledge or experience in operating the machine, it would be negligence to intrust its operation to him, without seeing that he was first properly instructed and educated, so that he could with due care operate it safely. It is a part of the duty of the master to instruct inexperienced workmen in the use of machines or appliances which he knows they are not acquainted with, and to warn them against dangers in their use, not apparent to the experienced observer, if he required the workmen to operate them; and this not only for the protection of the workmen assigned to the machine, but for the safety of all those employed with them, and who might be injured through their ignorance. His duty is to put the employee in possession of the knowledge required to enable him, with due and ordinary care, and using ordinary intelligence, to operate the machine with reasonable safety. How was this in the present case? Was the machine difficult to operate, and especially dangerous, or was it simple, though powerful, easy to understand, and requiring only slight knowledge and ordinary care ? Were the instructions given by Hammond to Pedlow such as should have enabled him, if he had attended to them and used ordinary care, to have operated the machine with ordinary safety ?] [5]. . . .</p>

If there was no negligence in assigning Pedlow to the operation of the machine, or in instructing him as to its use, the plaintiff claims that there was negligence in continuing him there after notice that he was operating the machine improperly. It is conceded that such notice was given to Hammond, the foreman, by Dyson. Such notice, in my opinion, was notice to the employer.] [7] But, inasmuch as there is no evidence that Pedlow was in general either incompetent or habitually careless, and the notice was that he was not pulling the lever right — not operating this particular machine in a proper manner — it does not follow that it was negligence to retain him in the employment. [If the improper pulling of the lever was due to Pedlow’s ignorance, it became the duty of the defendants or their representative, on knowledge of this, to see that he had the requisite instructions to enable him to correct it. But his general character for carefulness justified Hammond in believing that he would exercise care after a suitable caution, and if he gave such caution, and had reason to believe that Pedlow had attended to his orders, then the defendants would not be responsible, even although Pedlow caused the injury to the plaintiff by a subsequent act of carelessness. But if he knew that, notwithstanding his cautions, Pedlow continued to run it in a dangerous manner, or if he ought to have known it by ordinary attention, then they would be liable if Pedlow was continued in the employment and the plaintiff was injured thereby without his fault.] [8]</p>

Ham<a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>mond testifies, and there is no contradiction of it, that he went to Pedlow and cautioned him and gave him some .further instructions, which' you will remember; he said he observed the machine afterwards, and also passed it occasionally, and Pedlow was operating it all right.

The foreman of the shop in which the plaintiff was engaged in working, having authority to hire and discharge men in that department, from time to time, had such delegated authority over that department as rendered the foreman vice principal, and notice to said foreman was notice to the principal, and if the jury find from the evidence, notice was given to the foreman that Pedlow, in charge of the riveting machine, was running the machine in a careless or unskillful and dangerous manner, and after such notice he was permitted to continue running the machine in the same careless, unskillful manner, whereby the plaintiff was injured, this would be notice to the defendants, and they would be liable to plaintiff in damages for injury thus sustained. <em>Answer: </em>To this point we answer that the foreman of the shop, who had authority to hire and discharge the men employed, there, is to be considered as standing in the place of the employer in respect to that duty, which is one which belongs to the employer. Notice to the foreman that Pedlow was an unskillful and careless workman, whose employment would render the other workmen unsafe while discharging their duties, would be notice to the employer, and a continuance of Pedlow in the employment after such notice would render the principal liable for any injury resulting from the negligence or unskillfulness of Pedlow thereafter. But there is no evidence that Pedlow was either unskillful or careless in <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>respect to bis general character, nor that any such character was known to the employers or their foreman. Under these circumstances, knowledge that Pedlow was acting unskillfully or carelessly in a single instance, or, for example, in operating this particular machine, would not necessarily make it the duty of the employer to discharge him, nor to remove him from the machine. If the manner in which he was operating the machine showed a want of competent knowledge of the proper way to run it, it became the master’s duty, on notice of such want, to give the necessary instructions and so put him in such position that he could, if he pleased, operate it properly. If he was in this instance careless, but was a man of ordinary prudence and care in other matters, the master had a right to expect that a caution or reprimand would cause him to-be careful in this one. If after such caution the master or his foreman had no reason to suppose that the acts of carelessness were repeated he would not be bound to remove him from his place ; nor would he be liable for injuries resulting from his negligence. But he would be bound of course to exercise ordinary supervision over it, and to inform himself, not shut his eyes willfully to what was going on.” [11]</p>

There undoubtedly was evidence, proper for their consideration, tending to prove that the defendants employed Pedlow, a young and inexperienced man, about twenty years of age, to operate the new and powerful machine which had recently been introduced into their establishment, and that the injury sustained by plaintiff resulted from Pedlow’s incompetency and lack of experience in the use of said machine. There was also evidence tending to show that it was dangerous to intrust the operation of such a machine to any one not sufficiently instructed in its proper use, and that neither Pedlow nor the plaintiff had been so instructed.</p>

Mr. Norton, one of these witnesses, said that, in his opinion as an expert, it would not “ be safe to put in a young man to run a machine, who had no experience in this kind of work;” and, in answer to the question, “How long would it take a man accustomed to machinery, as you are, to learn ? ” his reply was, “ It would take a green hand all of a couple of weeks to learn how to run it,” etc. The testimony of Mr. Robinson, the other expert, was to the same effect. Both of these witnesses also gave it as their opinion that it would be dangerous to run a hydraulic machine fast.</p>
    <p id="b344-4" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[272,1039,1174,554]]]'>Mr. Hammond, defendants’ superintendent, being called and examined on their behalf, was asked to state “ what instruction or advice, if any,” he gave to Pedlow and the plaintiff before putting them at work. His reply was: “ I called them together; I asked them if they would take the machine. I wanted them to take the machine by the piece, that is by piece work, after they had got used to it. I says, take it for a week, two weeks, three weeks or four weeks; I says, take it quietly until you get accustomed to the machine; then I said, if you find you can make more money by working by the hundred than by the day you can have it in that way.”</p>
    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.6",344,[270,1600,1171,298]]]'>It was also testified by Mr. Dyson, defendants’ engineer, that, having observed Pediow’s unskillfulness and incompetency, he called the attention of Mr. Hammond, the superintendent, to the fact on the day before plaintiff was injured, and he dismissed the matter by saying, “that would be all right after they (Pedlow and plaintiff) got used to it; something of that kind.”</p>

We have referred to a few of the more salient points therein for the purpose of showing that the evidence was quite sufficient to require submission of the case to the jury. That was fairly done in a clear and comprehensive charge embodying full and adequate instructions in the law applicable to every phase of the testimony. It is not even alleged that there was any error in the admission or rejection of testimony. The several specifications of error are all directed either to excerpts from the learned judge’s charge or to his an <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>swers to points submitted by counsel. We have examined the testimony with special reference to each of the specifications, and are not convinced that the instructions complained of were either erroneous or unwarranted. With scarcely a single exception, the principles of law applicable to the facts of which the verdict is presumptively predicated are too familiar to require either discussion or citation of authorities.</p>
