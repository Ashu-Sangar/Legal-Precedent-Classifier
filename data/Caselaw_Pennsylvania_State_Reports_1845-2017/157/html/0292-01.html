About Sept. 1, <em>1884, </em>he made and acknowledged a deed to his daughter for the property, and there was evidence that the deed was delivered. The daughter paid nothing for the conveyance, but it was the understanding that her father was to have a home with her for the remainder of his life, and this was the reason for the conveyance. Soon after, father and daughter determined to purchase a farm; so the daughter, the father being present and consulting with her, made a written contract with the owner of the farm for its purchase at the price of $3,650. The daughter paid in hand only $25.00. The deed was to be made on April 1,1885. It was understood and agreed between father and daughter that the house conveyed <em>to the </em>daughter should be sold, and the purchase money applied in part payment of the farm. The remainder was to be paid directly by the father. On Nov. 29, 1884, the daughter sold the house for $700, receiving from the purchaser $5.00 hand money, which she gave to her father. Afterwards she surrendered the deed to her father, which had not been recorded. On Jan. 10, 1885, the father and daughter quarreled, and at the request of his daughter he left the house not to return. No reconciliation ever took place between them. On April 1, 1885, the father conveyed the house to the purchaser, taking a mortgage for $650, which was paid to him as the mortgage matured. The daughter having paid no part of the remaining purchase money on the farm, the father on April 3, 1885, paid it and took the deed in his own name. Subsequently, in 1887, he sold the farm and received the purchase money. By his will he cut his daughter off with one dollar and fifty cents. On June 22, 1891, the daughter claimed to recover from his estate $650 purchase money of the house, and $25.00 hand money paid <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>by her on the farm. Held, (1) that as the daughter wholly failed to perform the service which was the consideration for the deed, she was not entitled to recover the purchase money of the house; and (2) that the claim for the hand money was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

It was clearly established before the auditor, by the testimony of competent witnesses, that in the year 1884, William Fink made a deed conveying a house and lot of ground, in the borough of Shiremanstown, to his daughter Catharine Weaver, which deed was subsequently delivered to her. After-wards he concluded that it would be desirable to purchase a property belonging to Mrs. Smyser situated near Williams’ drove in this county, and to have his daughter and her husband remove thereto, and for him to reside with them for the remainder of his life. He proposed that if Mrs. Weaver would sell the Shiremanstown property, which he had conveyed to her, and apply the proceeds to the purchase of the Smyser land, he would furnish the remainder of the money needed to acquire it. Mrs. Weaver consented to this arrangement and accompanied her father to Mrs. Smyser’s, with whom she entered into a written contract for the purchase of the property of said Mrs. Smyser. The price agreed upon was $3,650, and Mrs. Weaver paid $25.00 of this on the signing of the agreement. The deed was to be made to her on April 1st following. After the execution of this contract, Mrs. Weaver on the 29th day of November, 1884, sold the Shiremanstown lot to Christian Myers, for seven hundred dollars. On the written agreement entered into between them Myers paid $5.00. This she handed to her father for the purpose of having it applied to the payment of the consideration money of the Smyser land. She subsequently delivered to him the deed which he had given her for the Shiremanstown property.] [9]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[182,1859,1168,395]]]'>“ A quarrel thereafter took place between Mr. Fink and his daughter and her husband. The former then refused to carry out the agreement made about the purchase of the Smyser property, but had the conveyance of it made to himself in the spring of 1885. On the first day of April of that year, he also conveyed the Shiremanstown property to Christian Myers, and took in part payment therefor a mortgage of the latter for $650.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b317-7" data-blocks='[["BL_317.7",317,[184,2268,1166,145]],["BL_318.1",318,[267,380,1171,300]]]'>“ Two years after this he sold the Smyser land to Jacob llenecker, and on the 12th day of September, 1890, died, after having made his last will and testament, by which he appointed Jacob <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>A.' Smith his executor. It was contended before the auditor on part of Mrs. Weaver that under the testimony ‘ he should have found that the proceeds of the Shiremanstown property were invested in that bought from Mrs. Smyser, and that Win. Fink, the testator, held it in trust for Mrs. Weaver to the extent that the Shiremanstown property sold for.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[262,688,1175,1207]]]'>“ In so far as the testimony taken before the auditor shows, the only money belonging to Mrs. Weaver, which was invested in the Smyser property, was the $25.00 she paid on the agreement. It does not appear that any part of the money derived by Wm. Fink from the sale of the Shiremanstown property was so invested. It is true Mrs. Weaver gave her father the $5.00 paid on the agreement between her and Myers, and that, as the mortgage which Myers gave on April 1,1885, was for but $650, the inference would be that he paid $45.00 in cash at the time. But it was nqt shown who received the $45.00, nor that either this sum nor the $5.00 were invested in the Smyser land. Before the time of the conveyance by Mrs. Smyser to Fink he had repudiated the arrangement made with his daughter in the fall of 1884, and avowed his purpose to take the title to himself. As to these $50.00, the statute of limitations, interposed before the auditor, would bar the claim of Mrs. Weaver in any event. At the death of Mr. Elnk there was due on the mortgage of Myers as appears by the inventory $550 of the principal debt, and accrued interest $16.18. When the difference between this sum and the amount for which the mortgage was originally given was paid or to whom does not appear. No portion was payable before April 1, 1886. It was payable to Mr. Fink and the presumption is that it was received by him. Indeed the contrary does not seem to have been averred before the auditor.</p>

So the will must stand. But, smarting under a supposed wrong, it occurs to the disappointed child there is another way of defeating the intention of the testator to exclude her ; if she can show an indebtedness to her on part of the father, equal to about the share she expected, justice will be done. If the law can be invoked to award her the amount of her claim, that will practically reform the will. The difficulty about such a method of equalization, is satisfactory proof of the indebtedness. The auditor finds there was no such indebtedness, the court that there was. What is the proof?</p>

Very soon after, they thought it desirable to purchase a farm called the Smyser farm in Monroe township ; so the daughter, the father being present and consulting with her, made a written contract with the owner for its purchase at the price of $3,650; the daughter paid in hand only $25.00; the deed was to be made the 1st of April, 1885. It was understood and agreed, between father and daughter, that the Shiremanstown property should now be sold, and the purchase money applied in part payment of the farm; the remainder was to be paid directly by the father. The daughter, on the 29th of November, 1884, did sell the Shiremanstown property to Christian Myers for $700, he paying to her $5.00 of the purchase money, which she handed to her father; afterwards, she surrendered to him the deed which he had before made to her, and which had not been re<a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>corded. The legal title of record being still in the father, he, on the 1st of April, 1885, conveyed it to Myers, the purchaser, taking from him a mortgage to himself for $650, the unpaid purchase money, which was paid to him as the mortgage matured. On the 10th of January previous, however, the father and daughter quarreled, and, at the request of herself and husband, he left the house not to return. Although there were repeated efforts to that end on part of the father and others-of the family, there was no reconciliation, and the estrangement continued until his death, nearly six years afterwards. Because of inability to do so, the daughter paid no part of the remaining purchase money on the Smyser farm, and absolutely refused to have anything further to do with the transaction. So the father, on the 3d of April, 1885, paid the whole of the-unpaid purchase money himself, and took the deed in his own name. Two years afterwards, he sold and conveyed it to Jacob Renecker, and received the purchase money.</p>

Assuming that the evidence shows the delivery of the deed to her, which was hot recorded, and then returned to the father, with the distinct agreement between them that the property was to be conveyed by the father, as if no conveyance had ever been made by him to her, and that the purchase money was to be applied in part payment of the Smyser farm, then this, as between themselves, was a rescission of the contract of conveyance.</p>

The fact that, by the agreement of both, it was thought best to purchase the Smyser farm and make that the home, and the purchase money of the Shiremanstown property was to be put into it, was no essential change in purpose of either, and no payment by her of the consideration for the deed. It imposed upon the father the contribution of a much larger amount of money, but that was all; he had appropriated for the understood purpose a property worth $700; now he consents to appropriate for the same purpose one worth $8,600; but as the first, in view of the purpose, could no longer be of service, it was sold to lessen the amount <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>of money necessary to be raised by him for the purchase of the second. Before the home was established as contemplated by both on the Smyser farm, the unfortunate quarrel took place. It appeared the father had already loaned his daughter’s husband $1,100, for which he had taken no security, and which the husband was unable to pay; the father complained of this; but it is not important to extend the inquiry into the cause of the estrangement; probably neither side was blameless. The established fact remains, that the daughter wholly failed to perform the service which was the consideration of the deed ; she gave the father no home on the Smyser farm or elsewhere.</p>
    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.4",324,[262,943,1170,904]]]'>As this consideration was not a covenant in the instrument, had she stood on her deed and refused to surrender it, what ever might have been the remedy of the father for her refusal to give him a home, the property would have remained hers absolutely; but, voluntarily, she gave back to the father what she was to get, and never gave him what he was to get, a home in his declining years. Where is the room to recognize in equity or at law any indebtedness on part of the father under such circumstances? Thereafter, both were in precisely the situation as before the deed was made to her. And so she must have understood it; for during the nearly six years of his life, after the sale of the property to Myers, she made no claim for any part of the purchase money. The whole of the testimony, taken in connection with her conduct, conclusively shows that the claim for the purchase money of the Shiremanstown property is an afterthought prompted by disappointment in the distribution made by the father’s will. Having wholly failed to sustain her claim, it cannot be allowed.</p>

The court below sustained her claim to this sum on the theory that the money was received by the father to her use, when he conveyed the farm to Renecker in <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>1887, and that the daughter had no right of action until then. But this is a mistake; the appropriation of her money to his use, was when, by a distinct unequivocal act of appropriation, he took to himself the title to the land on which it had been paid; he then had possession practically of her money, because he took the exclusive benefit and enjoyment of the farm. From that date there was an implied contract on his part to repay, and a right in her to demand. As this was more than six years before she presented her claim, her right of action is barred.</p>
