This is not only so by force of the decisions referred to (Porter v. Com. and Com. v.

It is sometimes a little difficult to know just where the city of Philadelphia ought to end and the county of Philadelphia to begin, but in the case before us we think the separation can be easily and correctly made. With regard to the tax on personal property, the state deals primarily with the counties, and not with the individual taxpayers. Other taxes may be collected under different provisions of law; but as to this tax, the counties are debtors to the state, and must pay their duly levied quota, whether they collect it or not: Schuylkill Co. v.

This was, of course, a misapplication of the money, but the commonwealth’s officers did not know the fact, and the commonwealth is not bound to make the correction.] [14] Moreover, this offer seems to ask us to make a fresh misapplication of the money, by taking it from one account in which it ought not to be, and putting it in another account where it is equally out of place.</p>

We assume (as the offers in part require us to assume) that he embezzled the money collected on account of this tax, but it seems to us quite clear that his crime cannot relieve the county. For this particular tax, the county is liable, although it may not collect a dollar from the individual taxpayers, and this liability can only be discharged by payment to the state. As to this tax, the county is not only a collector, but also a debtor. The money which the county collects helps to relieve its own liability, and therefore in a very true sense it was the money of the county, and not the money of the state, which the treasurer embezzled.] [15]</p>

This is strikingly shown by the case of Com. v. Phila., 9 Cent. B. 215, which decided that, although the county had collected money expressly as state tax on personal property, nevertheless it might retain it even as against the state, because the money in question was in excess of the quota assessed against the county by the revenue commissioners. In brief, the state looks to the county and the county looks to the taxpayers ; the consequence being, that the money collected from individual taxpayers goes into the county treasurer’s hands as money of the county in the first instance, and if embezzled there is lost by the county and not by the state.”</p>

The fourth objection was only supported by evidence tending to show, the county treasurer had applied on other indebtedness of his to the commonwealth $185,000 of the school fund of the city of Philadelphia. But, as there was no evidence the commonwealth’s officer knew from whence the money came, and, as to credit it in this suit on the personal tax account would only be a second misappropriation of the school fund, the court refused to allow such credit.</p>

The court, following its decision, which we have, at the present term, affirmed in No. 29, May term, 1893, (No. 303, September term, 1891, of the common pleas,) in a suit between the same parties, overruled the 5th objection and entered the judgment heretofore set out.

The whole amount of tax to be paid into the state treasury for 1891 was $828,909.36; the one third of this is $276,303.12; of this whole amount, the county actually paid into the state treasury $527,241.47, leaving, unpaid, $301,667.89; if this had also been paid in, the county would have been entitled to an immediate return of $276,303.12; and the commonwealth would have retained for her own use $25,364.77.

Many of the circumstances calling for a modification of the judgment in No. 303, September term, 1891, are absent in this case ; the defaulting county treasurer was in office not five months of the year 1891; the neglect of the commonwealth’s officers to enforce quarterly returns and payments could only relate to a single quarter of that year, and whatever loss may have resulted to the county from the preceding year’s laxity cannot be carried forward and imputed to the commonwealth the next year; for eight months after Bardsley was out of office the county had opportunity for investigation and ascertainment of its exact liability. Nevertheless, it chose to contest by appeal payment of the whole balance settled against it, and for that reason ought to pay such interest and commissions as the commonwealth can equitably demand. The act of 1811, however, by express terms confers equitable powers on the auditor general in making the settlement,, and although, by the mere fact of appeal, questions of interest and commissions become new matters of adjudication for the court, they are to be imposed according to “ law and equity ” as if they had been part of the settlement. Then, why, in view of the hardship of this case, should the commonwealth have interest on $301,667.89, when only $25,364.77 was actually hers ? If the whole sum had been paid, it was her duty to at once return to the county all of it except this comparatively small part; she could not legally have used more if it had been paid, therefore she lost no interest by its nonpayment. If the county had paid immediately after the settlement the $25,364.77, would the commonwealth have brought suit against the county for $276,303.12, added interest and commissions for the mere purpose of paying the principal back to the county? If such suit had been brought, would equity have added the additional penalties ? The conclusiveness of the settlement is conceded; the technical right of the commonwealth at law, to collect the exact balance shown by the settlement, cannot be denied, but the equity in imposing a penalty upon the county <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>for not handing over to the commonwealth $276,803.12 to be immediately handed back to the county, it seems to us, does not follow, therefore we modify the judgment thus:</p>
