This is the question upon which your verdict in this case depends. You have heard the witnesses on the stand who testity as to that; they are Laura E. Mitchell, Taylor Mitchell and Louis Mitchell. Laura E. Mitchell testified, as you recollect, that she was present when her father, Joseph Mitchell, and Mr. James S. Brothers were bargaining for this land, sitting upon the porch at the homestead, and as to what was said by Joseph Mitchell to James S. Brothers about the g'raveyard. If you believe this testimony then Mr. Brothers had notice of the deed of May 7,1886. His wife was not present at that time. This was some days prior to the date of the deed from Joseph Mitchell and wife to the plaintiffs. I also call your attention to the testimony of Taylor Mitchell and Louis Mitchell, who testified as to the admissions of James S. Brothers to them in regard to his knowledge of this deed of conveyance. I will not repeat the testimony of either of these witnesses. You will recollect it for yourselves. <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>It has been discussed in your hearing by the learned counsel on the one side and the other, and if this testimony satisfies you that James S. Brothers and his wife had knowledge that Joseph Mitchell and wife had conveyed this graveyard as it now exists to the defendants then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover. But unless you find from the evidence in the case, and you will recollect all the evidence on the one side and the other, that no notice was given to James S. Brothers and wife prior to the time that they purchased this tract of land and accepted the deed of September 22, 1886, then the title to all the lands claimed by the plaintiffs in this action vested in them, notwithstanding a prior deed had been made to these defendants, because if a purchaser of land who does not enter into possession of it fails to record his deed within six months the law says it shall not defeat the right of a subsequent purchaser who takes his title without notice. Here is the point in this case and where it hinges, and accordingly as you find the facts in regard to that your verdict will be. If you find that no notice was given to James S. Brothers and his wife that more land than they admit belongs to the defendants had been conveyed to them as trustees, then your verdict should be for the plaintiffs. But if you find that they did know of this deed of conveyance and knew that the land from the pale fence up to the public road had been conveyed to these defendants as testified to by Laura E. Mitchell and corroborated by the testimony of Taylor Mitchell and Louis Mitchell as to the admissions of James S. Brothers, then your verdict should be for the defendants.”</p>

While the charge of <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>the court indicates that it was not intended to include in the verdict the old graveyard or the strips of land added thereto on three sides thereof, the original as well as the amended preeeipe do not appear to harmonize with that intention, and hence, in executing the judgment in accordance with the verdict upon which it is based, tlie old graveyard, as enlarged, would not be excluded. Referring to the extent of tlie plaintiffs’ claim, the learned judge, in his charge, said: “They, however, do not claim that part of the graveyard that was then fenced. Subsequently to tlie deed of conveyance by Joseph Mitchell and wife to plaintiffs, .... tbis graveyard was enlarged by extension on three sides, and subsequently a pale fence was erected around it. The plaintiffs do not claim to recover even that much of it, but there was one acre and 29.89 perches of land lying between the pale fence and the public road, which was not fenced off, which tlie plaintiffs now seek to recover. That much of it was in no way fenced at the time of the conveyance from Joseph Mitchell and wife to the plaintiffs. They don’t seek to recover either the old ground, as it was originally fenced when Joseph Mitchell owned the laud, nor do they seek to recover that which was added to it afterwards on tlie three sides up to the line as was explained on the draft. Therefore, the land in dispute is that part which lies between the pale fence, as shown to you on the draft which was exhibited to you and given in evidence, and the public road, wbicb contains one acre and 29.89 perches.”</p>

But, however that may be, the record discloses an error that ought to be corrected either by amendment or reversal of tlie judgment. For tlie purpose of securing the former and thus avoiding the latter, the plaintiffs, on the argument, moved for leave to further amend their praecipe and correct the judgment so as to restrict their recovery to said last mentioned lot, and thus exclude the old graveyard and additions thereto. As expressed in the motion made and filed here May 24,1893, their proposed amendment, etc., is as follows: “ The plaintiffs in the court below hereby disclaim any and all lands now inclosed within the <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>present paled fence, being the lands comprising the ancient graveyard and the addition thereto upon three sides, containing fifty and eleven one hundredths perches (50.11) ; and expressly declare that in the matter of the above entitled action in the court below, and the verdict of the jury rendered therein, the plaintiffs (appellees here) only claim to have and recover the lands lying between the Newport road and the graveyard (including the addition upon three sides) inclosed within the present paled fence, containing one acre and twenty-nine and eighty-nine one hundredths (1. A. 29.89 Ps.) perches.” There cannot be any reasonable objection to this'proposed amendment. It is entirely proper even at this stage of the case. It will enable us to affirm the judgment, and at the same time protect the rights of the defendants so far as they are entitled to protection ; but, in the circumstances, we grant it only on terms that the plaintiffs pay all costs that have accrued in the court below, as well as in this court, from the time of their ineffectual attempt to amend in the court below to this date. The record being thus amended, there is no reason why the judgment thus restricted should not be affirmed, with costs to be paid by the respective parties, in accordance with this opinion.</p>
