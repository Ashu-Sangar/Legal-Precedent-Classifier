In connection with that you have heard the evidence as to its being assessed in different wards. So far as our own notes go, and we think we have taken it down correctly, the property was assessed in 1871 in the proper ward, the northeast ward. Subsequently Mr. Buechley lived in different wards, and the property was afterwards assessed, sometimes in the southeast ward and sometimes in the middle ward. Question has been made here as to whether such an assessment was legal, whether it must not be made in the ward and for the ward in which the property is located, and question has been raised as to the legality of the sale, in view of the efforts which Mr. Wells alleges he made in order to pay the taxes and prevent .the sale of the property, whether or not he was misled, and whether the treasurer was to blame for the fact that the land was not redeemed. These and other questions, some of them we confess a little perplexing to our mind just now, we need not discuss, because the case in our judgment turns upon another question, the first question suggested by the points of the defendant.</p>

That the sale upon the mortgage discharged the taxes so far as the property was concerned; and, if so, then the treasurer’s sale two years afterward, in 1882, would convey no title to the county, and the county commissioners’ sale of it afterwards in 1888 would convey no title to A. B. McCool, and that therefore your verdict must be for the defendant.] ” [1]</p>

If the title to the demised premises, which it is conceded the defendant .Wells acquired in 1880, was divdsted by that sale, it follows that the seizure of plaintiff’s goods on the landlord’s warrant was illegal. On the other hand, if said title was not divested by the treasurer’s sale, the relation of landlord and tenant between said defendant Wells and the plaintiff continued to exist, and the former had an undoubted right to distrain for the rent in arrear, and the plaintiff has no case.</p>

After thus acquiring title, Mr. Wells leased part of the property to •the plaintiff company, and the rent was paid by it until the •position now contended for was assumed, viz.: that his title to the demised premises was divested by virtue of the tax sale and his failure to redeem.

    <p id="b33-4" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[181,777,1168,657]]]'>As a specific remedy, in the nature of a proceeding in rem, for the collection of such taxes, the act of 1844 was in force when the mortgage was given, and the mortgagee must be regarded as having accepted the security subject to the provisions of the act. When her executor foreclosed the mortgage and bought the property, he held it subject to the then existing remedy for collection of delinquent taxes. If they had been a lien on the land at the time of sale, they would have been paid out of the proceeds; but, as we have seen, they were not, and the only remedy against the land was that provided by the act of 1844 and its supplements. We find nothing in the act of 1867 to warrant the conclusion that the commonwealth was thereby deprived of the remedy referred to.</p>

It is contended, however, by defendants, that the binding instruction referred to was fully warranted by the undisputed facts of which their third point, above quoted, is predicated; that if, in the circumstances, they were entitled to such binding instructions, the judgment should not be reversed because an insufficient reason, for such proper instruction, was given by the court. This contention is not only meritorious, but we think it is a sufficient answer to the assignments of error. As already observed, the facts, recited in defendant’s third point, were clearly established by testimony that was neither contradicted nor in any manner impeached. <em>There was no </em>conflict of testimony as to the fact that shortly before the sale for taxes Mr. Wells went to the treasurer’s office for the express purpose of paying all overdue taxes on the property and thus preventing a sale, that after explaining his business he requested a statement of such taxes and paid all <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>taxes demanded from him by the treasurer. There cannot be any question as to the fact that his purpose in going to the treasurer’s office was to ascertain from the proper officer what taxes were overdue and to pay the same then and there; nor can it be doubted that he did pay all taxes that were claimed by the officer. The conclusion of law, drawn from the facts recited in the point, is eorrectty stated therein: Dietrick v. Mason, <a href="/pa/57/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="57 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1010396" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0040-01">57 Pa. 40</a>; Breisch v. Coxe, <a href="/pa/81/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="81 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1044168" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0336-01">81 Pa. 336</a>. in the latter case, Mr. Chief Justice Agnew said: “ It must be conceded that the payment of taxes is a duty, and a failure to perform it is the fault of the owner. But payment is one thing, and the steps leading to it are another. For the latter the owner is not responsible. He cannot assess himself or know what is charged against him. He must await the action of the agents of the law. He cannot pay until he is informed what he is to pay. To perform the duty of payment he must apply to the treasurer for the taxes charged against his land. If this officer fail to give him the information on demand, on what just principle shall it be said he has not performed his duty ? It is said, there are the tax books open to inspection, let him search them. But this is neither his business nor his duty. As was said in Dietrick v. Mason, 7 P. F. Smith, 40, the treasurer is the legal custodian of the books and entries of the taxes necessary to show the sum to be tendered. This information it is his duty •to give, and he cannot lay the books before the owner, and compel him to search for himself. The knowledge of the latter ■may be inadequate to find what he needs. If then the owner pays all the taxes stated by the treasurer, he has done his whole duty. He can do no more. ... It is but just, then, that a bona fide attempt to pay all taxes, frustrated bj' the fault of the treasurer, should stand as the equivalent of an actual payment. It is an almost universal rule, which substitutes a tender for performance, when the tender is frustrated by the act "of the party entitled to performance.”</p>

It is by no means certain that an assessment' of seated real estate made outside of the ward in which it is located, and presumably not made by the assessor of the proper ward, will support a sale for taxes under the act.of 1844.</p>
