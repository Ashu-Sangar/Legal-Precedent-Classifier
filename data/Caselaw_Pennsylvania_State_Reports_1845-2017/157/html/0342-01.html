The defendant was at first authorized to make and sell a certain number of packers at a reduced price. This number was exhausted about the time of the difficulties which led to the attempted forfeiture of the license, and the defendant then advanced the price to $40.00, but was unable to sell any, as infringers were openly selling packers at less prices, and the plaintiff itself went into the business of manufacturing and selling packers ; advertised in the newspapers offering them at $25.00, and warning the public that the license to the defendant had been terminated, and that it, as well as others, were infringers. Thereupon the defendant wrote to the plaintiff notifying it that it should consider its public announcement as authority to it to sell packers at $25.00 each, and to account as in cases heretofore, when authorized to sell packers at $25.00. To this notice the plaintiff appears to have made no reply. Upon these facts the master found that the provision of the contract fixing the price had been abrogated by the acts of the parties, and that the account should be taken not at the contract price of $40.00, but at the price at which the defendant actually sold packers. <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>The plaintiff claims that this finding was overruled by the court in sustaining the plaintiff’s third exception, and the master, taking that view of it, has regarded himself as bound, against his own judgment, to adopt the contract price of $40.00, although the defendant did not realize so much from any, and some were ‘Pony’ packers, which sold in the market for $6.00 or $7.00 each. That the adoption by the master of the prices at which defendant sold packers as the basis for the accounting was overruled cannot be doubted, and it is plainly erroneous, unless the account is upon the partnership basis, which it is not. But we do not think the sustaining of the exception necessarily involves affirmation of the last clause which implies, rather than declares, that the contract price should have been adopted. In the absence of any comment or explanation from the court, we feel confident that the learned judge by whom the order was written intended no more than to declare that the standard proposed by the master was erroneous, without more. At the time the exception was sustained the bill was dismissed, which made it a matter of little moment, and it naturally did not receive the same critical attention which he bestowed upon the question upon which he ruled the case finally. We feel at liberty, therefore, excluding from consideration the measure furnished by the sales of the defendant, which could not itself fix prices under the contract, to sustain the learned master’s finding that the acts of the parties had abrogated, for the time at least, the price fixed by the contract, and to determine what the price should be. The real question seems to us to be whether the plaintiff shall not be treated as having acquiesced in the sale of packers by the defendant at the prices which it established in the market by its own wrongful sales of the same articles. If, as we are required to hold, this contract was in force, and the defendant is liable to account to the plaintiff for all packers made and sold by it; and if, as the learned master has found, the plaintiff, in violation of the exclusive license, which was the sole consideration for the defendant’s covenants, entered into destructive competition with its own licensee, and forced it to sell packers at prices much below the contract price, or retire from business, it certainly would be grossly inequitable to require the defendant to pay the contract price. The contract provided for changes <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>in the selling price by writing, but the parties were competent to change it, or any other provision of the agreement, by parol. The defendant notified the plaintiff that it should regard its public advertisements as authority to change the price, and the plaintiff remained silent, while the defendant acted upon that assumption. We think, as the master did, that it must be regarded as consenting. This conclusion is strengthened by the consideration that if the defendant is held liable to pay the contract price, the loss sustained by being forced by the acts of the plaintiff to sell at lower prices would be a legitimate element of damage, to be recouped against the plaintiff, and thus, indirectly, the same result would be attained. We are therefore of opinion that the learned master was in error in supposing himself required by the orders of this court to charge the defendant at the rate of 140.00 for each packer, and that the price charged should be that established in the market at the time when the sales were made by the plaintiff.”</p>

We decided the question of jurisdiction when the case was here before, and see no reason to change our opinion. The amendment to the defendant’s answer was properly allowed, and the determination of all matters involved in the contention, on their merits of law and fact, was what we intended by our former decision and it has now been accomplished. We are entirely satisfied with the reasons given bj7 the learned court below for holding that the defendant should only be charged with a price or royalty of $25.00, instead of $40.00, per packer, after the plaintiff commenced selling at that price. It would be productive of gross injustice to hold otherwise. We are also <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>of opinion that the court did perfectly right in holding that the plaintiff should account for all the packers sold by them after they commenced such sales. The minor questions have been correctly and justly decided, and the question of costs has been disposed of with eminent propriety.</p>
