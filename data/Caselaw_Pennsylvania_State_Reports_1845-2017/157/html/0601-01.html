Perry <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>Dewoody issued a fi. fa. upon one of these latter judgments by virtue of which A. L.

On Feb. 16,1892, A. W. Dewoody presented his petition alleging that he was merely a surety in the Gilfillan judgment, and showing the sale of A. L. Dewoody’s real estate and that the amount of this judgment was then in the hands of the sheriff, and praying for an order directing the plaintiff to receive the amount of the judgment in the hands of the sheriff and to enter upon the record of the judgment satisfaction, and that the execution in this case be set aside. Upon the presentation of this petition this execution was stayed and a rule to show cause was granted. Upon this rule testimony was taken, and, after hearing, the rule was discharged, April 4, 1892. From the decision upon this rule A. W. Dewoody appealed to the Supreme Court on April 18, 1892, and gave bail to make his appeal a supersedeas. Judgment of non pros, was subsequently entered upon that appeal.</p>
