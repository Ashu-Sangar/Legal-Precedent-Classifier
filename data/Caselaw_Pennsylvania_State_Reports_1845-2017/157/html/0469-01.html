    <p class="summary" id="b492-6" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[267,595,1171,963]]]'>“ [In the next place, after they had recovered they issued what is known in law as a writ of habere facias possessionem, and the sheriff made the return to that writ that he had executed it by delivering the possession of the premises to the parties, the plaintiffs there, but the defendants in this case. Now that was a solemn act on their part, and that return of the sheriff must be taken in this proceeding as conclusive, because we cannot, I think, in this proceeding attack it. So that when that writ was served and that return made you are to conclude that the defendants then were in the possession of this property. They certainly were unless that return is false, and as I said before that is a matter w.e cannot inquire into. It was their own solemn act; they caused the writ to be. issued; they had the return made, and if it was false they should have moved to have it set aside. It not having been set aside, but being in evidence here in this case, it must be taken as conclusive of the possession of these parties at the time when that writ was served and executed. However, that would not be conclusive to show that they were in possession when this suit was brought.</p>

What is the evidence as to the actual facts in this case ? The defendants themselves, Doctor Haupt and his brother, swore that they were not in the possession. On the other hand, witnesses were called to show that the defendants do exercise acts of ownership and control over the property in dispute. The plaintiff states that he was ordered out, I believe he used an expression something like driven out, by these parties. Some of the tenants that occupy the plaintiff’s premises were- called and they testify that they were ordered out by one or both of these defendants. Now taking all these facts together — the fact that the defendants did recover; that they did issue a writ of habere facias possessionem, and had the possession of these premises delivered to them, as appears by the return of the sheriff; the fact that when this writ was served and returned they plead to it, and put in what is known <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>as a plea of ‘ not guilty,’ by which they tacitly admit themselves in possession; ask yourselves whether the testimony is sufficient to satisfy you that the possession was in the defendants at the time this suit was brought. If it was not, then this action cannot be maintained, even if in other respects the plaintiff is entitled to recover. If the defendants have rebutted the presumption arising from the papers and the other evidence which was offered here by the plaintiff, to show possession in them, then it would be the end of this case, and you would proceed no further. Applying the principles which we have laid down for you, if you find that the defendants were in the possession, or have done such acts as prevent them from now asserting they were not in the possession, then you will pass to the next question and determine where this line is.] [1] ....</p>

First, the question of possession. If you find, under the instructions the court has given you, that, under the facts in the case, the defendants had that kind of possession that would warrant the maintaining of this action, then you will determine where the line was located between the lot of plaintiff and the estate of Sebastian Haupt.]” [2]</p>
