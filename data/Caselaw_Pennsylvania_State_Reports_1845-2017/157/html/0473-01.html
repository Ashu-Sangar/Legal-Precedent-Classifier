The defendants claim, however, that they gave this note upon the condition that if the land was not as represented to them by Adam H. Martin, who is the legal plaintiff in this issue, that they were not to pay the note; and they further allege that no such tract of land as was conveyed by Adam H. Martin to them can be found in Johnson county, Kentucky, and the title of Martin, which he conveyed to them, was of no value. [Now, gentlemen, this is the question for you to determine: Did Adam H. Martin own a tract of land in Johnson county, Kentucky, such as is described in his deed of conveyance to John L. Kline and George L. Kline, and was it capable of identification and location ? But your verdict will not depend upon this fact alone, as we will subsequently instruct you. You have heard the evidence on this question. John L. Kline testified to going down to Johnson county, Kentucky, and as to what he did to locate this land. You have heard the depositions of George C. Perry, J. K. Dickson, and J. W. Walker, residents of J ohnson county, Kentucky, read in your hearing. On the part of the plaintiff you have heard the testimony of A. H. Martin, and that of J. K. Blattenberger, who testified that John L. Kline told him after he returned from Kentucky that he had seen the land and it was worth $10.00 an acre. You will carefully consider all this testimony on the one side and the <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>other, giving to the testimony of each witness the weight that you think it is entitled to, and you will consider any other evidence there may be in the case touching this question. If you find that the land described in the deed from Martin to Kline did exist in Johnson county, Kentucky, and was capable of being identified and located as represented by Martin and as he agreed it should be, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff. But if you find from this evidence that such was not the ease then your verdict should be for the defendants,] [17] unless you further find that John L. Kline and George L. Kline, or either of them, induced Dr. J. F. Thompson to buy the said note from the said Adam H. Martin.</p>

Kline told him that if he gave the note it would be all right, and further whatever his testimony was- — I am merely giving you the substance of it. You Nave heard the testimony of the witness on this point on the one side and the other. The witnesses, as I recollect them as to this point, are Dr. J. F. Thompson, Adam H. Martin and J. K. Blattenberger on the one side, and John L. Kline on the other side, and other testimony bearing on this point, all of which you will consider, and if you find that Dr. Thompson was induced to buy this note by the Klines, or either of them, then no matter whether there was no such land in existence or not as Martin conveyed to the defendants, the Klines must pay this note and your verdict should be for the plaintiff, unless the said note after it was signed and executed bjr the said defendants was fraudulently altered to the prejudice of the defendants, and that this alteration was done by the said Adam H. Martin or Dr. J. F. Thompson, or some one else by their procurement. [If it was so altered that would render the note void and the plaintiff could not recover. You have heard all the testimony on this point: Martin, Thompson and Blattenberger all testified that the figure 4 was not in said note at the time of the first taking of the testimony on the rule to open the judgment; when that was, I do not recollect, you may be able to fix that date. Jacob L. Markel and E. U. Aumiller say that it was there at that time. There were also other witnesses called in relation to this point and I will call your attention to the record which says that this note was filed, for the purpose of en<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>tering judgment on it, on the 15th day of November, 1889. It was placed in the hands of the prothonotary, who entered it upon the docket and who made the entry upon the docket with the 4 per cent attorney’s commission in it. Now from this evidence you will determine, and from all the evidence in the case, when this alteration was made and by whom it was made. The Klines testify that there was a cross made there when they executed the note and delivered it to Martin — whether that was put in by Martin or by Dr. Thompson, or by some one else by their procurement, for they have not shown that the note was ever in the hands of anybody else until Dr. Thompson sent it to his attorney, Mr. Sponsler, who handed it to the prothonotary and placed it on record. Who made that alteration, if it was made at that time ? ] [18] Both parties admit and both parties testify that the note is not in the condition now that it was when executed by the Klines and delivered to Martin. There is no dispute about that; it is admitted upon all hands that somebody altered this note. Now who did it ? The plaintiff alleges that somebody subsequent to the time that the depositions were taken, for the purpose of making the note void and preventing a recovery on it by Dr. Thompson, made this alteration. They allege that that was the motive for doing it. [Mr. Market testifies that on the day the depositions were taken he saw the 4 there and gives as the reason for his recollection being clear about it, that it was unusual for that per cent to be put in and was accustomed to putting 5 per cent in and he told Mr. Kline of its being there, and he said there was no such thing there. Now we leave it for you to determine who made that alteration. What was the motive for it and who did it?] [18] From all the evidence in the case on the one side and the other you will determine this question. If you find that it was altered by Martin, Thompson, or by any one at their instance, then I instruct you that the plaintiff cannot recover. It is for you to say by whom this was made. There must have been some motive for its being altered. You will recollect that both plaintiff and defendants admit that the note was altered and it is apparent on the face of the note itself. Take into consideration, in determining this question, the character and credibility of the witnesses, and what the motive was in making this alteration. The plaintiff claims <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>that it was done by some one in the interest of the defendant, and not done until after the meeting at Shull’s office, and for the purpose of using that as a defence to the payment of the note. I submit this question to you to find, and if you find that- the note was altered by Adam H. Martin or J. F. Thompson, or by either of them, or any other person at their instance and request, it is such a material alteration as would avoid the note, for the law says, that if any person alters or changes a note, to the prejudice of the maker of the note, that he shall recover no part of it and thus punishes him for the attempted fraud by not permitting him to recover anything on the note thus altered, not even the amount honestly due.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[293,1001,1173,1419]]]'>“ [You will take into consideration, in connection with these questions, the surrounding circumstances as detailed by the witnesses as to whether or not there was a mutual interest on the part of Dr. Thompson, Adam H. Martin and John K. Blattenberger in this case. Mr. Blattenberger took a good deal of interest in the case, and if you believe that the declarations which he made to the jurors, whom he interviewed, that his interest in the case was a pecuniary one, then it would tend to show that the parties perhaps understood the manner in which the note was obtained. That is entirely a question for you, however. You will recollect the testimony of Mr. Barner and the testimony of Mr. Long, and perhaps other witnesses in the case, which tended to bring these parties together. You will take all these facts into consideration in making up your judgment.] [19] The credibility of the witnesses is entirely fox you. You will determine what weight you will give to their testimony. Take into account their appearance upon the witness stand, their manner, their apparent bias or the absence of it, the manifestation of their feelings, whether they were true or not, and in your own way determine where the truth lies, and rencler such a verdict as will do justice between these parties under the instructions we have given you. If you find for the plaintiff you will find in his favor the sum of $900, with interest from November 12, 1888, to this date, which, by a calculation I have made, amounts in the aggregate to $1,117.80. In that calculation I did not include one day’s interest. However, if you determine these questions in favor of the defendants you will render a verdict generally for the defendants.”</p>

Three questions were raised <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>on the rule to open judgment, and were to be determined by the issue. It would be better practice, and tend to a more intelligent determination of the issue in such cases, if the questions to be decided by the jury were incorporated into the order and required to be answered separately by the jury in their verdict. In this case it would have required an addition to the order made, as follows : “ The questions to be decided by the jury are three in number, viz..: Was the note in controversy given for a good and valid consideration? Was the purchase of the note by Thompson induced by the acts or declarations of the makers or either of them ? Was the note altered as alleged in defendant’s affidavit after its execution and without the consent of the makers ? ” If the jury had answered the first and second of these questions in the negative, the plaintiff would have no right to recover, regardless of the answer given to the third question. The court below would in such case have known exactly the conclusions reached by the jury, and upon appeal to this court there would be no uncertainty as to the character or extent of the verdict. The omission so to frame interrogatories is not error, but we respectfully call attention to what we consider the correct practice in these cases, and express our confident hope that the common pleas judges throughout the commonwealth willadopt it. In this case the verdict may have been rendered because of a finding for the defendants on the first and second questions regardless of the third; or it may have resulted from a finding for the defendants on the third question regardless of the first and second ; or again, it may be that the jury found for the defendants upon all of the questions. The evidence was abundant to justify the jury in finding for the defendants on the first question; and while portions of the depositions' taken in the county where the land was alleged to lie may be incompetent, the general purpose of the evidence to show that the lands had no real existence was a proper one. The portions of the evidence that might properly have been excluded were not brought to the attention of the learned judge by specific objections, and as portions of each deposition were competent their admission over a general objection was not error. If the jury found therefore that the note was obtained by false representations and was in fact without consideration as between the makers and payee, there was competent evidence <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>before them from which the conclusion might well have been drawn. The written declaration of Martin as to the consideration of the note and the location and quality of the lands was clearly competent. It was intended by the parties to be an independent contemporaneous statement, explanatory of the transaction, and was not merged or intended to be in the deed which was delivered at the same time.</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.5",505,[169,731,1166,856]]]'>The second question was a much closer one. Whether the purchase of the note by Thompson was induced by the acts or declarations of the makers depended largely on the testimony of the parties. They were before the jury. Their credibility was for the jury. There was evidence which if believed would have justified a verdict either way. It was fairly submitted by the learned judge, and while the charge is not as full in its statement to the jury of the position of Thompson as presented by his own testimony as we would have made it, we are not prepared to say that it is so inadequate as to require the reversal of the judgment. The jury saw and heard the witnesses, and they evidently believed that the purchase was not induced by any act or statement of the makers of the note or either of them. If the learned judge of the court below had been dissatisfied with the finding he would unquestionably have set aside the verdict which, undisturbed, we must regard as a correct determination of the question.</p>
    <p id="b505-6" data-blocks='[["BL_505.6",505,[168,1598,1161,803]],["BL_506.1",506,[267,387,1171,401]]]'>The third question seems to have been hotly contested in the court below, so hotly as to have led to unpleasant consequences affecting the very reputable gentlemen of the bar engaged in the trial. Indeed our attention was called during the argument in this court to the fact that an action for libel is pending for words spoken by counsel acting on behalf of his client during the trial in the court below. This is however not the time nor place for us to speak of the privileges of an advocate or to define its extent, and we advert to the subject only because it was brought to our attention with much earnestness at the argument. We see no error in the admission of the evidence upon this question. Whether the alteration was patent was one of the questions for the jury. For what purpose and by whom it was made, as between the makers and the holder, depended upon the conclusions the jury might draw from the evidence. We conclude, after an examination of the whole case, that <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>whether the verdict rested on a negative answer to the first and second questions regardless of the third, or upon an affirmative answer to the third question regardless of the first and second, there was in either case evidence before the jury-competent in character and sufficient in quantity, if credited by them, to sustain the verdict. This is equally true, if, as it may be, the jury found for the defendants upon all three of the questions involved.</p>
    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[316,795,658,45]]]'>The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>
