The first of these was- the act of May 1, 1868, P. L. 108, to revise, amend and consolidate the several laws taxing corporations, brokers and bankers. This was repealed and supplied by the act of March 21, 1878, which was in turn repealed by the act of April 24,1874. Thereafter no act required the tax on corporation loans to be deducted from the interest and paid over to the state until the act of June 7, 1879, P. L. 112, section 17, which was continued by the supplement of June 1, 1881, P. L. 37, section 2, and this by the further supplement of June 30, 1885, P.

In Com. v. Lehigh Valley Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/129/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="129 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="568042" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0429-01">129 Pa. 429</a>, Justice Clark, delivering the opinion of the court, said on page 449 : ‘ The company was bound to see to it that the treasurer performed his duty in assessing the tax and <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>retaining the amount out of the interest. If he made default in this, his default must be visited upon the company which he represents and for which he acts : Com. v. Delaware Div. Canal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=128%20Pa.%20594" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="128 Pa. 594">128 Pa. 594</a>. The settlement is made against the company, not for taxes of the company, but for taxes which the company, through its treasurer, ought to have collected. If the treasurer has failed or refused to perform what the law plainly required him to do, and has thereby relinquished his right, upon whom the primary obligation would otherwise have rested, the company, whose interest he represented, and whose instructions he is presumed to have pursued, is rightly held for the consequences of such willful default: Com. v. Lehigh Valley Kailroad Co., <a href="/pa/104/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="104 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="452145" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0089-01">104 Pa. 89</a>.’ And in Commonwealth v. Delaware Div. Canal Co., cited above, the same learned Justice said: ‘We are clear in our convictions that if there is any constitutional authority to impose the tax under the 4th section of the act, the settlement by the accounting officer was rightly made against the company. The act constitutes the company or its treasurer, as such, the collector of the tax, and upon failure to discharge the duty imposed by law, the settlement is properly made against the company whose servant he is, as in case of the default of any other officer of the government upon whom a like duty is imposed. The obligation rests upon the company, but as the company can only act through its officer, the default of the officer is esteemed the default of the company, and the penalty is visited upon them. The treasurer is designated in order that there may be no evasion; he has exceptional opportunities to know, and has the power in his own hands to perform the several matters required. This system of collecting the state taxes was first introduced under the 42d section of the act of April 29, 1844, P. L. 501, where it is applied to municipal loans, and by the act of April 80, 1864, P. L. 218, was first extended to the loans of private corporations.’</p>

But the case is made still plainer by section 4 of the act of April 8, 1864, P. L. 218, which is as follows : ‘ That the treasurer of each county and city, the burgess or other chief officer of each incorporated district or borough of this commonwealth, shall make return under oath or affirmation to the auditor general of the amount of scrip, bonds or certificates of indebtedness outstanding by said county, city, district, borough or incorporation as the same existed on the first day of January .... of each succeeding year .... together with the rates óf interest thereon; . . . . that on the receipt of said returns the auditor general shall proceed to settle the accounts of each county, city and borough with the commonwealth, fix the state tax due and unpaid and transmit notice of the amount by mail to the officers making said returns; and that if the amount so found due shall not be paid within sixty dajrs, the attorney general shall sue and collect the same with interest from the date of such settlement; and hereafter it shall be the duty of every treasurer of every county, city, borough and incorporated district in this commonwealth to deduct the said state tax on payment of any interest or dividend on debts due by the city, county, borough or incorporated district, and pay the same over to the state treasurer within thirty days after the said interest or dividend has fallen due.’ See 2d proviso, section 2, act June 1, 1889, P.

The act is somewhat inartificially drawn, and the logical order perhaps is not carefully followed, but we think its intent and meaning is sufficiently plain. The last clause reenacts sec. 42 of the act of 1844'. The first clause requires the treasurer of counties and cities, and the chief officer of boroughs to make returns of the indebtedness outstanding on the preceding first day of January; and the middle clause provides ‘that <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>on the receipt of said returns the auditor general shall proceed to settle the accounts of each county, city and borough with the commonwealth, fix the state tax due and unpaid, and transmit notice of the amount by mail to the officers making said returns.’ Briefly expressed, we think the meaning of the section is this: The treasurer is required, when he pays the interest, to deduct the tax and pay it over to the state treasurer within thirty days after the interest became due, and at the end of the year he is required to make return of the amount of indebtedness outstanding for the previous <em>year; </em>and on receipt of this return, the auditor general is to settle an account against the city giving it credit, of course, for the tax paid over by the treasurer, and, if any remain unpaid, to ‘ fix the tax due and unpaid,’ which the attorney general must sue for if not paid over in sixty days.</p>

L. 13, the compensation which the state is required to pay to county treasurers as commission for the collection of its revenues, belongs to the treasurers, and not to the counties; and it is an end of controversy for us on that point. But this does not conclude the question now before us, unless the mere fact that the state pays the treasurer a commission for the collection of its revenues, including the assessing, deducting and paying over the tax on loans, when interest is paid, makes him alone responsible to the state for the performance of his duties, and releases the county from liability in the premises. That this is not the case is manifest, for the act requiring the treasurer of private corporations to assess, deduct and pay over the tax, allows him <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>a commission for so doing, and yet as we have seen above, the corporation is liable for his failure so to do, and the account for the resulting liability is properly settled against it. The act of May 1, 1868, sec. 11, P. L. 108, allows to treasurers of private corporations 4 the same commission or compensation as is now allowed by law to county treasurers ; ’ and the act of June 30,1885, sec. 4, P. L. 198, provides that the treasurer’s 4 compensation for his services shall be the same that city and borough treasurers receive for such services; ’ and this compensation has always been allowed to treasurers of private corporations for assessing, deducting and paying over the tax. Thus the treasurer of a private corporation and the city or borough treasurer are paid the same compensation *by the state for the same services; if then such payment makes one of them a state officer, or if he must be a state officer to become entitled to such payment, certainly the other must also be such.</p>

This was required by the act of 1834, ten years before the passage of the act of 1844, which directed the state tax to be charged to the county, and besides he is still a county officer, in whose election or appointment the commonwealth has no voice, and he may be removed from office or compelled to give additional security at the instance of the county commissioners.’</p>

He is selected by the city and not by <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>the state; he acts for the city and it is responsible to the state for the proper performance of his duty. We can see no difference in this respect between the position occupied by a city treasurer relative to the city and the treasurer of a private corporation relative to the corporation ; each is equally liable to the state for the proper performance by its treasurer of the duty to assess, deduct and pay over, the tax, and when he has failed to perform this duty, under such circumstances as to create a liability in favor of the state, that liability is incurred by the corporation whose officer he is.</p>

Whichever term is used, the meaning is the same, and, physically, the treasurer neither deducts nor retains, but merely pays out of the treasury of the corporation or municipality, to its creditors, the amount of interest due, less the tax, and the amount of the tax remains in the treasury of the corporation, and does not come physically into the possession of the treasurer. It is simply in his custody as treasurer of the corporation, and it would be a breach of trust on his part towards the corporation to withdraw it in any other manner than by payment to the state.</p>

The government can transact its business only through its agents ; and its fiscal operations are so various, and its agencies so numerous and scattered, that the utmost vigilance would not save the public from the most serious losses, if the doctrine of laches can be applied to its transactions .... It is said that the laws require that settlements should be made at short and stated periods; and that the sureties have a right to look to this as their security. But these provisions of the law are created by the government for its own security and protection, and to regulate the conduct of its own officers. They are merely directory to such officers, and constitute no part of the contract with the surety. The surety may place confidence in the agents of the government, and rely on their fidelity in office ; but he has of this the same means of judgment as the government itself; and the latter does not undertake to guarantee such fidelity.’</p>

J.: ‘ Another ground of argument for the defendants was that the sureties were not liable by reason of the culpable negligence of the directors and their agents, inasmuch as the by-laws of the bank made it the duty of the directors to make frequent examinations of the affairs of the bank, to count the money, inspect the books, and generally to watch over its concerns; and it is contended that it does not appear from an inspection of the minutes of the directors that this was done. . . . The adoption of such a principle would lead to this result, that the negligence and fault of one agent, or set of agents, for a corporation would deprive it of the remedy against another for their fault. . . . The idea that the cashier is excused by the act or negligence of the directors arises from considering the board of directors as the corporation, and then applying a very equita<a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>ble principle that one ought not to recover of a surety damages caused by himself.

The question then comes to this, whether any act or vote of the board of directors in violation of their own duties, and in fraud of the rights and interests of the stockholders of the bank, could amount to a justification of the cashier who was particeps criminis. We are all of opinion that it could not. . . . The very form of these pleas sets up the wrong and connivance of the board as a justification; such wrong and connivance cannot for a moment be admitted as an excuse for the misapplication of the funds of the bank by the cashier. . . . What is the usage and practice as put in the case ? It is a usage to allow customers to overdraw and to have their checks and notes charged up without present funds in the bank. Stripped of all technical disguise, the usage and practice thus attempted to be sanctioned is a usage and practice to misapply the funds of the bank and to connive at the withdrawal of the same without any security in favor of certain privileged persons. Such a usage and practice is surely a manifest departure from the duty both of directors and cashier and cannot receive any countenance in a court of justice.

    <p id="b597-7" data-blocks='[["BL_597.11",597,[145,1498,1167,895]]]'>On August 1,1891, the auditor general of the commonwealth settled against the city and county of Philadelphia for the year 1890 a tax on loans, amounting to 186,513.36, no part of which was paid into the state treasury. The whole amount, however, was received by John Bardsley, city treasurer, from the city within the tax year, and was by him embezzled. About the 20th of May, 1891, on discovery of this and other large defalcations, he resigned, and soon after was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. Being insolvent, recovery of the amount of this particular defalcation is improbable, and it may be considered lost. The material facts in this issue are so perspicuously narrated by the learned president judge who tried the case, that further repetition of them is unnecessary. The principal question before him was : In receiving this loan tax, was Bardsley an officer of the commonwealth or of the city ? If the first, the city was discharged from liability by payment to him ; if the second, nothing relieved it but payment to the state treasurer.</p>
    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[278,378,1167,250]]]'>
      <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>That the question, before the trial, was not free from doubt, the able argument of counsel for appellant abundantly shows. That the county treasurer, however, in his relations to this particular fund, was an officer of the city, the court below, in a very able opinion, has clearly demonstrated.</p>
    <p id="b598-5" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[278,634,1169,1115]]]'>The many acts of assembly passed in the last fifty years, imposing taxes upon' the different subdivisions of the state, and upon all classes of corporations, directing how they should be assessed and collected, and by what officers received and paid into the state treasury, had led to uncertainty as to whose agent the city treasurer was when he received this “loan tax.” In receiving liquor and mercantile licenses, he was undoubtedly the agent of the commonwealth, and the city was in no way answerable for his fidelity. There was but little more doubt that in receiving the personal property tax he was the agent of the county, and its responsibility ended only with payment to the state treasurer. But, as to taxes on loans,' the peculiarity, both of the subject of taxation, and the method of its collection and payment, as well as equivocal language in some of the acts of assembly, made the law susceptible to conflicting inferences as to the real functions of the officer. By a careful examination and comparison of the many acts of assembly on this subject from 1844 down to 1889, in the light of the decisions from time to time made on cases arising under them, the court below rightly determined Bardslejr was the agent of the city as to this tax. The question now, on both reason and authority, may be considered settled.</p>
    <p id="b598-6" data-blocks='[["BL_598.6",598,[280,1756,1168,298]]]'>It was further contended on behalf of the city, that the failure of the treasurer to pay over this tax was occasioned by the neglect of the officers of the commonwealth to enforce payment as it was their duty to do under the law, and that his retention of it after it was in his hands was by their knowledge and permission.</p>
    <p id="b598-7" data-blocks='[["BL_598.7",598,[280,2062,1167,245]]]'>For the whole year during which this money was received and was due and payable to the commonwealth, and for the more than four months afterwards that Bardsley was in office, not a single quarterly return or payment, as the law enjoins, was requested or exacted by the commonwealth’s officers.</p>

Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheaton, 720, first followed by this court in Commonwealth v. Baldwin, <a href="/watts/1/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="1 Watts 54" data-case-ids="1838036" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0054-01">1 Watts, 54</a>, decided as early as 1832, down to Lehigh County v. Bartholomew, <a href="/pa/148/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="148 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="981863" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0082-01">148 Pa. 82</a>, decided in 1892, there has been no break in the decisions that the right of the commonwealth cannot be lost by the neglect or unfaithfulness of her agents. But as we have said in No. 303 September term, 1891, [the preceding case,] a suit between these same parties, this right of the commonwealth is to her tax, not to penalties. The reason given by Justice Story in United States v. Kirkpatrick, however imperative as a declaration of public policy, never did commend itself to the moral sense; it in substance says: The sovereign must not lose in such cases, because it is intolerably inconvenient to the government to be the sufferer; it could not be carried on if it practiced the same rule it enforces on the citizen, so the right of the government shall not be impaired by the neglect or wrong of her agent. While the rule has become so fixed in the law of the commonwealth that nothing less than positive legislative action can disturb it, there is no reason why it should be extended by implication to include, besides the strict right, the tax, also a premium or penalty for a delay occasioned, certainly in part, by the neglect of her officers. This is not a suit by the commonwealth against an individual, who had the money of plaintiff in his possession, and knew the exact amount and that payment was due. It is the case of a municipality which had raised the money and put it into the hands of its own agent to be paid over, an agent, too, recognized by the commonwealth; then, by the neglect of the commonwealth’s officers and the wrong of the agent combined, the money is embezzled and lost. If it were not for the prerogative of the commonwealth, of the sovereign, who is constructively <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>the parent of or trustee for the whole people, the argument from inconvenience, in United States v. Kirkpatrick, could be :as effectively invoked by this subordinate municipality as by the commonwealth. By progress in wealth and population, the magnitude of the city’s public affairs to-day equal those of the commonwealth when that case was decided. The city might aptly reply, that if it is inconvenient to the state, because of the multitude of its agents, to be prejudiced in right by their neglect, it is quite as inconvenient to the city, because of the large number of its agents, to lose money by their dishonesty. But the answer would avail nothing in the mouth of a subject against the unquestioned prerogative of a sovereign to exact the money for the use of the whole people.</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[295,1053,1169,605]]]'>When it comes, however, to adding penalties in shape of increased interest and fees for wrongful detention of the money, which the city had once raised and paid, and there was room for doubt whether in law it had not been paid to the commonwealth when Bardsley received it; and when it was just as important to the commonwealth as to the county to have the question settled as to whose agent the county treasurer is in the collection of the “ tax on loans,” for it affects every county in the commonwealth; and when it further appears that, owing in part to the neglect of the commonwealth’s officers, the money had not reached her treasury, it seems to us there was no such detention of it as warrants the imposition of penalties.</p>
    <p id="b600-6" data-blocks='[["BL_600.6",600,[296,1667,1166,248]]]'>For these reasons, the penalties imposed in the court below are deducted. Instead of interest at 12 per cent it is computed at 6 per cent to October 2, 1893, and attorney general’s fees, $3,825.49, are stricken off, leaving the judgment stand as of this day $85,690.92, and as thus modified it is affirmed.</p>
