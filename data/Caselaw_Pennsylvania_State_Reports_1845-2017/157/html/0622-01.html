This the Pennsylvania Railroad Company had a perfect right to do under their charter; but it was their duty, in so doing, to construct a channel or culvert under and across their tracks sufficient to carry away that water in times of ordinary high water, [and, after constructing, it was their duty to keep it free and unobstructed, so that it would carry off the water in times of ordinary high water; and, failing to do this, they would be liable in damages to any one injured by reason of their failure. You will observe by this brief exposition of the law, which rve have stated to you now, so that you may understandingly consider the testimony, that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company had a right, under their charter, to build a railroad across this channel; that it was their duty when they did this to construct an artificial channel or culvert so that the embankments would not obstruct the natural flow of this water ; that in doing this they were only bound to provide for the or<a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>dinary high water, and not for extraordinary freshets ; and that in maintaining it they were bound only by the same rule, that is, to maintain it in such a condition that its capacity would be sufficient to carry away the water in ordinary high water, and not at times of extraordinary floods or other occasions for which they were not responsible and against which they could not provide by ordinary care and prudence.</p>

And, in considering the question of their negligence or want of care, you will- consider the question as to whether ordinary care would have prevented the accumulation of the débris which it is alleged blocked up the channel. Third, you will consider, was the rainfall on the 19th of June, 1891, when it is alleged this injury occurred, extraordinary? Fourth, should you determine the first and second propositions or either of them in the negative, that is that the culvert was improperly constructed or improperly maintained, and the third in the negative, that the water was ordinary, then it would be your duty to determine from the evidence what damage the plaintiff sustained by reason of the negligence of the defendant.] ” [8] ....</p>
