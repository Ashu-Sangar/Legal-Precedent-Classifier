Upon becoming employed as a teacher in Pennsylvania, Mrs. Jones was advised that she lacked three college courses necessary for certification in this Commonwealth. In May, 1980, she received an emergency teaching certificate which was valid for the next following school year and <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>non-renewable. Mrs. Jones completed two of the three required courses during the summer of 1980, and, due to what she asserts as work pressure and family responsibilities, waited to complete the balance of the coursework during the summer of 1981. However, the last course was not offered locally during the summer of 1981. In late July, Mrs. Jones enrolled in a correspondence course through Louisiana State University, but because of delays in receiving course materials she did not begin the lessons until November 1981. In the meantime, Mrs. Jones applied for a renewed emergency certificate. This renewed emergency certificate was denied by letter dated December 10, 1981, “due to the inadequate rate of progress for completing” the required coursework. Faced with the alternatives of keeping Mrs. Jones employed and suffering a loss in state reimbursement or terminating Mrs. Jones’s employment, the School District terminated her on February 5, 1982 due to her failure to obtain a valid teaching certificate.</p>

      <em>LeGare </em>involved an employee's dismissal for refusal to submit to a physical examination by an employer where the employee had reported off sick and where the employer had no established policy requiring employees on sick leave to submit to an examination by employer’s physician. LeGare’s claim for benefits was denied by the Bureau of Employment Security on grounds her refusal to submit to the physical examination constituted “willful misconduct” under Section 402(e), 43 P.S. § 802(e). All the lower tribunals affirmed, but we reversed. In doing so, we simply ruled that LeGare’s refusal to submit to a physical examination which was not required by the employer’s written sick leave policy would not, under the circumstances, constitute “willful misconduct.” Applicability of Section 3 was not an issue in the case.</p>

      <em>Penn Hills </em>involved a denial of unemployment compensation benefits to school bus drivers who were unemployed due to school closings on account of snow. Commonwealth Court had denied benefits under Section 401(d)(1), 43 P.S. § 801(d)(1), reasoning that the drivers were unavailable for work. In reversing, we thoroughly reviewed the entire Unemployment Compensation Law, 43 P.S. § 751 et seq., for any provision which might operate to deny the bus drivers benefits. This review disclosed no provision'which would operate to deny benefits to school bus drivers who were temporarily unemployed due to school cancellations for “snow days.” Certainly, those drivers were not in any way responsible for their unemployment as they had no control over when snow fell, how much snow fell, or the decision to close the schools due to snowfall.

Moreover, as demonstrated by forty years of case law, Section 3 provides an explicit exclusion of benefits in cases where persons are unemployed through their own fault.

We reject this argument. Most, if not all, persons who have been denied benefits under Section 3 of the Unemployment Compensation Law were discharged because somehow their <em>voluntary </em>actions impugned their ability to do their work. Some were incarcerated and thus unable to report to work, <em>Smith v. Unemployment Comp. Bd.

It is clear that activity which does not rise to the level of “willful misconduct” may nevertheless constitute fault under Section 3.

While we are not insensitive to the demands placed on a wife and mother who also works full-time outside the home; nevertheless, we cannot escape the conclusion that Mrs. Jones’s <em>freely made decision </em>to delay the remaining course work until the following summer contributed directly to her inability to complete the required course work before expiration of her emergency teaching certificate.

Initially, it is important to realize that we are not here concerned with an employer’s authority or ability to discharge an employee for some conduct which the employer deems inimical to that employer’s interests, but rather, whether the discharged employee may be denied unemployment compensation benefits under the Act. <em>Frumento v.

Also, we are not dealing with an interpretation or concept of section 3 “fault” disqualification that has been so consistently defined and applied by the courts as to lead to the conclusion that the legislature has accepted or adopted the courts’ interpretation of section 3 “fault.” To the contrary, the application of section 3 to disqualify a claimant for “fault” has been rather haphazard.</p>

    <p id="b139-4" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[205,419,1140,1110]]]'>For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that eligibility for benefits is to be determined under section 402(e) (“willful misconduct”) where the claimant’s deficient conduct on the job or in direct performance of duties for the employer results in his or her dismissal, and under section 3 (“fault”) where off-job or only indirectly job-related conduct results in dismissal because that conduct has impaired the claimant’s ability to perform his or her duties at work or has reflected adversly upon the claimant’s fitness for employment. I would further hold that, for the latter to constitute “fault,” it must rise to the same level of culpability as is established by section 402(e) and the cases interpreting that section. Thus, disqualifying conduct amounting to “fault” would be an act of wanton or willful disregard of the employer’s interest, a deliberate violation of the employer’s rules, a deliberate disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of an employee, or negligence indicating intentional disregard of the employer’s interest or of the employee’s duties and obligations to the employer. <em>Frumento v.

Appellant made substantial efforts and progress towards completing her course requirements. She finished two courses and attempted to complete her third required course, for which she paid her tuition fee, but was not able to do so in time due to delays in receiving her correspondence course materials and the fact that the local campus of Penn State University did not offer the course in the summer of 1981 when she had planned to take it. Moreover, appellant was under the reasonable impression that her emergency certificate would be reissued if she began the third required course before it expired, and her emergency application for reissuance was, in fact, initially approved by the Superintendent of her <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>employer/school, West Branch.

The Board affirmed, stating that her failure and delay in pursuing the additional course work was “due to the claimant’s belief that she would receive another emergency certificate to teach another year; she had domestic obligations; she was not aware of the possibility of taking a correspondence course and she did not know that Penn State University did not offer the required study course.” Board’s Findings of Fact No. 6. The Commonwealth Court characterized appellant’s failure to obtain proper certification as “shortcomings,” and the majority of this Court describes that failure as a <em>“voluntary </em>action” that was causally connected to her subsequent unemployment. No one has ever viewed appellant’s conduct as a deliberate, willful, or intentional disregard of her employer’s interests or a deliberate, willful or intentional violation of her employer’s rules, policies or expected standards of behavior.</p>

To the contrary, the record discloses that appellant made substantial, good-faith efforts to meet the certification requirements in her employer’s interest (as well as her own) and to fulfill her duties and obligations to her employer. Her failure to complete her course requirements was due not to any willful or intentional disregard for or violation of her employer’s policies, rules or interest but was, rather, due to the obvious difficulty of juggling her four full-time careers as teacher, student, wife and mother, and her inadvertent failure to successfully juggle those careers to the satisfac<a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>tion of the Pennsylvania Department of Education which declined to reissue her emergency certification.</p>
