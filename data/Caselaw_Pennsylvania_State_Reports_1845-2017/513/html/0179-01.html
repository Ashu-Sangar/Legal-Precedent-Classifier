Case law is clear that a tenancy by the entireties cannot be severed by one party’s unilateral action. Appellant contends that since his wife’s death intervened before her allegation of wrongful misappropriation could be judicially determined, at the time of his wife’s death he was seised of a tenancy by the entireties which, by operation of the right of survivorship, became his alone.

In <em>Sheridan </em>one of three joint tenants with the right of survivorship in real estate filed an action to partition the property but died prior to the close of pleadings, whereupon his personal representative was substituted as plaintiff. One of the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, alleging that upon the death of the plaintiff the partition action abated because plaintiffs property had thereupon passed to the surviving defendants by operation of law. The trial court agreed and dismissed the action. This court affirmed, holding that the mere filing of an action in partition, without more, was insufficient to sever the joint tenancy and the partition action accordingly abated upon plaintiffs death.</p>

However, an examination of the reasoning behind <em>Sheridan </em>reveals why the case is not controlling. Unlike a tenancy by the entireties, a joint tenancy can be severed by a unilateral act of one of the parties, so long as the act clearly and unequivocally signifies an intent to sever. <em>See Estate of Eyer, </em><a href="/pa/455/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="455 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="582348" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0369-01">455 Pa. 369</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20203" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="317 A.2d 203">317 A.2d 203</a> (1974) (niece’s secret transfer of funds in a joint-tenancy savings account with aunt to a new account with husband constituted a severance of the account); <em>Estate of Allen, </em><a href="/pa/488/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="488 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="1761084" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0415-01">488 Pa. 415</a>, <a href="/pa/488/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="488 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="1761084" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0415-01">412 A.2d 833</a> (1980) (son’s surreptitious withdrawal of funds from an account held jointly with now deceased father terminated the joint tenancy and created a tenancy in common).

It is the two-part test of an offer, consisting of a misappropriation, and an acceptance, consisting of the filing of an action to partition. In this test we do not focus solely upon the filing of the action to partition but instead upon whether the <em>two </em>elements occurred. If the misappropriation took place, the filing of the action to partition is sufficient to constitute an acceptance of the offer to terminate and is a consummation of the implied agreement. In this instance it is not a question whether the action in partition was an unequivocal act, but rather whether there was in fact a misappropriation which constituted the offer. <em>Sheridan, </em>dealing solely with the question whether the unilateral action of filing a complaint to partition represented sufficient certainty of intent to sever the joint tenancy, does not control the instant case.</p>

We find no such inconsistency. The primary object of a suit for divorce is personal, that is, to change the relation of the parties to each other. In the case of the death of either party that object can no longer be achieved, the marital relation having been terminated by death. The divorce action also terminates since the court can no longer decree a divorce between the parties. <em>See Upperman v.

To forestall any prejudice to the interests of an innocent spouse, therefore, I would hold that once a wrongdoer acts in a manner which is inconsistent with the continuing viability of a tenancy by the entireties, the entireties interest of the parties may be severed at the option of the innocent spouse or his or her heirs regardless of whether the innocent spouse has legally manifested “acceptance” of the other’s “offer.” This position, however, is in no way intended to change existing law which prohibits the accrual of benefits to a wrongdoer or his or her heirs and assigns attendant upon severance of the estate.
