After reviewing Sections 1 and 4 of Act 111, Commonwealth Court properly concluded that, although Act 111 was silent on the subject, silence could not be interpreted as precluding an agency shop from a collective bargaining agreement between a public employer and public employees, particularly where Act 111 is construed in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act (PLRA), Act of June 1,1937, P.L. 1168, <em>as amended, </em>43 P.S. §§ 211.1-211.13. This Court previously determined that Act 111 and the PLRA are to be construed, within certain limits, as a single statute. See, <em>Philadelphia Fire Officers Association v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, </em><a href="/pa/470/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="470 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1723803" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0550-01">470 Pa. 550</a>, <a href="/pa/470/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="470 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1723803" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0550-01">369 A.2d 259</a> (1977). Section 6(l)(c) of the PLRA, 43 P.S. § 211.6(l)(c), provides that:</p>

Commonwealth Court was, therefore, correct in its determination that Act 111 and the PLRA, when read together, do not exclude the issue of an agency shop as a topic for collective bargaining and arbitration, and, therefore, that union membership and payment of fees and assessments by non-union employees are permissible subjects for bargaining and arbitration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>Commonwealth Court decided, however, that the award of an agency shop here was illegal under Section 711 of The Administrative Code of 1929 (Code), Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 177, <em>as </em>amended, 71 P.S. § 251. Section 711(b) of the Code, 71 P.S. § 251(b), details the court-martial procedure to be followed in the event any enlisted member of the State Police is dismissed or refused re-enlistment by the State Police Commissioner before the member has reached mandatory retirement age. Commonwealth Court felt that the arbitration award in the instant case would compel the discharge of a member of the State Police without regard to that procedure. Assuming that a non-union member does not pay the required fees and assessments, dismissal is mandatory. A hearing pursuant to Section 711(b) of the Code would be solely to determine whether the police officer had paid dues and assessments as required by the F.O.P. A finding that payment had not been made would mandate dismissal under the arbitration award. Commonwealth Court thought this contrary to Section 711(b) of the Code which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Court-martial Board shall recommend discharge, demotion, or refusal of re-enlistment to the Commissioner, who then has <em>discretion </em>either to follow or disregard the recommendation.</p>

As already noted, an agency shop is a legitimate subject for collective bargaining, and, hence, arbitration under § 6(l)(c) of the PLRA. Indeed, that section is emphatic to the effect that “nothing ... in any other statute of this Commonwealth” precludes an agency shop agreement. The Statutory Construction Act, 1 P.C.S. § 1921(a), requires that every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give full effect to all its provisions. The Administrative Code must, therefore, be construed, if possible, so as not to conflict with the PLRA and Act 111, and we think that that is readily done.</p>

The Commissioner, in other words, could not ignore or refuse to follow his own rules. Analytically, we see no difference between such rules or regulations, and standards (mandatory or otherwise) adopted as a result of collective bargaining or arbitration duly conducted under statutes authorizing the same (which occurred here). § 711(b) of the Code establishes due process <em>procedures </em>for aggrieved members of the State Police force, but cannot legitimately be read to prohibit the normal process of substantive confinement of administrative discretion through rule-making under § 711(a) of the Code, or through collective bargaining or arbitration properly conducted under other statutes.
