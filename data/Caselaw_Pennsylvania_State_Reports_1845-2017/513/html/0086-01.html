We are not persuaded, however, that such an approach is warranted. (Citation omitted.) For our review of the [relevant] cases leads us to draw three conclusions. First, by its very nature the calculation of an award for lost earnings must be a rough approximation. Because the lost stream [of income] can never be predicted with complete confidence, any lump sum represents only a “rough and ready” effort to put the plaintiff in the position he would have been in had he not been injured. Second, sustained price inflation can make the award substantially less precise. Inflation’s current magnitude and unpredictability create a substantial risk that the damage award will prove to have little relation to the lost wages it purports to replace. Third, the question of lost earnings can arise in many different contexts. In some sectors of the economy, it is far easier to assemble evidence of an individual’s most likely career path than in others.</blockquote>

The United States Supreme Court does not clearly state in <em>Pfeifer </em>and <em>Dickerson </em>who should determine the method to be used to discount damages to present value. Since it is the jury’s task to determine damages and discount them to present value, I believe that the jury should choose the method. Expert testimony on the various methods should be presented to aid the jury, and the judge should instruct the jury on all methods advanced by the parties.</p>
