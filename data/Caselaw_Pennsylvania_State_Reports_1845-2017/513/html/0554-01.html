The Court of Common Pleas had dismissed Appellee’s exceptions to an auditor’s report and confirmed the report, holding that Appellee was not entitled to further distribution from the estate because she had assigned her distributive share to Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[276,641,1139,307]]]'>Appellant Marian Bryan is the mother of Appellee Marian Flynn Gulden. On September 22, 1972, Corvan S. Bryan died intestate, leaving as his heirs his wife and daughter. Letters of administration were issued to the mother on September 29, 1972, and little occurred with respect to distribution of the estate until the spring of 1979.</p>
    <p id="b636-6" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[272,967,1143,732]]]'>At that time, the daughter petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Adams County to direct her mother to file an accounting of the estate. On January 20, 1982, the first and final accounting were filed together with a proposed schedule of final distributions. The daughter filed exceptions to the accounting and an auditor was appointed. The Auditor held an evidentiary hearing, and on April 13, 1983, issued his report, recommending that the remaining assets of the estate be distributed in whole to the mother. Auditor’s Report, R. 5a. The daughter renewed her exceptions which were dismissed by the Orphans’ Court. A final decree of distribution was entered by that court, ordering that the remainder of the estate be distributed as recommended by the Auditor’s report.</p>
    <p id="b636-7" data-blocks='[["BL_636.6",636,[270,1719,1140,628]],["BL_637.1",637,[203,316,1139,473]]]'>On appeal to the Superior Court, Appellee disputed the court’s treatment of three financial transactions. Two involved demand notes executed by the daughter, her husband, and the mother, the proceeds of which were used as a down-payment on a bar by the daughter and her husband. One of these notes was to the First National Bank &amp; Trust Company of Waynesboro for $11,000. The mother, as administratrix of her husband’s estate, consented to having this note secured by certain shares of stock in a water company that were part of the estate. The other note was to the Adams County National Bank for $15,000, and was secured by the funds in the mother’s personal savings <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Eventually, both banks demanded payment of the notes. Payment for the first note was made in the amount of $11,208.12 from proceeds received from the sale of the water stock, and payment on the other note in the amount of $15,028.12 from the mother’s savings. The other transaction questioned in the appeal was the receipt of $2,500 by the daughter from the mother. This transfer was made so that the daughter could purchase new clothes, since hers had apparently been taken during a domestic dispute.</p>
    <p id="b637-4" data-blocks='[["BL_637.4",637,[203,808,1139,844]]]'>When the mother filed the accounting of the estate she listed the payments of both notes and the $2,500 as distributions set off from the distribution which the daughter was entitled to receive from the estate. The Auditor and Orphans’ Court accepted the mother’s characterization of the payments as an assignment to her of the daughter’s share of the estate. The Superior Court, however, found that the only transaction which could be characterized as an advance was the $11,000 note secured by the estate’s water company stock, and that the other transactions were personal claims of the mother which could not properly be set off against the daughter’s share of the estate. Thus, the Superior Court reversed that part of the lower court’s order confirming the set off of the $15,028.12 and $2,500 against the daughter’s share of the estate and remanded the case for further proceedings. <a href="/pa-super/340/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="340 Pa.

    <p id="b638-4" data-blocks='[["BL_638.4",638,[281,639,1143,680]]]'>The Superior Court correctly held that sufficient evidence, i.e., payment of the note from the proceeds of the sale of estate property, supported the conclusion that the transaction involving the $11,000 demand note was an oral assignment. In the other two transactions, however, the Superior Court did not find any such direct link to the estate, as the money in those transactions came from the mother’s personal funds. Disregarding a document relied on by the Orphans’ Court below as being improperly admitted, the Superior Court reasoned that the only evidence available concerning both the $15,000 and $2,500 transactions was the conflicting testimony of the parties, which was not sufficient to meet the mother’s burden of proof.</p>

His recollection of her statements is consistent with the contents of the document. The daughter’s testimony with respect to the document was ambivalent. She first admitted, then denied typing it, and then on <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>rebuttal, denied having seen it before. The Superior Court held that the document was improperly admitted because it was not signed, and because the daughter’s testimony did not show that she typed the letter.

The Auditor clearly observed the demeanor and attitudes of both the mother and the daughter. The Auditor found the mother to be a more credible witness, noting the daughter’s hostile and uncooperative attitude. Auditor’s Report, R. 17a.
