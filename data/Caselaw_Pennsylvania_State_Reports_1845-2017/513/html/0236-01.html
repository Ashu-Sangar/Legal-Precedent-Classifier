In 1983, North American Industries was awarded a lucrative no-bid contract to supply granite for the Project, and, in 1984, North American Industries received further benefit when it received a substantial “commission” when a general construction contract was awarded to a firm which selected as its granite fabricators a consortium assembled by North American Industries.</p>

During the hearing before the Commonwealth Court, however, counsel for the parties agreed and stipulated that appellants would be relieved from complying with that portion of the subpoenas which required them to produce records for accounts, etc. that were in the sole control of their family members; the Select Committee reserved the right to issue direct subpoenas for the records of such persons at a later date.

Nevertheless, appellants claim that the particular resolution which created the instant Select Committee conveyed authority for the Select Committee to investigate only compliance with legislation pertaining to use of foreign steel products in the construction of the Capitol Addition Project, and that the instant investigation is therefore outside the scope of authority of the investigating body. We regard this claim as patently without merit, in view of the express language of the enabling resolution, Resolution 17 of 1985 (Printer’s Number 307), supra., which in clear terms authorized the Select Committee to investigate not only the foreign steel issue but also “other matters relating to compliance with State law in the performance of State construction projects----”</p>

    <p id="b323-4" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[216,485,1139,1589]]]'>The subpoenas were, however, quite specific as to the documents to be produced, and were at least limited in scope to the production of records generated during the time period during which appellants were engaged in work pertaining to the Capitol Addition Project, such being the general period during which the “payoffs” and other improprieties were alleged to have occurred. Further, the subpoenas were to some extent limited with respect to the types of records to be produced, in that only financial records rather than other types of records were to be produced, and not all financial records were requested, as, for example, the subpoenas did not command production of income tax records, etc. It can perhaps be argued, therefore, that the materials subpoenaed have been specified with all the particularity that the nature of the inquiry at this juncture permits. If the subpoenas were more narrow, as, for example, if financial records for only one or two years of the relevant five year period had been requested, or if records of savings accounts but not of checking accounts had been requested, the investigation might allow evidence of wrongdoing to slip past scrutiny, and, thus, fail in its mission of uncovering all of the sought-after data. At the same time, however, requiring the disclosure of financial records covering a five year span of time would no doubt result in revelation of many private matters that do not relate to evidence of wrongdoing. Standards governing a decision as to whether the instant subpoenas are too broad in their coverage must rest upon a balancing of the interests of the legislature versus the interests of individuals in maintaining privacy.</p>

The development of federal case law, under the Fourth Amendment, has not been such as to maintain Mr. Justice Holmes’ strict insistence upon a showing of “materiality” with respect to the particular records sought by an investigatory body. See <em>United States v. Morton Salt Co., </em>supra. Nevertheless, we believe that the views of Mr. Justice Holmes are persuasive insofar as they reflect a need to protect individuals from “fishing expeditions,” and, likewise, to the extent that a requirement as to the “materiality” of subpoenaed records should be imposed. Such protections for privacy interests can, however, be afforded under the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>

We would reject, therefore, such case law as has developed indicating that legislative subpoenas may be issued upon a lesser showing of cause than is applicable in criminal proceedings. Thus, when the legislature undertakes to investigate a matter, and in the course thereof it seeks to obtain records in which one has a reasonable expectation of privacy, a subpoena therefor should not issue except upon a showing of probable cause that the particular records sought contain evidence of civil or criminal wrongdoing.</p>

By issuing subpoenas for five years of records, to wit sixty months coverage of broad categories of financial statements, the Select Committee has engaged in what Mr. Justice Holmes would have referred to, see discussion supra., as a “fishing expedition” designed to “search through all the ... records, relevant or <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>irrelevant, in the hope that something will turn up.” Further, even if it were to be assumed that some portion of the sixty month collection of records would yield information relevant to the Select Committee’s inquiry, the situation is one where, as Mr. Justice Holmes stated, see supra., “We assume for present purposes that even some part of the presumably large mass of papers ... may be so connected with charges ... as to be relevant ..., but that possibility does not warrant a demand for the whole.” Indeed, by way of analogy, it appears that the Select Committee has, in this case, engaged in a “fishing expedition,” and, in the course of that expedition, the Select Committee has attempted to drain the pond where fish might be found rather than to proceed with hooks and lines to the areas of the pond where there is probable cause to believe fish will be located.</p>
