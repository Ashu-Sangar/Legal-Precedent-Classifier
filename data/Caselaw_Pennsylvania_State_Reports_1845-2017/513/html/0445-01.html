The essence of Appellant’s argument is that this case is factually very different from <em>Venetian Blind, </em>and is not within the scope of that decision. We agree with Appellant that <em>Venetian Blind </em>is clearly distin<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>guishable on its facts from the instant case. There, a self-employed businessman purchased a general liability policy on behalf of the company of which he was a partner. The policy provided personal injury and property damage liability coverage for all sums which the insured would be legally obligated to pay as damages and further provided that the insurance carrier had the right and the duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage up to the policy limits. The policy conspicuously displayed and sequentially listed the types of claims and losses which were excluded from the policy’s coverage. When the insured (Venetian) subsequently submitted a claim, the insurer agreed to pay for the damage caused by Venetian’s products, but refused to defend an assumpsit action for work performed by Venetian or to pay for damage caused to Venetian’s products themselves. The insurer based its refusal on an exclusion provision which expressly excluded such losses from coverage under the policy. The insured admitted that, although he had received a copy of the policy, he never read it, because he had relied on the judgment of the insurance agency and that he had indicated to the agency that he wanted full coverage on everything he had.</p>
    <p id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[221,1559,1139,773]]]'>The insurance policy issued, however, was what it purported to be, and what the insured purchased, a general liability policy. The purpose of a general liability policy is to protect an insured from claims made by third parties for injuries to their person or property resulting from the policyholder’s negligence. In such a case, it is patently unreasonable for an insured to contend that he should be paid for <em>his own </em>property damage loss from a liability policy. Neither the negotiations for benefits nor the type of coverage sought would lead an insured to believe that a liability policy would provide insurance coverage on one’s own property. Based on these facts and circumstances, we determined that the insured could not avoid the consequences of the exclusion provision by asserting that he failed to read the policy, or that he did not understand it.</p>

      <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>Appellant argues that where one applies and pays for certain coverage in advance, and the insurance carrier then unilaterally reduces and excludes the coverage desired, then the insurer should still have the responsibility to advise the insured that the coverage desired and paid for has been limited in the final policy. Contrary to the facts in <em>Venetian Blind, </em>Appellant here specifically requested a type of coverage that would have protected him in this instance, but was issued a policy quite different from that which he requested. Also contrary to <em>Venetian Blind, </em>Appellant’s claim is that he <em>never received </em>a copy of the policy and had never been advised of a change in the coverage that he had originally applied for, <em>not </em>that he received it, but failed to read it.</p>
    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[261,1035,1141,1134]]]'>Finally, Appellant asserts that since he applied for a policy without a workers’ compensation exclusion, and had an express understanding with the insurance agent to this effect, he had a right to expect that the actual written contract would not modify the agreement unless he was explicitly advised of such modification. In support of this proposition, Appellant cites our decision in <em>Rempel v. Nationwide Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/471/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="471 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1725172" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0404-01">471 Pa. 404</a>, <a href="/pa/471/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="471 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1725172" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0404-01">370 A.2d 366</a> (1977), wherein the insured purchased mortgage life insurance with — he believed — a $5,000.00 death benefit above the mortgage balance. His understanding resulted from negotiations with the insurer’s agent for precisely that type of insurance. The policy actually delivered <em>did not </em>provide the additional $5,000.00 benefit. The Rempels never read the policy and the change was never discussed until after Mr. Rempel’s death, when benefits were sought under the life insurance contract. The insurer denied the extra benefit and suit was brought on a theory of tortious misrepresentation. The jury found in favor of the insured and we affirmed, stating that “the policyholder has no duty to read the policy unless under the circumstances it is unreasonable not to read it.” <a href="/pa/471/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="471 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1725172" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0404-01">471 Pa. 404</a>, 411, <a href="/pa/471/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="471 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1725172" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0404-01">370 A.2d 366</a>, 369.</p>

While there was conflicting testimony, the jury, as was their province, resolved this credibility issue in favor of Appellant, as evidenced by their general verdict in his favor. However, Appellee contends and indeed the Superior Court held that the trial court, in its charge to the jury, failed to clarify the two discrete issues presented, i.e., whether Appellant received a copy of the policy, and whether Appellee proved that Appellant was made aware of and understood the exclusionary language. Since the question presented for the jury’s consideration merged these issues, Superior Court determined that it could not be discerned whether the jury determined that Appellant never received the policy in question, or whether it held that Appellee failed to sustain its burden of proof.

Courts should be concerned with assuring that the insurance purchasing public’s reasonable expectations are fulfilled. Thus, regardless of the ambiguity, or lack thereof, inherent in a given set of insurance documents (whether they be applications, conditional receipts, riders, policies, or whatever), the public has a right to expect that they will receive something of comparable value in return for the premium paid. Courts should also keep alert to the fact that the expectations of the insured are in large measure created by the insurance industry itself. Through the use of lengthy, complex, and cumbersomely written applications, conditional receipts, riders, and policies, to name just a few, the insurance industry forces the insurance consumer to rely upon the oral representations of the insurance agent. Such representations may or may not accurately reflect the contents of the written document and therefore the insurer is often in a position to reap the benefit of the insured’s lack of understanding of the transaction.

The Appellant did not set forth a separate cause of action in trespass for negligent misrepresentation, but sought only to recover on the insurance policy which had been issued.</p>
    <p id="b540-6" data-blocks='[["BL_540.6",540,[285,1877,1140,471]],["BL_541.1",541,[210,314,1136,147]]]'>Consistent with the contract cause of action stated in this complaint, the only testimony presented in the case in chief was that of the Appellant himself. The Appellant testified at length that he was not told about any exclusions in the policy, that he did not read the insurance policy, and that he never received an insurance policy pertaining to disability. It is noteworthy that the Appellant did not plead in his complaint or testify that he directed the Appellee’s agent to procure disability insurance that would be paid without <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>regard to the existence of workmen’s compensation coverage. The Appellant testified only to the following exchange with the agent:</p>
    <blockquote id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[253,474,1093,140]]]'>Q: And would you tell the jury when you went there how the application was filled out and how it was executed and so forth?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[252,638,1096,459]]]'>A: Mr. LaPorte and I, we had a rapport where I don’t know insurance, and I still don’t, and maybe I’m guilty for taking things just for granted as far as insurance is concerned, I just told him basically what I needed, the mortgage payment the amount that I could cover, and Mr. LaPorte told me I didn’t make enough money to substantiate the whole payment but I could get $450 which was awful close, give or take a few dollars.</blockquote>
    <p id="b541-6" data-blocks='[["BL_541.6",541,[211,1123,693,43]]]'>[R. 13a — 14a]. He further testified:</p>
    <blockquote id="b541-7" data-blocks='[["BL_541.7",541,[254,1178,1093,141]]]'>Q. Mr. Tonkovic, when you bought the insurance, did you desire to buy insurance which would cover you with this kind of exclusion?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b541-8" data-blocks='[["BL_541.8",541,[252,1344,1095,247]]]'>A: I wouldn’t purchase an insurance policy with that type of exclusion. Where else would I get hurt than automobile or work. I just never gave any thought to it. It was never mentioned. I didn’t dream I would be hurt in October.</blockquote>
    <p id="b541-9" data-blocks='[["BL_541.9",541,[211,1618,264,42]]]'>[R. 27a — 28a].</p>
    <p id="b541-10" data-blocks='[["BL_541.10",541,[211,1676,1137,673]],["BL_542.1",542,[289,311,1139,311]]]'>It was not until the Appellee presented the testimony of its agent, Norman LaPorte, that there was any reference to an understanding that the Appellant was applying for insurance which would provide coverage despite eligibility for workmen’s compensation. At no time did the Appellant move to amend or conform the pleadings to include a trespass action for negligent misrepresentation after this reference of the agent’s failure to obtain requested coverage was made. Instead, the Appellant proceeded with his assumpsit claim for wrongful denial of coverage on the insurance policy which had been issued. The majority’s holding depends upon its analysis of a cause of action which was not raised in the Appellant’s complaint or by the theory <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>of the case during the course of trial. Although the majority has raised a legal theory which may be applicable to the factual circumstances of this case, this Court is not at liberty to redraft the Appellant’s complaint or to dispose of the appeal on legal issues which were not presented by the parties.</p>
    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[285,647,1141,629]]]'>The basis of Appellant’s claim was that the exclusionary language of the policy had not been explained to him. The trial court specifically charged the jury that the burden was upon the insurer to establish the insured’s awareness and understanding of the exclusion under the existing law of <em>Hionis v. Northern Mutual Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/230/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="230 Pa. Super. 511" data-case-ids="814741" data-case-paths="/pa-super/230/0511-01">230 Pa.Super. 511</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=327%20A.2d%20363" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="327 A.2d 363">327 A.2d 363</a> (1974). The Appellee took a specific exception to the charge, asserting that the policy was clear and unambiguous as to exclusion. Inasmuch as the <em>Hionis </em>decision was subsequently overruled by this Court, I believe that the Superior Court’s order reversing the judgment and remanding the matter for a new trial should be affirmed.</p>
