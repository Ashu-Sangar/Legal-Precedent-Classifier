As to four of the charges the trial court adjudged Tuladziecki guilty without further penalty, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9753. On the charge of selling Percodan tablets, the court imposed a sentence of $1,000 fine and five years probation. On the Commonwealth’s appeal, Superior Court held that the sentence was outside the sentencing guidelines and unreasonable, reversed the judgment of sentence, and remanded for resentencing. <a href="/citations/?q=346%20Pa.%20Super.%20636" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="346 Pa.

    <p id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[238,427,1140,676]]]'>Examination of the brief the Commonwealth filed with Superior Court clearly reveals its failure to comply with this latter requirement. Nevertheless, Superior Court rejected Tuladziecki’s argument that the Commonwealth was required to set forth in a separate section of its brief reasons why its appeal should be granted. Relying on the language of the Note to Rule 902 that “the question of the appropriateness of the sentence may be briefed and argued in the usual manner,” the court, apparently after reviewing the Commonwealth’s brief and argument on the merits of the question, determined that the appeal had raised a substantial question and decided to “allow the appeal.” <em>See </em>Slip Opinion at 1, n. 1. This was error.</p>
    <p id="b592-6" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[235,1123,1139,615]]]'>It must first be observed that our rules make a careful distinction between “questions relating to the discretionary aspects of the sentence” and “the issue whether the appellate court should exercise its discretion to reach such question.” Pa.R.A.P. 2116. Recognizing this distinction, the language from the Note to Pa.R.A.P. 902, quoted in footnote 1 of the Superior Court’s Memorandum, speaks only to the fact that the appellant is to supply his brief, with argument on the merits of the question, at the same time as he provides his concise statement of the reasons relied upon for allowance of appeal. It does not and cannot obviate the need for such a statement.</p>
    <p id="b592-7" data-blocks='[["BL_592.6",592,[231,1766,1140,573]],["BL_593.1",593,[219,305,1139,414]]]'>The procedure outlined in the Note accompanying Rule 902 was published in the interest of maintaining consistency between practice under this section of the Sentencing Code and typical appellate practice in Superior Court, which does not ordinarily have discretion as to the exercise of its jurisdiction. It is recognized that this procedure compels a defendant to go substantially through the appellate process —i.e., engaging a lawyer, preparing and filing a responsive brief, etc. — before the Commonwealth has met its statutory burden of showing the existence of a “substantial question” that the sentence imposed is inappropriate. It is assumed, <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>however, that in practice, were the Commonwealth required to file a separate petition for allowance of appeal, a defendant would not likely remain uninvolved in the proceedings until after appeal had been allowed. Rather it is anticipated that a defendant would retain trial counsel or another attorney to take appropriate action in opposition to such a petition, <em>compare </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1116, a process not much less involved than that under present practice.</p>
    <p id="b593-4" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[219,741,1140,791]]]'>So long as the Commonwealth is required at some point to demonstrate a “substantial question” in accordance with the statute to invoke Superior Court’s jurisdiction, this procedure is sound. Superior Court may not, however, be permitted to rely on its assessment of the argument on the merits of the issue to justify <em>post hoc </em>a determination that a substantial question exists. If this determination is not made prior to examination of and ruling on the merits of the issue of the appropriateness of the sentence, the Commonwealth has in effect obtained an appeal as of right from the discretionary aspects of a sentence. It is elementary that such an enlargement of the appeal rights of a party cannot be accomplished by rule of court. For this reason it is essential that the rules of procedure governing appeals such as this be followed precisely.</p>
    <p id="b593-5" data-blocks='[["BL_593.5",593,[219,1551,1140,788]]]'>Our insistence on separate presentation of these issues is more than mere formalism; important concerns of substance guide this decision. In addition to preserving the respective rights of both parties according to the jurisdictional scheme provided by the legislature, it furthers the purpose evident in the Sentencing Code as a whole of limiting any challenges to the trial court’s evaluation of the multitude of factors impinging on the sentencing decision to exceptional cases. In this regard we find it significant that Section 9781(b) specifies that allowance of appeal of the discretionary aspects of sentence may be granted “where it appears that there is a substantial question that the sentence imposed is not appropriate <em>under this chapter </em>(Emphasis added). The chapter referred to is, of course, the entire Sentencing Code.</p>

      <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>According to the Code, except where there is a statutorily required minimum period of confinement, e.g., §§ 9712-9715, the trial court is authorized to choose one or more of five options as an appropriate sentence — guilt without penalty, probation, fine, partial confinement, and total confinement, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9721(a). A <em>general </em>principle has been established for the court to follow in choosing from these alternatives, that the sentence “should call for confinement that is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense as it relates to the impact on the life of the victim and the community, and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9721(b). Another <em>general </em>principle is that the court must “consider” sentencing guidelines adopted by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing.</p>
    <p id="b594-5" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[268,1103,1142,775]]]'>Along with these general standards, moreover, the court is given more specific criteria to consider with respect, to each of the alternatives. Thus, total confinement should be imposed if <em>the court is of the opinion </em>that it is necessary because of a risk that the defendant will commit another crime, because institutionalization would provide the most effective correctional treatment, or because anything less would depreciate the seriousness of the crime. Further, the court’s opinion is to be guided by considering “the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character and condition of the defendant.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9725. Even more detailed are the grounds which are to be “accorded weight” <em>in favor of </em>an order of probation, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9722,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and even these criteria are stated as “not controlling the discretion of the court.”</p>

In the present case the Commonwealth not only failed to articulate any such reasons, it did not even attempt to do so. The Appellant properly preserved his challenge to this procedural violation, and for the reasons stated herein the Superior Court’s decision to overlook it must be vacated.</p>
