Stevenson and Valerie Stevenson appeal by allowance a Superior Court order which affirmed the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. Common Pleas granted appellee General Motors Corporation’s motion for a new trial. Appellants claim that the trial judge abused his discretion in granting the motion based upon evidence offered in the second half of a bifurcated trial. Because the jury’s finding of liability is not a verdict upon which final judgment can be entered or from which an appeal will lie, we hold that a trial court may properly examine all of the evidence in ruling on post-trial motions filed after the damage verdict ends the trial. Our consequent examination of the entire record also leads us to hold the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in granting a new trial.

Stevenson, in his own right and as administrator of the Estate of Daniel L. Stevenson, Jr., Deceased, and the Estate of Deleita M. Stevenson, Deceased, Virginia A.

The trial was bifurcated into liability and damage portions at the direction of the court. Appellants, invoking the principles of § 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, argued that a steering defect in the Vega Virginia Stevenson was driving led to the crash which killed two of the Stevenson children and injured the three surviving members of the family. The liability portion of the trial was held from April 15 to April 23, 1982. After a finding of liability, appellee filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on May 5, 1982, and a motion for a new trial on May 26, 1982.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial on damages was held on January 4 to January 26, 1983 with a separate jury returning a verdict of $1,025,000 in favor of the appellants.

      <em>Kaiser v. Meinzer </em>suggests a framework for analyzing the problem posed in the instant case. Both the intent of the trial judge and the ramifications of treating the finding of liability as a “final order” are to be considered. A bifurcation in which the damage phase must proceed after liability is found is not akin to a severance in which one separate cause of action is fully disposed of while others remain independently unresolved. The bifurcation of a single cause of action into liability and damages based on <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>the general principles summarized in § 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts does not constitute a severance, but allows for a pause in the proceeding after a jury finding of liability has been announced. To give that finding the status of a “final order” would result in the piecemeal determination of actions that case law has uniformly condemned.</p>

Appellants contend that such evidence may not be used to grant a new trial as to both liability and damages. Appellants’ argument wrongfully assumes that the jury’s finding of liability in a bifurcated proceeding is unassailable by the trial court following the damage phase. Our holding today, that a finding of liability in a bifurcated proceeding does not take on characteristics of a judgment or final order, allows the trial court to review the totality of the evidence in ruling on post-trial motions.

Appellants’ case-in-chief was comprised solely of the testimony of Virginia Stevenson, Daniel Stevenson and their daughter, Valerie. Appellants offered no expert testimony on the existence of a defect giving rise to the accident. Under such circumstances, appellants’ credibility is essential to the cause of action. Judge Chalfin, in his opinion, painstakingly noted those instances where the appellants’ testimony contradicted their earlier deposition testimony and statements made immediately following the accident. Common Pleas slip op. at 5-7. Additionally, the trial court’s opinion recites those points at which appellee’s physical evidence refutes appellants’ account of the accident.

It was Dr. Sadwin to whom the plaintiffs went for treatment following the accident. It was Dr. Sadwin to whom the plaintiffs would be expected to give the most honest and complete description of the accident. It was Dr. Sadwin who would have the best knowledge of the credibility or reliability of the plaintiffs. However, it was Dr. Sadwin who testified that the plaintiffs had memory problems and were not reliable historians, and, it was this testimony that was not presented to the jury which decided liability. Thus, given Dr. Sadwin’s testimony and the many other examples of inconsistent testimony of the plaintiffs, this Court finds that the testimony of the plaintiffs was not credible and “that in many respects the testimony of the plaintiffs was colored to advance their own interest.” (quoting <em>Gougher v.

As noted earlier plaintiffs’ theory of liability was predicated on <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>§ 402A (1965), and plaintiffs proceeded to establish evidence of a “defective condition” circumstantially through the occurrence of a malfunction. In order to establish sufficient circumstantial evidence of a defective condition there must be an absence of reasonable secondary causes of the accident. Unfortunately for the plaintiffs, the only evidence as to the absence of secondary causes was their own incredible testimony. Thus, a new trial must be granted and the retrial should not be bifurcated.</blockquote>
