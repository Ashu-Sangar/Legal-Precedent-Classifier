On the evening of April 6, 1982, Harrisburg police received a report of a domestic disturbance at 124 Baum Street in which a pistol was involved. Shortly thereafter, Officer Klotzbeecher received a radio transmission alerting him that the man involved in the incident was one Gregory Taylor, that he was armed, and probably proceeding to a residence at 438 Boas Street in Harrisburg. The officer went to that address and knocked at the door, but received no response. He removed himself some distance and took up watch on the house.</p>

Eventually a man, afterwards identified as Mr. Taylor, came out of the house and walked down a nearby alley. Officer Klotzbeecher hailed him. The man turned, answered “yes?”, and approached the officer, removing a pistol from his jacket pocket as he did so. On the officer’s command he dropped the weapon; a .38 semiautomatic pistol which was cocked and contained one chambered round and six more in the magazine. Officer Klotzbeecher placed Mr. Taylor under arrest and charged him with carrying a concealed weapon without a license. At the same time he was also charged with simple assault by menace with a pistol<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> by another officer who had responded to the report of the earlier incident on Baum Street.

Neither is within the jurisdiction of a district justice as limited by the Judicial Code. 42 Pa.C.S. § 1515. On the other hand, both are within the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas. 42 Pa.C.S. § 931. Consecutive prosecutions in the court of common pleas of this combination of charges arising in a single episode would arguably bring the prosecutor squarely within the prohibition of subparagraph (l)(ii). However, the record in this case indi<a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>cates that at the hearing on April 14th the first charge, i.e., assault by physical menace, was reduced by the prosecutor to a charge of harassment, which is a summary offense within the jurisdiction of both the district justice and the court of common pleas. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2709; 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 931(b); 1515(a)(1). Thus, when the defendant appeared before the district justice there existed two offenses, one being a summary and one being a misdemeanor.
