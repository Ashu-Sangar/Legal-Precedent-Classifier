On the reverse side of each of the three notes there was a guaranty clause, by which each subscriber to the clause would undertake to “guarantee the payment” of the note at maturity. Each guaranty clause also included, <em>inter alia, </em>a cognovit provision, empowering Keystone to confess judgment against any or all of the signing guarantors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The guaranty clause on each of the three notes was signed by Mr. McCosby, in his personal capacity, and his wife.

However, in November of that year, while the revival proceedings were still pending, the bank released from its lien of judgment certain realty owned by the McCosbys, to enable the couple to sell it. In return for the release the McCosbys paid the bank Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) from the proceeds of the sale, as partial satisfaction of the judgment debt. The DeRubeises had not been given any advance notice of the bank’s release of the McCosby property. On January 26,1973, a judgment of revival was entered against all the guarantors, the proceedings having been uncontested by any party.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The petition averred, in substance, that the McCosby realty had represented collateral to secure the payment of the promissory notes, that the bank’s release of the property was done without the consent of the petitioners, and that such release impaired the petitioners’ right of recourse against the McCosbys. In connection with these averments, the petition further alleged that the McCosbys, upon the sale of their property following the release of the lien, realized net <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>proceeds sufficient to satisfy the entire underlying debt. Following the filing of an answer by the bank, the Court of Common Pleas denied the DeRubeises’ petition on the ground that it had not been promptly filed. The petitioners appealed that order to the Superior Court, and also applied for a supersedeas. When that application for a stay was rejected, they paid over to Keystone a sum of money sufficient to satisfy the judgments against them for the balance of the debt, and received assignment of the bank’s judgments against the other obligors on the notes. Efforts by the DeRubeises to reduce their losses by means of the assigned judgments were unsuccessful. Later, the Superi- or Court reversed the trial court’s decision regarding the petition for a rule to show cause, and remanded with a direction that the rule should issue. <em>Keystone Bank v.

    <p id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[280,585,1139,1110]]]'>After receiving evidence and hearing argument, the trial court decided that the DeRubeises had not established a legal basis for opening the judgments and, consequently, had no right to a return of funds from the bank. In so deciding, the court concluded that the DeRubeises, as guarantors within the meaning of section 3416 of the UCC, 13 Pa.C.S. § 3416, had incurred an obligation to pay each promissory note according to its tenor if such was not paid at maturity by the maker, Flooring Specialists. From that premise the court further reasoned that the legal force of the DeRubeises’ obligation to Keystone was in no way diminished by the bank’s release of the McCosby property from the lien of judgment. In short, the trial court determined that section 3606(a)(2) of the UCC did not apply to the case. Besides discharging the rule to show cause and dismissing the motion for the return of moneys, the trial court also entered an order dismissing the tort action on the ground that a case had not been made out. When their exceptions were overruled by a court <em>en banc, </em>the DeRubeises appealed to the Superior Court, asserting the discharge claim they had raised below.</p>

To reach that conclusion the Superior Court started with the dictate of section 3416(e) that “[w]hen words of guaranty are used presentment, notice of dishonor and protest are not necessary to charge the user.” 13 Pa.C.S. § 3416(e). With that language in mind, the court next focused on the part of section 3606(a)(1) which states that “failure or delay in effecting <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>any required presentment, protest or notice of dishonor ... does not discharge any party as to whom presentment, protest or notice of dishonor is ... unnecessary.” 13 Pa.C.S. § 3606(a)(1). The Superior Court then opined that since the DeRubeises, as guarantors, were not entitled to presentment, protest or notice of dishonor, Keystone’s release of the McCosby property without the consent of the other co-guarantors did not work a discharge under section 3606(a)(2) of the UCC.</p>
    <p id="b191-4" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[207,805,1137,574]]]'>The Superior Court was of the further view that Keystone never took a security interest in the McCosby real estate, and that the bank’s judgment lien against the property did not make it “collateral” within the meaning of section 3606(a)(2) as to be a subject of impairment. In support of this latter proposition, the court looked to the definition of “collateral” set forth in section 9105(a) of the UCC, 13 Pa.C.S. § 9105(a). That section defines “collateral” as being “property subject to a security interest, including accounts and chattel paper which have been sold.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Therefore, for the Superior Court to conclude in the case at bar that guarantors of a negotiable promissory note, who are treated as sureties by the UCC, could not raise the “impairment of collateral” defense in section 3606 flatly contradicts one of the central purposes of the entire statutory provision. To state, as the Superior Court did in reaching its conclusion, that the appellants “are guarantors and not accommodation parties” only served to compound the error. It is true that the Official Comment to section 3606 does include statements that the defenses are available to “accommodation makers” and “accommodation parties.” However, the purpose of those statements was not to deny the suretyship defenses to guarantors, but to make it clear that “accommodation parties” are to be included in the class of parties who can avail themselves of those defenses, thus rectifying an omission in the predecessor uniform statute on the subject, the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The premise that a certain type of party to an instrument is not entitled to presentment, protest or notice of dishonor is of significance only if such a party sought to escape liability on the ground that the creditor <em>delayed or failed to take those steps: </em>then, by the strict terms of section 3606(a)(1), such a defense would fail.
