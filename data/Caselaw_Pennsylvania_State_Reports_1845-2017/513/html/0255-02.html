      <em>Williams </em>was the culmination of our refinement of the standard governing the area of juvenile confessions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The record in the case at hand reflects that subsequent to appellee’s arrest, he conferred with his brother, sister-in-law and Attorney Garland. All told appellee to remain silent and make no statement to the police concerning the charges filed against him. At the extradition hearing, appellee was again advised to remain silent by his brother, Attorney Garland, plus his court-appointed counsel and the judge presiding at the extradition hearing. Nonetheless, four days later, while being transferred to Philadelphia, appellee chose to give an inculpatory statement. There is no assertion or indication that appellee was not of normal intelligence or that he was under the influence of drugs or <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>alcohol at the time of his statement. Additionally, it had previously been found by the lower court and by Superior Court, on appellee’s first appeal, that he had not been subjected to physical abuse or threats at the time he made the inculpatory statement. Thus, reviewing the “totality of the circumstances”, it is clear that appellee’s inculpatory statement was knowing and intelligent and therefore counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise or preserve an issue concerning appellee’s youth as it relates to the knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights prior to giving his inculpatory statement. Failure to raise a meritless issue is not ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Commonwealth v.
