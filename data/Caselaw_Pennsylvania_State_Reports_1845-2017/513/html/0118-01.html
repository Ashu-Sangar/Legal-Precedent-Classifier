Defense counsel also stated that he would not tell his client of any of the <em>in camera </em>disclosures made by Knowles. The prosecution countered by arguing that, because the disclosure sought by the defense would compromise the safety of the informant, the <em>in camera </em>inquiry should be made by the court, to the exclusion not only of the defendant but also of <em>defense counsel.</em>

    <p id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[258,941,1142,1404]]]'>The hearing court agreed that the inquiry should be conducted <em>in camera; </em>but, before ruling on the prosecution’s motion for the exclusion of defense counsel, the court instructed Detective Knowles to set forth the particulars of his fear for the informant’s safety. Knowles then proceeded to give the following evidence: He testified that the informant, besides having directed the police to Miller for the robbery of the discount store, and besides having given information relative to the four prior arrestees anonymously referred to in the affidavit for the search warrant, had also given the police information which led to Miller’s arrest for a separate, unrelated shooting incident. Knowles further stated that a “tip” from the same informant had led to the arrest of Miller’s brother in yet another case. According to Detective Knowles the informant, on at least five occasions <em>after </em>the arrest of Miller for the robbery of Korman’s, had given the police information leading to other arrests for various criminal offenses. Knowles next testified that all of the arrestees he had referred to lived within three square-blocks of the informant, and that the informant had daily contact with their families. Because of this latter circumstance, Detective Knowles opined that disclosing the names of too many of the arrestees would enable someone to conclude that the informant was some <em>particular </em>neighborhood person who was commonly known to the arrestees — and thereby deduce his identity.</p>

Nevertheless, the court concluded, as defense counsel had argued, that under <em>Commonwealth v. Hall, </em><a href="/pa/451/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="451 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1948559" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0201-01">451 Pa. 201</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=302%20A.2d%20342" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="302 A.2d 342">302 A.2d 342</a> (1973), the defense had the right to know the names of those prior arrestees for the purpose of testing the veracity of the probable cause recitals in the affidavit. Observing that defense counsel had made a commitment not to reveal any names he learned of <em>in camera, </em>the hearing court ruled that Detective Knowles had to make an <em>in camera </em>disclosure to defense counsel of the names in question.</p>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[195,1010,1140,736]]]'>The court further ruled that, should Knowles refuse to make the disclosure to or in the presence of defense counsel, all of the Detective’s testimony relative to the issue of probable cause would be stricken from the record. In view of that ruling, the prosecution offered to provide defense counsel with the names of two of the four arrestees referred to in the affidavit. The defense rejected that offer, and insisted upon being given all four names. When Detective Knowles, in violation of the court’s ruling, still refused to make the disclosure, the court ordered his testimony stricken — and granted the motion to suppress all evidence seized at Miller’s residence pursuant to the search warrant. The Commonwealth took an immediate appeal to the Superior Court from the order of suppression.</p>

Although the Superior Court concluded that defendants have, as a general rule, the right to test by cross-examination the veracity of search warrant recitals of probable cause, the further conclusion was reached that such a right was, in the instant case, outweighed by the danger posed to the informant’s safety. In this regard, the Superior Court <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>held that the <em>in camera </em>inquiry as to the identities of the prior arrestees should have been conducted by the hearing judge beyond the presence of the defendant and his counsel, but with the defense having the right to make an advance submission of questions to the judge. Under that procedure the veracity of the search warrant’s recitals about the informant’s history of reliability would be tested solely by the hearing judge, who would thereafter render to the defense a “general report” of his findings.</p>

The United States Supreme Court ruled that, if the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth was included by the affiant in the warrant, <em>and if </em>the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant’s request. What is particularly significant for our purposes is that the defendant was given the burden of establishing, at least <em>prima facie, </em>a material misrepresentation in the warrant’s affidavit before inquiry would be constitutionally required by the Fourth Amendment.

In this jurisdiction we grant the right of a supression hearing where the affiant is also present and available for extensive cross-examination testing his credibility. Again it must be emphasized that it is the police official, who requested the warrant, whose veracity is the subject of the inquiry. The justification for employing the exclusionary device in the first instance is to deter perjurious police statements. The reliability of the informant’s information must be determined from the facts supplied by the police official. Once the affidavit is sufficient on its face the question of the veracity of the statements contained therein is directed to the truthfulness of the officer. It therefore cannot be convincingly argued that to withhold the identity of the informer would effectively impede defense counsel in testing the credibility of the police officer who is under oath and subject to cross-examination. Although appellant’s counsel here argues that he did not seek the actual disclosure of the identity of the informant, it is clear that the information sought, i.e., the names of the persons anonymously referred to as having been previously arrested based upon information supplied, would reasonably lead to the disclosure of the informant’s identity.</p>

I disagree only to the extent that the “reasonable accommodation” relied upon by Mr. Justice Flaherty can be interpreted as permitting the Commonwealth to negotiate the disclosure of less than all of those convictions which bear on the determination of the reliability of the confidential informant. On the peculiar facts before us, the informant’s reliability should be assessed only by reference to the two convictions attributable to information the informant supplied to the affiant. The other two convictions were not within the personal knowledge of the affiant, but were simply hearsay about the claims of a fellow police officer, included to bolster the affiant’s assertion that the informant was reliable. I would find the statements about the informant’s help in securing these convictions to be extraneous information without any weight in the probable cause determination. It follows that if these third-hand assertion’s of the informant’s reliability can neither enhance nor detract from the probable cause determination, the Commonwealth’s failure to disclose further information about them is of no moment. It would be futile for a defendant to <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>challenge information which should have had no bearing on the determination.</p>

The controlling precept is that a finding of probable cause can be based on second-hand information presented to a magistrate by an affiant <em>if </em>an adequate basis is also presented to establish that the unnamed supplier of the information is worthy of belief. An assertion that this same person has proven reliable on previous occasions can suffice, but unless the specifics of those occasions are subject to investigation and challenge the affiant’s own assessment that his informant is reliable stands as the only evidence on this point. As Mr. Justice Flaherty and our previous cases make clear, it is unacceptable that allegations made to support a determination of probable cause, which is in the first instance <em>ex parte, </em>should forever be placed beyond the realm of testing.</p>
