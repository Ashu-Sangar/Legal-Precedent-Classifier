Giant Eagle joined Stanley Magic Door, Inc., and Jed Door (“Stanley”), which the parties agree are a single entity, as additional defendants. Prior to trial, Charles executed a release to Giant Eagle in exchange for Twenty-two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($22,500.00). On March 27,1981, after trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Charles in the amount of Thirty-one Thousand Dollars ($31,000.00). In accordance with instructions consistent with the provisions of the Comparative Negligence Act, the jury found Giant Eagle sixty percent (60%) negligent and Stanley forty percent (40%) negligent. Thus, had it not settled, Giant Eagle’s proportionate share of the verdict would have been Eighteen Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($18,600.00), Three Thousand Nine Hundred Dollars <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>($3,900.00) less than the consideration paid for the release.

Charles accepted payment but reserved his claim to the remainder of Stanley’s share of the verdict. Stanley subsequently filed a petition to have the judgment marked satisfied, arguing that the verdict had been paid in full. The trial court granted the petition and ordered the judgment marked satisfied. Charles thereupon appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed. <em>Charles v.

Settlement is a valuable tool in our arsenal of dispute resolution and it should not be undermined. The obligation of a tortfeasor as determined by settlement with the plaintiff should not be affected by a subsequent verdict against any of the remaining defendants. The inducements for a defendant to settle are the certainty of the agreed-upon obligation and the avoidance of the vagaries of trial. The finality of the settlement agreement is crucial. Any subsequent trial against the remaining defendants should not disturb the resolution reached between the plaintiff and the settling tortfeasor. It would be an equal disservice to a supportive settlement policy to provide a windfall to a non-settling tortfeasor where the settlement proves to be more generous than the subsequent verdict.

In addition to the erosion such a position would have upon a policy encouraging settlements, it is also bottomed on a fundamentally flawed premise. It assumes that the jury verdict more accurately measures the tortfeasor’s obligation than that which is agreed upon between the parties by way of settlement. Such an assumption is without foundation either in reason or experience. There is no basis for concluding the jury verdict must serve as a cap on the total recovery that a plaintiff may receive. The responsibility of the settling tortfeasor should be finally resolved by the terms of the settlement.</p>

Surely where liability is contested, the verdict may not reflect the exact worth of the injuries.

This door is an electronically operated door commonly found in supermarkets, and is activated by stepping on a floor mat adjacent to the door. Appellant stepped onto the mat, which was covered with snow, ice and slush, but the door failed to open.</p>

Stanley then entered judgment on the verdict and claimed that since Appellant received $22,500.00 from Giant Eagle by the terms of the release, Stanley was only required to pay to Appellant $8,500.00 (the difference between the verdict of $31,000.00 and the $22,500.00 settlement received), notwithstanding Stanley’s liability of $12,400.00 (40% of $31,000.00). The trial court agreed with Stanley, and by its order of March 2, 1982, directed the Prothonotary to mark the judgment against Stanley satisfied upon its payment of $8,500.00. Appellant took an appeal to Superior Court, arguing that the Comparative Negligence Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> has modified the law with respect to contributions among tortfeasors under the UCA-TA so that he is entitled to 40% of the verdict from Stanley regardless of the settlement made with Giant Eagle. The Honorable John Brosky, writing for the Superior Court panel, affirmed the trial court, relying on this Court's prior decision in <em>Daugherty v. Hershberger, </em><a href="/pa/386/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="386 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1268297" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0367-01">386 Pa. 367</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20730" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="126 A.2d 730">126 A.2d 730</a> (1956), and the companion Superior Court Case of <em>Mong v.

In <em>Daugherty, </em>we interpreted Section 4 of the UCATA to require that a verdict winner’s claim against all <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>tortfeasors must be reduced by the amount of the consideration paid for the release by a settling tortfeasor. In <em>Mong, </em>Superior Court permitted the overpaying settling tortfeasor to seek contribution from the non-settling tortfeasor to the extent that the amount paid by the settling tortfeasor exceeded its percentage of negligence.</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[207,629,1138,257]]]'>Under this analysis, since Giant Eagle’s liability as determined by the jury was only for $18,600.00, it overpaid its share of liability by $3,900.00 and, therefore, had a right of contribution from Stanley for that amount to the exclusion of Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b565-5" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[204,902,1142,840]]]'>Appellant sought review of Superior Court’s opinion with this Court, and renews his arguments that the Comparative Negligence Act has modified the effect of tortfeasor releases executed pursuant to the UCATA so that he is entitled to keep all of the consideration paid by Giant Eagle in its release, and also is entitled to recover the $12,400.00 from Stanley as its judicially determined percentage of liability to him. Allocatur was granted because of the importance of addressing these issues and re-examining our decision in <em>Daugherty </em>and Superior Court’s <em>Mong </em>decision in light of the Comparative Negligence Act. Like the majority, I conclude that the comparative negligence statute has modified UCATA so as to alter the effect of a release as to a non-settling tortfeasor and agree that we must reverse Superior Court and in the process bury <em>Daugherty </em>and <em>Mong </em>forever.</p>

First, there was the assumption <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>by our courts that where parties were mutually at fault, no apportionment of the damages could be made.

The law gave the injured person the right to obtain but one satisfaction for the damages done to him and, when that compensation was received from any of the wrongdoers, his right to any further remedy was at an end. <em>Thompson v.

In the plaintiff’s action against the city, the city claimed that the operator of the van was solely liable for the injuries, and that the operator’s negligence should be imputed to the plaintiff in order to defeat her claim. The city also joined the operator as a third-party defendant. During trial, the plaintiff gave the operator a covenant not to sue in exchange for a payment of $35,000. The jury found that the city was 51% negligent and the operator, 49%. Under Colorado law, the jury also imputed the operator’s negligence to the plaintiff as the owner of the van.

A tortfeasor who has paid more than his pro rata share of the common liability is entitled to contribution. The amount of contribution is calculated by reference to the percentage of negligence attributable to that tortfeasor. For purposes of contribution only, negligence was apportioned previously among tortfeasors in equal shares — i.e. 50% if two, 33Vs% if three, etc. A plaintiff’s right to recovery has never been limited by such an apportionment of negligence among tortfeasors.</p>

Nor is it necessary to speculate as to the effect of the comparative negligence statute on a defendant’s right to contribution.

Under the comparative negligence statute, contribution is based upon the comparative fault of the tortfeasors.
