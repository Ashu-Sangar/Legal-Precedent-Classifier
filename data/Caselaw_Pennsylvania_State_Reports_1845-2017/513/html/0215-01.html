Mr. Justice Pomeroy dissented and was joined by Mr. Justice Eagen, who both felt that the Liquor Code regulations and tax schemes were not so comprehensive as to prevent local municipalities from taxing the liquor industry. Justices Cohen and Jones did not participate in the consideration or disposition of the case. Three members of the Court (O’Brien, Pomeroy and Eagen, JJ.) did agree that the Liquor Code, by itself, was not a sufficiently comprehensive regulatory statute to prevent local taxation on the liquor industry. Three other members of that Court (O’Brien, Bell, Roberts, JJ.), however, agreed that the result reached in striking down the local tax was correct, albeit for unrevealed reasons.</p>

So viewed, the express legislative regulatory scheme for the banking industry emanates from <em>a primary concern for the financial soundness of banking institutions, </em>in order to afford the greatest possible safety to depositors, creditors and shareholders, and maintain public confidence in the institutions. Department of Banking Code, Act of May 15, 1933, P.L. 565, § 1 <em>et seq., as amended, </em>§ 202, 71 P.S. § 733-202.

Local taxation necessarily and unavoidably impinges upon and jeopardizes the subject of the regulation in the specific area of concern, the financial soundness of banking institutions, thus giving rise to the holding of this Court that the local taxation of banks created a “direct burden” upon the banking industry in contravention of the manifest legislative intent to maintain the soundness of banks. <em><a href="/pa/488/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="488 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="1761026" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0544-01">Id.</a></em>

Section 437(f) of the Liquor Code provides that the combined number of distributor’s and importing distributor’s licenses shall not exceed a ratio of one license for each fifteen thousand inhabitants of the county in which the licenses are issued, 47 P.S. § 4 — 437(f). Legislative concern for the regulatory impact upon the locality is evidenced also by the establishment of local option, the means by which a municipality may, by a majority vote of its electors, determine that no licenses for the distribution or retail sale of liquor, alcohol or malt and brewed beverages shall be granted by the Liquor Control Board, 47 P.S. § 4-472.</p>

Wilsbach argues that because sales of beverage to unincorporated organizations of armed forces personnel are exempt from the Malt Beverage Tax and because Wilsbach is thus "reimbursed" by the <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>manufacturer for Malt Beverage Tax paid on beverage subsequently sold by Wilsbach to such associations, the true “incidence” of the tax is upon Wilsbach, the importing distributor, not upon the manufacturer.</p>
      <p id="b314-9" data-blocks='[["BL_314.3",314,[296,1874,1105,462]]]'>However, it is not relevant that the Malt Beverage Tax is, in effect, "included” in the price paid by Wilsbach to a manufacturer upon Wilsbach’s purchase of the beverage. The Malt Beverage Tax Act, as well as regulations promulgated by the Department of Revenue under the Authority of the Section 113 of that Act, expressly provide that such refunds shall be made by the Department of Revenue to the <em>manufacturer </em>upon the manufacturer’s affidavit and proof, 47 P.S. § 112(b) &amp; (c), 61 Pa.Code §§ 74.33, 74.32. In the event of delinquency in payment, the penalty sanction established by the Act is directed against the manufacturer, 47 P.S. § 105(a.l) and on these criteria, the incidence of the tax is clearly upon the manufacturer. <em>Tax Review Bd. v.
