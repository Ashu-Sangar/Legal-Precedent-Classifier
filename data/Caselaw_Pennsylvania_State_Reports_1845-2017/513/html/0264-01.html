At that time, Dr. Hodge was a student of medical technology at St. Luke’s Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania while Mrs. Hodge was a clinical instructor there. Prior to the marriage, Dr. Hodge enlisted in the United States Army Medical Service Corps and was sent to Fort Hood, Texas, where he was stationed until 1970. While in Fort Hood, Texas, Mrs. Hodge served as a laboratory technologist at Darnell Army Hospital. After his discharge, Dr. Hodge became employed as a serologist with Ortho-Pharmaceutical in Raritan, New Jersey where he remained for approximately nine months. His earnings at that time were $6,938.00 a year.</p>

Mrs. Hodge and their daughter joined Dr. Hodge in Mexico for the last three years of medical school.</p>

On August 27, 1977, Dr. Hodge informed his wife that he no longer wished to continue their marital relationship. Thereafter, Mrs. Hodge commenced an action in divorce in Schuylkill County on December 26, 1978. Action on this complaint remained dormant, resulting in Dr. Hodge filing a complaint under section 201(d) of the Divorce Code on March 19, 1981. After preliminary objections of Mrs. Hodge were dismissed, a divorce decree was entered October 9, 1981, with the court retaining jurisdiction over the issues of support, alimony and equitable distribution.</p>

Mrs. Hodge filed exceptions to the master’s determination that the medical license was not ‘marital property’, while Dr. Hodge excepted to the determination of alimony.

The Code defines “marital property” as “all property acquired by either party during the marriage” subject to certain enumerated exceptions. 23 P.S. § 401(e). Furthermore, subsection (f) states that “[a]ll property, whether real or personal, acquired by either party during the mar<a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>riage is presumed to be marital property.” 23 P.S. § 401(f). As can be seen from reviewing these sections of the Divorce Code, implicit in any discussion of whether an item is “marital property” under the Divorce Code, is a preliminary determination of whether that item is “property”. Therefore, we must first determine whether a professional license, such as a medical license, is in fact “property”, before determining whether it is “marital property” under the Divorce Code.</p>

It cannot be assigned, sold, transferred, conveyed, or pledged. An advanced degree is a cumulative product of many years of previous education, combined with diligence and hard work. It may not be acquired by the mere expenditure of money. It is simply an intellectual achievement that may potentially assist in the future acquisition of property.

We are in accord with the Colorado Supreme Court’s legal analysis rejecting the argument that an advanced degree is “property”. Since a professional license does not have the attributes of property, it cannot be deemed “property” in the classical sense. Nor does the Divorce Code demonstrate any legislative intent to give “property” a different meaning than its traditional definition. Unless otherwise de<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>fined, words must be interpreted according to common usage. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). Therefore, we hold that an advanced degree, such as a medical license, is not “property” under our Divorce Code.</p>
    <p id="b349-5" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[212,538,1139,1378]]]'>Even if we were to conclude that a professional license is property, it is clear that the increased earning capacity attained as a result of a professional license does not come within the statutory purview of section 401(e). Specifically, section 401(e) is predicated upon the property being “acquired” during the marriage. In instances such as the one now before the Court, the real value being sought is not the diploma but the <em>future </em>earned income of the former spouse which will be attained as the result of the advanced degree. The property being sought is actually acquired subsequent to the parties’ separation. Thus, the future income sought cannot be “marital property” because it has not yet been earned. If it has not been earned, it has not been acquired during the marriage. Furthermore, the contributions made by one spouse to another spouse’s advanced degree plays only a small part in the overall achievement. There is no question that in cases such as the one now before this Court, one spouse very often struggles to support the other spouse and the family while the non-working spouse is completing his education and post-education training. However, we must not forget that others, including the student-spouse, have made sacrifices to aid him in achieving his advanced degree and increased earned income. Thus, it is inherently unfair to compensate one spouse, to the exclusion of all other contributing persons, for the achievements of the other spouse.</p>

Analysis of Chapters 4 (Property Rights) and 5 (Alimony and Support) of our Divorce Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> convinces me that the legislature did not intend a medical license or resultant increased earning capacity to be considered such an asset. Instead, the legislature provided that “[t]he contribution by one party to the education, training, or increased earning power of the other party” should be a <em>factor </em>considered in the equitable distribution of marital property, 23 P.S. § 401(d)(4), <em>and </em>in the determination of the necessity for, and the nature and duration of, alimony, 23 P.S. § 501(b)(6). The inclusion of this factor in both of these chapters makes it clear that the legislature intended to give our trial courts the flexibility needed to fashion a fair and just economic resolution when the parties acquire substantial assets subject to distribution, and when, as here, they have few such assets at the time of divorce.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Thus, the lower courts properly rejected the claim that Dr. <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>Hodge’s medical license constitutes marital property subject to equitable distribution.</p>

Precisely because the parties had few assets subject to distribution, the courts correctly considered Mrs. Hodge’s contributions to her husband’s professional education and resultant increased earning power in awarding her alimony of $100 per week for fourteen years under Section 501.

This wording acknowledges the relationship between Sections 501(a) and (b); the only way to determine what is a “reasonable need” under Section 501(a)(1) or “appropriate employment” under Section 501(a)(2) is to refer to the specific facts of each case as they compare with the factors listed in Section 501(b)(1)-(14). I agree with Mr. Justice Zappala that certain of these factors are more relevant to a determination of entitlement to alimony than others which go primarily to the nature, duration, amount and manner of payment of alimony.

After need, ability and relative wealth are so determined, all of the other 501(b) factors, including (5), (7) and (14), should be considered in determining the nature, amount, duration and manner of payment of alimony.

In this way, we are best able to “insure a fair and just determination and settlement of [the spouses’] property rights.” 23 P.S. § 102(a)(6). With this principle in mind, we must analyze marriage as a joint economic venture. A spouse lends money without a credit check or loan agreement, secure in the knowledge that repayment will be made. A supporting spouse expects that any contribution made to the student spouse’s education or career potential is an investment in the future — a future in which every family member will benefit. No prudent business partner would expend time, effort and money without the promise of a return on his or her investment. Similarly, a spouse may defer realization of personal career goals or make economic <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>contributions and sacrifices in order that his or her “partner” will attain a level of proficiency, evidenced by a degree or license, that will make possible the future rewards to both of the enhanced earnings of one.</p>

When the idea comes into existence, the investing partner owns a piece of it and is entitled to share in whatever profit it generates. The potential to generate profits exists from the moment the idea is created. The owner’s interest in that potential is recognized by the law in many ways. Trade secret law, licensing and franchise agreements extend legal recognition and protection to the intangible asset that exists as a bare potential for future profit.</p>

The supporting spouse has provided more than financial aid in enhancing the value of this marital property, and I would not limit a property award to the value of the financial contribution. I would therefore reverse Superior Court and remand to the trial court to evaluate appellee’s contribution to her husband’s potential for increased earning capacity and award appellee a like share of the proceeds generated by the degree which was conferred with appellee’s aid. I would further impose a constructive trust upon the proceeds with appellant as trustee.
