The checks in question were negotiated at First Valley by appellee, Mary Ellen Van Norman. Jones filed suit against appellees, David Van Norman and Mary Ellen Van Norman and appellant, First Valley Bank. The Northampton County Common Pleas Court, in a non-jury trial, found that Mrs. Van Norman was authorized by Jones to receive certain of his checks and endorse his name to those checks. The trial court found further that Mrs. Van Norman was instructed by Jones to deposit the checks in Jones’ bank account at Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New York. Instead of depositing them in Jones’ bank account as instructed, Mrs. Van Norman took the checks to First Valley where she received some cash and deposited the balance in her and her husband’s personal account. The lower court, concluding that the case involved a misappropriation of funds by an authorized agent, declined to find liability on the part of First Valley.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On appeal by Jones and the Van Normans,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the Superior Court reversed, citing its decision in <em>Levy v.

His business involved extensive travel, primarily in the east and mid-west regions of the United States. In or about 1978, appellee David Van Norman was employed to work for Jones. Several months after he was hired, Jones and David Van Norman agreed that they would continue as employer and employee but the method of compensating Van Norman was changed. Instead of an hourly wage or a salary, it was agreed that David Van Norman would receive fifty (50%) percent of the net profits on each job. He also was to be reimbursed for expenses.</p>

When he was traveling and working in other states, there was no one in New York to handle his mail and make bank deposits. Because of this, checks that were sent to him by customers would stay undeposited until he returned. Apparently, this lag between receipt of customer checks and their deposit into Jones’ bank account presented a cash flow problem for Jones. After discussing this problem with David Van Norman and David’s wife Mary Ellen, Jones reached an agreement with Mrs. Van Norman that she would become involved in handling certain transactions for Jones. Jones notified customers to send their checks to the Van Normans’ address in Bangor, Pennsylvania. Mary Ellen Van Norman was authorized to endorse Jones’ name to the checks she received and deposit them in Jones’ New York bank account. Jones furnished Mrs. Van Norman with a supply of deposit slips for that purpose. It is unclear whether Mrs. Van Norman ever deposited any <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>checks in Jones’ account. It is clear though that there were four checks that Mary Ellen Van Norman did not deposit in Jones’ New York account as instructed. Rather, she applied those checks for the use and benefit of her and her husband.</p>
    <p id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.4",656,[257,611,1146,1734]]]'>The first of these checks was dated May 15, 1979, issued by Helicopter Applicators, Inc. in the sum of $1,800.00; the next was dated July 7, 1980, issued by Tabor Products Manufacturing Co. in the sum of $5,856.50; the next was dated November 12, 1980, issued by Highland Fashions, Ltd. in the amount of $1,195.00; and the last was dated December 4, 1980, issued by Southern Athletic in the sum of $2,027.08. As to the check issued by Helicopter Applicators, Inc., Mrs. Van Norman endorsed the name of Walter Jones and then signed her husband’s name directly below. She took that check to First Valley where she received some cash and deposited the balance in her and her husband’s account. Since Mrs. Van Norman requested some cash from First Valley when she presented the check drawn on the account of Helicopter Applicators, Inc., she was questioned by the head teller. Mrs. Van Norman told the teller that there was a partnership type arrangement with Walter Jones. That Jones coordinated and set up jobs that he and David Van Norman worked on together. Based upon the information given and a ten-year history of the Van Normans as good and reliable customers of the bank, the head teller authorized the transaction. (See N.T., p. 70.) As to the other three checks, Mrs. Van Norman signed Jones’ name and then her own below his. When the checks drawn on the accounts of Tabor Products and Highland Fashions were presented to First Valley by Mrs. Van Norman, she likewise requested some cash. In each instance she was questioned by the head teller. In each instance the transaction was approved based upon the same information and for the same reasons as the first check was approved. The last check from Southern Athletic was totally deposited in a personal savings account.</p>

Jones contacted several customers who he believed had paid him. Among the customers he contacted were Helicopter Applicators, Tabor Products, Highland Fashions and Southern Athletic. He obtained photocopies of the check remitted by those customers. He learned that the checks had been deposited in a bank in Penn Argyl, Pennsylvania. After contacting Mrs. Van Norman and discussing her handling of the checks in question, Jones filed suit against the Van Normans and First Valley seeking recovery of $10,878.50, the sum of the four checks. In his complaint Jones alleged that the endorsement of his name on each of the checks was not genuine and was a forgery. Jones based his theory of liability against the appellant, First Valley, upon Section 3-419 of the U.C.C. which, in pertinent part, provides:</p>

At the time of the sale they authorized their attorney to take the proceeds of the sale and open an account for them at a local brokerage house in the name of B &amp; J Corp. which was to be the Levy’s new business. With the funds, the broker purchased Treasury Bills on the account of the Levys. When the Treasury Bills matured the Levys instructed their attorney to receive the proceeds from the broker and deposit them into Levys’ bank accounts at Girard Bank and at Industrial Valley Bank. The attorney received three checks totaling $222,776.87 from the broker. The payee of two of the checks was Novelty Printing Company Profit Sharing Trust. The third check was payable to the order of B &amp; J Corp. The attorney signed the back of each check with the name of the payee and added the notation “deposit to account No. 973-784-4.” The number written was the attorney’s personal account number. All of the monies were applied by the attorney for the attorney’s own benefit.

Mrs. Van Norman did not have authority to endorse checks with Jones’ name in order to deposit those checks into her personal account at a different bank, or to cash those checks at any bank. Thus, her conduct in signing Jones’ name to achieve such a purpose was unauthorized.

Jones saw fit to direct his customers to send their payments to the Van Normans in Bangor, Pennsylvania. He found it convenient and appropriate to vest Mrs. Van Norman with the authority to receive those checks and endorse his name to them. Since the endorsements on the checks in question were authorized by Jones, they cannot be the equivalent of forgeries as determined by the Superior Court. We agree with the lower court that it was not the signing of Jones’ name that was unauthorized. Rather, it was the cashing of the checks and the depositing of the proceeds into Van Normans’ personal account that constituted the wrongful acts. It is obvious that the misappropriation of the checks was unauthorized. The misappropriations, however, did not convert authorized endorsements into forgeries. The signing of the payee-principal’s name on the check is either authorized or it is not. That status does not depend upon whether the authorized representative properly applies the checks to the account of the payee or misapplies them to his own use.</p>

He used the funds by writing personal checks on his account.

The condition prescribed by the Act as necessary to relieve the bank from liability is that the fiduciary must <em>in fact </em>have been empowered to indorse the checks, not that the bank must have known that he had such authority.

They include, for example, course of dealing by the principal, authority or apparent authority for the agent to receive cash, the agent’s possession and use of a signature stamp. These types of indicia explain on their facts the cases noted by Professor Bailey for the proposition that authority to deposit bank checks includes implied authority to endorse <em>in blank </em>and receive their proceeds. <em>See </em>at 594-596 for a discussion of the cases cited by Professor Bailey.</p>

As the testimony at the trial shows, it decided to cash the first check because it trusted Mrs. Van Norman, not because of any evidence of <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>her authority to endorse <em>in blank. </em>The record also shows that this is normal banking procedure. R.R. at 142(a). If the decision to cash a check is based mainly on the agent’s reputation, and there is no other evidence of authority, it is not unreasonable to place the risk of whether that agent actually has the authority to endorse <em>in blank </em>on the party who cashes the check against the agent’s endorsement. Banks would not have to change their banking practice, and could still seek relief from the agent on whose integrity they relied. I do not believe that our negotiable instruments law protects a bank from liability for honoring an agent’s endorsement solely because he had authority to deposit the principal’s check in the principal’s account.</p>

On this point, the present record is scanty. However, it does have testimony that in August or September of 1980 Walter Jones became aware that Mrs. Van Norman did not deposit two of the checks into his account. R.R. at 88(a). Yet he never approached the bank, and failed to bring an action for conversion for almost one year. In fact, he kept Mr. Van Norman in his employment until February, 1981. R.R. at 93(a). The trial court should determine whether this evidence, if believed, either alone or together with such other evidence as may be developed is sufficient to create an apparent authority or estoppel in favor of the bank.</p>
