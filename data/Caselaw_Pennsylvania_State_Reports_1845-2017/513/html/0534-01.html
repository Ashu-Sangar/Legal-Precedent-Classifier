Church, pleaded guilty before a District Justice to a charge of violating Section 4902(a) of the Motor Vehicle Code,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which permits both the Common<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>wealth and local authorities to post weight restrictions on certain highways and bridges. Section 4902(g)(1) of the Motor Vehicle Code,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> imposes a rising scale of penalties for violating weight restrictions imposed or posted under Section 4902(a). In pertinent part, Section 4902(g)(1) reads, "... any person convicted of operating a vehicle with a gross weight in excess of a posted weight <em>shall, </em>upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $150 plus $150 for each 500 pounds, or part thereof, in excess of 3,000 pounds over the maximum allowable weight.” (Emphasis added.) Under strict application of this formula to the facts of this case, Appellee’s fine should have been $13,517.50, and this, indeed, was the fine imposed by the district justice. The matter was appealed <em>de novo </em>to the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County (Caiazza, J.), where Mr. Church again pleaded guilty. In spite of the mandatory nature of the sentencing statute, however, he was sentenced to pay a fine of only $3,000.00.</p>

Authority for reducing overweight fines because of inability to pay was based on <em>Commonwealth v. Bundrant, </em>29 D &amp; C.3d 393 (Lawrence County), 1983.</p>

Ed. 2d 763">3 L.Ed.2d 763</a> (1959), Mr. Justice Whittaker held that, “the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not, nor does anything in the Constitution, require a State to fix or impose any particular penalty for any crime it may define or to impose the same or ‘proportionate’ sentences for separate or independent crimes.” <a href="/us/358/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="358 U.S. 576" data-case-ids="3659498" data-case-paths="/us/358/0576-01">358 U.S. at 586</a>, 79 S.Ct. at 427. The jist of Appellee’s position, based on <em>Bundrant, supra, </em>is that it is unconstitutional discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause to permit a fine imposed for a serious crime to be reduced because of inability to pay, but not to permit a fine imposed for a less serious crime to be so reduced. In <em>Bundrant, </em>the trial court contrasts the overweight violation at issue there, a summary offense, with two “serious traffic offenses”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> in the Motor Vehicle Code, both of which were fully punishable at the time under the Sentencing Code, <em>viz., </em>driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> and homicide by vehicle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> In imposing a fine for either <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>offense, a trial court, could not, at the time <em>Bundrant </em>was decided, levy any fine if the financial circumstances of a defendant did not permit the imposition of a fine; and if the financial status of a defendant did permit the imposition of a fine, the amount of same would be affected by the financial ability of the defendant to pay.</p>
    <p id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[242,643,1142,1095]]]'>In levying a fine for an overweight violation, however, the trial court was not afforded the right to consider the financial plight of the defendant. Admitting that a classification having some reasonable basis is not constitutionally offensive merely because it is not made with mathematical nicety or even because the effect results in disparity, nevertheless, the trial court failed to recognize any reasonable basis for the classifications it discussed in <em>Bundrant. </em>Since the primary purpose of the Motor Vehicle Code and its amendment is to protect the public safety, the trial court reasoned that every provision of the code is to be interpreted in the light of that intent. In <em>Bundrant, </em>Judge Caiazza found no reasonable basis to treat an individual found guilty of an overweight violation differently than an individual who has been found guilty of vehicular homicide or driving while under the influence of alcohol, since, in each instance, the violator performed an act aimed at destroying the public safety. Hence, the ability of the court to reduce fines in “serious” cases, but not in overweight cases was thought to constitute invidious discrimination. The argument is fatuous.</p>

As we pointed out in <em>Smith, supra, </em>the graded fines imposed for driving overweight vehicles are obviously designed to deter these types of violations by removing the motive to transport large overloads, for a high profit, while only risking a relatively small fine. The legislature must certainly be permitted to assume (as we assume) that being able to plead inability to pay would seriously dilute the deterent effect of the heavy fines. Given the nature of the businesses that might be tempted to engage in overweight hauling, it will often happen that companies or drivers, at given points in time, <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>will be able to plead at least a temporary inability to pay. The legislature is certainly entitled to presume that this “loophole” might often become big enough to “drive a truck through” where the argument is presented to overly sympathetic judges or district justices. It is perfectly proper for the legislature to impose fines that may under some circumstances be delayed, but can in no way be avoided, in order to deter conduct such as the gross overweight violations involved here. Such violations are often knowingly calculated and premeditated for business reasons by the offenders. We think such a scheme is perfectly rational and well within the discretion of the legislature to enact.</p>

Various reformers have deplored this tendency from time to time. However, such reluctance has not occurred with respect to business crimes or crimes against property, as happened here. (Running overweight vehicles as a calculated business risk certainly damages the public highways which are public property.) The punishment of a mandatory fine which a violator knows must be paid out of current or future profits is reasonable and well within the discretion of the legislature for the types of essentially business-related offenses involved herein.</p>
