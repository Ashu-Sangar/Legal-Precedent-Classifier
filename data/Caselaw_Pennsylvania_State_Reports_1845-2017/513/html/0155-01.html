Common Pleas granted the new trial because one of the jurors selected had previously retained counsel for additional defendant Cardamone in an independent matter and met with counsel on that matter during the trial in violation of the trial judge’s express prohibition of such contacts. We disapprove the empaneling of any juror who is currently represented by trial counsel in any matter without regard to contact between trial counsel and that juror during the trial. Any contact under such circumstances must be viewed as highly improper and the basis for a new trial if there is any likelihood of prejudice. On this record, we cannot conclude that the <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>attorney’s client, Cardamone, in whose favor the jury returned a general verdict of no liability, did not benefit from his lawyer’s relation with the juror.

Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting a new trial and we affirm Superior Court.</p>

Kahle is a well known local attorney; he is also the elected district attorney of McKean County. Appellant argues that Cardamone had a close relation with the plaintiffs from which he infers Cardamone and the plaintiffs had a common interest hostile to appellant. The record shows some evidence of a relation between Cardamone and the plaintiff and cooperation between them in the litigation. Cardamone was friendly with the Edels and Colosimo, and Colosimo hired him to do electrical work at the complex from time to time. Colosimo and the Edels had not chosen to sue Cardamone; Penelec joined him as an additional defendant. Accordingly, all parties except Penelec and their attorneys met in Kahle’s office to plan trial strategy after each day’s proceedings. <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>Despite these meetings, it is obvious that Cardamone had a common interest with Penelec in obtaining a verdict against plaintiffs which would obviate any secondary liability on its part.

Kahle thought they required filing during the trial if the estate were to qualify for the five percent discount granted for paying inheritance taxes within three months of death. 72 Pa.C.S. § 1742 (appendix).

Thus, when a communication or contact has occurred between an attorney and a juror, the judge may, within his discretion, infer prejudice. To rebut the inference, the communication must not only be explained but explained and shown harmless.</p>
    <p id="b245-6" data-blocks='[["BL_245.6",245,[221,1583,1139,747]]]'>The judge here acted within his discretion in finding that the contact between Chapman and Kahle was prejudicial and granting the plaintiffs motion for a new trial. Though the contact has been explained, it has not been shown to be harmless under the evidence presented in the record and the depositions of Kahle, Chapman and the secretaries. That evidence shows that Chapman and Kahle entered into an attorney-client relationship before the trial began. It continued during and after the trial. The relationship was disclosed at the start of the trial. The problem was not removed by the parties’ agreement to go ahead. Indeed, we question the court’s wisdom in permitting the parties to agree to a procedure fraught with such obvious potential for injustice.</p>

      <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>That potential was not removed when the court cautioned the juror to avoid contact with all individuals and counsel involved in the case. Subsequently, Kahle concluded that unless the inheritance tax forms were filed, his client would lose the five percent discount for prompt filing. He told his secretary to ask Chapman to come to the office and sign the necessary forms. It was in the financial interest of both men to get the discount. The juror passed the attorney as he left the office. Perhaps they only exchanged pleasantries and did not discuss the case. This may have all been innocent and the contact a result of mischance. Both men received checks from the estate for discharging their respective duties as attorney and executor. The episode was not revealed to the court.</p>
    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[255,1085,1140,689]]]'>The lawyer and the juror had a continuing, active professional relationship. It makes no difference that the contact may have occurred through employees rather than the attorney personally, as one version of the testimony could show. Both men benefited financially from this relationship. These facts do not show a situation which is obviously innocent or harmless. We cannot discount the effect of this contact due to the asserted odd alignment of Kahle’s client with the plaintiff. . The interests of Kahle’s client, Cardamone, were at least in part allied with the original defendant Penelec. A biased juror could easily assume that he would best benefit Kahle by finding none of the defendants at fault.</p>
