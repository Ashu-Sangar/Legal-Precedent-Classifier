On December 14, 1976, they executed an “Option and Lease Agreement” with appellant Sunbeam Coal Corporation. The agreement provided, <em>inter alia, for </em>the payment of minimum advance royalties for at least three years should Sunbeam choose not to actively engage in the extraction of coal from the demised property. The parties differ over whether the three year term is a minimum term during which appellant coal company cannot terminate without payment of royalties or a maximum term during which the lease will continue in the absence of mining. In the event mining operations should commence, the agreement provides that Sunbeam is to pay to the landowner royalties in the amount of one ($1.00) dollar per net ton (2,000 pounds) of coal removed. The agreement gave the coal company an option to enter into a lease for the purpose of extracting the coal in place under appellees’ land pursuant to terms and conditions also set forth in the December 14, 1976 agree<a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>ment.

Under that lease, the absence of a covenant to mine would have left the landowner without any consideration for his grant of the right to mine. In the present case, the parties have expressly agreed that minimum advance royalty payments of $420.00 per year shall be paid to the lessor if the lessee fails to work the mine. Therefore, during the lease term, whatever that term may be, there is no failure of consideration in the absence of mining and it is not necessary to imply a covenant to mine.

Therefore, our rejection of that court’s rationale based on an implied covenant to mine does not relieve us of our obligation to examine the terms of this particular agreement to determine whether the three year period limits only the coal company’s obligation to pay minimum advance royalties, or, conversely, the term of the lease, in the absence of mining operations. The lease provides that the coal operator shall have 180 days after the execution of the document to exercise his option to lease the land. The coal operator also covenants it will commence mining within 90 days after the exercise of the option to lease and, in the event mining does not begin, the coal company agrees to pay the landowner $420.00 per year in minimum advance royalties.

The landowners contend that such a construction would make the reference to three years a nullity. Superior Court determined that the lease provision contemplates termination upon the happening of any one of three conditions: the expiration of three years, the coal operator’s determination that continuation of coal mining is no longer financially expedient or the cessation of minimum advance royalties. We agree with the result reached by Superior Court, not because of any implied covenant to mine, but because the lease on its face is ambiguous as to its term and the other available evidence favors appellees’ interpretation.</p>

So construed, the payment of $420.00 per year in minimum advance royalties would indefinitely extend the lease term. However, this interpretation brings the first measure of the term, three years, into conflict with the third, “so long as minimum royalties are paid.” Appellant’s argument that this conflict can be resolved by treating the period in gross as merely a limitation on its obligation to pay minimum advance royalties is at best strained and rests wholly on the use of the word “or” to connect the series of events which describe the term. It is also inconsistent with the plain purpose of the paragraph in question, <em>i.e., </em>to describe and delimit the term of the lease, not the term during which minimum advance royalties should be paid. Alternatively, paragraph five can be interpreted to reflect the appellees’ construction that minimum advance royalties are to be paid, following the failure to commence mining within 90 days of the coal operator’s exercise of the option, but that the lease <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>expires three years after the option is exercised unless mining has then begun. This interpretation is not totally consistent with the use of the word “or,” but seems more natural.

The document is ambiguous on its face as to when the three year period begins and ends, whatever purpose that period serves. Paragraph 5 (quoted in its entirety <em>infra, </em>at 389) of the document states, "This lease shall continue for a period of 3 years from the effective date hereof.” The document itself is both a lease and an option. This leads to at least three possible interpretations of the phrase "effective date <em>hereof" </em>(emphasis added): (a) the lease terminates December 14, 1976, three years after execution of the lease-option document; (b) the lease terminates June 1, 1980, three years after exercise of the option; (c) the lease terminates September 1, 1980, three years after paragraph three's grace period for commencement of mining ends. The parties have argued only the question of whether three years measures the term of the lease or the time during which appellant must pay royalties. Either way, it leaves the beginning and end of the stated period uncertain. We need not address this issue, however, as our affirming Superior Court’s holding that the lease term is only three years and not perpetual relieves us of the duty to construe the effective date of the lease term.</p>

In this case, a hearing was held before Common Pleas where both parties proffered their interpretation of the lease agreement. However, in deciding that the lease is perpetual on the continued payment of minimum advance royalties, Common Pleas simply relied upon the express terms of the lease making no findings on the evidence adduced at the hearing.
