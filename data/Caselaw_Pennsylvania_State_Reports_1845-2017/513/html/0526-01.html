The purpose for the waiver rule is to promote judicial economy by affording appellate tribunals the benefit of a fully developed record including the considered reasoning of the lower tribunal.

Nevertheless, the Workmen’s Compensation Act, which establishes the <em>administrative </em>scheme within which the board functions, has fixed the board’s quasijuristic functions as both appellate and fact-determining. See, e.g. 77 P.S. § 831 (Supp. 1986) which provides for investigation and fact-finding by, inter alia, the board. The board functions somewhat like an appellate court, but, because the board can consider new evidence, proceedings before the board are not, strictly speaking, appellate proceedings. Thus, I would not extend applicability of our waiver rule from the judicial setting to the administrative setting in workmen’s compensation cases. Rather, I would hold that matters raised within the aegis of the workmen’s compensation administrative scheme are not waived simply because they were not <em>first </em>raised to the referee, and that matters may be considered on appeal so long as they were raised <em>within the administrative process </em>below.</p>

    <p id="b614-7" data-blocks='[["BL_614.8",614,[264,787,1142,684]]]'>I concur in the result. However, I disassociate myself from any implication that the strict doctrine of waiver applicable to trials applies in workmen’s compensation proceedings. These proceedings are informal and the technical rules of procedure are relaxed. <em>See, e.g., Lako v. Schlessinger, </em><a href="/pa-super/208/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="208 Pa. Super. 85" data-case-ids="776635" data-case-paths="/pa-super/208/0085-01">208 Pa.Superior Ct. 85</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20665" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="220 A.2d 665">220 A.2d 665</a> (1966); <em>Gonzales v. O’Donnell’s Broad St. Bar, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/204/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="204 Pa. Super. 170" data-case-ids="770015" data-case-paths="/pa-super/204/0170-01">204 Pa. Superior Ct. 170</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=203%20A.2d%20583" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="203 A.2d 583">203 A.2d 583</a> (1964). <em>See also 2 </em>A. Barbieri, <em>Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation, </em>§ 6.19 (1975). Importing a rigid waiver doctrine into workmen’s compensation proceedings is neither desirable nor consistent with the goal of maintaining informality in the hearing procedure in compensation cases.</p>
