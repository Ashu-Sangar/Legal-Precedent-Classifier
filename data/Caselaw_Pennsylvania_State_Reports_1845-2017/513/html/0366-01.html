Sims had been tried before a jury, which, after finding him guilty of first-degree murder, voted to impose the penalty of death. The jury also found him guilty of robbery and criminal conspiracy. After the denial of post-trial motions, the appellant was given consecutive sentences of ten to twenty years’ imprisonment for the robbery and five to ten years’ imprisonment for the conspiracy.</p>
    <p id="b448-11" data-blocks='[["BL_448.9",448,[271,1485,1141,460]]]'>On December 1, 1980, Warren Teasley was in a certain third-floor room rented to a Barry Hilton. There, on that date, Teasley was killed by being shot in the back of the head with a .45 caliber automatic pistol. His body was then taken from the room and left on the sidewalk outside the apartment building. Hilton, the occupant of the room where the shooting occurred, testified at trial as a Commonwealth witness. From his testimony we have the following account of the murder and its related events.</p>
    <p id="b448-12" data-blocks='[["BL_448.10",448,[271,1974,1140,255]],["BL_449.1",449,[211,300,1140,312]]]'>Hilton used the room as a place for entertaining and the taking of drugs. On the day in question, but prior to the shooting, he was in the room with a girlfriend guarding some drugs for an associate nicknamed “Breeze." About 4:00 p.m. that day the appellant, Sims, arrived accompanied <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>by one Alfred Dill, also known as “Dirt.” The purpose of their visit was to purchase drugs. Sims asked for “Breeze”; upon being told that the person was not there, Sims stated that he and his companion would return later. When the appellant and Dill came back they had with them another man, Warren Teasley.</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[208,643,1141,420]]]'>After Sims, Dill and Teasley had entered the room, a dispute arose between the latter two concerning money. Dill asked Teasley where certain funds were. Teasley responded by saying that he had already given him forty-five dollars. Dill repeated his demand for money, with Teasley answering that he did not have any more. Dill then pulled out a gun, pushed Teasley onto a bed, and hit him on the back of the head with the weapon.</p>
    <p id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[205,1095,1142,741]]]'>Hilton’s girlfriend became alarmed at the eruption of violence, which prompted him to escort her from the room. In the course of doing that he requested the other men to take their dispute elsewhere. When he returned Dill and Teasley were still struggling on the bed. According to Hilton, he sought to intercede in the fight but to no avail. Dill was going through Teasley’s pockets, and resumed pistol-whipping him when nothing was found. Teasley again protested that he had no more money and added that they would have to kill him. At that point Sims said, “I’m tired of this; give me the gun.” Dill handed the gun to Sims, who then pressed it against the back of Teasley’s head and fired. Hilton departed, leaving Dill and the appellant in a discussion about what to do with the body.</p>
    <p id="b449-7" data-blocks='[["BL_449.6",449,[204,1865,1140,471]],["BL_450.1",450,[280,311,1137,95]]]'>Hilton returned to the site of the apartment building later that same day. Upon approaching the building he observed that the police had arrived and were in the process of drawing a chalk outline around Teasley’s body, which was then lying face down on the sidewalk. Because Hilton had a criminal record which included a homicide conviction, he avoided the police. However, a trail of blood led from the body back up to Hilton’s room. That fact, coupled with statements the police obtained from two residents of the <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>building, resulted in the issuance of a warrant for Hilton’s arrest for the murder of Teasley.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[278,426,1140,458]]]'>About a week later Hilton surrendered to the police, whereupon he was placed under arrest and charged. He denied having any involvement in the killing. And, although he also denied even having seen the killing, he told the police that the crime was committed by two men whom he identified only as “Dirt” and “Junior.” At Hilton’s ensuing preliminary hearing no witnesses appeared to testify against him; consequently, the case against him was dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b450-6" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[277,910,1140,894]]]'>In the meanwhile, on January 3, 1981, Bobby Lee Sims was arrested on a charge unrelated to the murder of Teasley. However, the police found in Sims’ possession at that time the gun which had been used to do the killing. A few months after that discovery, a detective newly assigned to the murder case decided to re-interview Barry Hilton. Although Hilton continued to deny that he saw the shooting, he disclosed to the police that the “Dirt” and “Junior” he had referred to earlier were actually Sims and Dill. In a subsequent police interview, held on October 3, 1981, Hilton admitted to the authorities for the very first time that he was an eye-witness to the shooting in his room. In the wake of that disclosure and other details then provided by Hilton, the police arrested appellant Sims and charged him with the murder of Warren Teasley. Hilton was granted immunity from prosecution, in return for his agreeing to testify at trial for the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b450-7" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[277,1821,1139,523]],["BL_451.1",451,[218,315,1140,625]]]'>At the time of trial, but before the reception of any evidence, Sims’ defense counsel filed a motion for leave to cross-examine witness Hilton as to what communications the latter made about the shooting to the attorney who represented him during the time he was charged with the crime. A companion motion was made requesting permission to call Hilton’s former attorney as a witness to inquire of him about the same subject matter. In considering those motions the trial court was advised, outside the presence of the jury, that Hilton wished to assert the “attorney-client <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>privilege” as codified in section 5916 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5916. The trial court then ruled, also outside of the jury’s presence, that the privilege applied and that its assertion by the witness barred the defense from making the requested inquiries either of him or his former attorney. The court further ruled that the defense could not ask Hilton any questions even touching upon his assertion of the privilege. Thus, the trial court’s rulings on the above motions not only prevented the jury from knowing what Hilton had previously told his attorney about the killing of Teasley, but also prevented the jury from even knowing that such information was being withheld by the witness.</p>
    <p id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[217,959,1139,519]]]'>The substance of Barry Hilton’s trial testimony concerning the shooting of Teasley is reflected in this opinion’s earlier recounting of the crime and its attendant circumstances. It was entirely within the jury’s province to accept that testimony. <em>Commonwealth v. Whack, </em><a href="/pa/482/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="482 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="1749680" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0137-01">482 Pa. 137</a>, <a href="/pa/482/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="482 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="1749680" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0137-01">393 A.2d 417</a> (1978). In addition to Hilton’s testimony, and the police evidence about the discovery of the murder weapon, the Commonwealth also presented the testimony of two women who stated that the appellant admitted to them that he had killed Teasley.</p>
    <p id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[217,1498,1137,193]]]'>The appellant took the witness stand and denied having had any participation in the shooting. According to his testimony, he was not in Hilton’s room on the day of the murder.</p>

Defense counsel went further and sought to establish that Barry Hilton was the actual killer. The appellant’s first effort in that regard was his explanation of why he had the murder weapon when arrested in January of 1981. He testified that he received the gun from Hilton a few days after the killing as collateral for a money loan, and that Hilton said he needed the money to leave town because of the killing. The defense also called as a witness a woman who was the mother of Hilton’s child. This witness testified that Hilton had admit<a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>ted to her, at some point in December of 1980, that he had shot someone and needed money to go away.</p>
    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[273,436,1141,783]]]'>Defense counsel next tried to put into evidence certain written statements which two of Hilton's neighbors, Rebecca Harris and David Carter, had given to the police within hours after the killing. Harris and Carter shared a room on the same floor as Hilton’s. According to Ms. Harris’ statement, Hilton had rushed into her room on the day of the murder and nervously told both her and Carter that he had just killed someone. She added that she had heard a scream just prior to Hilton’s sudden visit. Harris also told the police that she later saw Hilton and another man carry a body down to the sidewalk. Carter’s statement did not include all of the representations Ms. Harris had made; however, he did relate what he personally observed at the crime-scene soon after the shooting, and agreed that Hilton was extremely nervous upon entering their quarters.</p>
    <p id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[274,1237,1138,362]]]'>Defense counsel’s attempt to have the statements of Harris and Carter admitted into evidence was predicated on the fact that at the time of trial neither of those persons could be found, despite efforts by the defense and the police to locate them. That notwithstanding, the trial court ruled that the statements were inadmissible because of the hearsay rule.</p>
    <p id="b452-7" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[274,1616,1138,405]]]'>Given that the jury found the appellant guilty of all charges and decided the death penalty was appropriate, the conclusion is inescapable that they accepted the testimony of the Commonwealth’s witnesses and disbelieved the version of the events as urged by the defense. In his appeal to this Court, the appellant presses numerous arguments urging us to reverse the judgments of sentence and grant him a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b452-8" data-blocks='[["BL_452.7",452,[274,2046,1140,308]]]'>One assertion of error is that the trial court’s application of this state’s “attorney-client privilege” violated the appellant’s constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. As noted, Pennsylvania’s version of the “attorney-client privilege,” in its relation to criminal cases, is codified in 42 Pa.C.S. § 5916. That provision states as follows:</p>

Indeed, the “attorney-client privilege” is so deeply rooted in our common law that it can be traced to the reign of Elizabeth I, where it was already unquestioned. <em>Commonwealth v.

This disclosure is made in the strictest confidence, relying upon the attorney’s honor and fidelity. To permit the attorney to reveal to others what is so disclosed, would be not only a gross violation of a sacred trust upon his part, but it would utterly destroy and prevent the usefulness and benefits to be derived from professional assistance. Based upon considerations of public policy, therefore, the law wisely declares that all confidential communications and disclosures, made by a client to his legal adviser for the purpose of obtaining his professional aid or advice, shall be strictly privileged; — that the attorney shall not be permitted, without the consent of his client, — and much <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>less will he be compelled — to reveal or disclose communications made to him under such circumstances.</blockquote>

Once the privilege is recognized and upheld, the privileged communication remains inviolate.

The policy ends fostered by the privilege, encouraging full disclosure between an attorney and his client, are ill-served by “fishing expeditions” seeking to undermine a witness’s testimony through the invocation of the privilege. Counsel should have a reasonable belief that a privileged conversation relevant to the case at hand took place before cross-examination likely to force a witness to invoke the privilege is allowed.

An attorney must have a reasonable basis which satisfies the sound discretion of the trial judge before he can be permitted to probe into confidential communications on cross-examination. Counsel’s groundless pursuit of the invocation of the privilege by a witness would inflict a grave wound upon the ancient privilege guarding communications between attorney and client, a privilege which breathes life into our independent adversarial system. Therefore, I believe counsel must demonstrate, as he did in this case, a reasonable belief that a material privileged discussion took place before cross-examining a witness on communications with that witness’s attorney. Of course, general law requires at least a good faith belief that the cross-examination will yield relevant information. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

The record reveals no evidence of deceit on the part of Mr. Gelman in soliciting the confidential information nor any intent on the part of Mr. Moldovsky to breach the attorney-client privilege. As the evidentiary privilege may only be waived by the client, there is no waiver. 42 Pa.C.S. § 5916. A punishable breach of an attorney’s ethical obligation to preserve the secrets and confidences of a client requires that the disclosure be knowing. DR 4-101(B). However, counsel are reminded of the admonition of EC 4-1: "Both the fiduciary relationship existing between lawyer and client and the proper functioning of the legal system require the preservation by the lawyer of confidences and secrets of one who has employed or sought to employ him.”</p>
