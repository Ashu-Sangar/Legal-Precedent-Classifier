A gray Cadillac bearing New Jersey license plate 879-SDX was spotted at 7:00 p.m. on February 20 in a section of darkened residences. One police officer positioned himself in an unmarked vehicle to keep the Cadillac in sight, for it had been observed the night before operated by two white males, driving slowly back and forth through the high risk neighborhoods. The vehicle had also been observed parked near the scene of a prior attempted burglary. The officer in the unmarked vehicle saw an individual dressed in dark clothing getting into the Cadillac and driving away.

    <p id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.6",227,[214,675,1139,521]]]'>Again I must dissent from the majority’s result-oriented approach to the interpretation of a very important statute of this Commonwealth, namely, the Intra-State Hot Pursuit Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8901 (repealed August 15, 1982). In effect, what the majority attempts to do, as Mr. Justice McDermott more candidly sets forth in his Concurring Opinion, is to broaden this statute to allow for an extra-territorial <em>Terry </em>stop, <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">88 S.Ct. 1868</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">20 L.Ed.2d 889</a> (1968). This is neither contemplated by the statute nor logical.</p>
    <p id="b227-6" data-blocks='[["BL_227.7",227,[211,1230,1141,1003]]]'>The purpose of a <em>Terry </em>stop is to detain a person on less than probable cause where the officer has some specific, articulable reason to suspect that criminal activity is afoot, and frisk him if similarly identifiable reasons give rise to a suspicion of danger to himself. It is the danger to the officer combined with the possibility of criminal activity which allow the probable cause standard to be relaxed. In the instant case there was no danger to the police officers who were following the automobile, since the occupants were merely seen for a second time in an area where previous burglaries had been committed. No evidence of <em>present </em>crime had been obtained. The police were acting solely in an investigatory capacity in an attempt to solve <em>prior </em>crimes. Investigation, in and of itself, contemplates slow, methodical actions over time and not the immediacy and freshness underlying the purpose of the Act. It is therefore clear to me that the Act was not intended to empower a police officer to act outside his jurisdiction on less than probable cause.</p>
    <p id="b228-3" data-blocks='[["BL_228.3",228,[281,323,1140,614]]]'>
      <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>As the majority points out, the statute requires that (1) an offense has been committed within the officer’s political subdivision; and (2) pursuit continues following commission of the offense, (At 144). The operative word here is <em>continues. </em>Where, as here, police officers are merely investigating a series of crimes and conducting a stakeout of the general area, looking for suspicious activity but not possessing any specific description of a suspect person or vehicle, it cannot be said that those officers are pursuing or continuing to pursue the perpetrator of even these <em>prior </em>crimes, since they have no indication of who those perpetrators are.</p>
    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[279,964,1139,361]]]'>The fact that the Appellees here were stopped only two tenths of a mile outside the arresting officers’ jurisdiction makes the proper application of the Act appear to work an unfairness on the police. Regrettably, however, the legislature either overlooked or did not deem it appropriate to extend the extra-territorial authority of the Act to police officers merely <em>investigating </em>the commission of a crime.</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[279,1343,1138,254]]]'>Indeed, to find support for the legislature’s intention to apply no less than a probable cause standard to extra-territorial police jurisdiction, one need only look to the replacement for § 8901, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8953 which provides in relevant part:</p>

    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[217,447,1138,357]]]'>It is clear from the facts of the instant case that the police officers did not possess the probable cause necessary to effectuate an arrest of the Appellees and the Superior Court so held. It is not for this Court to judicially graft that power onto the statute in order to ratify the actions of the police in what otherwise appears to be a valid conviction.</p>
    <p id="b229-6" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[216,833,1140,683]]]'>At best, under the instant facts, the officers possessed only an articulable suspicion which might justify a <em>Terry </em>stop.
