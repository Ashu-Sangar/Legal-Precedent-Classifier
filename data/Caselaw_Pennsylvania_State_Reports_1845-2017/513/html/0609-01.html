Charge I concerns a real estate transaction in which Attorney Wittmaack failed to inform his clients, whom he represented in the matter of securing a construction mortgage, that he held a financial interest in and was counsel for a construction company which would receive the proceeds of the mortgage. Charge I also concerns Mr. Wittmaack’s forgery of a document purporting to be signed by his clients in which the clients are said to acknowledge that Mr. Wittmaack represents both the purchaser and the contractor in the real estate transaction and that the clients consent to this dual representation. Charge II concerns another real estate transaction in which Mr. Wittmaack <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>represented both the buyers and the seller of real estate, but, until the closing was almost completed, failed to inform the buyers that he represented the seller.</p>

Both Petitioner (the Office of Disciplinary Counsel) and Respondent (Mr. Wittmaack) filed briefs on exceptions. On April 14,1986 a panel of the Disciplinary Board heard oral argument, and on May 8, 1986, after the panel submitted its report to the entire Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the Board unanimously recommended a two year suspension plus the payment of costs. This Court then issued a Rule to Show Cause why Mr. Wittmaack should not be disbarred. Because of the gravity of the offenses in this case, we view the penalties recommended by the lower tribunals as inadequate and hold that Mr. Wittmaack must be disbarred.</p>

In November of 1980, the buyers, Dr. and Mrs. John D. Nelson, of New York City, entered into a construction contract with Heck <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>Builders for construction of a home on their lot in Pike County. Mr. Wittmaack had no involvement in this transaction and the Nelsons were represented by separate counsel when they selected Heck as their builder. One of the provisions of the construction contract was that , the Nelsons, who made an initial payment of $2,500.00, could unilaterally cancel the contract and receive a full refund of their money.</p>

They inquired of a salesman for Heck Builders whether he could recommend a lawyer to represent them at closing, and he recommended Mr. Wittmaack. He did not tell them that Mr. Wittmaack was president, a director, and legal counsel for Heck Builders, nor did Mr. Wittmaack tell the Nelsons of his association with Heck Builders, although the Hearing Committee and the Disciplinary Board found that a third party had told the Nelsons of Mr. Wittmaack’s connection with Heck Builders. Nor did Mr. Wittmaack tell the Nelsons that Heck Builders had failed to make a profit in its six years of existence, that Heck was owned by his father <em>and himself, </em>that the company owed the two of them $40,000 and that he had just loaned the company another $35,000. The closing was held in Mr. Wittmaack’s office on May 24, 1981, at which time the Nelsons also executed a construction agreement with Heck Builders which, unlike the previous contract, could not unilaterally be cancelled.</p>

When Dr. Nelson phoned Mr. Wittmaack to ask for advice, Mr. Wittmaack suggested that he might use the services of one of the subcontractors or a new builder, but that in any event, he, Mr. Wittmaack would be unable to represent Dr. Nelson any further. Dr. Nelson then contacted another attorney from the same area who informed the Nelsons of Mr. Wittmaack’s connection with Heck Builders and who repre<a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>sented the Nelsons in a civil action against Heck Builders, John Wittmaack and others associated with Heck Builders. Prior to filing the civil action, attorneys for the Nelsons confronted Mr. Wittmaack with the Nelsons’ claim that he had not informed them of his interest in Heck Builders. Mr. Wittmaack denied this claim, insisted that the Nelsons knew of his interest, and asserted that he had in his possession a Multiple Representation Agreement (hereinafter M.R.A.) signed by the Nelsons which would establish that the Nelsons knew of Mr. Wittmaack’s interest in Heck Builders and agreed to his representation anyway.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> He was, however, unwilling to produce the original or a copy of this agreement.</p>

Mr. Wittmaack testified under oath in the civil proceedings brought by the Nelsons and also in the disciplinary proceedings that the Nelsons signed this document in his presence <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>on June 6, 1981. Expert handwriting analysis, however, established that the signatures on this document were forgeries which were effected by xeroxing the Nelsons’ signatures on the closing documents, pasting them on a copy of the M.R.A. and xeroxing the pasteup. Enlarged photographs of each signature establish conclusively that the signatures on the two documents have been forged by way of the process just mentioned. Further, the lower tribunals found, and we agree, that the closing was held May 24, 1981, not June 6, 1981. Mr. Wittmaack admits that he wrote the date 6/6/81 on the M.R.A. and he insists that the closing was actually conducted on that date. Dr. Nelson, a periodontist, testified that the closing occurred on May 24, 1981, and he produced office and medical records indicating that he was in New York City on June 6, 1981, treating patients.</p>

Freundlich, of New York City, retained Mr. Wittmaack to represent them in the matter of their purchase of property in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Mr. Freundlich is an attorney practicing in New York. Pursuant to his representation of the Freundliches, Mr. Wittmaack secured a building and termite inspection of the property, and after the inspection report came in, acting on instructions from Mr. Freundlich, negotiated with the seller, one Mr. Dandrow, a reduction of price between $400 and $2,000 to cover the cost of certain repairs to the property. Mr. Wittmaack negotiated a reduction of $600. During a telephone conversation with Mr. Dandrow in which this price reduction was negotiated, Mr. Dandrow requested Mr. Wittmaack to represent him as well as the <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>Freundliches at the closing. Mr. Wittmaack agreed, but he did not inform the Freundliches of this dual representation until near the end of the closing when, without explanation, he handed Mr. Freundlich a Multiple Representation Agreement for his signature.</p>

He testified: “[I]f at any time I had been aware that he was representing the seller to any extent, I would very definitely have said: no way.”</p>

Mr. Wittmaack claims that because there is a great deal of difference between the sanctions of suspension and disbarment, <em>See Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Keller, </em><a href="/pa/509/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="509 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1795237" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0573-01">509 Pa. 573</a>, 578-79, <a href="/pa/509/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="509 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1795237" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0573-01">506 A.2d 872</a>, 874-75 (1986), the standard of proof in a disbarment proceeding should be higher than in a suspension hearing. Mr. Wittmaack also asserts that the effect of disbarment on an attorney is criminal in nature and that proof of misconduct should be required to meet the criminal standard: proof beyond a reasonable doubt. While it is plain that disbarment is a <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>sanction of the most serious dimension, and in fact, may be catastrophic for the errant lawyer, a disbarment proceeding, nevertheless, is a civil proceeding, not a criminal action, and we reaffirm our often stated standard of proof applicable in disbarment proceedings that the charged violations may be established by evidence which is clear and convincing. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel v.

Clients do not pay legal counsel for advice and representation which is or may be affected by counsel’s own interests in the matter, and clients have a right to know not only whether an attorney has any interest in the subject matter of the representation, but also, if he has an interest, exactly what that interest is and how it may affect his judgment in their case.</p>

Moreover, at the closing, Mr. Wittmaack, an officer, director and legal counsel for Heck Builders, knew but did not disclose that Heck Builders had not made a profit in its six years of existence, that it owed Mr. Wittmaack and his father $40,000, and that Mr. Wittmaack had recently loaned the company an additional $35,000.</p>

    <p id="b702-5" data-blocks='[["BL_702.5",702,[285,1546,1139,413]]]'>Next, Mr. Wittmaack asserts that he violated no disciplinary rules in the Freundlich representation and that any possible violation “is at best a hyper-technical one which did not result in any loss and does not warrant even the imposition of suspension.” Also, he argues that since the Freundliches signed the M.R.A., there was no violation and that the signed M.R.A. constitutes a waiver of any objection to the timing of the disclosure.</p>
    <p id="b702-6" data-blocks='[["BL_702.6",702,[284,1983,1139,363]],["BL_703.1",703,[210,304,1143,613]]]'>DR 5-105(A) and (C) require that an attorney shall not accept proffered employment which may adversely affect the attorney’s independent professional judgment in behalf of a client or if it would involve him in representing differing interests unless (a) it is obvious that he can represent the interests of each adequately <em>and </em>(b) each consents after full disclosure of the possible effect of such <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>representation on the exercise of the attorney’s independent judgment on behalf of each. The short answer to Mr. Wittmaack’s claim is that it is not sufficient for an attorney to inform a client at the end of a transaction that the attorney represented the other party as well. And even if the timing were acceptable — which it is not — Mr. Wittmaack does not even claim that he ever explained to the Freundliches the effect of the dual representation on his independent judgment. DR 5-105(A) and (C) require both a prior notice and a full explanation. The proffering of a last-minute document without prior consent and with no explanation constitutes violation of the rule.</p>

We too find Mr. Freundlich’s testimony credible. Beyond that, we are troubled by Mr. Wittmaack’s current insistence that any violation in the Freundlich matter was “hyper-technical.” We do not view as “hyper-technical” the requirement that an attorney be scrupulously honest with his client concerning possible conflicts of interest. Moreover, contrary to Mr. Wittmaack’s argument that the Freundliches have not been injured by any failure to disclose possible conflicts of interest, the Freundliches, the judicial system, the bar, and every citizen of Pennsylvania is injured when an attorney breaches his duty of strict loyalty and fidelity to his client. Contrary to being a trivial violation, Mr. Wittmaack’s behavior undermines the very foundation of trust and confidence upon which the attorney-client relationship depends. This claim is without merit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The essence of this argument is that although there is physical evidence of forgery, there is no evidence as to who the forger was. Therefore, the argument goes, in the absence of direct evidence concerning the identity of the forger, Mr. Wittmaack cannot be found in violation of any disciplinary rules with respect to his testimony concerning the Nelson M.R.A.</p>
