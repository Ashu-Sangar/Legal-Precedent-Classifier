Four written medical reports, including three prepared for employer’s insurance carrier, indicated that Beissel’s back problems were related to her fall. An agreement was reached between Beissel and her employer’s insurance carrier, and nearly two years after the accident, the employer filed a notice of compensation payable for a lower back injury. After paying compensation for almost two years, the employer filed a petition for termination of benefits and produced evidence in the form of testimony of yet another <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>physician indicating that Beissel’s back problem’s were caused by a “coughing and laughing spell” which occurred 10 days prior to her fall.</p>

The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Beissel </em>because the record does not show that J &amp; L actually investigated claimant’s condition prior to the notice of compensation payable. On the contrary, the record demonstrates that J &amp; L commenced payment of disability benefits prior to its investigation of the causes of claimant’s disability. After its investigation of claimant’s condition was complete, J &amp; L determined that the condition was never work-related and thus, that the notice of compensation payable was, in the language of § 771, incorrect in a material respect.</p>
    <p id="b602-6" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[268,1320,1140,789]]]'>Commonwealth Court also based its decision upon a perceived potential for abuse if employers are permitted to repeatedly challenge the cause of a claimant’s disability. This observation is certainly consistent with the spirit of our decision in <em>Beissel, </em>where we reversed an order terminating benefits. There, two years after compensation payments commenced and in spite of the fact the compensation award was based upon the opinions of three of the insurer’s own physicians, the employer sought to terminate claimant’s disability payments when yet another physician reviewed the case and opined that all his predecessors were wrong in their assessment of the cause of claimant’s disability. Repeated litigation of the cause of a claimant’s injury is wasteful and, thus, to be avoided. However, there is no hint on this record that J &amp; L is guilty of such abuse.</p>

Where, as here, an employer promptly commences payment of compensation prior to commencement or completion of investigation into the cause of claimant’s injuries and later determines that the claimant’s disability was never work-related, in the absence of evidence of repeated contests of the cause of the disability such as occurred in <em>Beissel, </em>the employer must be permitted to seek relief.

This is precisely what the appellant J &amp; L has sought to do in this case. In <em>Beissel </em>we did not permit the employer to litigate liability which had already been admitted. Likewise, it should not be permitted here. I would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Both the notice of compensation payable and the employer's report of occupational injury list July 18, 1977 as the date of injury. Other documents that are part of the record, including a report of Dr. Gerald I. Schor, state that the appellee was injured on July 20, 1977.</p>

        <em>. </em>It makes no difference that the appellant-employer in the instant case sought to litigate liability by filing a petition for review instead of a termination petition as was filed by the employer in <em>Beissel.</em>
