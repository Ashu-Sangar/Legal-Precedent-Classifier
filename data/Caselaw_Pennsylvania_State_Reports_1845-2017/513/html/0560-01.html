Zimmerman, M.D. has been the school physician for the Wilkinsburg School District. He has served with skill and care, and is doubtless part of the school memories of several generations. In 1979 the school board sought to place his service under the Public School Employes’ Retirement System (PSERS). When his eligibility was denied, he appealed to the Public School Employes’ Retirement Board. They adopted the recommendations of the Hearing Examiner who had found <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>that Dr. Zimmerman was in fact an ineligible independent contractor. He appealed to the Commonwealth Court, and they reversed. <em>Zimmerman v.
