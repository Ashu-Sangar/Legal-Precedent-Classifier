No objection to this charge was made by appellee, indicating his satisfaction with the charge. We find, in the instant case, that any prejudice to appellee from the limited reference to alleged prior criminal activity was effectively neutralized by the trial court’s immediate cautionary instruction to the jury and admonition in the jury charge. <em>See, Commonwealth v.

It appears appellee attempted, in his appeal to Superior Court, to frame the issue surrounding the introduction of alleged unrelated criminal activity as grounds for a mistrial. The Superior Court stated, “appellant [appellee herein] contends the lower court erred in failing to order a mistrial after the Commonwealth’s attorney elicited testimony on unrelated criminal acts from him on cross-examination. He requests discharge or a new trial." Mem. op. at 1. We note that this statement was the first indication that appellee attempted to raise the issue of a mistrial surrounding this particular event. Rule 1118(b), Pa.R.Crim.P. states, “When an event prejudicial to the defendant occurs during trial only the defendant may move for a mistrial; the motion shall be made when the event is disclosed. Otherwise, the trial judge may declare a mistrial only for reasons of manifest necessity.” Rule 1118, Pa.R.Crim.P. Examples of manifest necessity allowing the trial judge to declare a mistrial are contained in <em>Commonwealth v.

In the instant case, appellee's counsel did not request a mistrial at the time the Commonwealth made reference to alleged prior criminal conduct by appellee. Further, this reference does not constitute manifest necessity so as to justify the court declaring a mistrial, <em>sua sponte. </em>The rule is that double jeopardy attaches if a mistrial is declared without manifest necessity or without the request of the defendant. <em>Commonwealth v. Mehmeti, <a href="/pa/501/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="501 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="1782421" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0589-01">supra.</a> </em>As this court held in <em>Commonwealth v.
