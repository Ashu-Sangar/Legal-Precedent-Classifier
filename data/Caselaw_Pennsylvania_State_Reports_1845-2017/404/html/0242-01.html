    <p id="b291-9" data-blocks='[["BL_291.16",291,[189,1619,1155,433]]]'>The facts are that plaintiff, a registered engineer, was employed by the defendant as general superintendent and civil engineer from January 1, 1953, to December 16, 1957. Sometime during that period the defendant obtained a construction job for the United States Army. Work on this job was started in November, 1953, and was substantially but not wholly completed by September, 1955.</p>

The defendant also agreed with another engineer, named Buchanan, to pay him a similar commission.</p>

The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the final amount of bonus to be paid to Buchanan and the plaintiff for the Army job. The bonus for Buchanan, as agreed upon at this meeting, after a discussion of many figures relating to overhead costs, estimated profit and the like, was $12,330.58.</p>

    <p id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.6",292,[209,1249,1152,262]]]'>The plaintiff, contending that the agreement reached with Buchanan at the meeting of October 18, 1955, also applied to him, demanded additional payment which would total $12,330.58.

Paragraph 6 avers liquidated compensation at 4% on an agreed amount of net profit. The answer denied the new figure for the profits, alleging that the plaintiff’s bonus should be calculated at 4% of a lower figure arrived at by defendant. The original contract was admitted.</p>
    <p id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.6",293,[167,1570,1159,703]]]'>The court below found that the parties made and agreed to both contracts. Agreement to the new one was shown by the amount of Buchanan’s bonus and by defendant’s admission that plaintiff’s bonus was to be the same. Plaintiff testified as follows about what Dr. DeWire, defendant’s president, said at the original conference in October, 1953: “During this discussion Dr. DeWire made the statement that anything Mr. Buchanan would get in the way of bonus, ‘Mr. Yoder will get the same amount.’ ” The court then found that at the meeting in October, 1955, Mr. Buchanan’s bonus was based on 4% of a definite net profit, and hence that it applied also to the plaintiff.</p>

Defendant, while admitting the deal with Buchanan, denied that it extended as well to plaintiff. This, however, is no great step to take in view of defendant’s admissions that it agreed originally to treat Buchanan and plaintiff the same and later that it agreed to give Buchanan the larger bonus. Although Buchanan’s ■ testimony wavered, it was within the province of the fact-finder to establish his meaning, and his following statement gives clear footing for the finding: “When I left that conference I was of the opinion that I was to receive $12,000 and some odd dollars and Mr. Yoder was to receive the same amount.” Yoder, the plaintiff, testified similarly, as above noted.</p>

The only remaining question is whether the court abused its discretion in not granting appellant’s motion for a continuance. The original contract was in 1953, the new contract in 1955, defendant’s counsel withdrew on January 23, 1959, and shortly afterward present counsel were retained. The case came on for trial on February 17, 1959. There was no question of absent witnesses, and the central point of the case is not one of unusual complexity. Appellant cites <em>Bierstein v.
