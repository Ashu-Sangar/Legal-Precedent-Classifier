On the night of August 21, 1958, DeVito was assigned to investigate the premises of the Foland Furniture Company where a door had been found ajar by the night watchman. He proceeded to the building in a police car and shortly after his arrival there was joined by Stape. DeVito, Stape and the night watchman then entered the building together. Finding nothing of a suspicious nature other than the open door DeVito thereupon entered the office of the furniture company and telephoned his report to his superior. During the time he was in the building DeVito was in full view of Stape and the watchman. DeVito, Stape, the watchman and other policemen who had arrived prior to DeVito and Stape then left the premises and secured the door.</p>
    <p id="b404-5" data-blocks='[["BL_404.8",404,[235,1333,1149,865]]]'>The next morning DeVito returned the police car to his district police station. The car was then assigned to another officer who inspected its interior and found it clean. This policeman then took the car out on patrol. When he brought the car back three hours later he left it for a few minutes. Upon returning to the car he found a rolled up piece of paper in full view on the floor of the car. The paper was a check in the amount of $47 payable to the Foland Furniture Company. Upon investigation it was discovered that a quantity of cash and checks had been taken from a cabinet in the office of the furniture company. An investigation followed in which all of the policemen who had visited the premises, and the Company’s employees were questioned. All of them denied any knowledge of the missing cash or checks.</p>

They Avere then asked to submit to a polygraph or “lie detector” test which they at first agreed to do. Later upon advice of counsel they withdrew their consent and so informed the Commissioner of Police. Thereupon the Commissioner suspended them for 30 working days. During the period of their suspension the Commissioner ordered them to submit to the lie detector test or be dismissed from the force. They again refused and were dismissed. The reasons given for the dismissals Avere (1) conduct unbecoming an officer, (2) violation of §10-110 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, (3) insubordination, and (4) neglect of duty.</p>
    <p id="b405-3" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[185,1121,1151,815]]]'>DeVito and Stape each took an appeal to the Philadelphia Civil Service Commission. After a hearing, the Civil Service Commission filed an opinion in which it dismissed all of the charges against them <em>except the ones pertaining to insubordination and neglect of duty based on the policemen’s refusal to submit to the polygraph tests. </em>Thereupon the policemen appealed to the Court of Common Pleas pursuant <em>to </em>the provisions of §7-201 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter which pertinently provides: “. . . Findings and decisions of the [Civil Service] Commission and any action taken in conformance therewith as a result thereof shall be final and there shall be no further appeal on the merits, but there may be an appeal to the courts on jurisdictional or procedural grounds.”</p>

The first is where the administrative agency or lower Court has exceeded those powers possessed by it: <em>Dauphin Deposit Trust Co. v. Myers, </em>supra, page 462; <em>Board of Governors v.

The Board contends that the removal orders of the Board made under §30 are not subject to judicial review in the absence of a charge of fraud. It relies on the absence of a charge of fraud. It relies on the absence of an express right of review and on the nature of the federal bank supervisory scheme of which §30 is an integral part. [Citing cases]. A majority of the Court, however, is of the opinion that the determination of the extent of the authority granted the Board to issue removal orders under §30 of the Act is subject to judicial review and that the District Court is authorized to enjoin the removal if the Board transcends its bounds and acts beyond the limits of its statutory grant of authority.
