The Dairy Company joined Carnegie as an additional defendant, whereupon, by answer duly filed, Carnegie revealed that he was discharged of all liability in the controversy since he had made a settlement with Hasselrode. In support of that averment he attached to his answer a copy of the release given him by Hasselrode. The release provided, inter alia: “have remised, released, and forever discharged . . . Frank R.

It knows very well that it did not pay a penny of the $1518.87 received by Hasselrode, it knows very well also that it in no way participated in the negotiations between Hasselrode and Carnegie. It knows, in addition, that its involvement in the accident was not referred to in the remotest fashion in the agreement.

In taking up this extraordinary position, the Dairy Company wants to reap where it did not sow, to build where it owns no land, to dance where it paid no fiddler, to milk where it fed no cow. Human nature being what it is, one can understand the boldness and cupidity of such a pretension, but what is surprising is that this Court, by its decision of today, in effect supplies the defendant with a stool and a pail to proceed with its unabashed milking operation.</p>

At common law, a settlement with one tortfeasor discharged all tortfeasors whether they were mentioned or not in the settlement. The Legislature, after'years of observation, noted the great hardships imposed by this rule. A victim of a tort might, 'be willing to settle with .the ostensible author of his woes, wholly ignorant that others also contributed to causing these woes. However, once he settled with a tortfeasor, no matter how meager the terms of settlement, he could not subsequently sue somebody else now proved to have been the major contributing cause to the untoward happening <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>which brought him to grief. To correct this obviously inequitable situation the Legislature enacted the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, Section 4 of which reads: “A release by the injured person of one joint tortfeasor, whether before or .after judgment, does not discharge the other tortfeasors ■ unless the release so provides, but reduces the claim against the other tortfeasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced if greater than the consideration paid.”.</p>

But this kind of construction upsets the whole purpose of the legislature, it nullifies the very intendment of the Act. In addition, it introduces disorder and irresponsibility into the whole subject of liabilities arising out of tort actions. A careful reading of Section 4 demonstrates vividly that the Legislature intended that a release, in order to discharge other potential tortfeasors in any particular accident, must specifically designate the identity of the tortfeasor who is to be released. The Act says that <em>the other </em>tortfeasor shall not be released “unless the release so provides.” Who is the other tortfeasor in this case?

If the release had <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>included in its redundant verbiage the words “railroad companies,” it would be absurd to argue that Hasselrode could not sue. a railroad for injuries sustained by him while a passenger on a railroad train “on or about the 24th day of.August, 1956.”</p>
    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[226,616,1151,645]]]'>As already stated, . Hasselrode and Carnegie did not discuss the Dairy. Company at all.. In settling their differences, Hasselrode and Carnegie used, again as already indicated, a printed form in which, like the vapors supposedly surrounding the earth, everybody was included, but, with integrity as guide, can it fairly be concluded that the Dairy Company was released on the ground that the release <em>so </em>provided? Is the Dairy Company entitled to a free ride from a contract to which it was not a party, for which it paid no consideration, and was not even remotely considered by the actual parties to the contract?</p>
    <p id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.6",608,[225,1275,1148,317]]]'>If, as Hasselrode claims, it was the negligence of the driver of the Dairy Company’s truck which caused the accident, on what principle of law and justice can the Dairy Company be released from liability when the release did not “so provide?” Could the Legislature have intended so illogical and unjust a result?</p>
    <p id="b608-6" data-blocks='[["BL_608.7",608,[223,1605,1147,260]]]'>The most convincing proof that there was no intention between Hasselrode and Carnegie to release the Dairy Company resides in the admitted fact that the Dairy Company, as already stated, did not even know that the release had been signed.</p>
    <p id="b608-7" data-blocks='[["BL_608.8",608,[220,1879,1149,429]],["BL_609.1",609,[172,369,1145,99]]]'>In entering judgment for the defendants, the lower Court said that the: “Release was drawn and given under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act of July 19, 1959, P. L. 1130, 12 PS §§2082-2089.” There is nothing in the record to support this conclusion. The release, as heretofore emphasized, was a printed form which said nothing about the Act of 1959, and certainly nothing about reducing the claims <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>“against the other tortfeasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release, etc.”</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[170,479,1146,430]]]'>The only consolation I derive from the decision in this case is my belief that it cannot be long until the Legislature or this Court itself repudiates the illogical, untenable and unjust position advanced by the Majority which not only deprives the plaintiff of his day in Court, but entangles the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act in such a manner that another decision will be necessary to unsnarl the imbroglio.</p>
