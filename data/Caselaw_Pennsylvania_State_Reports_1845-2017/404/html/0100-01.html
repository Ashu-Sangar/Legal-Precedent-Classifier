In considering the entry or appeal from a nonsuit, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be considered in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and a judgment should be entered only in a clear case. It is likewise horn-book law that a plaintiff must prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that defendant was negligent and that his negligence was the proximate cause of the injury. Moreover, as we shall see, in malpractice cases we have pinpointed how a doctor’s negligence must be proved.</p>

Under the direction of the defendant various tests and X-rays were administered after which the diagnosis was modified to antral gastritis (inflammation of the stomach in the antral area). Accordingly, on August 23rd, in order to verify this diagnosis, the defendant performed a gastroscopic examination. This procedure consisted of the insertion of a semi-flexible tube approximately three feet in length and three-eighths of an inch in diameter with a soft rubber tip into the esophagus, the tube containing a light and lens periscope arrangement whereby a visual examination of the stomach could be made. [The path of the esophagus is not straight but is curved at the point of penetration.]</p>

      <em> </em>[and there was no evidence of any other reason or cause]. After the second attempt plaintiff complained of much pain in the upper quadrant and difficulty in breathing, causing him to suspect a perforation of the esophagus. Subsequently X-rays were taken and it was found that the. gastroscope had caused a tear in the esophagus resulting in a leakage of air into the pleura space around the lungs and a partial collapse of the right lung. This condition necessitated emergency surgery to suture the damaged esophagus. The surgery consisted of an incision from the vertebra, to the clavicular line and the removal of the seventh rib in order to reach the perforation and the insertion of some forty-one sutures to close the incision. Understandably, the plaintiff experienced severe pain in recuperating from this operation and has been left with a large, disfiguring scar.</p>

The use of a gastroscope is an intricate surgical procedure employed only at the hands of doctors having specialized training and qualifications. The passage of the gastroscope through the labyrinth of the esophagus and stomach involves care and skill but the success of such passage is dependent not only upon such care and skill but also upon the condition of the wall of the esophagus and stomach and other internal physiological factors. The record shows that Dr. Bralow, in the process of inserting this gastroscope into the patient’s esophagus and stomach to determine the correctness of his diagnosis of gastritis, encountered some “resistance” at a point where the esophagus curves.

The only exception to this otherwise invariable rule is in cases where the matter under investigation is <em>so simple, </em>and the lack of skill or want of care so <em>obvious, </em>as to be within the range of the ordinary experience and comprehension of even nonprofessional persons, as, for example, where a gauze pad is left in the body of a patient following an operation (Davis v.

The Majority then gave an illustration of the kind of negligence which <em>would be clear </em>and which would do away with the necessity for the calling of expert evidence.

It is clear from his testimony that when he met it he withdrew his instrument not once but twice. He knew what resistance meant at that point the first time, or he would not have withdrawn the instrument. And the patient did not complain of pain, the tell-tale of puncture, until after defendant withdrew his instrument the second time. He admits that there is no doubt it was his instrument that pierced the wall of his patient’s esophagus. Merely meeting resistance appears to have been enough to do the damage. The instrument did not push itself.</p>

Whether there was resistance or none, defendant admitted that his instrument went through the esophagus wall. Since no one else was on the operational end of it, it follows that he pushed it through and caused damage that he must have known could follow such a performance. This was more than the mere happening of an accident. He took the chance it wouldn’t happen, but it did, and let us not forget that this was not a critical operation but only an exploratory one.</p>
