Simply stated, the question posed is whether the rule of law that an eleemosynary institution is not liable for the torts of its agents and employees shall now be abrogated by this court’s decision.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.8",474,[227,858,1148,921]]]'>In the case in which St. Agnes Hospital is the defendant, the plaintiff administratrix sued to recover damages for allegedly negligent medical and surgical care and service given her decedent, while in the hospital, by two doctors in their capacity as alleged agents of the hospital. In the other casé, the plaintiff sued the Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital of Philadelphia, Inc., jointly with two doctors, for serious and permanent injury allegedly suffered by the plaintiff as the result of negligence and carelessness in the performance of an operation on the plaintiff by one of the doctors, while under the control and supervision of the other, who was a staff physician and - surgeon of the hospital. In each case, the hospital answered claiming charitable immunity and, on motions on the pleadings, a judgment in favor of each hospital was entered. The present appeals are from those judgments.</p>

If the doctrine of charitable immunity is, as the appellants contend, no longer suited to the times and should be dispensed with, the proper way to accomplish that end is prospectively by legislation and not retroactively by judicial ukase. Under our democratic form of government, it is the legislature that can competently declare and promulgate public policy <em>and not the courts. It is to </em>be hoped, therefore,' that, with this current decision, <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>the appellants’ contention will assume .a state of quiescence so far as further insistent court action is concerned. Perhaps that is too much to hope.for. It is just three .years: since the identical contention was urged upon us and rejected in <em>Knecht v.

If the rule were to be abandoned by court decision, it' would lay open to liability' all charities for their torts of the past that were not barred by the statute of limitations at the time of the rendition of the rescinding, decision. The injustice of such an imposition' of liability upon charities that theretofore had a right to rely on the rule of immunity is readily apparent. Whereas, if and when the rule is abrogated prospectively, which the legislature could provide, all charities then made subject to tort liability .for the future could protect themselves by appropriate insurance. Moreover, whether, in this day of traffic hazards from automobile vehicles of charities as well as of all others, the rule as to charitable immunity should be rescinded poses a question of public policy which falls peculiarly within the competence of the legislature.”</p>

In the Gable case, supra, it was said (p. 258, A. p. 1088), ‘It is a doctrine too well established to be shaken, and as unequivocally declared in our own state as in any other, that a public charity cannot be made liable for the tort of its servants.’ Surely a doctrine so deeply embedded in the structure of our common law should not lightly be overturned in violation of the rule of stare decisis. Principles of the common law are not established or developed arbitrarily; they congeal during the course of the years from the fluidity of recurrent judicial decisions which presumably reflect the sentiments and social values of the commu<a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>nity. Measured by that standard there is no class of institutions more favored and encouraged by our people as a whole than those devoted to religious or charitable causes. Public-minded benefactors are not likely to have their generous impulses encouraged if advised that some janitor, watchman or other employe of a charitable organization who carelessly fails to note the displacement of a brick or stone in a pavement may thereby bring about the loss of all the property and funds which the donors had sought to devote to the common good.

Thus while in no way detracting from the contribution which these estimable institutions make toward the alleviation and cure of the ills of mankind, a proper appraisement of the question involved impels the candid statement that the hospitals receive payment for their contribution.

In 1888 Pennsylvania brought its blocks of stone and mortar, in the case of <em>Fire Insurance Patrol v. </em>Boyd, supra, for still another higher addition to this pile which now was starting skyward. In the <em>Boyd </em>case, this Court spoke with approval of the Massachusetts case, which it could see, and with equal approval of the <em>Feoffees of Heriot’s Hospital </em>case, which had been wiped out. So sure was the 1888 Supreme Court of the solidity of its foundation in the <em>Boyd </em>case that it addressed itself sardonically to a decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Rhode Island which, with a wisdom and courage in inverse proportion to its geographical size, declared that a maltreated hospital patient was entitled to recover for damage done him. Justice Paxson, speaking for this Court, derided Rhode Island: “I will not consume time by discussing the case of Glavin v. Rhode Island Hospital, <a href="/ri/12/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="12 R.I. 411" data-case-ids="11269135" data-case-paths="/ri/12/0415-01">12 R. I. 411</a>, which, to some extent, sustains the opposite view of this question. There, a hospital patient paying eight dollars per week for his board and medical attendance, was allowed to recover a verdict against the hospital for unskilful treatment, and it was held that the general trust funds of a charitable corporation are liable to satisfy a judgment in tort recovered against it for the negligence of its officers or agents. It is at least doubtful, whether under its facts the case applies, and if it does, we would not be disposed to follow it in the face of the overwhelming weight of authority the other way, and of the sound reasoning by which it is supported.”</p>

It is not alone good morals but sound law that individuals and organizations should be just before they are generous, and there is no reason why that should not apply to charitable hospitals. 'Charity suffereth long and is Idnd, but in the common law it cannot be careless. When it is, it ceases to be kindness and becomes actionable wrongdoing’ . . .

However, even though the five to two majority of <em>Knecht v.
