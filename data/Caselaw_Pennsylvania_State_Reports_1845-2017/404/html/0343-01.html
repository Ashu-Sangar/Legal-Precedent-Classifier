Plaintiff averred that defendant, “falsely, intentionally and fraudulently represented at the time the premises were being inspected that the facilities thereon met the standards required by plaintiffs and that in reliance upon such representations a five-year lease . . . was entered into [by the parties].” Plaintiff further averred that the rented premises were not fit, as represented, for the intended use. <em>Preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer were sustained </em>by the Court below and affirmed by this Court. The Court reiterated that where, as in the instant case, the written contract covers or purports to cover the entire agreement of the parties, the law is now well settled that alleged oral inducing representations or agreements are merged into or superseded by the subsequent written contract, and such written contract can be modified or varied or nullified only after it is alleged with particularity and proved that the written contract was executed by fraud, accident or mutual mistake and that the alleged false or fraudulent representations were omitted from the written contract by fraud, accident or mistake.
