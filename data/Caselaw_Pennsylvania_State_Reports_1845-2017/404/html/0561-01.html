Rockwell either suggested or requested that the surgery be performed with a local anesthesia, but, due to the nature of the surgery, Dr. Kaplan advised a general anesthesia.</p>

Of this Department, Dr. Stone was the Chief and he Avas employed and paid by the hospital. While Dr. Kaplan had ordered a general anesthesia, he did not specifically instruct Dr. Stone as to the nature of the general anesthesia. In the induction room, Rockwell was prepared for an injection of sodium pentothal to be followed by a general anesthesia of cyclopropane gas, ether and oxygen. The initial preparation was by Mr. Molnar, a <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>registered nurse doing graduate work in anesthesiology who was employed and paid by the hospital.

While the personnel who prepared Rockwell for surgery were hospital employees, they then acted under the direct supervision and control of Dr. Stone; Dr. Jiminez was a resident taking graduate work in anesthesiology and Molnar was a registered nurse taking advanced work in anesthesiology. The record indicates that the Department of Anesthesiology was alerted to Rockwell’s impending surgery and that Department, under the aegis of Dr. Stone, set up sodium pentothal as the inducing anesthesia to be followed by a general anesthesia of cyclopropane gas, ether and oxygen. All that took place in the induction room was under the direction, control and supervision of Dr. Stone; at that time and place he was “captain of the ship”.</p>

After the injection of sodium pentothal had been made and Rockwell had responded in such a demonstrative manner, it was evident that either an inter-arterial injection or an extravasation of the drug had been made; in either situation, it was evident that the injection had caused an arterial spasm. In extravasation, the drug of sodium pentothal places pressure upon the artery, while, in an inter-arterial injection, the itima or lining of the arterial passage is damaged and contracted, causing a spasm, thrombosis or clotting of the blood. The injection given was a 5% solution of sodium pentothal and between 2% cc to 7 ec of this drug had been injected into Rockwell’s left arm.</p>

In such a situation, other immediate measures that common medical skill or prudence prescribe are a stellate ganglion block or a brachial plexus block. The former is an injection of procaine in the stellate ganglia located in the neck — the center of the control area wherein is the first dorsal sympathetic nerve — and the performance of a stellate ganglion block is an attempt to relax the nerves in the lower extremities. The brachial plexus block involves the injection of procaine into the brachial plexus area located beneath the collarbone. Both procedures are taken for the purpose of relaxing or paralyzing the nerves and have an effect upon the smooth muscle fibres in the artery. . The record is clear that, if either of the above stated remedial procedures were to be effective, they had to be performed within minutes of the actual injection of sodium pentothal outside the vein or into an artery.</p>
    <p id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[158,1520,1156,814]]]'>Instead of taking these immediate measures, Dr. Stone elected to go ahead with the administration of the general anesthesia considering that the general anesthesia would have both the propensity of dilating the arteries and at the same time anesthetizing Bock-well for the operation. The record indicates that the first of the above stated remedial measures — a stellate ganglion block — was not taken until approximately 11 a.m., one hour and forty-five "minutes after the injection of sodium pentothal. Sodium pentothal in an inter-arterial or extravasation injection acts immediately and the spasm, thrombosis or clotting is almost instantaneous; therefore, any counteractive measure must be enlisted and employed immediately; in such a situation time is definitely of the essence.</p>

There were no superseding or intervening independent causes which could raise a question in the jury’s mind as to. which act or cause was responsible for the resultant injury. The act of injecting the drug into the arm of Rockwell was performed by Dr. Jiminez and there was ample evidence produced at the trial of this, case that this act was the cause of the injury and that it triggered the thrombosis or clotting of the blood, which led to gangrene in the lower forearm and necessitated the amputation.</p>

The evidence indicated that, before an injection of sodium pentothal is made, the arm should be pulsated to determine whether or not an artery is present in the area and this was not done by Dr. Jiminez. The testimony further showed that another test which could have been employed in determining whether the needle is lodged within a vein or an artery is to allow blood to come back into the syringe and from its flow and color it can be ascertained whether or not the injection of the, needle is within a vein or artery and this was not done <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>
