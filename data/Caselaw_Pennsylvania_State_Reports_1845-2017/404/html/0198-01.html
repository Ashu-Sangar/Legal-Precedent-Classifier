    <p id="b248-4" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[233,817,1152,813]]]'>The land involved is a corner lot fronting 100 feet on one public street and 150 feet on the other. A small portion of the land is occupied by a building presently used as an ice distribution depot, which is a nonconforming use. For many years before, it was used as an ice storage house. The appellant purchased the property in December 1959, without making any investigation into its zoning classification. He proposes to demolish the existing structure and erect a gasoline service station. He maintains that the land cannot be used for purposes consistent with the area zoning because there is no market for modern or new homes in the area, and that it is not economically advisable to continue using the premises as an ice distribution depot.</p>

Nothing less than a shoAving of hardship, special and peculiar to the property involved, will empower the zoning board to permit a variance: <em>Michener Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/382/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="382 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1259973" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0401-01">382 Pa. 401</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20A.2d%20367" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="115 A.2d 367">115 A. 2d 367</a> (1955) ; <em>Smolow v.

The only evidence in support of the granting of the variance in this instance is that the appellant will suffer an economic hardship, if not permitted to pursue his plans. In his petition of appeal to the zoning board of adjustment, the reason stated in support of the application is that the present classification “causes appellant and petitioner to suffer a severe financial hardship.” In his testimony before the board, he admitted that the land is suitable for the erection of residences, specifically a series of row houses, twelve or thirteen in number. His contention, pure and simple, is that the requested variance should be granted in order to enhance the value of his lot, even though the use intended might well depreciate the value of other residential properties in the immediate area.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This does not constitute the type of unnecessary hardship which is sufficient reason to grant a variance: <em>Pincus v. </em>Power, <a href="/pa/376/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="376 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1246158" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0175-01">376 Pa. 175</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20914" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="101 A.2d 914">101 A. 2d 914</a> (1954) ; <em>Cresko Zoning </em>Case, <a href="/pa/400/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="400 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1292521" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0467-01">400 Pa. 467</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20219" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="162 A.2d 219">162 A. 2d 219</a> (1960).</p>
