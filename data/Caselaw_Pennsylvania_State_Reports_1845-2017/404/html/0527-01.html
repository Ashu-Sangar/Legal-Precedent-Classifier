All of the applicants were both employees of the Susquehanna Collieries Division of the M. A. Hanna Company and members of the United Mine Workers of America. Their employment was governed by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement entered into by the union and the anthra<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>cite operators on December 1, 1956. In March, 1958, that agreement was supplemented to provide that the vacation period of two weeks would commence at the beginning of the morning shift on Saturday, June 28, 1958, and end at the same time on Saturday, July 12, 1958. Under the agreement, as supplemented and continued in effect since 1956, vacation pay was fixed at a maximum of $140 for employees who had worked in each of the 24 semi-monthly pay periods in the year immediately preceding the vacation period and at lesser prorated amounts for employees who had worked in fewer than 24 of such pay periods.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[156,1018,1156,1364]],["BL_578.1",578,[227,352,1144,97]]]'>Accordingly, the employer made the required vacation payments on the last payday in June, 1958, and shut down its operations from June 28, 1958 until July 12, 1958. A number of employees filed applications for unemployment benefits with the Bureau of Employment Security for the period of the shutdown. The Bureau allowed benefits (partial in most cases) in accordance with an allocation formula established by Departmental regulation 108 whereby the employee’s full-time daily wage was divided into the amount of vacation pay, the resulting quotient being the number of days of the vacation period over which the vacation pay was spread. Any excess was allocated to the next working day. Thus, if an employee received $140 vacation pay and had a full-time daily wage of $28, the entire $140 vacation payment was allocated to the five working days of the first vacation week and unemployment benefits allowed in full for the second week. If he received $140 vacation pay and had a full-time daily wage of $20, the vacation payment extended into two days of the second week of vacation, giving the employe $40 for that week. If he was otherwise eligible for the then full unemployment benefit rate of $35, he would be awarded $1 in unemployment compensation since partial benefits were calculated by subtracting the <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>amount received ($40) less $6 from the full benefit rate ($35).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

At the time of this economic shutdown he received two weeks vacation pay, and this pay was allocated to the first two weeks of the shutdown. This allocation was sustained by the Superior Court, and unemployment benefits were denied for the two weeks in question. A second aspect of the allocation problem arose in <em>Santus v. U. C. Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-super/177/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="177 Pa. Super. 496" data-case-ids="724684" data-case-paths="/pa-super/177/0496-01">177 Pa.

There, the employee was entitled to three weeks vacation pay, all of which he received at the time he took a one week vacation in May. When, in July, the employee was laid off for lack of work, he filed for unemployment benefits. The remainder of his vacation pay was allocated to the layoff period and benefits denied as required by the then existing provisions of Regulation 108 which the Department of Labor and Industry had adopted. The specific section of the regulation, as it then existed, called for an allocation of vacation pay to the first period of otherwise compensable unemployment occurring within 90 days of the receipt of the vacation pay. The Superior Court affirmed the allocation and denial of benefits against the employee’s contention both that the statute’s delegation of rule-making power was unconstitutional and that the regulation itself was arbitrary.</p>

The employee, whose average weekly wage was $66.40, received vacation pay of $68.78 at the time of a plant shutdown of two weeks for vacation. The employee claimed unemployment compensation for both weeks; but the Bureau of Employment Security, in accordance with Regulation 108, allocated $66.40 of the vacation pay to the first week and denied benefits for that week. Since only $2.38 remained for allocation to the second week, the Bureau allowed benefits for it. The employer claimed that the vacation pay should have been allocated equally to the entire vacation period, but the Superior Court upheld the Bureau’s allocation and determination. It also concluded that the last sentence of Section 4(u) of the statute did not preclude payment of unemployment benefits simply because <em>some </em>payment had been made to the employee.</p>

First, as noted above, absence from work because of a plant shutdown for vacation does not automatically make an employee ineligible either as a volun<a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>tary quit or as being unavailable for suitable work. Of course, Ms availability may still be, questioned on an individual basis (i.e., be is not automatically, as tbe Superior Court implied in its opinion below, “deemed . . . available for suitable work” simply because of tbe 1955 amendment). Second; in order to resolve tbe multitude of varying situations,, tbe legislature has delegated to tbe Department of Labor and Industry of tbe Commonwealth extensive regulatory authority subject to three standards: first, vacation pay shall be deemed remuneration; second, absence from work during an agreed to plant shutdown for vacation does not result in automatic ineligibility; and. third, the receipt of vacation pay shall render an employee ineligible for compensation during a plant shutdown for vacation.</p>

Superior Court’s prior holding that the last of these standards must be given a reasonable interpretation. Otherwise, the receipt of a few dollars as vacation pay would serve to make the recipient totally ineligible for benefits, a result which we cannot attribute to the legislature. We conclude further that the receipt of vacation pay is to be allocated to an actual vacation period and to be allocated within such period as the Department provides by its regulations; however, we find no justification in the statute or elsewhere for allocating vacation pay to a non-vacation period as was done in the <em>IIoenstine, Santus </em>and <em>Wheatland Tube </em>cases. We recently have had occasion to point out, in another context, .that vacation pay is not compensation for only the calendar days of a vacation period but rather a bonus for a whole year’s work. <em>Mathewson v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em><a href="/pa/394/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="394 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="1280895" data-case-paths="/pa/394/0518-01">394 Pa. 518</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.2d%20409" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="147 A.2d 409">147 A. 2d 409</a> (1959). Section 4(u) of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, in indicating an alteration in this basic approach for the purposes of that law, must be taken as requiring allocation <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>of vacation pay to the actual vacation period; but we see no authority for allocating it to a non-vacation period. Third, reference to the collective bargaining agreement by the Department in its regulations is perfectly proper to determine the connection in a particular case between vacation pay and vacation time.

    <p id="b585-4" data-blocks='[["BL_585.5",585,[157,1234,1154,704]]]'>The error into which the Superior Court has fallen stems primarily from that court’s reluctance to recognize that determination of questions like the present one can be made only by reference to the specific provisions of the statute. Thus, whether an individual is “unemployed” is decided solely from the language of §4(u) and not by reference to what one might normally consider the word to mean. Whether the allocation of vacation pay to <em>and </em>within a vacation period is proper depends not simply upon how much vacation pay the individual has received but upon the adherence of the Bureau to the Department’s regulation and that regulation’s adherence to the legislative standards.</p>

If he were thus unemployed, he was entitled, under §402 (d) of the act, to compensation in an amount determined by subtracting from the weekly benefit rate the excess of the remuneration actually received over $6. Thus, in the example given, the difference between the remuneration received ($40) and $6 or $34 is subtracted from the weekly rate ($35). The difference is the award of $1.</p>
