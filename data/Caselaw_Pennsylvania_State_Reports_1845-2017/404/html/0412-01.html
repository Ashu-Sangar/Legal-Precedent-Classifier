The principal question involved is whether the testator made a gift in a dollar amount in the nature of a pecuniary gift equal to his maximum marital deduction, in which case it would not share in the increased value of the assets of the estate during its administration, or whether he made a fractional share gift, in which case it would share in such increased value.

This was due in large part to the complexity of the language in the Internal Revenue Code. Under the provisions of the Code, the marital deduction was to be based (as above set forth) on the <em>adjusted gross estate </em>which was to be arrived at by subtracting certain specified allowable deductions from the gross estate. However, the gross estate for federal tax purposes is frequently different from the estate which passes under the testator’s will, because the former includes life insurance and other property which is often not included in a testator’s will.</p>

In most cases these are interrelated. A testator is, therefore, in a dilemma. If he gives a specific sum or specific assets to his widow (outright or in a marital trust) it may fall short of the allowable amount and thus fail to utilize the maximum marital deduction (underqualifying). He may avoid this dilemma by using a formula to provide a gift which <em>exactly </em>equals the marital deduction allowable, and at the same time carry out <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>Ms testamentary wishes and intent. Testator here elected to use a formula. Formula clauses are usually divided into (a) those creating a gift in a pecuniary amount and (b) those giving a fractional share of the residue. How to accurately express this formula and at the same time carry out the testator’s dominant intent, viz., free his estate from as much of the Federal Estate Tax as is possible, has perplexed and baffled many.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">*</a>

L. Rev. 582">64 Harv. L. Rev. 582</a> (1951). Casner gives examples of pertinent language for nonformula gifts and for formula gifts.

The Court held that this was a <em>pecuniary </em>gift and that it should be satisfied by distributing to it enough shares of stock at their distribution time (higher) value as to make up the amount of the marital deduction reported in the Federal Estate Tax Return. There, as here, the marital trust was set up in one clause of the will, Article Third, and there, as here, the residuary estate was set up in a succeeding paragraph, Article Fourth. That Court considered such a pattern as an important factor in determining the testator’s intention. It said: “As though to eliminate the slightest doubt that the marital deduc<a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>tion gift was not intended to be of tbe residue formula type is tbe express direction in Article Fourth of tbe will that the trust there provided for should be constituted from tbe ‘rest, residue and remainder of my property,’ tbe conventional verbiage for reference to tbe residuary estate.

We are convinced that this was bis dominant intent. Tbe appellees have fallen into error in considering that Trust A was a gift of 5/9 or 1/2 or some fraction of testator’s <em>entire </em>estate — Trust A is not a residuary gift either in a 5/9 fraction or in a 1/2 or other fraction. Had testator intended to give bis entire estate 5/9 or 1/2 to bis wife and tbe other 4/9 or 1/2 to bis children and issue be could very easily have created a residuary trust estate and divided it into two trusts, tbe marital trust consisting of 5/9th known as Trust A,, and tbe trust of the remainder for bis children and issue known as Trust <em>B; </em>or even more clearly be could have specifically given a fractional share of bis residuary estate to bis marital trust and tbe other fraction to Trust B. He did not do so; instead be created a marital deduction trust in paragraph Fifth, and did not set up a trust for bis residuary estate until after that bad been accomplished. In other words, testator used tbe words — “so much of my estate which [with other property passing from me to my wife] shall equal tbe maximum marital deduction” — advisedly, and be thereby intended to convey bis desire and in<a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>tent that this marital trust was to receive <em>exactly the amount of assets </em>equal to the maximum marital deduction allowed by law — no more and no less! When testator wrote his will he could not know, we repeat, the exact amount of his gross estate or his adjusted gross estate in dollars and cents, but he (and his attorney) did know that the exact dollar amount of the marital deduction would be ascertained and determined when his Federal Estate Tax Return was subsequently computed and determined. They knew that this return would show in dollars and cents the <em>exact amount </em>which was allowable as the marital deduction, and testator intended this exact amount to be paid to (his marital) Trust A, unaffected by any subsequent fluctuation of the market during the period of the executors’ administration or by any possible but unforeseeable capital gains or losses.</p>
