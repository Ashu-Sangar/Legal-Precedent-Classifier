    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.8",208,[238,705,1147,310]]]'>Our mandate to the lower court in <em>46 South 52nd Street Corporation v.

    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.9",208,[238,1045,1150,870]]]'>There is no question that a court of equity which has entered a decree for an injunction may open, vacate or modify the same where the situation and circumstances of the parties or the law are shoAvn to have so changed as to make it just and equitable to do so. But we know of no rule of laAV or procedure, and none has been cited, that permits the lower court after appellate review to withhold the entry of an effective decree mandated by the appellate court. The lower court states that it declined to enter the mandated decree because city council had under consideration an ordinance which might change the applicable conditions, and hence it refrained from effectuating the decree until city council had an opportunity to act. That explanation gives proper consideration neither to the rights of the successful litigant nor to the mandate of our court.</p>

We deliberately refrain, therefore, from any expression or implication Avith respect to the validity or invalidity of the ordinance.</p>
