    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[163,916,1149,321]]]'>In its answer raising questions of law, the PTC attacked the jurisdiction of the court to entertain a declaratory judgment under the circumstances, i.e., no actual controversy and no imminent and inevitable litigation threatened, and PTC contended that the City was merely seeking an advisory opinion.</p>

There is a complete lack of any evidence that, even if the price under the formula proved to be satisfactory, the City <em>would </em>exercise this option and such willingness to exercise the option can be evidenced only by official action taken by the City, i.e., by an ordinance duly passed'by City Council approved by the Mayor: Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, Section 2-200 et seq. Until this is accomplished the exercise of the option is a matter of conjecture and surmise, an event the occurrence of which is uncertain.</p>

The City argues that, if it did exercise the option for $62,000,000 — apparently, the City’s top price under the formula — it would be subjected to two risks: (1) if the City exercised its option, the courts might hold the City bound to the purchase even if the price under the formula was fixed in excess of $62,000,000; (2) if a court determined the formula price to be. $75,-000,000 and the City had exercised its option at $62,-000,000, the City by naming the wrong price, might be held to have forever forfeited its exercise of the option even at the correct price. Regardless of the City’s apprehensions, until the City takes an. official position with regard to the exercise of this option declaratory judgment will not lie.</p>

Such ordinance could be couched in such terms to relieve the City of its apprehensions either as to forfeiting its option rights or becoming obligated to pay a higher price than it deems appropriate. Unless and until the City takes such action, no justiciable contro<a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>versy exists under the Declaratory Judgment Act.
