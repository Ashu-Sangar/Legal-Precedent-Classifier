Titles to all of the land involved in this action stem from a common grantor. In the year 1883, the tract, then farm land, was laid out in lots, streets and alleys. The street in question appears on the recorded map of the tract as planned by the common grantor, and also appears on the borough map. wherein it is situated, dated 1934 and revised to May, 1950. While the street was never accepted for public use by the borough, the private right, or easement to use the street, acquired by the plaintiffs and their predecessors in title, was not affected by the failure of the municipality to act upon the dedication.

However, the operation of the doctrine does not depend solely upon the passing of time: <em>Pa. State Bd. of Med. Ed., etc., v. </em>

Laches will not be imputed where no injury has resulted to the other party by reason of the delay: <em>Joseph Melnick B. &amp; L. v.

In the absence of prejudice to the one asserting laches, the doctrine will not be applied: <em>Schireson v.

The evidence herein fails to disclose any prejudice to the defendants by reason of the delay on the part of the plaintiffs in seeking legal relief. The improvements made to the specific land by the defendants were effected during a time when plaintiffs were absent from the property, and completed before they were notified that the defendants considered the land their exclusive domain. Further, as the chancellor pointedly observed, the improvements, consisting of leveling and blacktopping, made by the defendants were not such as to be inconsistent with the use of the strip as a street.</p>

It is true that where the asserting party’s legal right to the easement is not clear, or is in substantial dispute, equity lacks jurisdiction to determine the issue: <em>Ohringer Home Furn. v.

Where a lot of land is conveyed and the deed makes reference to a plan upon which the lot is laid out which, in turn, calls for a certain street thereon, this constitutes a dedication of the use of the street to the enjoyment of the purchaser as a public way though not yet opened and the map or plan becomes a material <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>and essential part of the conveyance and has the same effect as if incorporated therein.
