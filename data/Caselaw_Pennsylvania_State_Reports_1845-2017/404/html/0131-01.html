Thereupon, decedent’s executors and trustees petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County to annul Mrs. Kaufmann’s election; the basis of their petition was that Mrs. Kaufmann, by reason of the antenuptial agreement of September 3, 1954, was barred from making any such election. By answer to this petition, Mrs. Kaufmann took the position that, although she did execute the ante-nuptial agreement, the agreement was invalid and not binding upon her for various reasons :<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> lack of mutuali<a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>ty, that the agreement was executed by her without an understanding on her part of its meaning and purport and without having been adequately and properly advised by counsel of her own choice, that, when the agreement was made, she was not aware of decedent’s actual financial status or of the existence of the charitable purpose life insurance trust, that she was without knowledge of the impact on decedent’s estate of taxation and the tax saving device of marital deduction, that decedent, although his will was already prepared and ready for execution, failed to disclose to her the manner in which he proposed to dispose of his estate and, lastly, the agreement failed to make adequate and suitable proportionate provision for her maintenance and support. Although Mrs. Kaufmann’s challenge to the agreement’s validity appears to be in the nature of a shotgun attack, the real thrust of her challenge is two-fold: (1) that the decedent fraudulently and falsely concealed and failed to disclose to her the actual manner in which he intended to make a charitable disposition of his estate and (2) that the agreement failed to provide an income adequate and sufficient to maintain her in a manner consistent with that in which she had lived during coverture.</p>

We have the unrebutted testimony of Attorney Knox (who acted as Mrs. Kaufmann’s counsel when the agreement ivas executed) “that [Mrs. Kaufmann] was fully acquainted with Mr. Kaufmann’s property and resources, financial position . . .:” the testimony of Mrs. Kaufmann’s mother that in Mrs. Kaufmann’s desk in the Palm Springs residence were kept “all the business papers” of decedent; the uncontradicted testimony that Mrs. Kaufmann for at least three years prior to the agreement acted as decedent’s secretary and companion, and knew, at first hand, the very lavish and extravagant manner in which decedent lived, a manner of living which only a <em>very wealthy </em>man could afford. More important than all this testimony, however, is the admitted and conceded fact that the agree<a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>ment examined and executed by Mrs. Kaufmann contained the recital “that she [Mrs. Kaufmann] has been informed by Mr. Kaufmann and is aware that his net worth is in excess of Ten Million Dollars”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> That this was a true and accurate statement of decedent’s financial status is borne out by the undisputed fact that, seven months after the execution of the agreement, decedent died leaving an estate of approximately $10,-500,000. Mrs. Kaufmann would have the court believe that, although the agreement recites otherwise, she had not seen nor was she familiar with certain statements setting forth decedent’s assets and liabilities. Even though she had not seen and was not familiar with these statements, such facts would only tend to prove a lack of full disclosure of decedent’s net worth. Assuming, arguendo, Mrs. Kaufmann had not seen these statements, the fact remains she <em>knew </em>decedent’s financial worth. It is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of a situation where there could be a more complete and honest disclosure of his net worth by a groom-to-be to his bride-to-be.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

In disposing of this complaint the court below well stated: “The provision made for the widow in the antenuptial agreement, consisting of capital gifts amounting to $250,000 and a life income of $40,500 before taxes ($23,128.44 after <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>taxes), is reasonable and adequate in the circumstances of this case.</p>

The provisions made by decedent for Mrs. Kaufmann were adequate and appropriate. In fact, after a seven-month marriage, Mrs. Kaufmann finds herself in a position of economic security and financial independence such as enjoyed by comparatively few women.</p>

That considers only one “if” in the situation; <em>if </em>decedent had not married her what would her position have been so far as maintenance and support be concerned? Furthermore, assuming that decedent did marry her without an antenuptial agreement, her survival of decedent conditioned the receipt of anything from his estate. Of course, Mrs. Kaufmann receives less by reason of the agreement than she otherwise would have received when decedent died, but that was the purpose of the agreement and Mrs. Kaufmann <em>knew </em>it. She <em>knew </em>when she signed the agreement that thereunder she bound herself to take less of the decedent’s estate than she would receive without the agreement.

In the agreement it is recited (Paragraph 10) : “That [Mrs. Kaufmann] recognized that it is the desire of Mr. Kaufmann that the majority of his estate shall go to charitable purposes, in which desire [Mrs. Kaufmann] also joins . . .” Mrs. Kaufmann takes the position that this recital is the very essence of the agreement and that it was her understanding that the reason for the agreement was to enable decedent to give his <em>entire </em>estate (other than the assets mentioned in the agreement) for charitable purposes; upon that understanding alone did she acquiesce in a waiver of her statutory rights to a share in decedent’s estate. In this respect, Mrs. Kaufmann urges she was deceived and defrauded by decedent for he knew that under his will, then prepared but unexecuted, his <em>entire </em>estate was not being given to charitable purposes and such deception and fraud should vitiate the entire agreement. Although not expressly asserted, the real thrust of this argument is that, by the inclusion of his son and faithful employees as recipients, in part, of his bounty, decedent breached the antenuptial agreement.</p>

A “majority” means more than half of any total. The agreement gave Mrs. Kaufmann less than ten per centum of decedent’s estate and expressed a “desire” to give more than fifty per centum of the estate to charity; as to disposition of the possible balance of forty per centum of the estate the antenuptial agreement is silent.

Such argument is irrelevant to the issue. There is no provision in the antenuptial agreement that decedent would disinherit his son or forego bequests to faithful employees and the fact, if <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>it is a fact, that a more carefully prepared estate plan would have saved taxes has no bearing on the validity of the antenuptial agreement.

Under the terms of the antenuptial agreement, decedent was bound to deliver to Mrs. Kaufmann, immediately after the marriage, 2500 shares of may stock, and by the terms of his will, to give her the Palm Springs residence and a life interest in the income from at least 20,000 shares of may stock. Had decedent failed to perform any or all of these promises Mrs. Kaufmann could have secured a specific performance of such promise or promises against either the decedent or his personal representative: <em>Liggins Estate, </em><a href="/pa/393/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="393 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1279722" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0500-01">393 Pa. 500</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="143 A.2d 349">143 A. 2d 349</a>; <em>Coane’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/310/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="310 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1144312" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0138-01">310 Pa. 138</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%202" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="165 A. 2">165 A. 2</a>.

Decedent’s executors and trustees offered in evidence the antenuptial agreement, proof of the marriage between the parties, the will and record of the will’s probate, evidence of the completion of the inter vivos gift of 2500 shares of may stock and then rested. Mrs. Kaufmann then presented her evidence to set aside the antenuptial agreement. At the conclusion of Mrs. Kaufmann’s evidence, decedent’s executors and trustees moved the court to enter a decree in the nature of a judgment of nonsuit and to strike off Mrs. Kaufmann’s election.
