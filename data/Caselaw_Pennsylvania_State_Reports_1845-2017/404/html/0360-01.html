He was survived by a son, Augustus G. Heaton, and a daughter, Rosalie H. Tows. Augustus died on October 11, 1930, and was survived by three children— (1) Augustus, who died April 11, 1936, without issue; (2) Harry, who died on September 21, 1933, and was survived by three children — great-grandchildren of testator — John G. Heaton, Caroline H. O’Connor and Mary H. Villemin; and (3) Perry, who died June 15, 1954, without issue. Upon the death of Perry, Harry’s three children above mentioned, John, Caroline and Mary, inherited absolutely the balance of the principal of the trust created by testator for testator’s son Augustus and Augustus’s sons and issue. The net result has been that John, Caroline-and Mary, who were the children of Harry and the great-grandchildren of testator, inherited outright and absolutely the principal of one-half of testator’s trust estate. Two of these children, namely, John and Caroline, are the present appellants and claim the entire principal of the residuary trust which testator set up for his daughter Rosalie and her child Ferrars.</p>

There then follows this provision [still part of paragraph 4] which has given rise to the present controversy: “and failing such brothers and sisters ... or their issue [Ferrars died in 1958 without issue or brothers or sisters] then and in that event I direct and order the share of such grandchild to be paid, ... to the persons who would be entitled thereto as my heirs and next of kin respectively under the intestate laws of the State of Pennsylvania m <em>force at the time of this writing </em>.” It will be instantly noted that the share of the grandchild who died without issue and without brother or sister is not given to the trust for the other line, it does not augment the shares of any legatee or cestui que trust, it is not given to “survivors” or even to testator’s heirs and next of kin— it is given to testator’s heirs and next of kin in accordance with the intestate laws <em>in force at the time of this writing. </em>Testator’s heirs and next of kin under the intestate laws in force at the time he wrote his will <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> were his son, Augustus, and his daughter, Rosalie, and it is through Rosalie that Ferrars’ legatee inherits by devolution one-fourth of testator’s estate.</p>

The lower court consequently decreed that the remaining principal of testator’s residuary trust (Rosalie’s share) was to be paid one-half to testator’s son, Augustus, and one-half to testator’s daughter, Rosalie, and each of said halves passed through them to their respective legatees. The Orphans’ Court unanimously agreed upon this construction (and result) first and primarily because of the language of <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>testator’s will, and secondly because if there were any ambiguity in testator’s language the settled rule of construction at the date he made his will compelled the same construction and result.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a>

Many people cannot understand why a testator would prefer to allow one-fourth of his estate to be given to a grandchild’s wife or friends, instead of giving the entire four quarters to his great-grandchildren even though he had never seen them. Sound, sensible persons sometimes make eccentric wills or prefer an individual or a charity or a corporation to relatives, or leave their estate in a manner that seems to exclude children or issue as well as to Courts to be inequitable or unjust or extremely foolish.
