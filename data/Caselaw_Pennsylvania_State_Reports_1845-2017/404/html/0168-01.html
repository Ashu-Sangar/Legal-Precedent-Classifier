On August 30, 1956, the Commonwealth condemned 3.2 acres, isolating and rendering useless .84 acre and leaving appellee 5.7 acres. The reason for condemnation was the extension <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>of Route !100. On August 81, 1956, appellee’s revised plot plan, showing a subdivision into lots, was approved by the borough and recorded and the construction of houses was begun; the original plan, prepared in June from field-work done in May, was neither approved nor recorded because appellee had heard that Route 100 was to be extended and after inquiry from the district engineer for the Commonwealth in June or July the extension seemed imminent enough to warrant a final revision of the plan.</p>
    <p id="b218-4" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[233,904,1152,484]]]'>Appellee bought the 9% acres for $15,000. He and his experts testified to the value immediately before and after condemnation as follows: Kerstetter, sole owner of the stock of appellee corporation; before, $128,000, after $62,300, difference, $65,700; Bowen, before, $134,000, after, $67,700, difference, $66,300; O’Dell, before, $107,640, after, $53,929, difference, $53,-711; Thompson, before, $92,653.50, after, $39,415, difference, $53,238.50.</p>

We have refused to countenance this kind of testimony since <em>Pennsylvania, Schuylkill Valley Railroad Co. v.

It may be salable as a <em>site for the erection of </em>a hotel, a factory, a dwelling, or a wharf, but it is not <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>proper to lay before tbe jury proof of what the hotel .or other structure would cost, together with proof of the value of the lot with such structure upon it, and treat the difference between these sums as the value of the lot. Such a method would be speculative and fanciful. Equally improper is evidence showing how many building lots the tract under consideration could be divided in to,, and what such lots would be worth separately. It is proper to inquire what the tract is worth, having in view the purposes for which it is best adapted, but it is the tract, and not the lots into which it might be divided, that is to be valued.”</p>

Appellee’s purpose in offering such evidence was to show, with other factors, the depreciation accruing to the rest of the tract by having to fence it off against a cut eight to fifteen feet deep. Agáin, the fact of fencing would have been competent evidence, but not the cost: appellee may have made a poor bargain in buying fence or may have indulged a whim in the kind or quality of fencing. The cost of specific items never translates exactly into market value, which may, in the curious process of the public’s collective mind, be more or less than the price paid and for no arguable reason. Expert opinion, which is only an ordinary guess in evening clothes, tries to fathom the public mind, and specific prices have no place in a general idea of value. The law allows expert testimony whenever something is incapable of exact proof: it is an instance of . the best evidence available. Our position on the fencing in the instant case is supported by <em>Sgarlat Estate v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/398/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="398 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="1289101" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0406-01">398 Pa. 406</a> (1960), <a href="/citations/?q=158%20A.2d%20541" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="158 A.2d 541">158 A. 2d 541</a>, and <em>Chambers v.
