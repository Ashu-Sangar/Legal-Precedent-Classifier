To do so, of course, they had to be man and wife, as the entireties tenure is peculiar to the state of marriage. The facts are that defendant married a man named Lipeczky in 1933, was deserted by him in 1935, and was divorced by him in 1943. Meanwhile his father told her, when she inquired, that his son was dead; however innocent her belief in his death may have been, if he was not dead in fact she could not become the plaintiffs common-law wife: <em>Frederick v. Bouthwick, </em><a href="/pa-super/165/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="165 Pa. Super. 78" data-case-ids="467335" data-case-paths="/pa-super/165/0078-01">165 Pa.

In 1936 she began living with the plaintiff as man and wife, and they separated in May, 1946. She did not act on her supposed freedom to marry plaintiff when she heard that Lipeczky was dead, nor even when she learned that he was alive and had divorced her. In any event she could not have held property with plaintiff as tenants by the entireties from 1936 to 1943, since she had a living and undivorced husband, and after 1943 the court below, on ample evidence, found that no common law marriage existed.</p>

I was known as Mrs. Simpson.” Witnesses McElbatten, Colley, Townsend, and Bunton reported ber as saying that sbe and Simpson were not married: Colley testified that sbe told bim that sbe and a Peter Tully were married. In bis adjudication tbe Chancellor says this: “On two separate occasions when a common law marriage was suggested, sbe arose from ber place beside ber counsel, interrupted the proceedings, and vehemently stated that she never was married to tbe plaintiff. When tbe trial was resumed about six weeks later, sbe contradicted this testimony directly and said that sbe and tbe plaintiff were living as husband and <em>wife; </em>that they assumed that relationship, not initially, when many of tbe transactions which are tbe subject of controversy occurred, but following May, 1943 when sbe learned of ber divorce from ber lawful husband, Lipeczky.”</p>

    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[237,1693,1147,705]]]'>The case was effectively adjudicated, when, following its final decree of March 16, 1950, the court below confirmed the report of the Master in partition on December 8, 1953. The auditor was appointed to mop up rights already adjudicated and to present a balance for distribution. To unwind the sale of the farm and uproot the rights of the bona fide purchaser who bought it, and to open up the accounting back to 1936, with the plaintiff dead and the Dead Man’s Act blocking the witness chair, would be unnecessary and unfair, for appellant could have tried out her rights on one of her three former appeals, when the spoor of the case was fresh and young. She must be sternly foreclosed.</p>

      <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>The court below has handled this complex case with meticulous and intelligent care, and if there is any error it lies in the prodigious length of the proceedings, a condition for which appellant is primarily responsible.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[180,655,1147,422]]]'>The decree now appealed from appears to be the last one of record, that of September 24, 1959, dismissing exceptions to the auditor’s reports, awarding $4842.99 to defendant and presumably $4194.05 to the administrator c.t.a., and any excess over $8537.04 in like proportion. The record must be remanded in order to determine whether there is any such excess and to award final amounts.</p>
