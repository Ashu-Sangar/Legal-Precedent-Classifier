      </a>
      <em> </em>loss, cost or expense . . . <em>arising from accidents to </em>mechanics or <em>laborers employed in the construction of said work, </em>or to persons passing where the work is being constructed.’ ” During the course of the construction one of the contractor’s workmen was killed through the negligence of one of the property owner’s employees. The property owner was compelled to respond in damages for the death. He then brought an action in assumpsit on the indemnity bond against the contractor. This Court affirmed the entry of a judgment of non-suit. In construing the contract clause in question this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Mestrezat aptly said (pages 259, 260, 262, 263) : “The question presented here has not arisen or been determined in any of the reported decisions of this court. In other <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>jurisdictions, however, the inclination is decidedly against construing a contract of this character as indemnifying the indemnitee against his own negligence; and it is there held that a contract, will not be so construed unless express language requires it. In Mynard, etc. v. Syracuse, etc., R.R. Co., <a href="/ny/71/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="71 N.Y. 180" data-case-ids="2168058" data-case-paths="/ny/71/0180-01">71 N.Y. 180</a>, it is held that 'every presumption is against an intention to contract for immunity for not exercising ordinary diligence in the transaction of any business, and hence the general rule is that contracts will not be so construed unless expressed in' unequivocal terms.’ In Mitchell v. Southern Ry. Co., 24 Ky. L. Repr. 2388, Mr. Justice Paynter, speaking for the court, says: 'If a doubt existed as to its (clause of indémnity) meaning, the court would resolve that doubt against the contention that the contract was intended to indemnify appellee against its own negligence. Every presumption is against such intention. . . In Perkins v. New York Central R.R. Co., <a href="/ny/24/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="24 N.Y. 196" data-case-ids="2029517" data-case-paths="/ny/24/0196-01">24 N.Y. 196</a>, the court said: "A party who claims exemption from liability for the negligence of his servants or agents must undoubtedly base his claim upon the express words of his contract.

Suit was then brought by the company against the contractor on his indemnity contract, blit it was held that the contract did not indemnify the company against <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>the negligence of its employees. In the opinion of the court it is said: ‘For, while the language of this part of the contract is very general, it cannot reasonably be so construed as to impose upon the contractors the obligation to protect the plaintiff against the carelessness or negligence of persons in its own employment. What the party designed and intended by this part of the agreement was to indemnify the plaintiff against liability for any. damages or injuries that might be sustained by persons in the employment of the contractors in the progress and execution of their work. . . There was no relation whatever existing between them (employees of the railway company) and the contractors, and it is not reasonable to suppose that in the use of this language, either the plaintiff or the contractors intended or understood the latter to be obligated to indemnify the plaintiff against the carelessness or misconduct of its own servants or employees.’</p>

The circumstances surrounding the parties, the one, the owner for whom the building is to be erected, and the other, the contractor who is to construct the <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>building and hence from whose acts injury to persons and property may be anticipated, would seem to make the conclusion irresistible, that unless expressly stipulated in the contract the owner is not to be indemnified against his own negligence. In the case in hand the parties have not expressly stipulated against injury occasioned by the indemnitee’s own negligence, and we are satisfied, from the terms of the instrument read in the light of the circumstances surrounding the parties as well as the manifest purpose inducing the bond, that they did not intend to protect the indemnitee against his own or his servant’s negligence.”</p>

Whitaker Co., </em>supra, argues that where the language of the contract is not explicit the Court will look to the circumstances surrounding it and the object of the parties in making it. This is a correct statement of the law, but unfortunately for plaintiff it cannot help him here. The facts of the <em>Tidewater </em>case are clearly distinguishable from the material facts in the instant case. In <em>Tidewater </em>the indemnitor had complete possession and control of the premises and actually selected and employed the people working upon them, although the indemnitee had technical control of the <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>employees while working there. While it is true that the indemnitee had one part-time employee on the premises, this employee was also in the employ of the indemnitor. Under these circumstances and conditions it was logical and reasonable for the Court to infer that the object of the indemnity contract was to save the indemnitee harmless from negligence by employees <em>so selected </em>and so employed. However, in the present case the facts are quite different. The indemnitee remained in possession of the premises. Its own employees continued working under its exclusive control. Under the construction contended for by plaintiff, Patterson and in turn Eichleay would be made insurers for acts of negligence over which they had or could have no control. Without more direct and unequivocal language in the contract, it is unreasonable to infer or conclude that the parties intended an indemnification of such magnitude.</p>

The right of indemnity rests upon a difference between the primary and the secondary liability of two persons each of whom is made responsible by the law to an injured party. It is a right which enures to a person who, without active fault on his own part, has been compelled, by reason of some legal obligation, to pay damages occasioned by the initial negligence of another, and for which he himself is only secondarily liable. . .</p>

But the important point to <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>be noted in all the cases is that secondary as distinguished from primary liability rests upon a fault that is imputed or constructive only, being based on some legal relation between the parties, or arising from some positive rule of common or statutory law or because of a failure to discover or correct a defect or remedy a dangerous condition caused by the act of the one primarily responsible. In the case of concurrent or joint tortfeasors, having no legal relation to one another, each of them owing the same duty to the injured party, and involved in an accident in which the injury occurs, there is complete unanimity among the authorities everywhere that no right of indemnity exists on behalf of either against the other; in such a case, there is only a common liability and not a primary and secondary one, even though one may have been very much more negligent than the other. The universal rule is that when two or more contribute by their wrongdoing to the injury of another, the injured party may recover from all of them in a joint action or he may pursue any one of them and recover from him, in which case the latter is not entitled to indemnity from those who with him caused the injury.” Accord: <em>Helz v.
