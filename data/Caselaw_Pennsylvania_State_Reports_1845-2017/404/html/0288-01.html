The complaint avers that the affairs of Trans-United were not being properly managed and that the books were irregular and incomplete. The complaint also states that the plaintiffs-appellees desire to ascertain: (1) salaries paid to officers and directors, (2) the value of corporate shares, and (3) the names of stockholders and the extent of their holdings, and it is concluded by an assertion that if the books of the corporation reveal irregularities and mismanagement the plaintiffs will either file a bill in equity to appoint a receiver or solicit proxies to effectuate a change in management.</p>

Appellees caused articles ' to be published in leading trade journals implying that Son-Mark was in the process of purchasing control of.Trans-United. Appellees then brought this' action and publicized Trans-United’s refusal to allow inspection of the books as well as the allegations of-mismanagement and the possibility that the proceedings would ultimately lead to a receivership; The lower court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of plaintiff-appellees thus permitting them to examine the books, and Trans-United appealed.</p>

Pa. R. C. P. §§1457, 1091. Therefore, pleadings in mandamus now need only be “concise and summary,” Pa. R. O. P. §1019(a), and matters of intent may be averred generally. Pa. R. C. P. §1019(b). No cases have arisen since 1947 involving the question of sufficiency of a return to a writ of mandamus. There is no doubt, however, that the allegations contained in Trans-United’s answer fulfill these requirements of the new rules of pleading in mandamus actions.</p>

If the right to obtain a list of stockholders is not granted liberally by the courts, the corporation, by such simple dilatory tactics as filing an answer and submitting the case to a trial of fact, can delay the stockholder’s procurement of the list beyond the date of the stockholders meeting. Consequently, the courts of this Commonwealth have closely scrutinized any and all answers to a complaint in mandamus when the information sought by the stockholders is restricted to a list of the names and addresses of the other stockholders.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
