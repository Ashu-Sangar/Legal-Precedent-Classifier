On the date of his death, there was on deposit in the Allegheny Trust Company of Pittsburgh the sum of $18,325.09 in a joint checking account in the names of the decedent and his daughter-in-law, Sheila P. Eogan. Within a matter of days following his death, Sheila P. Eogan withdrew the entire sum from the bank.

Eogan and her husband, to show cause why the money should not be turned over to the estate. Sheila Eogan claimed ownership of the money by reason of á gift inter vivos. After issue framed, a jury trial ensued. Upon the completion of the testimony offered by the executor of the estate, the trial judge ruled that the evidence established a prima facie gift of the funds in favor of Sheila P.

If a valid gift were established, not only would the alleged donee be entitled to the money, but the bank might well be saved from an embarrassing situation.

Bogan, as the case then stood, the question of whether or not a gift inter vivos had been established was a question for the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The existence of the signature cards in the custody of the bank establishing the joint account, while prima facie evidence of a gift, did not preclude the introduction of other evidence to show no gift was actually intended: <em>Dempsey v.

However, the evidence to rebut the fact that a gift inter vivos was intended and effected must be clear, precise and convincing: <em>Amour Estate, </em>supra. It met this test. Up to this point in the testimony, it <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>had not. been, proven that the decedent had actually signed the cards. Admittedly, the decedent himself had . never personally talked to an officer of the bank in regard to the new joint account, or the transfer of the funds from one account to another. The testimony of Sheila P. Bogan, herself, the alleged donee, given in .response to questions submitted by counsel for the estate negatived the existence of the donative intent necessary to the establishment of a gift inter vivos. She, unequivocally, said that the.joint account was established for the sake of..convenience and <em>that it was the decedent’s intention that she was to. have the money ■upon his death'.. </em>This, in itself, clearly indicated that the decedent, intended .to continue control over, and ownership in, the money until his death. If any gift was proposed, it was upon his death and, as such, was testamentary in character. This is not a gift inter vivos.

The funda<a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>mental reason, underlying these principles, is that if the witness is friendly, or biased, in favor of the examiner, there is no need for suggestive questions and such interrogation may even lead to incorrect answers; however, if the witness is unfriendly to the cause of the examiner, he is not likely to accept or be influenced by the examiner’s suggestions. Leading questions are, therefore, permissible in the latter instance to discredit or test the truthfulness of the direct testimony. See, 3 Wigmore, Evidence, §§773, 915 (3d ed. 1940). However, as stated by Professor Wigmore in the above authority, when the reason for these rules ceases to exist, so do the rules themselves, and if it develops in the trial of a case that the witness is in fact 'biased in favor of the cross-examiner, then leading questions are unfair and should not be permitted.
