The question in this class of cases often depends upon the exact wording of the signature card or agreement, and the disposition of the cases usually is on the basis of whether a gift inter vivos was affected: <em>Furjanick Estate, </em><a href="/pa/375/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="375 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="1244355" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0484-01">375 Pa. 484</a>, 493, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%2085" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="100 A.2d 85">100 A. 2d 85</a>. When a depositor creates a joint savings account with right of survivorship, and a signature card so stating is signed by both parties, a prima facie inter vivos gift to the other party and of the creation of a joint tenliney with right of survivorship is established: <em>Furjanick Estate, </em>supra; <em>Lochinger v.

The signature card recites that the parties applied for “a savings account ... In the joint names of . . . [Berdar and Malutinokl as joint tenants with the right of survivorship and not as tenants in common.*” At the bottom of the signature card explanation of the asterisk (*) is given; “* Joint tenants, with right of survivorship, constitute one member, as a partnership constitutes one member.” <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>Such explanation, patently ambiguous, would seemingly equate a partnership with a joint tenancy.</p>

Nothing on the card indicates or informs the depositors that the funds are to be <em>owned </em>by them jointly, that upon death of either of them the balance of the account will become the <em>absolute property of the survivor, </em>nor is there any stipulation or provision that the agreement is irrevocable except when agreed upon by both parties. As a matter of fact, this signature card simply and solely'sets forth the creation of a joint tenancy with right of survivor-ship<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which fact, as pointed out above, does not bar t^e admissibility of evidence — such as introduced in the case at bar — of acts and conduct on the part of the deceased depositor which reveal, manifest or indicate the depositor’s intention at the time of the creation of the account.</p>

Berdar, 72 years old, until his retirement was a laborer at Homestead Steel Works. Conversant with the Slovakian language, Berdar had great difficulty in understanding or conversing in the English language. With little educational background, he was unable to read or write. To make matters--worse, Berdar was deaf which rendered conversation and understanding in any language more difficult. Berdar’s business transactions were ordinarily carried out with persons who were able to converse in his native tongue.</p>
    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.6",145,[155,1350,1148,430]]]'>Berdar, ill and seeking help, in February 1956 moved into the home of John Palyok, a fellow-emigrant and countryman and, on February 14, 1956, sent for one Smoley, conversant with the Slovakian language, to prepare a will. Under the will as drawn, all Berdar’s estate was left to his wife and other relatives. Although Palyok testified Berdar had executed this will,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the fact of its execution was a matter of dispute.</p>

The record is convincing and clear as to Berdar’s intent in opening this account. Both Palyoks testified that, in creating this account, Berdar did not intend to give Mrs. Palyok a beneficial interest therein but simply did so to facilitate payment of bills, etc., and, in the event of his death, to provide for remittance of the balance of his estate to the legatees set forth in the will prepared by Smoley.</p>

Into — the Malutinok home, — Berdar withdrew the funds from the Berdar-Palyok account ($12,422.92) an&lt;l deposited them in an account reading “Mitro Berdar in trust for Mary Malutinok”, an account which permitted withdrawals only by Berdar. On April 8, 1957, Berdar closed this account and opened the account which is the subject matter of this controversy, depositing therein $12,000. The only withdrawals from this account were by Berdar, and the only deposits were dividend deposits made by the Association.</p>

However, she did not inform him that, if he did so, he would cease to be the sole owner and that, if he pre-deceased Malutinok, she would, be the sole owner. Neither Wingert nor Mrs. Lane read the card to Berdar, ñor did they explain the meaning or implication of the legal terms contained therein to him, because, as Wingert explained: “. . . he wouldn’t have understood, anyway.”</p>
