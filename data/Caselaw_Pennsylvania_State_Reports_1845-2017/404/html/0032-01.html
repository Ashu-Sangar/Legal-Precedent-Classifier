    <p id="b81-4" data-blocks='[["BL_81.8",81,[156,1142,1146,482]]]'>After remand, further hearings were held by the Chancellor who filed supplemental findings of fact, conclusions of law and an adjudication, and entered a decree nisi enjoining erection of the proposed garage. Defendants filed exceptions to this decree and after argument before the Court en banc the exceptions were dismissed and the decree nisi was adopted as the final decree of the Court. From this final decree defendants took this appeal.</p>

Defendants’ home is part of a development of 46 similar houses bounded on the north by Roosevelt Boulevard, on the east by Sandyford Avenue, on the south by Revere Street and on the west by Guilford Street. Each of the 46 two-story one-family houses contains a garage in the rear of the basement as <em>an integral part </em>of the dwelling. Immediately adjoining the houses on the rear are driveways providing ingress and egress for the basement garages. Beyond the driveways, and within the perimeter they form, is a considerable open area, <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>principally improved with lawns, gardens and shrubbery, although some owners have blacktopped their part of the ground, and one has put up a shed which is used as a play house for children.</p>
    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[236,575,1143,423]]]'>The development was laid out, and the houses were built by Max Norman, the common grantor, who in his application for a zoning permit from the City of Philadelphia sought and obtained permission to “erect 46 2 story residences (1 family) with <em>basement </em>garages.” <em>A plot plan was filed with and as part of the application. </em>Pursuant to this application, a zoning permit was issued.</p>
    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[236,1008,1147,752]]]'>There was adequate evidence to prove that (1) each of the 46 dwelling houses constructed upon the tract here involved contained a garage in the basement as an integral part of the house; (2) each of the 46 lots contained an open area at the rear of the house; (3) each of the 46 deeds contained a similar restrictive covenant requiring a basement garage; and (4) the restriction was attached to the plan or map which was a part of the application by the common grantor for a zoning permit which was filed as a public record with the City of Philadelphia. Furthermore, several of plaintiffs’ witnesses testified that the open area in the rear of these lots was an important inducement in their decision to purchase one of these dwelling houses.</p>
