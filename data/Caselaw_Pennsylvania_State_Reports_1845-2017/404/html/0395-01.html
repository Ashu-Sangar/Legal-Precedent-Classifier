The defendants answered asserting that the two farms involved were originally a single unit, subsequently divided and conveyed by the common owner, and that the use of the roadway <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>was by permissive grant and not adverse. At tbe hearing, defendants’ counsel stated, “It is admitted the plaintiffs’ predecessors in title made use of the defendants’ lane and the land between the two farms for a period of more than fifty years.”</p>
    <p id="b445-4" data-blocks='[["BL_445.5",445,[194,635,1148,595]]]'>The chancellor, whose findings of fact and conclusions of law were affirmed by the court en banc, found that the roadway had been used by the plaintiffs and their predecessors in title, and by the public generally, for upwards of fifty years; that such use was “adverse, notorious and hostile”; that starting in the year 1959, the defendants had obstructed passage through the lane and prevented the free use thereof by the plaintiffs; and he entered an order directing the defendants to restore the roadway to its original condition and to refrain from obstructing plaintiffs’ free use thereof.</p>
    <p id="b445-5" data-blocks='[["BL_445.6",445,[191,1241,1151,810]]]'>It appears that the entire farm land concerned was at one time owned by Michael Gingrich and his wife. On December 23,1859, they conveyed that portion thereof, which is now the defendants’ farm, to their son, David. On the same day, they conveyed the remaining portion to their son, William. This presently constitutes the plaintiffs’ farm. The deed to David provided, inter alia: “The said David B. Gingrich, his heirs and assigns, shall have the right to water his or their cattle at the creek running through the Plantation sold by said Michael to his son William in the lane . . .” The deed to William provided, inter alia: “Said Michael also reserves the right for his son David, his heirs and assigns, to water their cattle at the creek running through the above land in the lane . . .”</p>

It is argued that the evidence in the case, when considered in connection with the above provision in the deeds, indicates a permissive use of the lane, or road, for a limited purpose; that since both portions <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>of the farm land were conveyed by the common grantors, at or about the same time, that legally it cannot be implied that it was the intention of the grantors to make one portion servient to the other, citing <em>Maioriello v. Arlotta, </em><a href="/pa/364/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="364 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1223520" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0557-01">364 Pa. 557</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.2d%20374" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="73 A.2d 374">73 A. 2d 374</a> (1950). This case is inapposite. If this were an easement created by grant with a specified and limited use, it should be restricted to the use stated: <em>Nallin-Jennings Park Co. v. Sterling, </em><a href="/pa/364/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="364 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="1223490" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0611-01">364 Pa. 611</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.2d%20390" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="73 A.2d 390">73 A. 2d 390</a> (1950). If we were concerned with an easement created by implication by the common owner and grantor of both tracts, the dates of conveyance of the dominant and servient tenements would loom large in importance: <em>Rennyson’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/94/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="94 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="486049" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0147-01">94 Pa. 147</a> (1880). But the facts are not within either scope. The chancellor <em>refused to find that the lane referred to in the deeds was the one in litigation </em>and, further concluded that the defendants failed to establish that the use of the lane in question had its inception in a permissive grant. The evidence certainly justifies these conclusions. As the lower court ruled, this, therefore, is not an easement created by grant or implication, rather is it one arising by prescriptive right or adverse use.</p>
