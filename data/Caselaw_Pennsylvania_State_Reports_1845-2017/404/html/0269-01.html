If the one in possession happens to be a tenant, his landlord may intervene and defend; if he does not choose so to do, and judgment be obtained against the tenant, the landlord cannot then intervene to prevent the plaintiff in the ejectment from taking possession. The possession of the tenant is the possession of the landlord; therefore the ejectment, whilst it may have no effect in determining the question of title as between the plaintiff and the lessor, does determine the right of possession: Johnson v.

It was contended that, inasmuch as the tenant’s right to possession arose by virtue of a lease from the State of Nebraska, suit against the tenant was, in effect, a suit against the State which could not be maintained without the State’s consent. Answering this contention, the Court said (21 N.W. 2d p. 67) : “It follows that the State of Nebraska, the landlord of the defendant, is not an indispensable party to this possessory action against the defendant, and we entertain the view that if the State is not an indispensable party to such an action, it cannot be said that the action is against the State, even though it be consequently affected by the eviction of its tenant.” We approve of the language, logic and result of this decision.</p>

      <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>The Commonwealth argues that the Act of 1953<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> controls this situation. In pertinent part that statute provides: “The Board of Property shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine cases involving the title to land or interest therein brought by persons who claim an interest in the title to lands occupied or claimed by the Commonwealth”. In our view this statute is inapplicable to the instant situation. In the first place, assuming, arguendo, the 1953 statute is a consent-to-be sued statute enacted by virtue of Article I, §11 of the Constitution, such statute only applies in the event suit is brought, or must be brought, directly against the Commonwealth in which event the Board is given jurisdiction and cannot apply to a situation, such as presently presented, where the action was not brought, nor required to be brought, against the Commonwealth and where maintenance of the action does not require the consent of the Commonwealth. In the second place, neither the historical background of the Board nor the language of the 1953 statute supports, the Commission’s argument that the 1953 statute presently controls. Historically, the Board, prior to the 1953 statute, was limited in its jurisdiction to causes arising out of the operation of the Land Office, i.e., where there were adverse claimants of title to land originally granted by warrants or patents by the Commonwealth. See: Jones, Land Office Titles in Pennsylvania, Chapters II, X, XII (1850). Such limitation of the Board’s jurisdiction is clearly enunciated in the Act of 1929, supra. The language of the 1953 amendment to section 1207 of the 1929 statute demonstrates that, while the amendment purports to enlarge or extend the Board’s jurisdiction to cases wherein the <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>Commonwealth is a claimant, the Board’s jurisdiction is not extended and enlarged to <em>all </em>cases which may arise but only such cases where the claims arose out of the operation of the Land Office. Moreover, even assuming, arguendo, the 1953 amendment conferred jurisdiction of the Board to eases not arising out of the operation of the Land Office, there is nothing in the 1953 amendment granting the Board <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction. The statute states the Board “shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine cases” not that the Board shall have <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction nor even jurisdiction to hear <em>all </em>cases. If the Commission’s construction of this statute were correct a radical, novel and unusual change would be effected. However, neither the language of the statute nor the historical background of the Board and its power supports such construction of the statute.</p>

This does not mean, nor is it meant to infer, that the Commonwealth may be sued in an action of ejectment in any county court of common pleas. The Commonwealth is clothed with sovereign immunity to such actions and, in the absence of its consent to the suit or a waiver of that immunity, common pleas courts have no jurisdiction over the person of the Commonwealth. The Clearfield County court does have jurisdiction over the subject matter of this ejectment action and over the person of the Gas Corp., the tenant of the Game Commission. The order of the court overruling the Commission’s objection to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter and the person of the Gas Corp. was proper and correct.</p>

This statutory authority to intervene also confers upon the Commonwealth the power to waive its sovereign immunity by intervening in any action and participating thereafter as other parties litigant. The Act specifies both the type of action and the manner in which the Commonwealth may waive its immunity. If the Act were construed otherwise, i.e., — that the Commonwealth could intervene and participate in the action and yet retain its immunity and avoid any adverse determination in the action, — such construction would completely disregard the mandate that it participate “as other parties litigant”. The Act gives the Commonwealth the right to intervene generally and, in doing so, to waive its sovereign immunity. There is nothing unconstitutional in this construction; in fact, it is entirely consistent with the mandate of Article I, §11 of the Constitution.</p>
