With divorce brewing between them, he had promised to pay her $8000 for her interest in the land. Its value was $14,500, and the defendants bound themselves to pay an $8000 mortgage. Two years later they sold part of the land to some people named Stong for $6500. The court below considered the proceeds of $6500 as an effective setoff against the $6816.79 which they had paid plaintiff to buy off Jane, but we see no necessary connection between the two facts. The amounts are <em>deceptively but not legally </em>close, and there is no evidence that either side has offered to make <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>the other whole. The deal was not, therefore, the usual one of a transfer of property against a promise of support and an ultimate failure of consideration when the promise was broken. This ivas a sale for a substantial cash consideration, plus the promise of support, and when the promise was broken there could be no more than a partial failure of consideration which may be redressed by an action for damages but not by a transfer back of the real estate.</p>
    <p id="b553-4" data-blocks='[["BL_553.5",553,[161,855,1149,487]]]'>From other jurisdictions there are two cases in point from New Jersey: <em>Butterhof v. Butterhof, </em><a href="/njl/84/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="84 N.J.L. 285" data-case-ids="219781" data-case-paths="/njl/84/0285-01">84 N.J.L. 285</a> (1913), <a href="/citations/?q=86%20A.%20394" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="86 A. 394">86 A. 394</a>, and <em>Dunn v. Ryan, </em><a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.%201025" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="88 A. 1025">88 A. 1025</a> (N.J. 1913). In both cases there was a promise of support and a cash payment for the land. The New Jersey court held that the breach of the promise to support did not render the fee conditional or base, refused rescission and restitution, and left the grantor to his action at law for damages.</p>
    <p id="b553-5" data-blocks='[["BL_553.6",553,[152,1352,1157,1030]],["BL_554.1",554,[242,346,1143,153]]]'>Appellant argues that a reconveyance may be ordered upon either a partial or total failure of consideration, citing <em>Ziegenfuss v. Ziegenfuss, </em><a href="/pa-super/160/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="160 Pa. Super. 374" data-case-ids="459343" data-case-paths="/pa-super/160/0374-01">160 Pa. Superior Ct. 374</a> (1947), <a href="/citations/?q=51%20A.2d%20508" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="51 A.2d 508">51 A. 2d 508</a>. The argument is that even if there was a cash consideration as well as a promise to support, a breach of the promise to support is a partial failure of consideration that justifies rescission. This is ingenious but erroneous. The two elements of consideration are different; the cash payment was an executed contract, the promise to support is continuing and executory. Furthermore, where there is a promise to support there are myriad services contemplated, such as providing food and shelter and warmth and clothing and light: if none of these is provided the failure of consideration is total, but if less than all are neglected, the failure is partial. In <em>Borys v. Halko, </em>supra (<a href="/pa-super/124/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="124 Pa. Super. 418" data-case-ids="993925" data-case-paths="/pa-super/124/0418-01">124 Pa. Superior Ct. 418</a>), quoted by us in <em>Shook v. Bergstrasser, </em>supra (<a href="/pa/356/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="356 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="470714" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0167-01">356 Pa. 167</a>), the Superior Court said: “The court prefers to treat deeds having such a con<a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>sideration in the nature of an executory contract. The burden is on the grantee to show full performance of his agreement to care for the grantor.”</p>
