Then contestant (present appellant), by calling Attorney Wentz and his secretary as witnesses, proved that, after the will was executed by decedent and witnessed by Attorney Wentz and his secretary on June 29, 1956, the will was placed in decedent’s possession, decedent stating she was going to place it in her safe deposit box that same day.

Each hearing, in many instances, involved identical testimony, each hearing involved considerable time and expense to the litigants and each hearing created additional delay in reaching a final result. Too often justice delayed became justice denied in this type litigation and expense and delay rendered prohibitive such contests, particularly in small estates.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> To remedy this situation, the legislature by the addition of the last sentence of Section 744 authorized a court to <em>impanel </em>a jury at <em>any </em>stage of the proceedings. Such a jury acts in a “stand-by” capacity: if the court, after hearing the testimony in the presence of the impanelled jury, determines as a matter of law that the dispute of fact as to the validity of the will is not substantial, then the court will refuse to permit the jury to pass on the dispute:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> on the other hand, if the court determines the dispute is substantial, it will permit the jury to determine the dispute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Furthermore, under the authority granted the court, the court need not wait until <em>all </em>the testimony is heard: if the court is of the opinion that on the testimony heard, even though incomplete, a substantial dispute of fact has arisen, the court may then grant a jury trial. The court is given wide latitude in determining <em>when </em>to <em>impanel </em>a jury. Section 744 does not, however, determine the <em>right </em>of the court to <em>grant </em>a jury trial. The court below erred in its reliance upon the last sentence <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>of Section 744 as authority for it to <em>grant </em>a jury trial; that portion of Section 744 was simply intended to authorize the impanelling of a jury to be available <em>if the grant of a jury trial became justified.</em>
