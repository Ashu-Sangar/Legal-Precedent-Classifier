A deficiency assessment for Mercantile License taxes for the years 1954 through 1958 or 1959 was made against each appellee by the Treasurer of the School District.

The question in the last analysis is we repeat whether a natural gas company in its sale of natural gas is a vendor or dealer in goods, wares and merchandise within the meaning of the Act.</p>

The essence of appellee’s argument is that goods, wares and merchandise by common meaning and usage refers to and is something tangible, and is inseparably connected with merchants and merchandising. The appellant gives a broader construction to the Act and particularly to the words “goods, wares and merchandise”, and contends that the legislature intended , to include all vendors and dealers who were not expressly exempt by the Act.</p>

A public utility company, by definition in the Public Utility Code, renders its buyers or customers a service — it does not sell or deal in goods, wares and merchandise. The word “mercantile” as defined in Webster’s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, means “Of or pertaining to merchants, or the business of merchants; characteristic of, or befitting, a merchant; having to do with, or engaged in, trade.” “Goods” are defined as “Wares; merchandise”. “Wares” is defined as “Articles of merchandise; . . . goods, commodities; merchandise.” “Merchandise” is defined as “The objects of commerce; whatever is usually bought or sold in trade; wares; goods.” Plainly none of those definitions describes an invisible, volatile, ephemeral, fugacious gas. We repeat, goods, wares or merchandise according to their common popular meaning denote tangibles not intangibles like “natural gas”.</p>

We disagree with this contention. More accurately stated, the question is whether vendors and dealers <em>in natural gas </em>are clearly included in the Mercantile License Act as vendors and dealers in goods, wares and merchandise, and the burden of proof to show that they are so included is on the School District. We are convinced that the sellers of natural gas do not fall or come within the Mercantile License Tax Act in their sales of this intangible and invisible commodity.</p>

Water is both tangible and visible, but the local water company is not on that account a vendor or dealer in goods, wares, and merchandise. The real reason for the distinction is that government has decided to control, otherwise than by taxation on sales, what are known as the public utilities: gas, oil, water, and electricity, the rates for which are fixed by a public body with regard to the public’s rights and welfare. It is an altogether different conception of regulating an activity in which the factor of competition is minimal.</p>

The tax is neither a regulatory device, nor is it unique in the field of taxation — it is simply an ordinary revenue measure. As a tax upon all vendors and dealers in goods, wares and merchandise, it should be imposed upon all such vendors and dealers, including utilities, unless they are specifically exempted by legislative enactment. It might be that the failure to exempt utilities was an oversight. If so, it should be corrected by the legislature — not the court acting as such.</p>
