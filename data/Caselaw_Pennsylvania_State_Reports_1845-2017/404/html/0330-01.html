Even more importantly, Rule 4011 provides: “No discovery or inspection shall be permitted which (a) is sought in bad faith; (b) causes unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, expense or oppression to the deponent or any person or party; . . .” Although this Rule has never been judicially interpreted in this connection, we agree with the text-writers<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">**</a> that discovery which would reveal confidential information or trade secrets to a competitor, as in this case, should not be allowed.</p>

The fact of petitioner being a stockholder in a rival concern and that he may thereby gain some advantage by an inspection of the books of the defendant company, does not necessarily shoAV an improper purpose in making demand for inspection, and will not deprive him as a stockholder of his right of investigation into the management of the affairs of the company.’ In the case at bar there is simply an averment, on belief, that the relator desires the information to use it for the advantage of a competing company.
