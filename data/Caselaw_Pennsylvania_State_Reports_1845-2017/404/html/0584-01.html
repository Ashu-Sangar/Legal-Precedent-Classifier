On May 26, 1950, the Committee on Offenses of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County lodged with him a written complaint charging him with “professional misconduct.” As a result of hearings on the complaint, held by a Subcommittee of the Committee on Offenses, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County ten years later (viz., on May 10, 1960) entered an order disbarring Schlesinger on the basis of the <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>report and recommendation of the Committee on Offenses. The principal charge against the respondent was that he had violated his oath as an. attorney by being a member of the Communist Party. No charge was made nor proof adduced that he had ever been guilty of unprofessional conduct in his relations with any of his clients or with the courts. Upon his appeal to this court from the order of disbarment, we entered an order on May 23,1960, upon his petition for a supersedeas, suspending the order of disbarment until final disposition of the appeal, which is now before us for that purpose.</p>

Thereafter, the subcommittee recommended that the motion to dismiss be denied and that the respondent be directed to file an answer to the complaint. This recommendation was in due course approved by the Committee. On June 6, 1951, a request for a bill of particulars was filed with the Committee on Offenses by the respondent. This request was denied. The respondent then challenged for cause each and every member of the Committee on Offenses because, inter alia, of their conflicting capacities. This challenge was also denied.</p>

As the allegations of Cvetic in his information against Schlesinger were similar to the charges in the Committee’s complaint against him, the Subcommittee took no action with respect to a hearing on the complaint while Cvetic’s criminal prosecution of the respondent was pending. The criminal proceeding was quashed on December 11, 1951, by three judges of the Court of Common Pleas, sitting en banc, for the stated reasons that “our judicial criminal procedure was ignored if not flaunted,” that “the defendant was denied his state constitutional and statutory rights and protection,” and that “the admitted activities or nonactivities following his arrest denied to the defendant due process of law and equal protection of the law under the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.”</p>

The hearing was still further delayed, however, for about eight months because of the respondent’s unsuccessful attempts to enlist at that time the services of counsel in his behalf. It is a lamentable commentary, but none the less true, that, in the existing frame of the public mind, a lawyer who undertakes voluntarily the legal representation of a person charged with being, or even pointed at (in <em>J’accuse </em>fashion) as, a Communist runs the risk of a disruption of his law practice and the impairment of his own professional reputation.</p>

Since then, the services of these attorneys in their faithful and zealous representation of their client, including their able brief and oral argument in this court, have been in the finest traditions of the profession, e.g., that legal representation shall not <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>be denied anyone called to answer a charge against himself in an American court of justice.</p>

Thereafter, the Subcommittee filed its report finding that the respondent was á member and functionary of the Communist Party and concluded therefrom that he had been guilty of professional misconduct “in that he has violated the oath administered to him at the time of his admission to the Bar.” The Subcommittee accordingly recommended that respondent be disbarred. On April 15, 1957, the Committee on Offenses adopted and filed in the Court of Common Pleas the report and recommendation of the Subcommittee recommending the respondent’s disbarment.</p>

Two and a half years later, viz., May 3, 1960, the court en banc (one member having died in the meantime) filed an opinion dismissing respondent’s exceptions and recommending to the Board of Judges of the Court of Common Pleas (consisting of sixteen members) that the respondent be disbarred, and on May 10, 1960, the Board of Judges adopted the recommendation of the court en banc and entered the order disbarring Schlesinger, which is the subject of the present appeal.</p>

These witnesses were the only persons produced by the Committee to support the charges of the complaint.</p>
    <p id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.6",640,[226,1280,1151,1087]],["BL_641.1",641,[155,260,1147,97]]]'>Subsequent to the hearing, the veracity of one of these witnesses, Joseph Mazzei, was “wholly discredited” by disclosures of the Solicitor General of the United States in connection with a case then pending before the Supreme Court of the United States. See <em>Mesarosh v. United States, </em><a href="/us/352/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="352 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6159061" data-case-paths="/us/352/0001-01">352 U.S. 1</a> (1956). The Subcommittee, in its report, stated that its decision and findings “do not depend upon the testimony of Joseph Mazzei.” But, apparently, the Subcommittee had not entirely disabused its mind of Mazzei’s testimony, for a summarization of it was included in the Subcommittee’s report. However, the brief for the full Committee in this court contains the following confirmatory rejection of Mazzei’s testimony: “before its Report was filed, the Subcommittee had knowledge of the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in the case of Mesarosh, alias Nelson, et al. v. United States, <a href="/us/352/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="352 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6159061" data-case-paths="/us/352/0001-01">352 U.S. 1</a>, (1956), impeaching Mr. Mazzei as a reliable witness and the Subcommittee disregarded the testimony of Mr. Mazzei in arriving at the Findings of Fact contained in its <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>Report (108 P.L.J. 166).” Rightly, therefore, Mazzei’s testimony must be rejected as wholly untrustworthy.</p>
    <p id="b641-5" data-blocks='[["BL_641.5",641,[155,370,1149,318]]]'>The brief for the Committee also concedes that Mrs. Mazzei’s “testimony generally was not significant to the issue in this case”. Consequently, support for the Committee’s charge against respondent is left to rest solely on the testimony of the Committee’s two remaining witnesses, George Dietze and Matt Cvetic.</p>
    <p id="b641-6" data-blocks='[["BL_641.6",641,[154,699,1149,750]]]'>Dietze testified that he was employed by the FBI from January or February of 1940 to March, 1950, and that, pursuant to such employment, he became a member of the Communist Party in March, 1944. At that time he was a piano teacher and, from 1939 to May, 1949, had his place of business at 440 Wood Street, Pittsburgh. He testified on direct examination that various Communist organizations met there on occasion; that he acted as door keeper for such meetings; that the respondent attended about fifteen' meetings of the Tom Paine Club, which Dietze described as a branch of the Communist Party, during the years 1946 to 1948; and that such meetings were closed to persons other than members.</p>

He testified that other groups held meetings at his place of business, including the International Workers’ Organization, the Progressive Party, and the Civil Rights Congress. He conceded that he did not know one group from another or the connection between the persons he admitted and the various groups. He extenuated, — “You see, I might villify myself. You see, I couldn’t ask anybody who of those groups come up, because this was quite a danger— not a danger, but they would get suspicious, what are the interests of yourself in what is going on? You see, after all, the FBI told me, ‘Now, you just let them in <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>and ont and see what you can see.’ ‘After all, we wired your place and we have all the evidence up there, we know what is going on.’ And, for my part, as I said, probably I want to mention this now too, I wasn’t sitting in these meetings either . . At another point in cross-examination by the respondent, Dietze said, “Mr. Schlesinger, I told you lots of organizations came up ... I can’t inquire or ask these people, who are you, what is the name of your organization, and I tried it once, and of course, you know, ‘It’s none of your business’, and so and so on. Since this place was so occupied during the six years on 440 Wood Street I certainly could not put my nose into each individual group and ask questions, so and so on. And so I just looked at it, because, after all, the FBI know it, they know that.” Dietze further testified that he did not know what took place at the meetings which he said the respondent attended, that he, himself, never attended any such meetings, that he did not know whether the respondent held any position or office in the Communist Party, and that he never discussed Communist matters with him. By the time Dietze concluded his testimony, very little, if anything, of probative value was left.</p>

He testified that he was employed by the FBI from the spring of 1941 to February, 1950, and that, pursuant to such employment, he became a member of the Communist Party in February, 1943, and was assigned to the Tom Paine branch of the Party, He testified he attended many meetings of Communist groups with the respondent. Most of these meetings concerned the Civil Rights Congress which Cvetic described as “a legal arm of the Communist Party.” In answer to a question from the Subcommittee, Cvetic admitted that the Civil Rights Congress included many persons who were not Communists and, on cross-examination, admitted that a number of the Congress’s prin<a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>cipal officers were not Communists. He testified that the principal activity of the Civil Rights Congress was to supply defense counsel in cases involving members of the Communist Party and other minority groups.</p>
    <p id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[161,576,1152,917]]]'>Schlesinger was charged, as already stated, with being a “functionary” of the Communist party. In support of the charge, the Subcommittee permitted Cvetic to define the word “functionary” and then to give his opinion that the respondent came within Cvetic’s personal definition. Having stated that “[a] Party functionary is one who is active in a certain phase of Communist activity,” Cvetic then testified that “Mr. Schlesinger was a member of the Legal Commission of the Communist Party, he would be a Communist Party functionary, one who is functioning in this capacity.” Thus, the respondent was charged with an activity not defined until the hearing thereon when the Committee permitted it to be defined by the witness called to testify to the charge against the respondent. Cvetic also testified that he collected respondent’s Communist Party dues on several occasions.</p>
    <p id="b643-6" data-blocks='[["BL_643.6",643,[158,1512,1151,484]]]'>The respondent sought to cross-examine Cvetic in order to show his bias, prejudice, interest and general antagonism toward the respondent and also to lay the groundwork for impeaching the witness’ credibility in various particulars, especially in his self-contradictory statements.

In such a procedure, so contrary to traditional American juridical concepts, unfairness was, ipso facto, inherent; it was fraught with the possibility of temptation to each member of the trial tribunal to favor, consciously or unconsciously, the prosecuting body which appointed him and of which he was a member. The record as a whole contains a reasonable basis for doubt as to whether impartiality on the part of the members of the tribunal was completely absent and suggests an unsympathetic predisposition toward the appellant. Moreover, a predilection to favor one side over the other is not required in order to vitiate a judical proceeding as being violative of due process. Merely, “a possible temptation to the average man as a judge . . . not to hold the balance nice, clear and true” is sufficient. Such “a possible temptation” was implicit in the proceeding before the prosecutor’s own Subcommittee which resulted in appellant’s disbarment.</p>

The Committee then referred the proceeding for hearing and report to a sub-committee which consisted of three of the members of the same Committee which had initiated the charges. The Committee, in the role of prosecutor, examined and paid the witnesses against Schlesinger, sought to limit Schlesinger’s cross-examination of its own witnesses and the scope of Schlesinger’s rebuttal and impeachment evidence and vigorously prosecuted the charges against Schlesinger. Acting through the sub-committee and in a judicial capacity, the Committee presided over the hearing on the charges which it had initiated, determined the burden of proof which the prosecution had to meet, ruled on matters of evidence, and, finally, determined the law applicable to the evidence adduced.

The Committee appointed a subcommittee which held hearings and took testimony. Four witnesses testified in support of the complaint; the Committee relied only on the testimony given by Matthew Cvetic and George E. Dietze. Cvetic served with the FBI from the Spring of 1941 to February, 1950. During these nine years he met with Communists, dealt with them and learned the workings of their organization. After becoming a member of the Communist Party (upon orders of the FBI) he served on numerous committees of the Party, and engaged in almost every type of activity to which the Party had committed itself in the Pittsburgh area. During the period he was with the Communist Party he attended about 4000 meetings with his Communist comrades.

The majority Opinion says that Schlesinger should have been permitted to cross-examine Cvetic on the subject of whether he was an alcoholic. But this argument completely overlooks the all-important fact that Cvetic was on the witness stand for four days and the fact-finders thus had ample opportunity to judge his credibility and the weight to be given his testimony. They found Cvetic’s testimony credible and trustworthy.. In addition, there is no evidence in the record that Cvetic’s testimony was affected, tainted, or remotely influenced by any suggestion of alcoholism. Moreover, the fact that one might be addicted to drink or alcoholism does not in itself indicate that he may not be as truthful, accurate, and reliable as one not so addicted. In any event, the cross-examination which Schlesinger desired dealt with collateral matters and it is hornbook law that the latitude of cross-examination is a matter of discretion for the fact-finders or lower Court, and it is clear that there was no palpable abuse of discretion in sustaining objections to certain questions propounded by Schlesinger.

Especially in large cities where Court congestion and the colossal backlog of Court cases is worrying everyone, a similar practice is indulged in by custom and indeed by necessity in divorce cases and in other cases where a Courif does not personally see the witnesses or actually try the case, but the matter is referred to a master or referee or auditor, etc. Furthermore, and even more important, The Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, and the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board act exactly the way that the <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>Committee on Offenses did in the instant case.

Fortunately for the welfare of our Country, the Supreme Court of the United States — carrying out the heartfelt wishes of the people as well as the will of State Legislatures and of Congress — has recently and flatly rejected such contentions. Commencing in 1933, when President Roosevelt recognized Communist Russia and proclaimed it to be more Democratic than our Democracy (ours is actually a Republican form of Government although our system and way of life is democratic), many of our highest public officials, many members of the State Department, many diplomats, many so-called intellectuals, and many union labor leaders, were completely fooled and bamboozled as to the real nature and meaning and the real goals and menace of Communism.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_7" id="ref_footnote_4_7">*</a> It is astonishing to me and one of the numerous things in today’s world which to me is incomprehensible, that a few leading <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>Americans including experienced Judges and wishful-thinking diplomats are still completely fooled as to the real nature, purposes, aims, objectives and goals of Communism. Possibly this is because of the yearning of millions of Americans for Peace at any price, and their consequent swallowing hook, line and sinker of the specious pious pleas for peaceful coexistence and other deceitful phrases and artifices employed by Russia’s leaders. Communism, by its teachings, and even more <em>strikingly </em>by its acts and deeds, is the mortal enemy of our Country. The Bible teaches us “By their fruits ye shall know them”. Today we sometimes express the Same thought “actions speak louder than words.” Applying this or any other realistic standard, it is clear as the noonday sun in summer, it is clear beyond the shadow or possibility of a doubt that Marx’s Communism, as interpreted, promulgated and <em>practiced </em>by Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev and Company, advocates, plans and constantly plots (1) to establish a Communist Dominion of the World under a despotic Russian Dictator with puppet dictators in every satellite country (allegedly by and for the proletariat); and (2) the overthrow and capture of every Government and every Country in the World by force, violence, subversion, sabotage, strikes, insurrections, revolution and, whenever necessary, war; and (3) <em>the Enslavement </em>of all peoples throughout the Globe under the tyrannical, terroristic, ruthless rule of an atheistic Communist Tyrant; and (4) the destruction of religion — all of this for the pretended benefit of (a tiny percentage of) the proletariat known as Communists, and hypocritically called “The State”. You don’t have to study Marx’s or Lenin’s* or Stalin’s books to. realize' this. Anyone who <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>has the slightest doubt of this after Russia’s rape of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland and Czechoslovakia, and the enslavement of the Baltic peoples and the Slavs and the East Germans and other satellite nations, and Russia’s merciless, treacherous destruction and butchery of Hungary’s patriots, must be totally ignorant of world affairs or unbelievably naive and gullible.</p>
