Defendants then filed a petition for a rule to show cause why the preliminary objections should not <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>be amended.

D. &amp; C. 2d 233</a> (1956), argues that preliminary objections cannot be amended after argument and decision of the court and therefore defendants’ failure to appeal the order of March 23, 1959 within fifteen days pursuant to the Act of March 5, 1925, P.L. 23, §3, 12 PS §674, subjected the defendants to the jurisdiction of the court. The plaintiff has correctly stated a general rule of law but that rule is inapplicable to this case since the court below, in its order of March 23, 1959, did not render a decision on the merits of the preliminary objections but simply ruled that the form of the pleadings was incorrect. The case at bar is therefore readily distinguishable from <em>Pennsylvania Coal Company v. Luzerne County, </em><a href="/pa/390/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="390 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1275687" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0143-01">390 Pa. 143</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.2d%20657" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="134 A.2d 657">134 A. 2d 657</a> (1957), and <em>Busillo v.

      <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>Tims we reach the merits of this appeal. Defendant Price contends that the service upon him in New York was improper and that he is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court. Service upon a party may be made extra-territorially pursuant to Pa. R.C.P. 1504(b) if a principal defendant has been served within the county in which the action is commenced or if the subject matter of the action is property within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[218,844,1151,807]]]'>The court below ruled defendant Pennsylvania Paper Corporation was such a “principal defendant” and, under that finding, extra-territorial service on Price would be permissible. A principal defendant is one who has an interest in the controversy presented by the complaint and whose presence is requisite to the complete or partial adjudication of the controversy. <em>Lower Merion Township v. 34 Derwen Road, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/362/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="362 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="477307" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0149-01">362 Pa. 149</a>, 151, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%20293" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="66 A.2d 293">66 A. 2d 293</a> (1949). The lower court, in order to support its finding that the defendant corporation was a principal defendant, ruled that the plaintiff had alleged a proper cause of action against the defendant corporation on the theory that the defendant corporation breached its duty to protect its stockholder from an unauthorized transfer of shares.</p>

A corporation also owes its shareholders a duty to protect them from unauthorized transfers. See 12 Fletcher, Cyclopedia Corporations, Section 5537.1 (rev. vol. 1957). This court impliedly recognized such a duty where a corporation had been informed in advance of conflicting claims to the stock in question. <em>Leff v. N. Kaufman’s, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/342/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="342 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1206971" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0342-01">342 Pa. 342</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20A.2d%20786" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="20 A.2d 786">20 A. <em>2d </em>786</a> (1941). We need not now decide if this duty extends <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>beyond cases involving forgeries or notice to the corporation of irregularities, since here a wholly owned subsidiary relied upon a general power of attorney given to an agent by the parent corporation’s sole shareholder. There can be no greater justification for a finding that the agent was clothed, at least, with apparent authority, thus effectuating an estoppel against the principal (plaintiff corporation).
