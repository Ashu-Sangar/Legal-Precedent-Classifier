Nelson and Doris J. Rago as additional defendant for the damage to Rago\u2019s automobile. That part of the Superior Court\u2019s order is affirmed. Otherwise it is reversed and a new trial generally is ordered for all parties and all actions involved.\nMr. Justice Bell dissents, and would affirm the orders of the Superior Court.",
