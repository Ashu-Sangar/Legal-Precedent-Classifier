        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS, Justice.\nAppellant raises two issues for our review: (1) whether he was deprived of a speedy trial guaranteed by Pa.R. Crim.P. 1100 as well as by constitutional requirements; and (2) whether the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a weapon recovered from his coat pocket.\nAppellant and a confederate were arrested on January 4, 1985, and charged with the pistol-beating robbery of $200.00 from a garage attendant. Appellant Smith was tried by a jury on July 16, 1986, and a verdict of guilty was returned on each of the charges of robbery, possession of instruments of crime, and criminal conspiracy. He was sentenced to prison for concurrent terms of twenty-eight months to fifty-six months each for robbery and possession of instruments of crime. An additional three years probation (consecutive) was imposed for criminal conspiracy. Appellant also was directed to receive psychiatric treatment for alcoholism and related problems tied to his record of violent crimes.\nA. Speedy Trial Issue\nThe first issue to be considered is whether the judicial delay of 555 days between his arrest and trial constitutes a violation of his speedy trial rights. At all times, it should be emphasized, the delays in this case were caused by back-logged, individualized court calendars. Appellant specifically urges us to find that the length of the delay is itself improper and is exacerbated further by his allegation that his case could have been assigned to other, less-occupied jurists for earlier trial, thereby making the delay even more indefensible under the law.\nThe mechanical run date for trial was July 1, 1985. Following his arrest, however, there were two brief delays prior to the preliminary hearing on March 15, 1985. The case was assigned to Judge Eugene H. Clark who, on April 11, 1985, determined that because of the unavailability of a defense counsel until June 3, 1985, the case would be put in his ready pool for trial on that date. When it became apparent that Judge Clark\u2019s docket was overcrowded and would prevent the case from being heard on June 3, 1985, the Commonwealth filed a timely and successful motion to extend.\nOn December 18, 1985, Appellant filed a Petition for Habeas Corpus, alleging a violation of his speedy trial rights. An evidentiary hearing then was held on January 17, 1986, before Judge William J. Mazzola who denied the petition after deciding that the failure to try the case was excusable because of the backlog of Judge Clarke\u2019s caseload. Judge Mazzola also established that the case likely would be heard in the period May-July, 1986. The case then was reassigned to Judge Moss.\nAlthough Judge Moss held a pre-trial conference on May 23, 1986, she listed the case for June 18, 1986, her earliest open date. On that date, nevertheless, the judge\u2019s calendar once again forced a continuance of the trial until July 14, 1986, when a suppression hearing finally was held, and once again Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss on Rule 1100 grounds was denied. Trial began on July 16, 1986. There is no dispute on the record that the Commonwealth filed timely motions to continue at each required point in this case.\nHere the Commonwealth was duly diligent in its own efforts, but the delay was beyond its control. Our review, therefore, concentrates on the question of whether the trial court violated Appellant\u2019s speedy trial rights.\nRule 1100 was adopted by us in Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 449 Pa. 297, 297 A.2d 127 (1972), pursuant to our supervisory powers. According to Hamilton, the rule is intended to reduce the backlog of cases awaiting trial and to \u201cformulate a rule of criminal procedure fixing a maximum time limit\u201d to bring an accused to trial. Id., 449 Pa. at 308, 297 A.2d at 133. Hamilton thereby explicitly incorporated the \u201cfixed time\u201d proviso of Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101, 116 (1972). The mandatory time requirement was designed to encourage both the prosecution and the judiciary to act promptly in criminal cases and to establish an objective time limit for their guidance.\nThe apparent simplicity of a 180-day rule, nevertheless, has been belied over the years by repeated efforts on the part of our judiciary to define with any precision just how long is too long and which factors count in tolling the legal odometer. In the case at bar, we are asked by the Appellant to find that the trial court failed to reassign the case in a speedy manner but rather adhered to an excessive degree to a rigid, backlogged, individualized calendar system.\nWe are being asked to find, furthermore, that lengthy delays beyond the prescribed period which are caused by court congestion violate the provisions of the speedy trial rule. In support of his contention, Appellant points to the fact that following administrative assignment of his case to Judge Moss, he was tried promptly. His obvious point is that the reassignment should have occurred early enough to satisfy the rule and that such a lengthy delay as did occur cannot be justified.\nThe rule in this Commonwealth, which we are being urged to overturn, is that our courts are under no obligation to rearrange their dockets in such circumstances. Our seminal case on this subject is Commonwealth v. Mayfield, 469 Pa. 214, 364 A.2d 1345 (1976), which was based both on Hamilton and Barker v. Wingo. Adopting first the A.B.A. recommendation that calendaring of cases lies within the power and responsibility of the trial court, the Mayfield court rejected the Superior Court\u2019s decision that any judicial delay was per se error:\nThe Superior Court, concluding that rule 1100 was intended to promote prompt action by the courts as well as by the prosecution, held that delays attributable to court administration could never justify an extension under rule 1100(c). The rule, however, was not intended to create such an inflexible result. This Court is aware that, despite diligent efforts by the trial courts, cases may arise when a trial of a defendant cannot be held within the prescribed period. In such circumstances, the policies which prompted the adoption of rule 1100 would not be served by disallowing a reasonable, limited exception specifying \u201cthe date or period within which trial shall be commenced.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(c). The rule recognizes that \u201cdue diligence\u201d is the most that should be demanded from the prosecutor and that if despite such efforts, he cannot prepare for trial within the prescribed period, an extension is permissible. No more rigid result under our present rule is justified when the inability of a trial court to proceed within the prescribed period is at issue.\n469 Pa. at 220, 364 A.2d 1345.\nCommonwealth v. Crowley, 502 Pa. 393, 466 A.2d 1009 (1983), later also construed Mayfield as not requiring an exhaustion of \u201cthe possibility of rearranging overcrowded dockets to accommodate Rule 1100 run dates.\u201d Moreover, although a court must cite the reasons for its delay, the majority concluded that:\nA rigid requirement that the Courts of Common Pleas, particularly in urban areas with severely crowded criminal and civil dockets, must continually arrange and rearrange their schedules to accommodate the 180 day rule, would be ill-advised.\nIt may be possible, in an abstract sense, to arrange a crowded court calendar to insure that every criminal defendant is tried within 180 days. However, such a rigid system requires eliminating a realistic mechanism for scheduling civil cases, or giving weight to those who await trial in prison for lack of bail.\nId., 502 Pa. at 400-401, 466 A.2d 1009.\nAny per se rule:\nIgnores the realities of crowded criminal and civil dockets which overburdened Common Pleas courts must deal with on a day-to-day basis. Rule 1100 was designed to promote the administration of criminal justice within the context of our entire judicial system, not to render that system hostage to its own closed logic. The goals of efficiency and ease of administration which Rule 1100 serves are worthy; they should not be exalted at the expense of justice. Thus, in interpreting our Rule 1100, we must throw away the stopwatch and pick up the scales of justice. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Blady, 492 Pa. 285, 424 A.2d 864 (1980) (dissenting opinion, Larsen, J., in which Flaherty, J. joined).\nRule 1100 should not be construed to require Common Pleas Courts with backlogged criminal dockets to devote all their administrative and judicial resources to guarantee that every defendant is tried within the period prescribed by the Rule. It should be sufficient for the court to establish that it has devoted a reasonable amount of its resources to the criminal docket and that it scheduled the criminal trial at the earliest possible date consistent with the court\u2019s business. (Citations omitted).\nId., 502 Pa. at 402-408, 466 A.2d 1009.\nIn Commonwealth v. Terfinko, 504 Pa. 385, 474 A.2d 275 (1984), we reached a similar determination by following th\u00e9se precedents. As noted, we have rejected all suggestions that under our law the trial court must demonstrate that another judge could not have heard the case before the run date.\nIn addition to asserting that the Commonwealth did not comply with Rule 1100, Appellant also alleges that the length and reasons for his pre-trial delay and ensuing prejudice violated his speedy trial rights under Article I, section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Such an inquiry is necessary because although Rule 1100 was designed to implement the right to a speedy trial as required by Hamilton, constitutional guarantees under Barker continue to provide a separate basis for asserting a claim of undue delay. Jones v. Commonwealth, 495 Pa. 490, 499, 434 A.2d 1197, 1201 (1981).\nIn determining whether the right to a speedy trial has been violated, Barker v. Wingo demands that the conduct of both sides in a criminal trial must be balanced in light of four factors: the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. No one factor is dispositive and \u201ccourts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process.\u201d Id., 407 U.S. at 532, 533, 92 S.Ct. at 2192, 2193, 33 L.Ed.2d at 117, 118. The length of delay constitutes a \u201ctriggering mechanism,\u201d but unless the delay \u201cis presumptively prejudicial there is no necessity for inquiry into other factors that go into the balance.\u201d Moreover, the reasons used to justify the delay play a critical role in the balancing test, and \u201covercrowded courts should weigh less heavily\u201d against the prosecution. Id., at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d at 117. Finally, there must be an accounting given for the prejudice which accrues to the defendant because of the delay.\nHere the delay of one and one-half years was caused by choked trial dockets. The length of the delay itself, of course, is not dispositive. In Barker v. Wingo, a five-year delay did not result in dismissal of the complaint. In Commonwealth v. Ware, 459 Pa. 334, 329 A.2d 258 (1974), we justified twenty-six months of \u201cunexplained and unexcused\u201d delay. Also see, Commonwealth v. Glover, 500 Pa. 524, 458 A.2d 935 (1983) (four year delay); and Commonwealth v. Cooley, 484 Pa. 14, 398 A.2d 637 (1979) (delay of three and one-half years). As to the specific reason for the delay, we concluded on point in 1981 in Jones v. Commonwealth, that \u201cthe delay lasted two and one-half years was ... simply an unfortunate consequence of backlogs in the judicial system.\u201d 495 Pa. at 497, 434 A.2d 1197. Balancing the length of delay in the instant case with the reasons for it does not provoke us at this time into changing our rules.\nAppellant Smith argues further that he was prejudiced because an alibi witness (his sister) could not recall on cross-examination what food and medicine she had served him on the night of the robbery (T.T., 7/17/86, p. 21). He also complains about the alleged general lack of detail and consistency in her testimony (T.T., 7/17/86, pp. 5-9), all of which could have been due to a loss of memory caused by the passage of time. As we stated in Glover, prejudice arising from an impairment of the defense surely is the most serious of the Barker v. Wingo factors, since it directly affects the fairness of the trial.\nAppellant now contends in this vein that his sister\u2019s inability to remember such details as the type of food served or aspirin given to him for a pulled tooth rendered her alibi statement less credible, leading to prejudice. We find that line of defense implausible and agree with the reasoning of the Superior Court: these matters were not crucial to the jury\u2019s determination of whether her brother was at home on the night of the crime. Her admission of a lack of memory as to those details is neither unusual nor does it vitiate the fact that she emphatically did remember his presence. There is no clear evidence of prejudice to the Appellant on this record.\nB. Suppression of the Gun\nAppellant\u2019s second claim of error is that the weapon introduced at trial was seized without a proper warrant and was not in plain view of the officers who were seeking to arrest him in his sister\u2019s home.\nAppellant frames the question, in two parts, as follows: The relevant facts indicate that an arrest warrant was issued commanding that Appellant be taken into custody if he be found in the Commonwealth. The police went to the sister\u2019s home, where Appellant resided, at 7:00 a.m., in order to intercept him before he went off to work. The sister admitted the police into her home and told them that Appellant had gone to work. Disbelieving her, the officers decided to search the house. One detective proceeded to steps leading to the basement, and there he brushed up against several coats hanging in the stairwell. The coats fell to the steps. As the officer returned up the stairs from the basement, he picked up the coats, including Appellant\u2019s brown suede coat, noticed an unusual feel and weight suggesting a weapon, reached in the pocket and pulled out a gun which was fully loaded (T.T., 7/16/86, pp. 149-152). The defendant\u2019s sister told police that the coat was her brother\u2019s and that the gun was hers, which, it was later verified, she had reported stolen (T.T., 7/15/86, p. 13). The police kept the gun.\nFailing to find Appellant in their initial search, the police returned to the same address at 1:00 p.m. when, on this occasion, they found and arrested Appellant. According to police testimony, Appellant admitted that he owned the brown suede coat and wore it to police headquarters (T.T., 7/15/86, pp. 151-163). The gun was admitted by the court as evidence of armed robbery.\nThe Superior Court concluded in an unpublished memorandum opinion that the seizure of the gun was lawful under the plain view doctrine: \u201cIn the instant case, the weight of the coat and \u2018feel\u2019 of the pocket were sufficient to place the gun within the plain view of the officer.\u201d By contrast, Appellant argues that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated because the police were not lawfully on the sister\u2019s premises, the gun was not in plain view, and the police officer lacked probable cause to seize the weapon.\nOur initial consideration is whether the police had a legal right under the warrant to search for Appellant in his sister\u2019s home. Appellant argues that neither the courts below nor the Commonwealth has been able to determine why the police went to the sister\u2019s house, while the address on the warrant was the Appellant\u2019s home. Appellant specifically concludes that his constitutional rights were violated because \u201cthere was no evidence whatsoever offered by the Commonwealth at the suppression hearing to establish that there was a reason for the police to believe that the defendant was inside his sister\u2019s residence\u201d prior to their first entry. The issue is crucial because the arrest warrant must provide the location where the actor is being sought, or the police must have reason to believe that the Appellant is within the premises to be searched for him. Such a safeguard prevents the authorities from engaging in blanket or house-to-house searches which, in effect, amount to an infamous general warrant based on unfettered police discretion. Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 220, 101 S.Ct. 1642, 1652, 68 L.Ed.2d 38, 50 (1981).\nOur interpretation of this standard for an arrest at a different location than that shown on the arrest warrant is whether the police have \u201creason to believe\u201d the suspect could be found there. Our case on point is Commonwealth v. Stanley, 498 Pa. 326, 333, 446 A.2d 583, 586 (1982):\nA valid arrest warrant and mere \u201creason to believe\u201d that appellant was within was all that the police needed to enter. More stringent requirements \u2014 a search warrant or probable cause \u2014 were wholly unnecessary.\nThe police appear to have questioned an anonymous relative of the Appellant prior to the arrest, but there is nothing on the record to show that the police thereby were pointed towards the sister\u2019s house. (N.T., 7/14/86, p. 40). Appellant is correct, therefore, in concluding that the Commonwealth produced not one \u201cscintilla of evidence of record justifying a belief by the police\u201d that he could be found there.\nIn spite of this, however, the Appellant\u2019s arguments must fail because he did not raise the issue in suppression, trial or post-trial motions.\nMR. KELLY: Well, I\u2019m sure Mr. Smith knows that we\u2019re trying to do here, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: I just want him to state that he understands the basis for your motion.\nMR. KELLY: Mr. Smith, we\u2019re trying to suppress three things, the out-of-court and in-court identification of you by Michael Nelson and a .22 caliber Jennings semi-automatic pistol, which was found at your residence, and a statement which you made to the detective.\nWe have discussed these things before, haven\u2019t we? THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n(S.T., 7/14/86, p. 17).\nNo other statement referring to the discrepancy over the address appears in the suppression record. Efforts to suppress the weapon never were predicated in any articulated manner on the issue of whether the police were lawfully on the premises. An identical void exists in the trial record, while post-verdict motions included only the following:\n4. The Court erred in failing to suppress the pistol taken during the warrantless search of petitioner\u2019s dwelling. The motion was not argued further on the issue of the police being lawfully there. Since the Appellant did not properly challenge the right of the officers to be at his sister\u2019s home, we are required to conclude that the constitutional question has been waived. Commonwealth v. Berrios, 495 Pa. 444, 434 A.2d 1173 (1981); Commonwealth v. Goggans, 455 Pa. 606, 317 A.2d 222 (1974). In order to raise any objection, the defendant must give a specific reason. Commonwealth v. Austin, 484 Pa. 56, 398 A.2d 941 (1979). It is significant that throughout every critical stage of the proceedings, all the participants, Appellant, his counsel, his sister, the police, the prosecutor, and the judge never questioned the fact that the police had gone to his residence.\nWe turn next to the question of the seizure of the gun. Here the coats were knocked accidentally from their hooks, and the officer was picking them up when by the feel and weight he was able to determine that the coat pocket contained a gun. The relevant testimony is as follows:\nBY MR. KELLY:\nQ. You found this brown suede jacket, right? That was the last coat you picked up?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you were hanging that on the hook?\nA. That\u2019s right.\nQ. Then you discovered the gun?\nA. When I picked it up, I discovered the gun.\nQ. You picked it up?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you see it?\nA. I felt it.\nQ. You felt it with what, your hand?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Not the weight of the jacket?\nA. I felt the weight, I grabbed it and I realized it was a gun that was in there.\nQ. Pick up that gun for a second, detective, would you, please?\nA. Sure.\nQ. How much does that weigh?\nA. I don\u2019t know, but I could certainly tell it\u2019s a gun, whether it\u2019s in the pocket or whether it\u2019s sitting right there. I can tell.\nQ. Do you have any idea how much it weighs?\nA. No, I don\u2019t.\nQ. It weighs a lot less than the revolver you carried while on duty, doesn\u2019t it?\nA. Not a lot less, no.\nIt is clear from the record that the finding of the gun was inadvertent. In picking up the coat which he had accidently knocked off the hook, he sensed the presence of what he reasonably believed to be a gun in a pocket of the coat. The law has long recognized the sensitive feel of police officers in permitting them to seize weapons which they have found in \u201cfrisk\u201d cases. A \u201cfrisk\u201d is a search that involves contact or patting down of outer clothing to detect concealed weapons. In such cases we have never questioned the ability of the police to recognize the existence of a concealed weapon based upon their sense of feel.\nThere seems to be no reason to question the ability of the officer in this case from sensing that the coat he was lifting off of the stairs contained a gun in one of the pockets. Coupled to his awareness that a gun had been used in the robbery, he was motivated properly to search the garment and retrieve the weapon. He seized the gun when the sister identified the coat as Appellant\u2019s.\nEven though there was no pre-existing cause to search that particular item when he entered the home, subsequent events altered the circumstances. Under those changed conditions, the officer could not have been expected to ignore the distinct possibility of the existence of this evidence. The facts, in effect, deprived him of any discretion: any reasonable person would have seized the evidence. His intrusion into the coat, therefore, was a reasonable inference in all respects and justifiable as an exception to the requirement of probable cause. The officer was able to point to articulable facts and the rational inferences he drew to warrant the intrusion. Commonwealth v. Fassett, 496 Pa. 529, 437 A.2d 1166 (1981); Commonwealth v. Murray, 460 Pa. 53, 331 A.2d 414 (1975).\nWe, therefore, conclude that the search of the coat, in the absence of the presence of the defendant and without any ransacking or dragnet search of the house, was a minor intrusion when balanced against the government\u2019s need to seize weapons under these very restricted and compelling circumstances.\nThe judgment of sentence is affirmed.\nSTOUT, former J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nNIX, C.J., files a dissenting opinion in which ZAPPALA, J., joins.\n. Although bail was reduced, Appellant still lacked enough funds to pay. He also remained in jail on a probation violation retainer throughout these proceedings. His sentence reflected time served.\n. The individual judge calendar system was in use at the time of this trial. It had been adopted in 1983 at the direction of the late Chief Justice Samuel T. Roberts. In May, 1986, two months before the instant trial took place, the Administrative Judge (sic) of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County established a ready pool of the oldest major felony cases involving jailed defendants represented by private counsel. The ready pool system subsequently totally replaced the individual judge calendar system.\n. The victim garage attendant could not identify the weapon in evidence as the one used on him on the night of the crime (T.T., 7/16/86, p. 85). At the suppression hearing (S.T., 7/14/86, p. 62), the following testimony was given by the officer who found the gun:\nA. We had an arrest warrant and proceeded to search the residence for him. I started to go to the basement, and on my way down there\u2019s hooks there where you hang your clothes from when you come in from the outside. I knocked several of those coats down. Okay. As I was picking them up to hang them back up, I noticed a gun in, I believe it was a brown suede jacket. The sister at that time related to me it was her brother\u2019s coat and she was quite surprised that the gun was there.\nQ. What did she tell you about the gun?\nA. She had reported that gun stolen sometime earlier. I don\u2019t remember the exact date, but I know that she had, she stated she had reported the gun stolen, and later on I checked it out and found out that she did, in fact, have a police report on it.\nQ. What type of weapon was it?\nA. It was a small .22 caliber automatic, silver in color. I believe it had brown grips.\nQ. And do you know, of your own knowledge, what type was used in the robbery of this case?\nA. I believe that it was described as that type of weapon.\n. The arrest warrant specified \"Levi Smith, 2955 N. 12th Street;\u201d the sister\u2019s address where the arrest took place is 2838 N. Watson Street. Appellant insists that because of this difference, the police had no right to be at his sister's home.\n. The only other reference to the issue of the search of the sister\u2019s home appears at S.T., 7/14/86, p. 71, where defense counsel noticeably did not delve into the matter:\nBY MR. KELLY:\nQ. Didn\u2019t you think that was important, detective?\nA. Well, I think that\u2019s just as important as the fact that he was in that particular house where he lived when we apprehended him. That\u2019s important too. That\u2019s the address I believe that\u2019s on the warrant.\nQ. May I see the search warrant for the residence?\nA. The search warrant for the residence?\nQ. Yes.\nA. I don\u2019t know if there is a search warrant for the residence. Q. Did you fill out the property set for the weapon?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. Why not?\nA. I gave that to Det. Troutner.\nQ. Why didn\u2019t you do it?\nA. Because I was busy doing other things, counsellor. (Emphasis added \u2014 no attempt to examine the arrest warrant was ever made.)\n. The post-verdict motions filed on July 25, 1986, were denied by Judge Moss on January 3, 1987.\n. The trial court opinion, as expected, made no reference to the issue. The Superior Court did address the matter and rejected Appellant\u2019s arguments.",

        "text": "NIX, Chief Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe probability of the guilt of a defendant does not provide license to trample upon that person\u2019s constitutional rights. Here there was a flagrant violation of appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. The police went to the home of appellant\u2019s sister, 2838 N. Watson Street, armed with an arrest warrant specifying \u201cLevi Smith, 2955 N. 12th Street.\u201d The warrant, as written, authorized entry into appellant\u2019s North 12th Street residence. In order for entry into the sister\u2019s home to have been appropriate under these facts, there must have been reason to believe appellant was inside the sister\u2019s home. The majority appropriately cites to Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 101 S.Ct. 1642, 68 L.Ed.2d 38 (1981); and Commonwealth v. Stanley, 498 Pa. 326, 446 A.2d 583 (1982), for the above standard for an arrest at a different location from that shown on the arrest warrant and concedes no evidence was offered by the Commonwealth to justify a belief by the police that defendant could be found in his sister\u2019s home. Entry into the sister\u2019s home to arrest the defendant, implicitly acknowledged by the majority to be unauthorized even if deemed waived, may not be used to justify a warrantless search of clothing in the sister\u2019s house. The fact is that the police officers were illegally on the premises when one of them \u201caccidentally\u201d knocked down several coats as they descended the cellar steps while looking for the appellant. After determining that appellant was not on the premises, one of the officers attempted to repair the damage resulting from his intrusion into the lady\u2019s home by graciously replacing the garments on the hook from which they had been dislodged.\nAt this juncture, it must be emphasized that the warrant which was used to secure entrance into the home was a warrant of arrest of a specific person who, at that point the police knew, was not on the premises. The testimony the Commonwealth asserts to justify the search is that the officer noticed one of the jackets (which belonged to appellant) was of unusual weight, and by feeling the pocket determined that a gun was probably contained therein. The majority characterizes this search as an \u201cinadvertent\u201d finding and seeks to justify the warrantless search of the lady\u2019s home by resort to the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d search doctrine.\nThe majority\u2019s application of the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d doctrine in this case is erroneous. Under that doctrine, first enunciated in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968), an officer, prior to making any search of an individual\u2019s person, must have observed such an unusual and suspicious conduct on the part of the person who is stopped that he may reasonably conclude criminal activity is afoot and the person with whom he is dealing may be armed and dangerous. In both Commonwealth v. Fassett, 496 Pa. 529, 437 A.2d 1166 (1981), and Commonwealth v. Murray, 460 Pa. 53, 331 A.2d 414 (1975), on which the majority relies, automobiles were involved. In both Fassett and Murray police officers caused the driver of an automobile to stop. As I stated in Murray:\nThe United States Supreme Court in Terry, supra and in Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct.1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), has suggested that even in the absence of probable cause there may be, under certain circumstances, justification for a limited intrusion upon the privacy of an individual. Under these decisions the Court has suggested that a brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining additional information may in fact be reasonable although the officer at that time did not possess probable cause that would justify an arrest. In the Terry, supra and Adams, supra decisions, the Court was required to struggle with the balancing of the right of society and the right of an individual in street encounters. Because a motorist\u2019s extreme mobility may otherwise al low him to avoid police confrontation, the State has an equally strong interest in these cases in stopping a moving vehicle to freeze momentarily a situation of suspected criminality. However, these decisions have made it clear that to justify the intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which taken together with rational inferences from those facts reasonably warranted the intrusion---- (Citations omitted.)\nThus, it is also clear that an investigative stop of a moving vehicle to be valid must be based upon objective facts creating a reasonable suspicion that the detained motorist is presently involved in criminal activity. (Emphasis added.)\n460 Pa. at 61, 331 A.2d at 418.\nThe \u201cspecific and articulable facts which taken together with rational inferences from those facts reasonably\u201d warranting intrusion, referred to in Terry and rearticulated by me in Murray, are not the type of facts present in this case. There is no issue of a motorist\u2019s extreme mobility nor a case of freezing momentarily a situation of suspected criminality. The urgency extant in \u201cstop and frisk\u201d cases was not present here. This is clearly a case of an illegal entry into someone\u2019s home, followed by an illegal search of appellant\u2019s clothing found in that home which produced poisoned fruit.\nFinally, when holding that the doctrine of the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d cases warrants the admissibility of the evidence produced by the unlawful entry, search and seizure occurring here, the majority does violence to a fundamental aspect of stare decisis \u2014the facts must be substantially the same when applying a principle of law previously enunciated.\nI am compelled to dissent.\nZAPPALA, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\n. The majority's statement \"the appellant resided in his sister\u2019s home\u201d, p. 341, is contradicted by the concession there was no evidence to justify a belief the defendant could be found in his sister\u2019s home.\n. At the point when the officers knew the defendant was no longer on the premises, there was no longer a reason for them to remain in the house.\n. The facts as related by the officer who found the gun are remarkably similar to the facts of a \"pat down\u201d search except for the crucial point that here the garment searched was not being worn when \"patted\u201d or felt.",
