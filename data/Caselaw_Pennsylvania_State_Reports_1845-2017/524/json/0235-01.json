        "text": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nWe granted Appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal to review the Commonwealth Court Order and Opinion, 117 Pa.Cmwlth. 465, 543 A.2d 1268 (Barbieri, S.J., Craig, J., concurring and Paladino, J., dissenting), reversing the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Board) which had denied Appellee\u2019s petition for termination of Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits. Specifically, we are asked to interpret \u00a7 307(7) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7 562 which addresses termination of widow\u2019s and widower\u2019s benefits for involvement in a meretricious relationship.\nAppellant, Alice Sadvary, was awarded widow\u2019s benefits in 1984 based upon her husband\u2019s 1980 work-related death. Shortly thereafter, Appellee, Bethenergy Mines, Inc., the self-insured compensation employer, hired a private investigator to conduct a surveillance of Appellant. As the result of this surveillance, Appellee learned that Appellant was living with another man. This information precipitated the filing of a petition to terminate compensation benefits under \u00a7 307(7) of the Act.\nIt is undisputed that the Appellant was in the midst of a meretricious relationship. The Board determined that such a finding did not mandate termination of benefits. As indicated, a divided panel of the Commonwealth Court reversed the Board. The lead opinion, authored by Judge Barbieri, theorized that \u00a7 307(7) was mandatory and not discretionary and therefore once the Board determined that the Appellant was participating in a meretricious relationship, termination of benefits was required. He concluded that although the result seemed harsh, it was for the legislature and not the court to rectify. Although agreeing with the result reached by the lead opinion, the concurring opinion, theorized that a strict interpretation of the term \u201cmay\u201d would result in the Board having unbridled discretion which is constitutionally impermissible. Thus, \u201cmay\u201d meant the sain\u00e9 as \u201cshall\u201d. Like the lead opinion, the concurring opinion implored the legislature to rectify this glaring injustice. Finally, the dissenting opinion argued that the legislature did not intend for \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d to have the same meaning and that economic circumstances provided sufficient criteria to avoid a constitutional challenge.\nFor the reasons set forth hereinafter, we must reverse the Commonwealth Court.\nSection 307(7) of the Act states, in pertinent part:\n. * * * He * *\nProvided, however, That if, upon investigation and hearing, it shall be ascertained that the widow or widower is living with a man or a woman as the case may be, in a meretricious relationship and not married, or the widow living a life of prostitution, the Board may order the termination of compensation payable to such widow or widower. (Emphasis added).\nWith regard to death or remarriage, \u00a7 307(7) provides that\nShould any dependent of a deceased employe [sic] die or remarry, or should the widower become capable of self support, the right of such dependent or widower to compensation under this section shall cease except that if a widow remarries, she shall receive 104 weeks compensation at a rate computed in accordance with class 2 of \u00a7 307 in a lump sum after which compensation shall cease ... (Emphasis added) (Footnote omitted).\nThus, within the same provision,, the legislature has specifically used the words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d.\nWhile we are cognizant of the principle of law set forth in Hotel Casey v. Ross, 343 Pa. 573, 579, 23 A.2d 737, 740 (1942), that, \u201cwhere a statute directs the doing of a thing for the sake of justice, the word \u2018may\u2019 means the same as the word \u2018shall\u2019 \u201d, we are bound by principles of statutory construction in interpreting any statute. In particular, we have long been guided by the principle that when enacting legislation, the legislature does not intend to violate any constitutional provisions. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(3). Furthermore, common usage of a word is appropriate unless specified otherwise. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a). Finally, if language is not ambiguous, then we cannot ignore its plain meaning to reach a desired result. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b).\nThe use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in \u00a7 307(7) cannot be considered insignificant or coincidental when compared with other parts of that section as well as other provisions of the Act. For example, in \u00a7 307(7) the legislature chose the word \u201cshall\u201d to mandate what group would be the beneficiary of benefits. Furthermore, \u00a7 307(7) denies the Board any discretion in determining when a widow of an employee will receive compensation through the choice of the word \u201cshall\u201d. Finally, concerning the affect of a widow\u2019s marriage, the legislature used the word \u201cshall\u201d rather than \u201cmay\u201d in setting forth a widow\u2019s right. The remaining sections of the Act are replete with similar examples.\nAlthough there may be some instances when the legislature interchangeably uses \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d, this does not appear to be such an instance. Without clear direction by the legislature to the contrary, we conclude that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in \u00a7 307(7) granted discretion to the Board.\nFinally, if in fact the Board is granted discretion, the issue becomes under what guidelines may this discretion be exercised. Appellee argues that no such guidelines are apparent, therefore, an exercise of discretion by the Board would be arbitrary. This, of course, would result in an unconstitutional delegation of authority. Tosto v. Pa. Nursing Home and Loan Agency, 460 Pa. 1, 331 A.2d 198 (1975).\nA presumption exists that the legislature does not intend an unconstitutional result. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(3). Furthermore, a proponent arguing the unconstitutionality of a legislative enactment has a heavy burden to sustain his claim. James v. SEPTA, 505 Pa. 137, 477 A.2d 1302 (1984). Reviewing this provision of the Act in light of these standards, w\u00e9 cannot agree with Appellee.\nThe purpose of the Act is remedial in nature and designed to protect workmen and their dependents suffering economic damages from work-related injuries. Krawchuk v. Philadelphia Electric Co., 497 Pa. 115, 439 A.2d 627 (1981). In exercising any discretion the Board must do so keeping in mind the Act\u2019s purpose. As we stated in Pa. Nursing Home and Loan Agency, \u201c... pervasive general policy is clearly sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement that \u2018basic policy choices\u2019 be made by the legislature.\u201d 460 Pa. at 12, 331 A.2d at 203. The use of economic circumstances as a basis upon which to determine whether benefits should be continued or terminated is not an arbitrary exercise of the Board\u2019s discretion. In making its determination, the Board considered the Appellant\u2019s ability to support herself based on her income and earning potential. Finding the Appellant could not survive without the workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, the Board denied Appellee\u2019s petition to terminate benefits. As such we cannot agree that the Board\u2019s exercise of discretion in this instance was arbitrary.\nThe Order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the Board\u2019s Order dismissing Appellee\u2019s termination petition is reinstated.\nMcDERMOTT, J., dissents.",
