Appellant waived his right to counsel and to a full Board hearing and admitted to the technical violation. His arguments that he wanted a better paying job were rejected, and appellant was recommitted to serve ten months’ back time, a term within the presumptive range<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> of three to eleven months. After receiving notice of his recommitment, appellant requested and was appointed counsel from the Lancaster County Public Defender’s Office. He filed a Petition for Administrative Relief, which was denied. He then filed a Petition for Review with the Commonwealth Court. The court determined appellant’s appeal to be frivolous because the court had repeatedly held that it would not review the discretionary recommitment when the recommitment period is within the presumptive range. On that basis, the Commonwealth Court granted the Board’s petition for attorney’s fees pursuant to Rule 2744 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure 117 Pa.Cmwlth. 220, <a href="/pa-commw/117/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="543 A.2d 221" data-case-ids="1373762" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/117/0220-01">543 A.2d 221</a>.

This determination was based upon a finding that he had violated Special Condition No. 6 of his parole, maintaining employment once secured. Appellant does not challenge the Board’s action as being a violation of his constitutional rights or the law, nor does he dispute that he failed to maintain employment. Rather, his allegations are premised upon the belief that the Board did not give adequate consideration to the evidence he presented as a mitigating circumstance. We affirm that this aspect of the recommitment order is not appealable. <em>See Chapman v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, supra. </em>The Board is accorded broad discretion in the assessment of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, much like the trial court is accorded discretion in its exercise of sentencing power. <em>See Commonwealth v.

To restrict the Board’s discretion in this limited area would be to open the floodgates of litigation to the many parole violators who would challenge an action of the Board which is already narrowed by the Board’s own regulations. This we decline to do. Absent some special circumstances which would justify a reconsideration of our determination that this delegation is constitutional, <em>see Commonwealth ex rel. Banks v.
