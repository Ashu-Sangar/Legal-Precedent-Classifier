In <em>Abu- Jamal </em>we determined that each case involving prosecutorial remarks about the appellate process must be evaluated in light of the circumstances peculiar to that case.

    <p id="b162-8" data-blocks='[["BL_162.8",162,[277,1770,1104,192]]]'>1) Absent from the remarks in <em>Abu-Jamal </em>were, statements that the Supreme Court would not let anyone be executed until absolutely certain that the defendant received a fair trial.</p>

    <p id="b162-10" data-blocks='[["BL_162.10",162,[277,2252,1103,96]],["BL_163.1",163,[214,306,1104,251]]]'>3) In <em>Abu-Jamal </em>unlike <em>Baker </em>the jury did not report that it was “hopelessly deadlocked” on the proper sen<a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>tence, did not indicate confusion concerning aggravating and mitigating circumstances and thus the “potential was not great that a wavering juror might assent to a verdict” because he believed the Supreme Court would re-examine it.</p>
    <p id="b163-5" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[170,587,1148,528]]]'>In evaluating the prosecutor’s remarks in the present case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in light of its particular circumstances, it is clear that the Superior Court erred in setting aside the sentence of death. Although the remark that Beasley would have “endless appeals to all levels of the court system,” and the reference to the last execution in Pennsylvania, were irrelevant and unnecessary, they did not lessen the jury’s sense of responsibility as the ultimate arbiter of the sentence to be imposed. Like <em>Abu-Jamal, </em>the present case is distinguishable from <em>Baker.</em>

    <p id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[169,1137,1148,419]]]'>First, the prosecutor here did not suggest that this court would make the final decision concerning the sentence to be imposed.

(This would mark Beasley’s third conviction for homicide and second death sentence.) Under this scenario, the sentence of death was mandated by statute — the jury having never engaged in the weighing process, required by statute, in a case where the jury finds both aggravating and mitigating circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Moreover, this is not a case like <em>Baker </em>where the jury displayed confusion as to whether aggravating or mitigating circumstances had to be weighed in considering a life sentence and where the chance was great that a hesitant juror may have acquiesced in the imposition of the death penalty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

This wastes judicial time, and resources— all for naught.

    <p id="b165-6" data-blocks='[["BL_165.6",165,[168,443,1149,905]]]'>In <em>Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, </em><a href="/pa/521/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="521 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1817450" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0188-01">521 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="521 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1817450" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0188-01">555 A.2d 846</a> (1989), we went to some lengths to demonstrate that the prosecutor’s remarks were reasonable response to defense counsel’s arguments. I find no similar circumstance here. In <em>Abu-Jamal </em>we further found that the prosecutor’s argument, as a whole and in context, did not create a risk that the jury would abdicate to the reviewing courts its responsibility to determine sentence. Here, the prosecutor’s argument was tainted throughout, even incorrectly suggesting to the jury that a life sentence carried the possibility of parole. Nevertheless, because the jury ultimately found two aggravating circumstances, which were incontestable matters of fact, and no mitigating circumstances, the sentence of death was required under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(iv), and cannot be said to be a product of the prosecutor’s improper remarks.

Crawley, </em><a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">514 Pa. 539</a>, 559-60, <a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">526 A.2d 334</a>, 344-45 (1987).</p>
