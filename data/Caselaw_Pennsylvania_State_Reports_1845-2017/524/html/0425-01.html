The loan was secured by mortgage and note in which CleveTrust held the first lien on the property.</p>
    <p id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[164,705,1148,583]]]'>On the same date, Edinboro entered into a contract with Drakes Mills Development Company, which was to act as general contractor for the project. Appended to the contract was a cost estimate prepared by the general contractor in which the cost to build the mall was divided into forty-eight different categories. After construction began, Drakes Mills submitted a monthly application for payment based upon invoices it received from subcontractors for work performed the prior month. An architect employed by CleveTrust verified that the work described on the applications for payment was actually performed.</p>

The subcontractors were hired by Drakes Mills, the general contractor, and CleveTrust had no knowledge of who the subcontractors were or which of the forty-eight categories any of them had been placed in. The subcontractors all executed waivers of mechanics’ liens.</p>

Upon receipt of the application for payment, Clevetrust wired the requested amount to a title company, which would insure that CleveTrust’s lien on the property was primary, and then the title company would disburse the money to Edinboro, which would pay Drakes Mills, the general contractor. Drakes Mills, in turn, would pay the subcontractors.</p>

In November of 1974, however, less than eight months after the execution of the loan documents, Edinboro failed to make a mandatory interest payment on the loan. In accordance with its rights under the loan agreement, CleveTrust refused to disburse any additional funds. At the time of default, CleveTrust had disbursed $1,903,891.13, not including retainage, as requested in applications for payment one through eight. Five days after the default, the ninth application for payment was submitted to CleveTrust, which declined to pay.</p>

Thé subcontractors then ceased work, although appellee Felheim Roofing had already completed its work. In January, 1975, several subcontractors filed mechanics’ liens against Edinboro for labor and materials. A complaint was subsequently filed, and Edinboro’s motion for summary judgment was granted by the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County because of the waivers of mechanics’ liens executed by the subcontractors. Superior Court affirmed.</p>

On February .19, 1975, CleveTrust began foreclosure proceedings on its first mortgage. On March 7, 1975, an involuntary bankruptcy petition was filed by Edinboro’s creditors and a receiver was appointed to operate the business. CleveTrust’s foreclosure suit was stayed by a temporary restraining order and the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. On August 25, 1975, the bankruptcy court lifted the stay and CleveTrust continued with its foreclosure action. CleveTrust foreclosed on the mall and purchased it at sheriff’s sale on December 12, 1975 for taxes and costs in the amount of $120,921.05.</p>

Further, the court determined that CleveTrust was enriched, but not unjustly, where the advances made were in excess of the amount claimed by the subcontractors and no other subcontractor performed work under the line item in question, but that CleveTrust was unjustly enriched by the amount of retainage (10% of the amount invoiced and held back by CleveTrust) where the advances made were not in excess of the amount claimed by certain subcontractors. Accordingly, the trial court awarded appellees Hill and Felheim Roofing a portion of their claims, but determined that sufficient funds had been distributed to satisfy the claim of appellee Erie Flexlume Sign Corporation, and that Erie Flexlume, therefore, was not entitled to any recovery.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

As we have seen from the <em>Meehan </em>
      <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>case, the value of the invoices is not a proper measure of enrichment. The appraised value of the mall, on the other hand, is relevant to the question of enrichment, which would consist of any surplus value after advances made were set off against the appraised value. The trial court determined that CleveTrust had been enriched in that the mall was appraised at between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000, and CleveTrust had advanced only $1,903,000. Slip Op. at 11.</p>
    <p id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[174,784,1149,901]]]'>The trial court was in error in making this determination, however. The appraiser testified that he made two appraisals, one in 1973 at $3,000,000 and one in 1975 at $2,000,000 (R. 137a ff.). More particularly, the appraiser testified that, in May of 1975, seven months before the sheriff’s sale, the value of the mall was either $2,000,000 or $1,950,000, depending on whether the capitalization rate was ten percent or ten point five percent (R. 138-9a). He also testified that the effect of a foreclosure would be to depress the value of the property (R. 140a). This evidence suggests that the value of the mall in 1975 was approximately $2,000,000, erring on the high side, not between two and three million, as the trial court determined.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a> This $2,000,000 figure, however, would have to be reduced by $100,000, the cost of completing the mall (R. 153a).

As this Court held in <em>Meehan, </em>a third party is not <em>unjustly </em>enriched when it receives a benefit from a contract between two other parties where the party benefitted has not requested the benefit or misled the other parties. There is no evidence of record that CleveTrust either requested anything from the subcontractors or misled anyone; in fact, it did nothing more than exercise its rights under the construction loan agreement to discontinue construction installment payments and foreclose on the property. The subcontractors in this case voluntarily waived their rights to mechanics' liens and went forward without being protected by a performance bond. These decisions were business calculations which carried a certain amount of risk. It would be manifestly unfair for this Court to restructure these contractual arrangements in such a way as to place all of the risk on CleveTrust, thus insulating the subcontractors from any responsibility for their own decisions and making CleveTrust, in effect, the insurer of the subcontractors' interests.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">5</a>

The $2,000,000 appraisal was done seven months before CleveTrust purchased the property at sheriff’s sale and the value of the property during this time was in a state of flux because the area in which the mall was located was in the midst of an economic decline (R. 161a). This, added to the foreclosure, suggests that the value of the property would have been lower than $2,000,000.</p>

Other security can be acquired by contract. If the right to file a mechanics’ lien has been waived, if a contractor chooses to rely upon the personal credit of the party with whom he contracts, a court should not rewrite the contract of the parties or legislate a right to receive payment from a mortgagee who has been compelled to go into possession to preserve its security.
