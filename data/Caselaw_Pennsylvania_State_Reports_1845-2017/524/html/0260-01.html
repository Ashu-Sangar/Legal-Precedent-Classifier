At the time <em>Welsko </em>was decided, the Tenure Act provided that except where there were substantial differences in ratings, a point not in issue, professional employees were to be retained on the basis of seniority rights. We held that the school district erred in dismissing the least senior teacher of a particular subject, when teachers with even less seniority could have been dismissed if members of the remaining staff were assigned to their duties. (When the legislature repealed this section of the Tenure Act and adopted the present Section 1125.1, the realignment it required to accommodate seniority rights was not so extensive as we had imposed by our decision in <em>Welsko. </em>See <em>Duncan.) </em>Although in passing we affirmed the view first stated in <em>Ehret v.

In that case, it will be recalled, though he was not assigned to the particular position he wanted (which was filled by someone less senior), the complaining employee was, in fact, given an opportunity to fill a position for which he was certified and a less senior employee was bumped. Here, the complaining employees were furloughed while a less senior employee was retained in a position for which their certification was sufficient.</p>

Elsewhere in the Public School Code the legislature has provided that “[n]o person shall teach [meaning “to engage in the practice of teaching ... <em>or to provide related educational specialist, administrative or </em>

(Emphasis added). Thus, it is apparent that the position does require certification, i.e., the minimum certification necessary to teach in the school system. The superintendent acknowledged as much in his testimony. It is true that no special certification distinguishes those eligible to hold the coordinator’s position from those eligible to hold other teaching positions, as a certification in mathematics distinguishes those who may teach that subject from those certified and eligible to teach another subject. Lingner was eligible to hold the position because she was certified; it happened that her certification was in English, but it could as well have been in mathematics, science, physical education, or any other field. In most cases, it would seem, there is a correspondence between position and certification. The statute, however, is not so narrowly drawn as to exclude from its reach those positions that do not so easily correspond to a subject or field of certification. If a position exists and an employee’s certification enables him to fill that position, he must be given the opportunity to do so by displacing the less senior employee.</p>

At best, certification is but a rough indicator of a professional employee’s ability to perform in a given area. It perhaps becomes even less meaningful as length of service increases and employees “specialize” in one area of certification to the exclusion of others, though never losing certification in those latter areas. The disparity is even more acute in a situation such as this, where certification is but a minimum requirement for a position, individualized talents and experiences being more significant to the success of the program. The benefit of giving school districts discretion to make <em>appointments </em>on the basis of persons’ <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>qualifications is limited by a requirement that <em>retentions </em>be based entirely on seniority and certifications.</p>
    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[227,434,1149,1162]]]'>Nevertheless, for reasons that themselves are not insignificant, the legislature has deemed it appropriate to require school boards to rely only on certification in determining whether an employee may survive reductions in force. It cannot be forgotten that these reductions occur in the “extra-ordinary” context of substantial decrease in pupil enrollment, perhaps accompanied by curtailment or alteration of the educational program. See 24 P.S. § 11-1124(1), (2). This method protects long-tenured employees, who carry greater salaries, from removal simply to save the district a greater amount of money, while providing an obvious incentive for employees to broaden their professional abilities. Further, it is not clear that there are a significant number of positions like the one at issue here, where the job requirements differ to such a degree from the minimal certification necessary. In this regard, any disruption to the district’s program caused in this case by adherence to Section 1125.1(c) may be sui generis. And we note that school districts are not without options to garner greater flexibility in making such decisions. See 24 P.S. § ll-1125.1(e) (collective bargaining agreement may supersede other requirements of Section).</p>

It would be inappropriate, however, for this Court to determine the form of relief. More than seven years have passed :since the suspensions were first ordered. If the circumstances in this case, as reflected in the record of the hearing before the Board, are at all typical, much may have changed in those years. In the short space of the few months between the announcement of the suspensions and the hearing, two of the teachers scheduled for furlough were recalled and another was likely to be recalled before the start of the school year; others may have secured employment elsewhere. Thus an order of reinstatement may be impractical, and the most that may be appropriate is <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>a monetary award for lost wages.
