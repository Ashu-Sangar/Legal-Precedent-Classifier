Post-verdict motions were filed, argued and denied. On March 27, 1987, appellant was sentenced as follows: bill of information No. 1308 (first degree murder) — death as determined by the jury on May 23, 1986; bill of information No. 1306 (criminal conspiracy) five (5) to ten (10) years incarceration consecutive to bill of information No. 1308; bill of information No. 1350 (possession of an instrument of crime generally) — two and one-half (2V2) to five (5) years incarceration consecutive to bill of information No. 1306. Appellant directly appealed the Judgment of Sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The events leading to the conviction of appellant begin on the early morning of May 16, 1980, when police were summoned to 321 West Sedgley Street in Philadelphia. There, lying in the street, hands bound behind his back with a trench coat belt, and a belt tied around his neck, head blasted by shotgun, was found the dead body of 17 year-old Richard Caldwell. The cause of death; two shotgun blasts to the head and ligature strangulation.</p>

The confession and testimony of Miss Baker gave a glimpse into a lawless world of drug selling and off-hand murder. That evidence describes that the deceased, Richard Caldwell, was a drug pusher for one Leroy Johnson (Bubbles), that he had fallen short in his accounts and was killed at Johnson’s behest by the appellant and one Daniel Freeman.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

All four repaired to the apartment of Miss Baker. When they arrived at the apartment, Johnson said to the appellant, “Your boy is in the van all high on pills.” The appellant replied, “Good I can take care of that now.” Thereupon appellant went upstairs, got a shotgun, handed it to Freeman who concealed it in his pants. Johnson gave the keys of the van to appellant and they left. Within an hour they returned and said that the shotgun fired while Freeman was playing with it, shooting a hole in the van floor and that they had strangled and shot Caldwell.

When appellant was arrested he made a statement to the police. His statement was admitted into evidence, in which he said he killed Caldwell because Johnson threatened to kill him or his family if he didn’t. Appellant said that Johnson wanted Caldwell killed as an example for failing to pay Johnson and other dealers for heroin sold. Appellant went on to describe how he and Freeman strangled the victim and then both took turns shooting him. It is clear that if such evidence was legally posited and believed by the jury, and it was, it was sufficient to sustain conviction.

These assertions are totally without merit. Initially it should be noted that any argument by counsel to the effect that appellant was controlled by Johnson would have been inconsistent with his defense at time of trial which was that he was not at the scene of the crime. Similarly there was no evidence offered that he was unable to read or write, on the contrary the evidence disclosed that he had attended school but did not progress beyond the sixth grade. The record also discloses that the appellant did not wish a continuance to secure the presence of other witnesses who would have testified as to his environment and good character.

Primarily on the basis of her testimony the jury found the mitigating circumstance of character.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> The jury also found that the appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1).

When he refused to even touch the document, the prosecutor, at the suggestion of the trial court, read him the statement. Since the statement failed to add any facts not already in evidence as the result of appellant’s own statement, he suffered no prejudice. Thus this allegation is without merit. <em>Commonwealth v. Slaughter, </em><a href="/pa/482/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="482 Pa. 538" data-case-ids="1749615" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0538-01">482 Pa. 538</a>, <a href="/pa/482/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="482 Pa. 538" data-case-ids="1749615" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0538-01">394 A.2d 453</a> (1978).</p>

The jury found that the appellant participated in a killing for hire, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(2) and that the killing was effectuated by means of torture, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(8). Our death penalty statute provides for the aggravating circumstance of killing for hire when it is demonstrated that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b478-7" data-blocks='[["BL_478.7",478,[278,1931,1105,204]]]'>(2) The defendant paid or was paid by another person or had contracted to pay or be paid by another person or had conspired to pay or be paid by another person for the killing of the victim.</blockquote>

The evidence presented at trial by both the appellant’s and Shirley Baker’s statements revealed that the appellant was in the employ of Johnson and that the victim owed money to Johnson and to others <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>which debts were not satisfied. Johnson then instructed the appellant to “get on your job.” With that, the victim was killed. To kill for pay does not require a specified amount in the agreement. The consideration may be what suits the purposes of each; money or services. Here the jury could accept that since appellant worked as a drug middleman for Johnson and that murder was part of the job description. Clearly the only distinguishing feature between the above employment scenario and a classic killing for money is that the appellant contracted to sell drugs in addition. Accordingly we find that the Commonwealth provided ample evidence for the jury to find this aggravating circumstance.</p>
    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[156,1016,1149,1157]]]'>The appellant next contests the finding that the victim was tortured. Here the record reflects that both the appellant and co-defendant transported the victim to a place located six city blocks away from Shirley Baker’s apartment. The Commonwealth presented testimonial evidence that such a journey would take three minutes by vehicle. Shirley Baker testified that both the appellant and co-defendant did not return for almost an hour. During that time two trench coat belts were fastened to the victim’s neck. First the co-defendant attempted to strangle the victim and then the appellant tried his hand. The cohorts then became involved in what may best be described as a “tug-of-war” with the victim’s neck placed in the balance. Both men proceeded to tug in opposite directions. When the competition was over, first the co-defendant and then the appellant took turns at shooting the victim in the head with a shotgun. Since they came armed with a shotgun, the jury could find that the strangulation was but a cruel prelude to an intended denouement by that gun. It was not unreasonable for the jury to infer from the evidence presented that it was the intent of both the appellant and co-defendant to first torture the victim.</p>
