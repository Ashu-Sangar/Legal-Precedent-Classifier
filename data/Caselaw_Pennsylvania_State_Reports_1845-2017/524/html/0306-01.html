The issue presented is whether the trial court erred in refusing to order the husband to submit to such tests upon appellee’s Motion for Physical Examination pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 4010(a).</p>

On June 6, 1980, Paula gave birth to the couple’s first child (whose paternity is not at issue). In January-February, 1981, John and Paula engaged in sexual intercourse on several occasions without <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>birth control precautions.

Essentially, John claimed to have visited mother and the Child at the hospital upon the Child’s birth, and to have kept up a relationship with the Child and her mother. John also testified that Paula had acknowledged to him that he was the Child’s father, and that he had offered to support the Child, which offer was refused because Paula would have been unable to explain the source of the support money to her husband. John established a trust fund for the Child; however, at oral argument it was conceded that the trust was revocable at the will of the donor-John.</p>
