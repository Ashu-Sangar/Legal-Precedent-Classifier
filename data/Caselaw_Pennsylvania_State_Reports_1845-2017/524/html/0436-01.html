On appeal, the court of common pleas found that the ordinance did prohibit mobile home parks, rejecting the Township’s contrary finding for lack of substantial evidence. Nevertheless, the court affirmed the denial of the curative amendment based on its reading of our decision in <em>In Re: M.A. Kravitz Co., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/501/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="501 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1782415" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0200-01">501 Pa. 200</a>, <a href="/pa/501/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="501 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1782415" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0200-01">460 A.2d 1075</a> (1983).

Accordingly, we granted the petition and remanded for reconsideration in light of our decision in <em>Fernley. </em>Commonwealth Court then determined that the ordinance improperly excluded mobile home parks, and remanded to the common pleas court for consideration in accordance with 53 P.S. § 11011(2).

    <p id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.4",562,[246,1366,1149,576]]]'>The Township’s primary argument is that this case falls within the rationale of <em>Kravitz. </em>There, a plurality of this Court sustained an ordinance that failed to provide for townhouses although provision was made for residential uses other than single family detached dwellings. It did not approve a rule whereby an ordinance prohibiting a given residential use could nevertheless be sustained under the “fair share” analysis of <em>Surrick. </em>See <a href="/pa/501/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="501 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1782415" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0200-01">501 Pa. at 210-211</a>, <a href="/pa/501/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="501 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1782415" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0200-01">460 A.2d at 1081</a>.

A zoning ordinance, like all legislative enactments, is presumed to be valid and constitutional; one challenging it bears a heavy burden of proof. Demonstrating that an <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>ordinance expressly excludes a particular use is perhaps the most clear-cut means of meeting that burden, for “the constitutionality of total prohibitions ... cannot be premised on the fundamental reasonableness of allocating to each type of activity a particular location in the community.” <em>Exton Quarries Inc. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/425/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="425 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="1906748" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0043-01">425 Pa. 43</a>, 59, <a href="/citations/?q=228%20A.2d%20169" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="228 A.2d 169">228 A.2d 169</a>, 179 (1967). Though the proof is more difficult, it is also possible to show that a use is effectively prohibited throughout the municipality although it is apparently permitted. <em>Benham v. Middletown Township, </em><a href="/pa-commw/22/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="22 Pa. Commw. 245" data-case-ids="1871566" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/22/0245-01">22 Pa.

    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[172,886,1149,524]]]'>In <em>Kravitz, </em>it was noted that the township had, on review, determined that townhouse development would be permitted in one of the residential districts, not by variance or special exception but as a permitted use. This determination, supported by substantial evidence in the record and affirmed by the court of common pleas, gave indication that the zoning power was not being used unreasonably. In other words, the challenger had not met its burden of proving that the ordinance effectively prohibited the proposed use.</p>
    <p id="b563-6" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[171,1433,1148,896]],["BL_564.1",564,[245,281,1148,256]]]'>Although the Township here claims that its ordinance merely fails to provide for mobile home parks, we are satisfied that the common pleas court did not err in characterizing the ordinance as effectively prohibiting mobile home parks. We note particularly that the ordinance recognized mobile home parks by including a definition of them, but did not list them in any of the residential zones, where the enumerated uses <em>and no others </em>were permitted. The Board’s original rationale, that mobile home parks would be permitted, essentially as subdivisions made available for rent, in either the Residential Development District or the Village Residential District is untenable. Although each individual unit in a mobile home park might qualify as a single family dwelling, the large minimum lot size for each dwelling (20,000 square feet) in those districts would make development of a mobile home park economically unfeasible, allowing at most only 2.1 units per acre <em>before </em>account<a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>ing for road right of way requirements. (By way of comparison, the developer proposed minimum lot sizes of 4300 square feet, at a density of 5.3 units per acre <em>after </em>allowing for road right of way and open space, a density described as lower than average for mobile home parks.)</p>
    <p id="b564-5" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[237,556,1155,1046]]]'>We are aware that some early Commonwealth Court cases affirmed rulings where mobile home parks would have been required to meet minimum lot sizes of 20,000 square feet per dwelling unit.

In <em>Delaware County Investment, </em>however, the landowner had sought a <em>variance </em>from the township’s minimum lot size regulation and the court found no abuse of discretion in the finding that the landowner had not shown the unique hardship necessary to the grant of a variance. In <em>Colonial Park, </em>the court, while acknowledging that such evidence might exist, found no evidence in the record before it from which it could conclude that the burden of demonstrating the unconstitutionality of the ordinance had been met. Here, as stated, the court of common pleas ruled otherwise on the record before it, Commonwealth Court affirmed, and we find no error.</p>

While this appeal was pending, however, the General Assembly repealed Article X of the Code, dealing with appeals of land use decisions, and replaced it with Article X-A. Act 1988-170. Unlike Section 1011(2), new Section 1006-A, 53 P.S. § 11006-A, does not enumerate specific factors that a court must consider in granting relief. Rather, as it did in 1972, the Code now grants courts broad discretion to approve the proposed use “as to all elements,” or to approve it “as to some elements, referring] other elements to the [appropriate authority] for <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>further proceedings, including adoption of alternative restrictions, in accordance with the court’s opinion and order.” Although Act 1988-170 contained no indication as to whether the legislature intended it to be applicable to cases pending when it became effective, it would be inappropriate to require the court, on remand, to be guided by a statute that has been repealed.</p>

The majority is incorrect in framing this issue as a matter of factual dispute.<a class="footnotemark">1</a> Ordinances rise and fall on their face. A use is either included or it is excluded <em>as a matter of law, </em>and this matter is quite simply determined by reading the ordinance. A party to an exclusionary zoning dispute cannot by evidence show that apples are oranges or that two plus two equals five. Trial courts need not pore over the records in these cases to find evidence of inclusion or exclusion. Rather, they must examine the plain meaning of <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>the ordinances themselves, using the statutory rules of construction to interpret the words of the ordinances. To allow the meanings of the ordinances to depend upon what zoning boards wish them to mean is to throw the law into chaos, and will encourage these governing bodies to continue engaging in practices that exclude persons of moderate and limited income from residing in their communities.</p>
