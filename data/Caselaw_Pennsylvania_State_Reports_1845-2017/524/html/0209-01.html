The requirements, basically, are the same as for any writing which purports to be a contract: the parties must be known; the terms (here the time period involved) must be definite; and the writing must, when plainly construed, indicate an agreement or meeting of the minds on the terms.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>addition, an agreement written in the context of statutory or regulatory application must be read in the context of the statute or rule.

    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.7",339,[170,591,1151,958]]]'>The first question which arises in this case is whether there has been an exchange of letters within the meaning of the rule. Presumably, the requirement of an exchange of letters was intended as a sort of procedural statute of frauds, a requirement that the exchange in and of itself must reveal the agreement. If that were not the case, the rule would do little to serve its intended purpose of reducing uncertainty, for the parties might well disagree, as in this case, as to the terms of the agreement. It seems likely, therefore, that the comment contemplated the situation in which one party’s letter requested an extension of X days and the other party’s letter granted the X day extension. In this case, however, one party requested an open-ended extension and the other party replied by granting a thirty day extension. We do not believe, therefore, that there is an “exchange of letters” manifesting an agreement, for the writing indicates only a proposal offered by one of the parties answered by a counter-proposal.</p>

Left to our own devices, we would understand “thirty day extension” to mean an extension to run thirty days from the date the answer was originally due, August 31, 1986. Johnson’s attorney, however, intended the thirty days to run from <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>August 25, 1986.

Thus, the ambiguity is not only apparent from the face of the document, but it is actual in that our construction of the most probable meaning of the phrase “thirty day extension” is not what was meant at all. In sum, there is no agreement because the “thirty day extension” granted by plaintiff’s attorney is indefinite as to its application: the scrivener of the agreement states that it means something other than its plain meaning, and the opposing party insists that it means yet something else. Even in the absence of these disagreements based on the parties’ understandings of what was said during the telephone conversation of August 25, 1986, the “thirty day extension” of Johnson’s letter would be unacceptably ambiguous: it might refer to thirty days from the date the- answer was due, or thirty days from the telephone conversation, or even thirty days from the date of the letter. In the face of such uncertainty it cannot be said that an agreement exists.</p>

Instead of appealing, of course, SEPTA should have filed a petition to open or strike judgment in the Court of Common Pleas.
