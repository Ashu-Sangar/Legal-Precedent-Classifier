    <p id="b182-9" data-blocks='[["BL_182.7",182,[242,890,1149,732]]]'>Norman Lurie, a licensed dentist and the appellee herein, was arrested and charged with 22 counts of Medicaid Fraud. The charges arose out of his treatment of 13 patients while he was employed at a Philadelphia dental clinic during 1984. Each of the counts was separately charged as a violation of 62 Pa.S. § 1407(a)(1), § 1407(a)(4), § 1407(a)(7), and § 1407(a)(9) thus cumulating a total of 88 charges against Dr. Lurie. In the charges, the Commonwealth alleges (a) that the Department of Public Welfare (DPW) was billed for services not rendered; (b) that DPW was billed for non-compensable services; and (c) that certain billings for dental services made by the appellee to DPW were upgraded in order to obtain compensation greater than the actual work done would allow.</p>

The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argued that 62 P.S. § 1407(a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) required only reckless or criminally negligent conduct for criminal culpability. The trial court granted appellee’s <em>motion in limine </em>ruling that the culpability necessary to sustain a conviction under 62 Pa.S. §§ 1407(a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) is proof of a knowing or intentional presentation of fraudulent claims. The trial court held that proof of recklessness in presenting claims to the DPW could not sustain a conviction.

Rather, the Commonwealth vigorously submits that proof of recklessness on the part of the accused provider is sufficient to support a conviction. The Commonwealth’s argument is based upon the readily discernible fact that subsections 1407(a)(4), (a)(7), and (a)(9) do not contain “mens rea” or “intent” language. Contrasted with the language of § 1407(a)(1) which expressly requires a knowing or intentional act, subsections (a)(4), . (a)(7), and (a)(9) are silent with respect to the requirement of knowing or intentional conduct.</p>

The principle of statutory construction affirmed in <em>Revtai </em>is helpful in construing the provisions of the Medicaid Fraud Abuse and Control Act before us in the instant case.

      <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>The purpose of the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Control Act is “to eliminate fraudulent, abusive and deceptive conduct and practices that may occur.” Introductory paragraph of Act 1980, July 10, P.L. 493, No. 105. In speaking of “fraudulent, abusive and deceptive” conduct, the legislature most certainly is referring to willful conduct as opposed to recklessness or negligence. Subsection (1) of § 1407(a) declares it unlawful: (i) to <em>knowingly or intentionally </em>present for payment of any false or fraudulent claim for furnishing services or merchandise under medical assistance; (ii) to <em>knowingly or intentionally </em>present for payment any claim for medically unnecessary service or merchandise; (iii) to <em>knowingly </em>submit false information for the purpose of obtaining greater compensation than that to which the provider would be entitled; and, (iv) to <em>knowingly or intentionally </em>submit false information for the purpose of obtaining authorization to furnish medical services or merchandise.</p>
    <p id="b185-5" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[158,1292,1148,674]]]'>Subsection (a)(4) of § 1407 makes it unlawful to submit a claim for services or merchandise which was not delivered to a recipient. It is fundamental that to knowingly submit a claim for services, etc. that were not rendered is to present a false or fraudulent claim for payment. To recklessly or negligently present a claim for services, etc. which were not delivered does not amount to a knowing presentment of a false or fraudulent claim. Reading this provision in the context of the entire statute, including the “mens rea” requirement of subsection (a)(1), it is reasonable to conclude that the General Assembly did not intend to treat recklessness and/or negligence in presenting claims the same as willful fraud.</p>
    <p id="b185-6" data-blocks='[["BL_185.5",185,[158,1992,1146,365]],["BL_186.1",186,[250,315,1144,201]]]'>Subsection (a)(7) of § 1407 makes it unlawful to submit a claim which <em>misrepresents </em>the service or merchandise delivered, the date or dates of delivery, the identity of the person or persons who received the services or merchandise, the identity of the provider, etc. Again, it is fundamental that to purposely <em>misrepresent </em>any of the information described in subsection (a)(7), is to knowingly present a false or <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>fraudulent claim for payment. On the other hand, a claim which recklessly or negligently misrepresents any of the described information does not involve a knowing presentment of a fraudulent claim and is not accorded criminality.</p>
    <p id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.4",186,[248,534,1145,466]]]'>Subsection (a)(9) of § 1407 makes it unlawful to submit a claim for something that was not provided by the provider. This subsection is similar to subsections (a)(4) and (a)(7) in that purposely submitting a claim for a service or item not delivered by the provider-claimant is fraud and subject to the criminal sanctions of the statute. Where a provider recklessly or negligently submits a claim for a service or item not rendered, there is no fraud and criminal sanctions are not implicated.</p>

However, it would be wholly inconsistent and unreasonable for the General Assembly to make it a felony punishable by a maximum penalty of a fine of fifteen thousand ($15,000) dollars and a term of imprisonment of seven years for violating § 1407(a)(1) by <em>knowingly </em>or <em>intentionally </em>presenting any false or fraudulent claim for services or merchandise, and likewise deem it a felony with the identical maximum penalties under § 1407(a)(4) for recklessly or negligently submitting a claim for services or merchandise not delivered to the recipient. It is a principle of statutory construction that the legislature is presumed <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>not to intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable. <em>Hatchard v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, </em><a href="/pa/516/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="516 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1808614" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0184-01">516 Pa. 184</a>, <a href="/pa/516/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="516 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1808614" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0184-01">532 A.2d 346</a> (1987); 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1). The interpretation which the Commonwealth urges us to adopt and apply to § 1407(a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) most certainly would produce an absurd and unreasonable result. A provider who recklessly or negligently submitted a claim for services not delivered would be treated as a felon subject to a fine and imprisonment the same as a provider who schemed to intentionally defraud the medical assistance program. We cannot presume that the legislature intended such a result.</p>
    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[150,971,1149,1061]]]'>Additionally, the provisions of § 1407(a) are penal in nature and thus, must be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1); also see <em>Milewski v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa-commw/93/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="93 Pa. Commw. 120" data-case-ids="1341824" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/93/0120-01">93 Pa.

The Commonwealth argues that the principle that “penal laws are to be strictly construed” is an obsolete standard no longer applicable in this modern era. The Commonwealth cites Section 105 of the Preliminary Provisions of the Crimes Code which sets forth that: “The provisions of this title shall be construed according to the fair import of their terms.... ” 18 Pa.C. S.A. § 105. However, it is clear from the explicit language of Section 105 that the “fair import” principle of construction specifically applies to the provisions of the Crimes Code (Title 18). It does not supercede the “strict construction” standard outside of the Crimes Code prescribed by 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1). Thus, contrary to the Commonwealth’s assertions, both the trial court and the Superior Court correctly applied the “strict construction” principle to the penal provisions of the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Control Act, 62 P.S. § 1407(a).</p>

Subsection (a)(1) describes knowing and intentional conduct amounting to fraud. It describes conduct involving guilty knowledge. Similarly, § 1407(a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) specify conduct of <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>the same kind and nature as that delineated in § 1407(a)(1). Each of the relevant subsections describe fraudulent acts. All of the prohibited acts are classified as third degree felonies and all carry the same maximum fine and prison term.</p>
    <p id="b188-5" data-blocks='[["BL_188.4",188,[251,603,1147,403]]]'>Fraud involves deliberate and intentional conduct calculated to deceive. <em>Frowen v.

Reckless conduct or negligence is not conduct deliberately calculated to deceive.
