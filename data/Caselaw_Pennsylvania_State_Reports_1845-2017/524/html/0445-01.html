Other courts have not hesitated to hold government responsible for harm caused by its actions pursuant to Section 323. <em>See, e.g., Rosa v. United States, </em><a href="/f-supp/613/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="613 F. Supp. 469" data-case-ids="3777165" data-case-paths="/f-supp/613/0469-01">613 F.Supp. 469</a>, 476 (M.D.Pa.1985) (principle of liability set forth in Section 323 “has been held specifically applicable to the United States.”)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Thus, I would hold that political subdivisions have a duty 1) to erect barriers when locating a playground adjacent to a known hazard, and 2) to exercise reasonable care in maintaining those barriers once erected for the protection of the children who use the playground.</p>

      <p id="b585-6" data-blocks='[["BL_585.8",585,[193,2041,1142,304]]]'>. The majority further supports its decision by citing <em>Scarborough v. Lewis, </em><a href="/pa/523/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="523 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="1820316" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0030-01">523 Pa. 30</a>, <a href="/pa/523/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="523 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="1820316" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0030-01">565 A.2d 122</a> (1989), and by stating that it would be "jurisprudentially unsound and in violation of the fundamental principle of <em>stare decisis </em>for this Court to unsettle an area of law which we settled only four months ago.” Maj. op. at 451.
