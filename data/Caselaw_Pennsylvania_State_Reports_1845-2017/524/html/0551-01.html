He was due to return home before 9:30 p.m. that evening. The members of his family became concerned when he did not return home, and spent Sunday and Monday searching for him in the outdoor areas that he was known to frequent. His brother and brother-in-law" discovered the victim’s automobile at about 6:30 p.m., on Monday, June 11, and realized by the odor of decay that the victim, who could be seen slumped in the front seat of the vehicle as soon as they started to walk toward the vehicle from the road, was dead. The vehicle was parked on an isolated dirt lane, approximately 150 feet off of Route 601. This location, which was not far from the community of Windber, was well known to the victim who had spent many hours there on outings with his wife and two young children, gathering berries and edible plants.</p>

She was screaming and appeared to be frightened. Appellee had her purse in one hand and a knife in the other. She begged Mr. Varner to give her a ride, claiming that someone was going to kill her. Mr. Varner would not let appellee get into the vehicle because she had a knife, but he did let appellee sit on the hood of the vehicle, and he told her he would drive her to get help. Appellee appeared to compose herself while riding on the hood of the vehicle, and she placed the knife in her purse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Mr. Varner drove slowly for about one mile and stopped the vehicle near a house with lights.

As Mr. Boyer brought the dog under control, appellee asked Mr. Boyer how far it was to the nearest main road. Appellee, who did not appear to be crying or otherwise frightened or out of breath, stated that she had just punched her boyfriend in the nose. Mrs. Boyer then invited appellee into the Boyer home, where appellee, upon questioning, identified herself and her parents whom appellee stated lived in Richland Township, a nearby community. Appellee again said that she had punched her boyfriend in the nose, and further elaborated that she had run away <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>from him about a mile down the road. Mrs. Boyer noted that the Boyers had just returned to their home along Route 601 and had not seen appellee.

Appellee indicated that she had used her clothing to wipe the blood from her boyfriend’s face before she had run away from him. Mrs. Boyer, who had carefully scrutinized appellee, noticed that appellee did not have any scratches, bruises or brush burns and that appellee was missing one shoe. Appellee turned down Mrs. Boyer’s offer to call her parents, whom appellee stated were in Florida, or to call the police.</p>

Mrs. Boyer’s vehicle stalled, and as soon as she was able to restart it she immediately left the scene, fearful that appellee’s boyfriend would come after them. Then, Mrs. Boyer drove appellee to several locations in Windber while appellee tried to decide where to go. Eventually, appellee asked to be let off at what she identified as a friend’s place in an apartment complex called Stadium Terrace.</p>

When questioned, appellee said she had been throwing up and then told her boyfriend that someone had tried to rape her <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>and that she had stabbed him. Appellee did not call the police as allegedly urged by her boyfriend. Appellee and her boyfriend left the bar after appellee indicated she just wanted to go home to be with her daughter.

The baby-sitter did not believe appellee because appellee related the incident in a completely calm manner. Appellee asked the baby-sitter what she should do, and the baby-sitter suggested that appellee call the police. Appellee arranged to leave her daughter with the baby-sitter through the day so that appellee and her boyfriend could participate in a charity motorcycle event.</p>

Appellee’s boyfriend claimed that appellee showed him an area in the weeds where appellee claimed she had been knocked down by the victim. Appellee’s boyfriend stated that in a large area about fifteen yards from the road “[t]he weeds were all knocked over and busted up.” N.T. at 204 (Yol. I, Apr. 2, 1985).</p>

Then, appellee again asked the baby-sitter what she should do, and again the baby-sitter told her to go to the police. Appellee asked the baby-sitter if anything had appeared yet on the news about the incident, and appeared so calm that the baby-sitter again did not believe that anything had happened.

While walking to Windber, appellee claimed that the victim had stopped his vehicle and offered to give her a ride. She refused and walked on, but the victim again pulled his vehicle onto the berm, this time angling it toward the guardrails and blocking her path.

Appellee’s story of an attempted rape could well have not been believed by the jury. The fabrication of false and contradictory statements by an accused are evidence from which a jury may infer that they were made with “an intent to mislead the police or other authorities, or to establish an alibi or innocence, and hence are indicatory of guilt.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellee told the Boyers, when she arrived at their home after dark with blood on her clothes, that she had punched her boyfriend in the nose. She also told her boyfriend, her women friends, her baby-sitter, and the police that the victim had tried to rape her when, in fact, the physical evidence belied any such assault having occurred. The testimonial and physical evidence presented by the Commonwealth negated appellee’s version of the incident leading to the victim’s death, and gave the jury “a substantial object on which to rest and fold” the wings of their perplexity. Thus, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellee was not acting in self-defense when she killed the victim.</p>

Appellee, Patricia Ann Carbone, urges this Court to find that she was denied her right to a fair trial in that the victim’s widow was permitted to sit, over objection, at counsel table for the prosecution during voir dire and at trial.

Indeed, the prosecutor has some discretion in choosing those persons with whom he or she wishes to consult at counsel table during trial.</p>
