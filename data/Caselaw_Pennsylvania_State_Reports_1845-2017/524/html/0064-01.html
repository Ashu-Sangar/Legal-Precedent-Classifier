Todaro, and a co-actor, Larry Albert Kinsey, were apprehended traveling in an automobile containing items stolen in numerous burglaries committed in southern Somerset County. Both were charged with the burglaries and related offenses. Kinsey pled guilty, while Appellant chose to go to trial before a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Somerset County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant was convicted on four of the informations filed against him, each relating to a different burglary. As to each of the four burglaries, he was convicted of various and different charges, including burglary itself, theft, criminal mischief, conspiracy and violations of the Uniform Firearms Act, and was sentenced accordingly. The Superior Court, <a href="/citations/?q=378%20Pa.%20Super.%20653" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="378 Pa.

Although appellant raised three issues in his Petition for Allowance of Appeal, we granted the Petition limited to the issue of whether a mistrial must be declared where a co-actor is called as a witness by the Commonwealth, is sworn and takes the witness stand, and then leaves the witness stand, without explanation to the jury. We did so in order to determine <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>whether such conduct was consistent with our decisions in <em>Commonwealth v.

After being sworn, he quietly turned to the trial judge and requested to plead the Fifth, stating that he did not want to testify. The request was deemed proper since he had not yet been sentenced on his guilty plea.</p>

He granted a recess and, out of the presence and hearing of the jury, he heard the prosecuting attorney explain that the witness, the day before, had indicated he would have no problem in testifying. Defense counsel complained that he had told the prosecuting attorney two months before that the witness would invoke his Fifth amendment privilege and refuse to testify. He argued, therefore, that a mistrial must be granted in accordance with the rule we have laid down in <em>DuVal, supra. </em>At side-bar, the following exchange took place:</p>

No <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>explanations were given <em>or </em>comments made by anyone regarding the comings and goings of Kinsey.</p>

Under other circumstances, a hearing into the matter would have been justified and even necessary. Nonetheless, failure to hold such a hearing in this case did not lead to reversible error because, as the Superior Court properly found, Appellant was not prejudiced by what happened here in the first place.</p>

Although it could be argued that under certain circumstances, a refusal to testify on grounds of self-incrimination might have probative value in establishing an issue in a matter to which the witness was not a party, we have recently held that it is not permissible for either defense or prosecution to attempt to capitalize on such refusal. <em>Commonwealth v. Greene, </em><a href="/pa/445/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="445 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1940013" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0228-01">445 Pa. 228</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20865" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="285 A.2d 865">285 A.2d 865</a> (1971). Where it is the prosecutor who attempts to use such a device, there is a special vice: the inference to be drawn from the refusal to testify of the defendant’s co-defendant, accomplice or associate has <em>no probative value whatsoever </em>in establishing the guilt of the defendant. It is rather an effort to cause the jury to think "guilt by association.”</blockquote>

Here, however, the assertion of the privilege was not made within the jury’s hearing. It is difficult to see how they could draw any reasonable inference of anything. Appellant argues that when Kinsey was called and then permitted to leave without testifying, that the jury was already aware that Kinsey was involved in this particular case since there was prior testimony regarding Kinsey being an occupant of the automobile driven by Appellant. Thus, he argues, the appearance of Kinsey and his being excused from testifying for no apparent reason would be sufficient to prejudice him in the eyes of the jury. <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>Knowing that Kinsey had certain stolen items in his possession from the various burglaries, the jury could impute Kinsey’s guilt onto Appellant. This is the sheerest speculation! The jury was just as likely to conclude that Mr. Kinsey had decided at the last minute to testify against the Commonwealth and was dismissed for that reason. In truth, we conclude that there was nothing that occurred here that would be likely to cause the jury to infer <em>anything, </em>one way or the other. Taken to its logical conclusion, Appellant’s argument would lead to the discharge of every defendant who appeared in court but who declined to testify on his own behalf because the jury could always “improperly” infer that silence connotes guilt. That is absurd. It is the expressed, highlighted reference to the Fifth Amendment privilege that may prejudice or influence a jury, not mere silence itself. The trial court concluded that Appellant was not prejudiced by what happened here. We agree. That conclusion was reasonable and represents a sound exercise of discretion on the part of the trial court. We will not disturb it. A mere odd or unexplained occurrence during a trial does not justify the conclusion that the jury has drawn an inference prejudicial to the defendant. In accord, see, <em>Commonwealth v.
