Pepper attempted to reach an agreement through negotiations with Maritrans which would remove the client’s objections. Peter Hearn, Esquire, a partner in the firm not involved with Pepper’s representation of Maritrans, was given the task of effectuating the removal of Maritrans’ objections. Pepper suggested their two attorneys (D’Angelo and Haller) designated to handle Maritrans legal matters would not convey any information received from Maritrans to Pepper’s attorney (Messina) designated to represent the New York firms in the labor negotiations with a local of the ILA. This proposal, called a Chinese Wall, was not accepted and on December 1, 1987, Pepper ended its representation of Maritrans.</p>

The trial court found as facts that the meeting lasted thirty-five minutes; that strategies were discussed regarding Mari-trans’ desire to seek the marine transportation business in New York harbor if the New York firms’ labor contract negotiations broke down and a strike was called; that these strategies were discussed with D’Angelo and Haller from both a legal standpoint and a sound business perspective; and that the information conveyed by Maritrans at the November 5th meeting was deemed confidential by Mari-trans and was not to be conveyed to Messina.

At that meeting Messina and Hearn were told of information given D’Angelo and Haller by Mari-trans’ executives in the November 5th meeting.

Tool Works, the plaintiff, claimed a breach of the attorney-client relationship by defendant Kovac’s representation of others adversely in matters that were substantially related to confidential information he had acquired while representing the Tool Works.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court affirmed the lower court’s dismissal of the complaint, noting the case was neither a disciplinary proceeding nor an attempt to disqualify the lawyer and finding no breach of a fiduciary or confidential relationship. That case stands for the proposition that without evidence of imminent or actual disclosure, the violation of the prophylactic rule against representation of a former client’s adversary in a substantially related matter will not sustain an injunction against continued representation of the new client.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The reasoning of the Illinois Court in <em>Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. Kovac, supra, </em>reflects our view of the matter.</p>

Since no reference is made to the other two, as well as the three counts added by amendment, see p. 2 of this Memorandum Opinion, the five other alleged causes have been abandoned and thus will not be addressed.</p>
