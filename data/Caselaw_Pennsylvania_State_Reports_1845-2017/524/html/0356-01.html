Unterberger, an eighteen-year-old freshman at Bucknell University, attended a party held in his freshman dormitory, Trax Hall, and a second party hosted by the Kappa Chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity at their fraternity house. At both parties alcohol was served and was consumed openly by Unterberger. The owner of the neighboring fraternity house, Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity, subsequently filed a claim against Unterberger and a companion, Van Kingsley Sullivan, alleging that the two had negligently caused or failed to control a fire in the Lambda Chi Alpha house which resulted in over $400,000 in property damage. Unterberger filed a complaint to join Bucknell University, the Kappa Chapter of Sigma Chi, and Sigma Chi Fraternity as additional defendants, alleging that they were negligent in providing him, a minor, with alcoholic beverages at the parties he attended. Appellant alleged that this negligence proximately resulted in the conduct which caused the fire.</p>

However, appellant’s reliance on these cases is misplaced.</p>

In <em>Macleary v. Hines, </em>that court reiterated the reasoning of <em>Fassett </em>and developed the rule that the social host must have “intentionally and substantially aided and encouraged the consumption of alcohol by a minor guest____” <em>Macleary, </em><a href="/f2d/817/1081-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="817 F.2d 1081" data-case-ids="1671053" data-case-paths="/f2d/817/1081-01">817 F.2d at 1084</a>. We believe that that interpretation does not offend our case law but merely restates our position that a social host must have “knowingly furnished” alcoholic beverages to a minor. The “knowingly furnished” standard requires actual knowledge on the part of the social host as opposed to imputed knowledge imposed as a result of the relationship. In both cases the Third Circuit held as potential social hosts individuals who had participated in the planning and the funding of social events where alcohol was consumed by minors. In each instance the social host was aware of the degree of consumption by the minors. <em>See Macleary </em>and <em>Fassett, <a href="/f2d/807/1150-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="807 F.2d 1150" data-case-ids="1649731" data-case-paths="/f2d/807/1150-01">supra.</a> </em>The Third Circuit correctly determined in both instances that we would not restrict the application of the social host theory to solely those instances where the defendant was alleged to have <em>physically handed </em>an alcoholic beverage to a minor. <em>Macleary, </em><a href="/f2d/817/1081-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="817 F.2d 1081" data-case-ids="1671053" data-case-paths="/f2d/817/1081-01">817 F.2d at 1081</a>; <em>Fassett, </em><a href="/f2d/807/1150-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="807 F.2d 1150" data-case-ids="1649731" data-case-paths="/f2d/807/1150-01">807 F.2d at 1161</a>.

As previously stated, there are no allegations that either the fraternity or the University was involved in the planning of these events or the serving, supplying, or purchasing of liquor. The fact that the functions were held on property which arguably was owned by appellees is of no consequence in light of appellees’ detachment from the events in question. Appellees’ conduct is insufficient to establish them as social hosts for the purpose of finding potential liability.</p>

By definition such organizations are based upon fraternal, not paternal relationships. National organizations do not have the ability to monitor the activities of their respective chapters which would justify imposing the duty appellant seeks. The national organization in fraternal groups has only the power to discipline an errant chapter after the fact. It does not possess the resources to monitor the activities of its chapters contemporaneously with the event. Fraternal organizations are premised upon a fellowship of equals; it is not a relationship where one group is superior to the other and may be held responsible for the conduct of the other. From this factual matrix, there is no basis in the relationship to expand the liability of the <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>national body to include responsibility for the conduct of one of its chapters.</p>
