Two questions are presented for our consideration: a) whether the Visionquest facility satisfies the criteria to be characterized as a school under the township’s conditional use ordinance and b) whether the protestors met their burden of establishing that the proposed use would be detrimental to the community.</p>

      <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>The appellee operates a rehabilitative facility for youths, a majority of whom are referred to the program by the judicial system. The youths are generally adjudged juvenile delinquents. The program is known as a “wilderness” program and consists of outdoor experience combined with some traditional classroom instruction. It is one step in a three-phase placement program for these youths. The other steps include a “wagontrain experience” and a residential school facility, both of which are located elsewhere. The physical facility for the “wilderness experience” is located in an agricultural section of Honey Brook Township and is structured as a camp, with the “students” living in teepees they build themselves. There is one large “A” frame tent which houses the eating area for the students as well as an area for performing administrative functions and mass communication with the students.</p>
    <p id="b233-4" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[174,1202,1149,692]]]'>The Honey Brook facility was established in July, 1983, without appellee first obtaining the necessary approvals and licenses. The zoning ordinance for the area in which the facility was located is designated agricultural; allows conditional uses in such areas, including churches, schools and campgrounds; but expressly prohibits conditional uses for correctional institutions. (See n. 4, <em>infra.) </em>Since appellee sought no such approval prior to the commencement of operation, the appellant issued a cease and desist order in August, 1983. Thereafter, appellee filed an appeal from that order and an application for conditional use approval. A hearing was subsequently held by appellant, with all interested parties participating.</p>

Residents and neighboring property owners testified that this facility would have a substantial detrimental effect on the area. The Board of Supervisors denied the application, stating that appellee had not complied with all of the ordinance criteria. Specifically, the <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>Board found that while the proposed use was an educational facility,- the applicant had not presented any evidence that the proposed use was necessary or important to the Township.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Board concluded'that without satisfying that burden the application must fail.

The Court of Common Pleas of Chester County ruled that the Board misapplied the initial burden of the applicant but affirmed the denial of the conditional use permit on separate grounds. That court held that once the applicant had established compliance with the objective standards of the ordinance, the burden shifted to the protestors to show that the proposed use was not in compliance with subjective provisions. Specifically, the court held that once the Board concluded Visionquest was in fact a school<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> under the conditional use ordinance, the burden shifted to the protestors to show that the facility was not in compliance with the Township Comprehensive Plan or presented a detriment to <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>the community.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

No. 85-02017, slip op. at 10-16, (Common Pleas Court of Chester County, March 11, 1987). The protestors offered testimony that obscenities and loud noises could be heard every morning at the facility. Furthermore, the neighbors expressed concern over the possible dangers of a “student” who escapes. The court relied upon the apprehension of the residents to deny the application for a conditional use permit. Such concern was not without support considering the background of these youths, incidents of property damage at Visionquest’s Venango County facility, and the clear statement of Vision-quest that they would not accept responsibility for any property damage caused by an escaped youth. The court stated that the residents were not merely testifying about speculation or unsupported anxieties but were relating experiences with this Visionquest facility during its unauthorized and unapproved use.

Placement of the youths at this facility is an alternative to secure confinement, at the discretion of the court (N.T. at 26-27). All of the youths have demonstrated an inability to function in a regular school setting (N.T. March 26, 1984 at 24-25). The youths are not permitted to leave the premises without authorization and they are under observation on a twenty-four hour basis (N.T. at 82). Should a youth escape, the Visionquest staff is required to search and apprehend the youth.

That testimony stated that the “students” received some traditional classroom training in addition to the outdoor experience provided by the “wilderness camp.” Notwithstanding, the testimony of that expert concerning this facility was insufficient to establish the criteria of the conditional use ordinance. Throughout the testimony of the expert, it was clear that he had never visited the facility. His testimony was based solely upon conversations with instructors at the facility and pamphlets describing the project. Indeed, the witness conceded that this facility could be classified as a school only if it was in fact operated in the manner described in the pamphlets. (N.T. Sept. 13, 1983, at 88).

The conditional use ordinance clearly excluded “correctional or penal institutions” from this area. See, n. 4 <em>supra. </em>A flat assertion that traditional subjects are taught at the facility cannot establish that it is educational rather than penal in nature. The mere fact that the facility provides an educational experience does not make it a school. The primary function of the “wilderness” camp is penological in nature and, like many other penal institutions serving juvenile offenders, it offers some educational instruction. Providing “educational instruction” does not disguise the primary mission of Visionquest, which is to alter aberrant behavior patterns. The majority of the youths are adjudged juvenile delinquents and emotionally disturbed children referred to appellee by the court system. These are young people who are severely troubled and potentially dangerous (some rapists, drug addicts and violent assaulters). The appellee’s expert incorrectly suggested that the fact that this facility does not have a fence supports the conclusion that the facility is a school and not a penal institution. (N.T. at 78).
