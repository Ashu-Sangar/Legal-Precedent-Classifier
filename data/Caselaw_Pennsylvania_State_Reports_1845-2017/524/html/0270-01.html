    <p id="b395-9" data-blocks='[["BL_395.10",395,[192,1331,1147,580]]]'>This case involves the interpretation of the Pennsylvania Recreation Use of Land and Water Act, 68 P.S. §§ 477-1 to 477-8, as pertains to its purpose and applicability. We must determine whether the act provides immunity for all landowners whose land is used for recreational purposes, as it says, or whether its protection is limited to landowners who invite the public to use their land for recreation. We hold that the statute affords protection to owners whose land is used for recreational purposes free of charge, even though the landowner has not donated the land to the public for such purposes.</p>
    <p id="b395-10" data-blocks='[["BL_395.11",395,[191,1933,1146,418]]]'>The cause of action arose as follows. In 1984, Robert Friedman, appellant, was hunting on land adjacent to that of Grand Central Sanitation, Inc. Appellant inadvertently wandered onto the land of Grand Central, which was used as a sanitary landfill, though the land was posted with “no trespassing” signs. Appellant allegedly was overcome with fumes from waste material and fell into a large open trench, injuring himself.</p>

      <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>When he sued to recover for his injuries, Grand Central defended on several grounds. First, it claimed that in addition to posting its property, it deployed personnel to patrol the property and pursued a policy of prosecuting trespassers. Second, it claimed that appellant was injured in a trench which was so obvious and clearly visible that no one had ever fallen in it before so that appellant was contributorily negligent. Finally, it raised the immunity of the Recreation Use of Land and Water Act, claiming that appellant had entered on its land without charge for recreational purposes, implicating the act, and that Grand Central was therefore not liable for appellant’s injuries, having no duty to keep the premises safe or to give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on its premises.</p>

By its terms, Section 3 grants immunity to the “owner of land” without reference to whether the owner “invites or permits” others onto his or her property. Section 4 extends the same immunity to the owner who <em>does </em>somehow invite or permit recreational activity. Unlike Section 3, however, it further provides that those owners who “invite or permit” recreation do not thereby assure the safety of their premises or confer “the legal status of an invitee or licensee” upon persons using their premises. The need for this further grant of immunity arises from the complexity of landowner liability in our common law. A landowner traditionally has greater responsibility to persons whom the owner invites or permits onto the land than to mere trespassers. The act makes sense as written only if we view Section 3 as a general grant of immunity and Section 4 as an extension of that immunity to cover the special circumstances long recognized in the case law.

The previous act had provided: “No landowner of agricultural lands or woodlands shall be liable for the payment of damages for any personal injury suffered by any person while hunting or fishing upon the landowner’s property, except for any deliberate and wilful personal injury inflicted upon such person by such landowner.” The General Assembly enacting the Recreation Use Act, which repealed the broad immunity then existing under P.L. 1696, apparently felt it necessary to replace it with the immunity granted in section three of the Recreation Use Act, even though such immunity was not in direct furtherance of the purpose stated in section one.</p>

It would suggest that land which had been open for recreational purposes prior to 1966, when the Recreation Use Act was adopted, would fall outside the terms of the act because immunity could not encourage the owner to make his land available to the public for recreation inasmuch as he had already done so. <em>See, e.g., Livingston by Livingston v.
