In this appeal, we are called upon to decide the recurring question of whether employees who are involved in a work stoppage are eligible for unemployment compensation benefits under the provisions of section 402(d) of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, Act of December 5, 1936, P.L. 2897, as amended, 43 P.S. § 802(d) (1964). More specifically, we must decide whether a work stoppage which began on August 6, 1983 as a strike was converted to a lockout in October, 1983 when the employees union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local 1842 (Union), offered to return to work under the terms and conditions of the expired labor contract on a day to day basis while negotiations continued.</p>

The employer, Joy Manufacturing Company, intervenor-appellee herein, appealed from the OES determination. On March 29, 1984, a hearing on the employer’s appeal was held before an Unemployment Compensation Referee. On April 18, 1984, the Referee issued a decision and order affirming the determination of the OES and allowing benefits for the compensable week ending October 29, 1983 and subsequent thereto. The employer appealed from the Referee’s decision to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review. On May 17, 1985, the Board issued a decision and order which reversed the decision and order of the Referee and denied the appellant benefits. The appellant filed an appeal from the Board’s decision to the Commonwealth Court. The appeal was heard by a Commonwealth Court Panel and, in a 2-1 decision (Colins, J. dissenting), the Panel affirmed the <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>Board’s decision denying benefits. We granted appellant’s timely Petition for Allowance of Appeal. For the reasons that follow, we now reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

      <em>Background</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b598-5" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[239,637,1151,1217]]]'>The facts as found by the Board establish that the employer and the union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement which was effective on August 6, 1980, and expired at 12:00 midnight on August 6, 1983. (That agreement pertained to and covered manufacturing employees at the employer’s Franklin, Pennsylvania factory.) Negotiations for a new labor/management agreement commenced on June 7, 1983 and continued for fifteen sessions through June and July. On August 1, 1980, management and the union held their last negotiating session prior to the expiration of their bargaining agreement. The employees of the employer, Joy Manufacturing Company, who were members of the union and who were covered by the labor/management agreement worked their last day of work on August 4, 1983 under the labor contract which was set to expire on August 6, 1983. As of 12:00 midnight, August 6, 1983, the union and the employer had not negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement. The employees rejected new terms and conditions proposed by the employer and voted to strike effective midnight, August 6, 1983. Picket lines were formed and maintained at the Franklin plant by the union members commencing at 12:00 midnight, August 6, 1983 when the labor agreement expired.</p>
    <p id="b598-6" data-blocks='[["BL_598.6",598,[236,1875,1149,363]]]'>Additional negotiating sessions between the employer and the union were held on August 24, 1983, August 29, 1983, September 8, 1983 and September 28, 1983. At each of these additional bargaining sessions a mediator participated. Nonetheless, these continuing and additional efforts bore no fruit. The dispute was not resolved and no new agreement was reached.</p>
    <p id="b598-7" data-blocks='[["BL_598.7",598,[235,2258,1145,96]],["BL_599.1",599,[176,317,1148,1651]]]'>When the work stoppage began on August 6, 1983, all work units at the factory had work loads on the assembly <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>floor and in the assembly stalls. Following the commencement of the work stoppage and continuing for approximately four weeks, the employer maintained the partially finished work-in-progress on the floor and in the stalls. Thereafter, the employer removed the partially finished work-in-progress from its Franklin, Pennsylvania plant by transferring some of the work to its various service centers at other locations (in Pennsylvania and elsewhere) and shipping other of the work to independent outside vendors for completion and delivery to customers. The employer waited approximately four weeks before shipping the partially completed work-in-progress for completion elsewhere because, based on the history of previous labor/management negotiations, there was a good chance that a new labor agreement might be reached within that time frame. If the appellant through the union had offered to return to work at any time during the approximate four week period immediately following the work stoppage on August 6, 1983, the partially finished work-in-progress would still have been at the Franklin plant and work would have been available on a day-to-day basis. Once, however, the partially finished work-in-progress was removed from the Franklin plant and shipped elsewhere for completion, it was not possible to have it returned to the Franklin plant for completion. Further, in order to resume the level of operations that prevailed at the employer’s Franklin plant prior to August 6, 1983, a start-up period of 60 to 70 days was necessary. Additionally, after the shutdown from August 6, 1983 to October 19, 1983, the employer needed a preliminary start-up time of at least two days to perform maintenance on the machines which had been lying idle.</p>
    <p id="b599-4" data-blocks='[["BL_599.5",599,[177,1987,1146,365]],["BL_600.1",600,[244,318,1153,1162]]]'>On October 19, 1983, the union submitted three offers to the employer to settle the labor dispute. The first offer was to go back to work for a period of one year under the terms and conditions of the expired 1980 agreement and with the additional conditions that: (i) there would be continuing cost of living adjustments, and (ii) no disciplinary action would be taken against any employee who partici<a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>pated in the work stoppage. Under this offer, there was the further proviso that both sides would be bound by these terms for one year, and the agreement would not be subject to continuing negotiations. The employer rejected this first proposal. Next, the union proposed to settle the dispute and go back to work for one year under the precise terms and conditions of the expired 1980 labor agreement, without the continuing cost of living raises and without the stipulation of no disciplinary action against strikers. Again, under this offer, both sides would be bound for one year, and there would be no further negotiations concerning the terms of employment for that period. The employer rejected this second union proposal of settlement. Finally, the union offered to resume work under the terms and conditions of the 1980 collective bargaining agreement on a day-to-day basis while negotiations for a new labor agreement continued. Again, the employer rejected the union’s offer. At no time did the employer make a counter-proposal to any of the three union offers of October 19, 1983. Further, the employer did not even suggest what terms it would consider acceptable to permit the employees to return to work.</p>

Further, because all work in progress had been shipped to other locations, it was not practical to resume operations at that plant on a day-to-day basis. Eventually, the work stoppage was resolved and operations resumed effective November 20, 1983.</p>

The employer, Hershey Estates, rejected the union’s proposal and a work stoppage ensued. When the question of whether the work stoppage was a strike or a lockout for purposes of unemployment benefits came before us, we held that the union’s offer was not an offer to continue working for a reasonable time. In reaching this conclusion, we emphasized that Hershey Estates was primarily in the service business. Hershey Estates operated, among other things, a hotel, laundry, department store, community inn, etc. “The <em>nature of these industries </em>is such that it would be almost impossible to operate them adequately on a day to day basis.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=163%20A.2d%20535" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="163 A.2d 535">Id.,</a> </em>400 Pa. at 451, 163 A.2d at 537.

The employer is in the business of manufacturing mining machinery and equipment. There is nothing in the record which would tend to establish that the nature of the employer’s manufacturing business made it impossible or impractical to continue operations on a day-to-day basis. The record does establish however, that between August 6, 1983 and October 19, 1983 the employer voluntarily chose to remove all work in progress from the struck plant. The employer made this decision to ship all work in progress elsewhere for completion knowing full well that there was a possibility that the union could offer to restore the status quo and resume operations under the terms and conditions of the pre-existing contract. Obviously, the employer chose to have the work completed at other facilities in order to relieve the economic pressures caused by the strike. Economic pressure is one of the purposes of a strike. Without such pressures on the employer, reasonable and amicable settlements would be difficult to achieve.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> If an employer, in an attempt to lessen or relieve the economic pressures brought on by a lawful strike, clears its entire plant of work and commits the completion and delivery of that work to other company locations not affected by the strike and to independent vendors, it is not for the Unemployment Compensation Board to inquire into the economic justification of the employer’s actions. The nature of the employer’s manufacturing business and the work available at the Franklin plant on August 6, 1983 when the strike commenced indicate that a continuation of work on a day-to-day basis under the pre-existing terms and conditions of employment was not only possible, but entirely reasonable. When the union made the offer to resume work on a day-to-day basis on October 19, 1983 after the employer had summarily rejected two previous offers to return to work for one year, there was no reason for the union to believe that the offer was <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>anything but reasonable.

We do not favor gamesmanship in labor negotiations. It is essential that all parties approach negotiations with proper motives and deal with each other in good faith. It is in this context that we apply the <em>Vrotney </em>test and determine responsibility for the continuation of a work stoppage. In <em>High, </em>we held that each week of unemployment is the subject of a separate claim, consequently a work stoppage which begins as a strike may later become a lockout. <em>High v.

Knowing this, an employer cannot divest itself of all available work and then reject offers to resume work based upon a self created and unarticulated “new time frame” which the employer deems reasonable for an agreement to resume operations under the terms and conditions of the old contract.

The <em>Vrotney </em>test is to be applied without regard to the employer’s economic motives. In so applying the test here, we find that the union’s offer of October 19, 1983 to return to work on a day-to-day basis was an offer for a reasonable time. The nature of the employer’s manufacturing business does not render the resumption of operations on a day-to-day basis impossible or impractical. The employer had previously agreed to an extension of a labor contract with a different bargaining unit representing time study employees at the Franklin plant which provided for a <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>two-day termination notice. Obviously, this two-day period was considered reasonable by the employer.
