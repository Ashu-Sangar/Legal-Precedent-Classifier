Among the considerations listed in 501(b), is: “[t]he contribution by one party to the education, training or increased earning power of the other party.” 23 P.S. § 501(b)(6).

That is, from 1974 through 1979, plaintiff invested $34,000 more than the defendant did into the marriage. Second, the master considered that the parties separated when defendant’s increased earning potential was only beginning to be realized. Thus, plaintiff was precluded from enjoying the benefits of her five year investment in defendant, that is, in his potential for increased earnings. During that time, she sacrificed her ability to accumulate and to save assets, and her lifestyle. Finally, the master considered the different lifestyles that the parties now enjoy.

Prior to the 1988 amendment to Section 501, courts were left to their own devices to fashion some definition of fairness. After the 1988 amendment, it is clear that the General Assembly’s view of fairness in these circumstances implicates considerations that are similar to our own.</p>

While I realize that the Legislature has removed the “inability to provide” prerequisite for alimony as alluded to in <em>Hodge, </em>alimony continues to be based on need and the Legislature has set forth the factors to be considered in evaluating that need. One such factor is the contribution made by one spouse to the education, training or increased earning power of the other party. 23 P.S. § 501(b)(6). <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>Thus, if a spouse is in need of assistance for a period of time to increase her/his earning capacity, alimony may be appropriate.

The legislature has provided a comprehensive scheme to resolve the economic issues in a failed marriage, keeping in mind the purposes set forth in § 102. This Court is now imposing new provisions that run contrary to those purposes. For the foregoing reasons I cannot agree with the majority and therefore dissent.</p>
