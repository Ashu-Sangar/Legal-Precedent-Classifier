Appellant’s memorandum of law raised two issues: the first issue related to the doctrine of estoppel — Appellants argued they were entitled to the limit of the underinsurance policy, ($30,000.00), because of a misrepresentation by one of Appellee’s agents that was relied upon to its detriment; and the second issue concerned the possible awarding of delay damages as contemplated by Pa.R.C.P. 238. The parties agreed that in the absence of a finding of estoppel by the arbitrators, the limit of liability clause in the subject insurance policy would preclude the Appellants from recovering anything from the Appellee. The parties stipulated that there were two separate claims for injuries involved in this matter, which result<a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>ed in the death of William J.

Further, the arbitrators found that if each claim was considered separately, as was appropriate, and Appellee was given the reductions mandated by the policy, Appellee still remained liable for $15,000.00 for each claim or for a total of $30,000.00 which represented the policy limits on underinsurance. Additionally, although counsel for the Appellants under the policy indicated the issue before the Board was estoppel, with respect to Appellee’s claims investigator, the Board concluded that it was required to consider the facts, terms, and provisions of the policy, and the applicable law, in order to reach a fair and just decision, even if a particular issue was not pursued or raised by counsel.

They further held, that the arbitrators at bar exceeded the parameters of their power in awarding underinsurance benefits to the Appellants.
