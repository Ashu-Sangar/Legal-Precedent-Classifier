Post-trial motions were denied, and this Court assumed jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h) and Pa.R.A.P. 1941, concerning direct appeals of death penalty cases.</p>

He removed the victim’s body along with her purse and cash from the bar. After carrying Martin’s body outside and depositing it in the bed of his pickup truck, he drove to his grandparents’ vacant house, where he took the body inside. Shortly thereafter, he attempted to hide the body in a nearby woods.</p>

The blood samples obtained from Breakiron’s truck and clothing matched the blood type of the victim, and Breakiron was arrested.

We disagree. First, as we have indicated above, the Commonwealth may not introduce these materials into evidence or otherwise make known their existence at trial unless the defendant himself uses the reports. Second, although it is conceivable that the Commonwealth might exploit the reports to develop evidence that it would otherwise not have discovered (should the defendant admit to the psychiatrist, for example, that he committed the crime and that he hid a weapon in a particular location), the supplementary evidence also would be subject to suppression upon the defendant’s motion. <em>See Wong Sun v.
