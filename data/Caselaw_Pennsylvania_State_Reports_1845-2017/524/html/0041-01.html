The cause of death was listed as liver failure, which was a direct result of the assault. Before the jury retired to deliberate, the trial judge gave oral instructions on the legal issues involved. Over the objections of appellant’s trial counsel, the trial judge also sent with the jury written instructions pertaining to legal causation and the definitions of third degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both the involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault charges. Both parties stipulated to the merger of the charges for sentencing purposes and the appellant was sentenced to serve not less than three years nor more than ten years imprisonment.</p>
