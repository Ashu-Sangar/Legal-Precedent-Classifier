In the Court of Common Pleas the appellees herein, the Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT) and Michael Baker, Jr., Inc. (Baker), were held jointly and severally liable for injuries sustained by the appellant, Edward J. Marshall. The injuries were sustained in 1981 when appellant, an employee of the Mosites Construction Company (Mosites), was performing demolition work on a railway bridge that had been acquired by PAT. Mosites had been engaged by PAT to demolish the bridge in connection with the construction of a busway. Baker had been engaged to provide certain engineering and other services for the project. The accident occurred as appellant stepped onto a bridge beam, which, unbeknownst to him, had been cut with a torch. The beam collapsed, causing him to fall to the ground and suffer permanent injuries.</p>

The issue presented is whether yet another subsequent agreement, Supplemental Agreement No. 6, reinstated the duty to supervise jobsite safety procedures. It was this latter agreement that was in effect at the time of appellant’s accident. Supplemental Agreement No. 6 provides for “engineering management of the construction phase” and states in Section B(l) that Baker shall:</p>

The PAT-Mosites agreement contained a section denoted as “Safety and First Aid Require<a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>ments,” which stated that the contractor would not require laborers to work under conditions that posed dangers to their safety as determined by standards promulgated under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA). General Provision 4.11.1. The agreement further provided that, in the event Mosites failed to comply with such standards, where “such failure create[s] a hazard to life, limb or property, the Engineer <em>may </em>stop any operation of the Contractor affected by the failure until the failure is remedied.” General Provision 4.11.5 (emphasis added). Clearly, under the PAT-Mosites agreement, the engineering firm, Baker, was <em>permitted </em>to take action against perceived safety hazards. Although this authority was given to Baker, the PAT-Mosites contract also provided that Mosites “shall supervise and direct” the work and “be solely responsible for all construction means, methods, techniques, sequences and procedures____” General Provision 6.4.1. The determinative question is not, however, whether Baker <em>could </em>have acted to prevent the instant accident, but rather whether it had a <em>duty </em>to do so.</p>

Baker’s obligation under its contract with PAT was to “assure delivery,” see Section B(l) supra, of a completed project that met PAT’s specifications. To hold otherwise, by imposing a duty on Baker to be actively involved in procedures for safety compliance, would be inconsistent with the provision in the PAT-Mosites contract stating that Mosites “shall supervise and direct” the work and be <em>“solely </em>responsible for all construction means____” (Emphasis added).</p>

One of the other provisions in the PAT-Baker contract indicates that Baker’s duties pertaining to jobsite safety were to be passive in nature, not involving a duty to continually oversee the jobsite and seek out safety hazards. It is provided in Section B(16) of Supplemental Agreement No. 6 that Baker shall:</p>

Section B(16) clearly contemplated that Baker’s involvement with safety concerns would be of an indirect sort, requiring contractors to furnish certain paperwork and forwarding that paperwork to PAT, rather than being an on-site inspector. This duty is plainly of a lesser sort than that in the <em>original </em>PAT-Baker contract which, prior to its modification by Supplemental Agreement No. 4, required Baker to review “contractors’ practices and procedures to minimize hazards associated with construction operations.”</p>

Traditionally, our courts determined that the Commonwealth, as sovereign, could not be sued <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>against its consent. <em>Monongahela Navigation Co. v. Coons, </em><a href="/watts-serg/6/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 101" data-case-ids="480106" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0101-01">6 Watts &amp; S. 101</a> (Pa.1843). Local units of government also historically enjoyed court created immunity from tort liability. Apparently originating in the English case of <em>Russell v. Men of Devon, </em>100 Eng.Rep. 369 (K.B.1788), the doctrine was adopted in this Commonwealth at least by 1888. See, <em>Ford v. Kendall Borough School District, </em><a href="/pa/121/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="121 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="561227" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0543-01">121 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20A.%20812" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="15 A. 812">15 A. 812</a> (1888). The immunity of local government units, however, was not absolute. Liability existed for failure to maintain roads, bridges, and sidewalks; in actions based upon improper management and use of municipal property; and in cases in which the function was determined to be “proprietary” as opposed to “governmental.” See, <em>e.g., Shields v. Pittsburgh School District, </em><a href="/pa/408/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="408 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="1308385" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0388-01">408 Pa. 388</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.2d%20240" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="184 A.2d 240">184 A.2d 240</a> (1962). The distinction between those local units of government to which the governmental/proprietary concept applied and the Commonwealth was not enunciated as “governmental immunity” versus “sovereign immunity” until this Court’s decisions in <em>Ayala v. Philadelphia Board of Public Education, </em><a href="/pa/453/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="453 Pa. 584" data-case-ids="577621" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0584-01">453 Pa. 584</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20877" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="305 A.2d 877">305 A.2d 877</a> (1973), and <em>Brown v.

In <em>Ayala </em>we abrogated governmental immunity, but in <em>Brown, </em>we retained (albeit temporarily) the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Subsequent to these two cases, our courts ruled that such local governmental units as boards of education, townships, counties and cities, were no longer immune from liability. See, <em>Kitchen v.

In an attempt to resolve what that Court saw as an ambiguity, it looked to the PAT-Mosites contract as extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties as to what duties Baker undertook to perform in its contract with PAT and what, if any, duties were breached. The Commonwealth Court concluded in reading two sections of the two contracts together that Baker was never obligated under contract to control the manner in which Mosites performed its work, and that Baker never had a duty to inspect demolition procedures for safety compliance. Therefore, Baker owed no duties to PAT or Appellant which were breached or upon which a finding of negligence could be based. I do not agree.</p>
