Their pregnant daughter, Anmar el Zein, was also stabbed but both she and her child survived the attack. While the assailant was attacking Dr. Faruqui, Mrs. Zein was able to reach a telephone and call for help.

Both sets of prints were sent to the FBI for analysis and were determined to be a match. An arrest warrant was issued for appellant. In order to serve the arrest warrant, the detectives immediately contacted the Philadelphia Police Department where appellant was <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>incarcerated for an unrelated offense. The Philadelphia detectives arranged for him to be transported from the detention facility to the homicide division for the Montgomery Police to serve him with the warrant for his arrest.</p>

At the conclusion of this inquiry appellant said, “This is about Dr. Faruqui, isn’t it?” The Philadelphia detectives immediately informed him of his rights and proceeded to question the appellant further about the murders of the Faruquis. Appellant stated he had committed the murders and was willing to sign a written confession. At that point, the Montgomery County police arrived and served the arrest warrant on the appellant. The appellant then repeated his confession in the presence of the Montgomery police officers and the statement was transcribed by one of the Philadelphia detectives.</p>

He relied solely upon the defense of insanity. He claimed voices instructed him to commit these murders because the victims were having homosexual relations with Malaysian students. Two psychiatrists for the defense testified that, while the victims were not involved in illicit conduct with students, the appellant had a deeply hidden psychosis toward homosexuals and his belief that the victims were so involved triggered this attack. The Commonwealth provided three expert witnesses, each of whom stated appellant <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>was not suffering from criminal insanity at the time of the murders.</p>

In addition to the confession, there were several pieces of scientific evidence which further inculpated appellant. The matching fingerprints, blood types and hair samples all indicate he committed these acts. Finally, as previously mentioned, appellant has not denied he committed the acts; instead he has offered his alleged insanity in defense.

However, the affidavit supporting the arrest warrant did not mention an informant; it relied solely upon the matching fingerprints. The question of reliability is not called into play when a suggestion to compare fingerprints (those of appellant with those found at the scene) is made. Appellant’s privacy was not invaded nor was it necessary to invade his privacy in.order to make the comparison, for the fingerprints were already in the police files.

In the usual situation the judge is entrusted with determining the appropriate sentence, and the jury’s function is confined to determining the guilt of the accused.

By rendering this judgment, the jury is permitted to advise the sentencing judge to consider the fact of mental illness in the exercise of his sentencing decision. Capital cases are unique in that the jury and not the judge sets the penalty in such cases. The consideration of a possible verdict of guilty but mentally ill is a matter that would appropriately be rendered by a jury in a capital case during the sentencing phase as opposed to the guilty phase.
