This contract further provided that the “Rollins Protective System shall remain personal property and title thereto shall continue in Rollins,” that appellants were to refrain from damaging the system, and that upon termination of the lease, the system would be returned to Rollins. Additionally, the contract contained a $250.00 limitation of liability provision for all loss or damage resulting from failure of the system in operation or performance.</p>

The trial court denied this motion on the grounds that the written contract was not legally binding on the parties because it had never been executed by a representative of Rollins’ home office as expressly required as a condition precedent to the binding effect of the contract.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Accordingly, the case proceeded to trial not on the <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>written contract, but upon the contract implied by the actions, oral representations and course of conduct of the parties.</p>

In a unanimous opinion by President Judge Vincent A. Cirillo (joined by Judge Patrick R. Tamilia and Senior Judge John P. Hester), the Superior Court panel addressed each of these issues, and resolved all but one against Rollins. On this one last issue, Superior Court held that the provisions of the UCC regarding express and implied warranties and its statute of limitations were applicable to the transaction involving the lease of the burglar alarm system, and that the Cucchis’ complaint for breach of warranty under the UCC was untimely under section 2725, 13 Pa.C.S.A. § 2725, because it was filed more than four years after the system was delivered.

Hazard, Jr., Chairman of the Permanent Editorial Board for the Uniform Commercial Code. The drafters of Article 2A-Leases decided, according to the official comments, that Article 2-Sales was “the appropriate statutory analogue” for conventional leases of goods since the “lease is closer in spirit and form to the sale of goods than to the creation of a security interest.” Thus, many of the provisions of Article 2A-Leases were adopted and modified from Article 2-Sales to apply to conventional or “true” lease transactions, with very little change in many instances from the corresponding provisions in Article 2-Sales.</p>

However, the assumptions underlying Article 9-Secured Transactions were deemed to be different, and more analogous when dealing with “leases” of goods that were actually finance devices. The assumptions for finance leases/security devices are that parties to these types of transactions are regularly represented by counsel, that the agreement of the parties in these transactions is frequently reduced to writing, extensive in scope, that the obligations between parties in these transactions are essentially unilateral, and because applicable law limits the freedom of contract in these transactions.</p>

The express warranty found by the trial court and jury in this case was that the burglar alarm system would provide “safety,” which, considering the nature of the goods leased, meant protection from unauthorized intrusion. While these warranties, express and implied, do not in and of themselves “explicitly extend” to future performance, this explicit extension is manifest from all of the circumstances where these parties quite clearly bargained for a continually operational burglar alarm system for the duration of the lease. Indeed, the very nature of a conventional lease of goods with monthly payments by the lessee and the continuous obligation of the lessor to service and repair, especially where (as here) the goods are to be returned in working order to the lessor at the end of the lease, supports a finding that the future performance of the goods has been warranted, and that the goods will continue to operate and remain fit for their ordinary and intended use.</p>

In tort cases, the objective is to modify a course of behavior through the allocation of financial risk upon the party in the best position to prevent the harm. In contrast, contract law contemplates that the parties to an agreement have volunteered to accept certain risks or financial responsibilities throughout the life of the contract.

This analysis is a stark departure from the exception stated under Article 2’s limitation provision for breach of warranty actions, 13 Pa.C.S. § 2725. The majority looks to the circumstances surrounding the transaction to create a warranty “explicitly” extending to the future performance of the goods. Resorting to an analysis of the surrounding circumstances, the majority creates a warranty that <em>explicitly </em>extends to future performance by <em>implying </em>the existence of the warranty from the circumstances.</p>

The alarm system was installed in the Cucchis’ residence in 1973. Delivery of the alarm system was, therefore, tendered in 1973. This date of delivery is not affected by the fact that the lease of the alarm system was continually renewed every time the Cucchis made another payment to Rollins or that Rollins periodically made repairs on the alarm system and replaced some of its parts. Only if Rollins had repossessed the alarm system and then reinstalled it or another system in the Cucchis’ home every time the Cucchis renewed their lease would the warranties begin anew with the Cucchis’ renewals of their lease.

The same argument applies to nearly all warranties. If we held that the warranty in this case “explicitly extended” to future performance, we would allow the exception to swallow the rule. Commonplace warranties such as those which guarantee the number or quality of widgets a particular machine can produce or the number of pounds a particular truck can haul all would “explicitly extend” to future performance. The drafters of the Code would not have intended this result.

This reading of Section 2725 does not render Mack’s warranty “meaningless.” Mack remained open to any suit for breach brought within four years of tender.
