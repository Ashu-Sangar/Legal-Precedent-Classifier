Mr. Smith sent the crew to the house with instructions to do whatever was necessary to repair the roof. A crew was dispatched to the house and upon an inspection of the roof, the crew foreman determined that a new roof was required. The crew, without conferring with the Respondent, removed the old roof and installed a new roof. Upon their completion, the crew returned to their workplace and were paid by Smith Roofing, Inc., for their work.

The new roof was delivered in such a manner that the Respondent could not have prevented its installation nor could he return it after it was installed.

In the latest chapter of the sad saga of the Philadelphia Roofer’s scandal, the majority opinion, by intimation, excoriates the constitutionally mandated Judicial Inquiry and Review Board (“JIRB”). The opinion makes no real attempt to apply controlling, unanimously held case law while simultaneously justifying the acceptance of a gift of substantial value by posturing the recipient as merely an <em>“unwitting </em>participant” (original emphasis), at 65. It artfully dis-creates this Court’s requirement that all members of the judiciary disclose their financial status and activities each year. If such spuriousness is accepted in exoneration of the conduct here involved, public confidence in the integrity of our judicial system can appropriately be expected to sink to unimagined depths.</p>

Snyder, </em><a href="/pa/514/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="514 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="1804544" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0142-01">514 Pa. 142</a>, 151, <a href="/pa/514/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="523 A.2d 294" data-case-ids="1804544,1804599" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0142-01,/pa/514/0141-02">523 A.2d 294</a>, 300 (1987) (Nix, C.J., Concurring Opinion joined by Flaherty, J.).

It <em>shall order </em>... [the form of discipline] ..., as it finds just and proper.” To <em>suggest </em>that this broad scope of review was vested in this Court by the people of this Commonwealth because of an apprehension that the members of the Board would abuse the rule of confidentiality that surrounds their deliberations, would give vent to personal animosities, would re<a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>spond to base personal predilictions or prejudices, or would deliberately and knowingly render an unfair judgment demeans the intelligence of the people and distorts the motives of the electorate of this state, for such a suggestion has no foundation in fact.</p>

It is a recognition that the honest and fair judge is vulnerable to unjustified and scurrilous attacks upon his character by those who may be offended by his proper exercise of the office. <em>See, Boettger v. Loverro, </em><a href="/pa/521/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="521 Pa. 366" data-case-ids="1817503" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0366-01">521 Pa. 366</a>, 377, <a href="/pa/521/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="521 Pa. 366" data-case-ids="1817503" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0366-01">555 A.2d 1234</a> (1989). To suggest that the rule of confidentiality might invite a Board of this stature to “indulge its suspicions, yield to public pressure, even its whims, send zealous agents with a deliberate intent to find grounds to bring a judge beneath its influence for good or purposes of their own”, at p. 60, reflects a siege mentality totally unrelated to reality and casts grave aspersions upon the integrity of highly respected citizens of this Commonwealth who have been called upon to volunteer to perform an important societal function. While we may disagree in a particular instance with the judgment of this body, it is unseemly to invite general suspicion of the body as an institution.</p>

The record reflects that, during an interview with a member of the FBI, Judge Chiovero stated his reason for calling Mr. Traitz on that occasion was to receive a recommendation as to roofing contractors. In prompt response to this conversation, a roofing company installed an entirely new roof on the Judge’s residence. The testimony of record also reflects that the company never received payment for the labor and material involved in the installation of that roof. Both the owner of the contracting company and the crew foreman testified that no bill was ever issued to Judge Chiovero, nor was payment ever received. That testimony was not disputed by Judge Chiovero. Therefore, that testimony can be believed without question.</p>

The majority asks the public to accept the conclusion that Judge Chiovero’s inquiry was not intended to elicit the response of a gift by Stephen Traitz. That conclusion would not be difficult to accept if Judge Chiovero had paid for the work involved after it was apparent that he was not being billed; such action by Judge Chiovero would have prevented any appearance of impropriety. However, that was not the case. As stated previously, the majority gratuitously characterizes Judge Chiovero as an “unwitting participant” in this gift, at 65, and suggests that a judge should not be legally bound to pay for something which he did not explicitly authorize and which he can not return.

Although Judge Chiovero did not directly contact the contractors who performed the work, his inquiry to Stephen Traitz concerning roofing work set in motion the wheels of favors and influence.

The majority’s attempts to shift the burden of the donee, set forth in <em>Cunningham, </em>by stating, “More importantly, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that the respondent [Judge Chiovero] was aware of any improper motives when he accepted the new roof.” At 65. However, the Court in <em>Cunningham </em>clearly placed the burden on the jurist to legitimize any gift brought into question by the Board. Therefore, without any testimony of Judge Chiovero to explain the reason for a gift from a union businessman, with whom he had no prior relationship, the conclusion of impropriety drawn by the Board must be accepted.</p>

This is ingeniously accomplished by affording Judge Chiovero another opportunity to answer question 11 of the Statement of Financial Disclosure more fully, and with impunity, because the charges brought against Judge Chiovero are dismissed with <em>prejudice. </em>At pp. 198-199.
