The two, who had been close friends since third grade, both lost all their money while gambling. After conferring as to potential sources of additional funds, appellant advised Draper that he knew a man, Amos Nor-wood, who lived nearby from whom they could extort money. Unfortunately for Mr. Norwood, age 56, extortion was merely the opening scene in his personal tragedy.</p>
    <p id="b346-6" data-blocks='[["BL_346.5",346,[243,1946,1145,152]],["BL_347.1",347,[170,317,1148,354]]]'>After discussing the proposed extortion, appellant and Draper then proceeded to the Norwood residence. While Draper waited at a nearby corner, appellant spent fifteen <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>minutes in Norwood’s house before rejoining Draper with ten dollars he had secured from Norwood. As he was exiting Norwood’s residence, appellant crossed paths with Norwood’s wife, Mamie. Although they did not know each other, appellant said hello to Mrs. Norwood as she passed by. Draper witnessed this exchange, although he did not know Mr. or Mrs. Norwood.</p>
    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[169,695,1149,843]]]'>After securing the ten dollars from Norwood, appellant and Draper returned to the scene of the gambling but the participants had taken a break and were merely “rapping” i.e. talking. The pair remained, talking with the others. As misfortune would have it, Mr. Norwood, two or three hours later while on his way to his church to do some volunteer work, was driving by the intersection where the “rapping” was occurring. Appellant, upon seeing Norwood, flagged his car down, got in the car and drove away. A few minutes later, he returned with Norwood to the intersection, got out of the car and said to Draper “play it off like you going home, like you want to ride home, and we gonna take some money.” Draper, grasping appellant’s plan, got in the car with appellant and Norwood, and proceeded to give Norwood false directions home, leading Norwood instead to a dark secluded area adjacent to a cemetery.</p>
    <p id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[168,1557,1148,622]]]'>At that point, Draper, who was in the rear driver’s side seat, grabbed Norwood from behind and appellant, in the front passenger seat, ordered Norwood to “be quiet and get out of the car.” Appellant, Draper and Norwood exited the car, climbed over a small fence and proceeded into the cemetery. Upon arriving at some tombstones, Norwood was ordered to lie face down. Appellant and Draper searched Norwood and found twenty dollars hidden in his sock. While Norwood was begging for his life, the assailants tied his hands behind his back with his shirt, tied his legs together with his pants and stuffed his socks in his mouth.</p>

After some discussion between appellant and Draper,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> appellant commenced repeatedly hitting Norwood about the head with the tire iron. Appellant, while hitting the victim, said to Draper, “Man, you with me. We got to do this together.” Whereupon, Draper joined in the brutality, striking Norwood’s head repeatedly with the socket wrench, while appellant was smashing him with the tire iron.</p>

The pair then returned to the victim’s car, emptied the contents of the glove compartment into a trash bag and dumped the bag into a nearby trash bin. They then drove to Draper’s house, where he got ready for work.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> After making arrangements to meet the next morning, Draper went to work and appellant drove the victim’s car to downtown Philadelphia to meet Ronald Rucker, a friend of some two months.</p>
    <p id="b348-6" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[252,1292,1148,473]]]'>Rucker testified at trial that upon meeting appellant that night, appellant called him aside and confided to him that he had just “offed” a guy named Amos. Rucker testified that although he did not believe appellant at first, he came to believe him when he noticed blood spots on appellant’s shoes and when he accompanied appellant for a drive shortly thereafter in the victim’s car. After dropping Rucker off very late in the evening, appellant returned to the cemetery, soaked the victim’s body in gasoline and set it on fire.</p>

Their purpose was to retrieve the contents of the glove compartment and determine if there was anything of valué to them. In the victim’s wallet, they found a Mastercard and an AT &amp; T telephone card, both in the victim’s name. Appellant advised Draper that he knew a <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>person, Ronald Rucker, who could help them make use of the credit cards. The pair then picked up Rucker and, after Rucker confirmed that the Mastercard was usable,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> the trio drove to Atlantic City, with the intention of using the Mastercard to secure cash advances. Prior to the trip to Atlantic City, Rucker and Draper had never met each other.</p>

Later in the evening, appellant slipped away from his companions and, unbeknownst to them, secured two (2) one hundred dollar cash advances on the card. While at the casinos, Ronald Rucker used the AT &amp; T telephone card to make various telephone calls. The next day, June 13, 1984, appellant used the Mastercard, by signing Norwood’s name, to purchase two gold chains at a jewelry store in downtown Philadelphia.</p>

Despite the burning and extensive decomposition, it was possible to identify his body through his dental records. Because of incautious use of the AT &amp; T telephone card, the ensuing investigation led police to Ronald Rucker and his sister, Renee. On July 18th and 19th, 1984, Ronald Rucker gave two statements to police implicating appellant and Marc Draper. Although Rucker told appellant he was interviewed by the police, he did not tell appellant how deeply he had implicated him during the police interviews.</p>

In the instant case, the Commonwealth presented direct evidence from Marc Draper, appellant’s longtime friend as to appellant’s actions at the murder scene. This evidence was bolstered by Ronald Rucker’s testimony that appellant had admitted to him his participation in the killing and the burning of the corpse. In addition, there was testimony from Mrs. Nor-wood placing appellant in the victim’s company on the day of the murder and appellant’s own testimony that he shared the proceeds of the robbery/murder, i.e. that he used the victim’s Mastercard and car. Also, by way of physical evidence, there was testimony from Ronald Rucker about appellant’s blood splattered shoes and testimony from the police regarding the recovery of the victim’s jacket from appellant’s bedroom.

Especially damaging was the credibility gap created by appellant’s testimony with regard to the four letters to Draper delineating the “story” to be used in Draper’s proposed retraction. Appellant, after hearing testimony from a handwriting expert, admitted writing the letters but claimed that he was merely the stenographer for a story actually concocted by Draper.

Robinson’s testimony was to the effect that Draper, a prison mate of Robinson’s, had told him that “another guy”, other than appellant, had committed the murder with Draper. The prosecution brought out Robinson’s homicides to establish that Robinson was biased against Draper because Draper’s father, a police officer, had participated in the investigation leading to Robinson’s homicide convictions. Testimony was adduced from the former prosecutor who handled the Robinson case that during discovery Draper’s father’s name was given to Robinson’s attorney, as part of a list of officers involved in the investigation.

In the scenario testified to by appellant on direct examination, since Michael Hopkins, appellant’s deceased purported murderer of Norwood, and Draper murdered Donna Freedman, Draper could not implicate Hopkins in the Norwood murder for fear Hopkins would implicate him in the Freedman murder. On cross-examination, the prosecution was permitted, to a limited extent, to explore the Freedman murder to impeach appellant’s scenario. When the prosecution asked appellant whether he-was a suspect in the Freedman case, objection was promptly made and sustained and the question was stricken. Accordingly, in no way whatsoever was the jury “informed” that appellant was a suspect in the Freedman murder. Indeed, the Freedman murder would never have been mentioned in the trial if not for appellant’s own testimony. Moreover, the trial court, on numerous occasions throughout the trial and in its instructions, advised the jury that the questions asked by the respective attorneys were not testimony, only the answers adduced. Since there was no answer adduced with respect to whether appellant was a suspect in the Freedman murder and the <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>issue itself was raised first by appellant, his averment of error is without merit.</p>

As a general principle, trial counsel is presumed to be effective and a defendant has the burden of proving otherwise. <em>See Commonwealth v. McNeil, </em><a href="/pa/506/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="506 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1790951" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0607-01">506 Pa. 607</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="506 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1790951" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0607-01">487 A.2d 802</a> (1985). Moreover, to prevail on a claim of ineffectiveness, a defendant must demonstrate that the course followed by trial counsel was unreasonable, that another meritorious course was available and that defendant was prejudiced by counsel’s ineffectiveness. <em>See Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967) and <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant, however, again misstates the record. The record shows that counsel, as part of his requested charges, sought cautionary instructions as to the reliability of the testimony of (1) an “informer-interested witness”, (2) an “immunized witness” and (3) an “accomplice.” Indeed, the trial court’s instructions included the following, “In view of the evidence of Marc Draper’s criminal involvement, you must regard him as an accomplice ... you should view the testimony of an accomplice with disfavor because it comes from a corrupt and polluted source.” Moreover, from his opening statement throughout his cross examination of Draper to the closing argument, defense counsel consistently emphasized the benefits arising to Draper from cutting a “deal” with the Commonwealth, i.e. he was permitted to plead guilty to second degree murder and receive a sentence of life imprisonment rather than face a first degree murder charge and the possibility of the death penalty. Accordingly, counsel was not ineffective with respect to the impact of Draper’s deal on his credibility.</p>

      <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>Appellant’s two other allegations of ineffectiveness are related in that they both involve the definition of reasonable doubt. Appellant objects to the trial court’s definition of reasonable doubt as a “doubt that would cause a reasonably careful and sensible person to hesitate before acting upon a matter of importance in his own affairs.” He also objects to his trial counsel’s use of the analogy of purchasing a home while discussing reasonable doubt in his closing argument. Appellant’s argument is that both definitions or descriptions are “future oriented” dealing with “uncertainty and risk taking,” rather than a retrospective evaluation of past events. Although appellant’s argument has some facile appeal, it is thoroughly specious. He emphasizes the time component of the analogies while their real point is the relationship or connection between the level or type of doubt and the need to hesitate before acting or, in the case of a jury, making an important decision.</p>

In this Commonwealth, for <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>purposes of the Crimes Code, a person who has attained the age of eighteen is treated as an adult.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> The jury in this case was made fully aware of appellant’s age.

The Commonwealth, in presenting its argument for the death penalty, is permitted to examine the facts surrounding the convictions of the violent felonies. <em>Commonwealth v.

While it is true that <em>any </em>fact or circumstance about the defendant may be presented to a jury as a potential mitigating factor, it is not the duty of a trial attorney to list for the defendant an exhaustive list of potential areas of mitigation; such a list would go on forever. The record in the instant case reveals that trial counsel, on a number of occasions, advised appellant that he should be prepared, in the event of his conviction, to supply counsel with factors about his life that could be seen as mitigating. Appellant failed to provide such information. Moreover, the alleged “good” record appellant now asserts is grounded in a letter dated April 13, 1987 from a corrections counselor at Huntingdon prison to appellant’s appellate counsel. The letter, which addressed appellant’s fourteen month stay at Huntingdon, can best be described as a lukewarm endorsement. While it notes that appellant exhibited a “cooperative attitude” in counselling sessions, it also reveals that his prior facility characterized his adjustment as “not being satisfactory at all times” and during his stay at Huntingdon, he received two conduct violations. Furthermore, if evidence of appellant’s “good” prison record was introduced by trial counsel, the Commonwealth, in rebuttal, could have emphasized that during his stay at Huntingdon, appellant was passing notes to Marc Draper <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>for the purpose of suborning perjury.
