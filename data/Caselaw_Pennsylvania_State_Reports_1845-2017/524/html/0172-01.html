We conclude that the motions must be filed to perfect an appeal of a summary conviction initially tried in the Court of Common Pleas, however, for the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>

    <p id="b298-8" data-blocks='[["BL_298.8",298,[225,1499,1149,472]]]'>In 1986, Appellant was summoned to court for what allegedly were new violations of the same statutes; however, the record contains nothing to indicate that a new complaint was filed against Appellant. Five hearings were held on this matter between April 22, 1986 and November 18, 1986, and Appellant, again appearing without counsel, was ordered to pay a fine of $100.00 following the hearings held on October 21, 1986 and November 18, 1986. Appellant paid her fine shortly thereafter.</p>

On February 27, 1987, Appellee filed a Motion to Quash the appeal on two grounds: that Appellant had failed to preserve the substantive issues raised in the appeal <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>by failing to file post verdict motions, which were required by Pa.R.Cr.P. 1123; and that the appeal was moot because the fine imposed by the court had been paid. Superior Court granted the Motion to Quash on July 16, 1987, and denied reconsideration of same on August 14, 1987. We granted allocatur to consider whether Appellant had waived the substantive issues raised before Superior Court. Appellant first argues that the issues were not waived because post verdict motions were not required to be filed in this case.</p>

The Rule further provides that “this rule shall provide the exclusive means of appealing from a summary conviction.” Pa.R.Cr.P. 86(g). The comments to Pa.R.Cr.P. 86, however, state: “upon appeal from a conviction in a summary proceeding and after a finding of guilt at a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Court of Common Pleas, Rule 1123 is intended to require post-verdict motions in the common pleas court.” In addition, the comments to Pa.R.Cr.P. 1123 note that “[t]his rule is intended to require post-verdict motions in the court of common pleas after a finding of guilt at a <em>de novo </em>trial in a summary case”.</p>

Under this Rule, all truancy cases in Philadelphia are assigned to be heard in the Family Division, rather than in Philadelphia Municipal Court. Therefore, the instant case was initially brought in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, in the Family Division.</p>

Appellant had already been tried in the Court of Common Pleas, however, and to argue that she should have sought a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Court of Common Pleas <em>from </em>the Court of Common Pleas is absurd.</p>

In Philadelphia, this is not true. Though there is no Rule of Criminal Procedure that explicitly states that post verdict motions must be filed after a summary trial is initially held in the Court of Common Pleas, it seems that if such motions <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>are required after a trial <em>de novo, </em>they must be required after an initial trial. Since this case was <em>initially </em>brought in the Court of Common Pleas, Appellant’s route of appeal was to Superior Court, and the comments to both Pa.Rules Cr.P. 86 and 1123 support our conclusion that post verdict motions should have been filed in this case.</p>
    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[189,670,1150,1121]]]'>Appellant further argues, however, that if such motions were required to be filed, she should not be deemed to have waived consideration of the substantive issues raised in her appeal because she was not aware that such motions were required. Following a summary trial <em>de novo </em>or an initial summary trial, the defendant is to be informed by the judge or issuing authority of his right of appeal, and that either a notice of appeal or post verdict motion, whichever is appropriate, must be filed to preserve the issues for appeal. <em>See, </em>Pa.Rules Cr.P. 86, 1123. The Stipulation in Absence of Transcript that was prepared relative to the hearings of October 21, 1986, and November 18, 1986, does not indicate that Appellant was informed by a judge of her right to appeal, or of the requirement that post verdict motions must be filed. There is no additional evidence in the record to show that Appellant was so informed. Also, counsel was not retained by Appellant during the time period allowed for filing of such motions. Since the trial judge was, pursuant to Pa.R.Cr.P. 1123, <em>required </em>to inform Appellant of her appeal rights, we hold that Appellant has not waived the substantive issues raised to the Superior Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court granting the Motion to Quash is vacated, and the case <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>remanded to the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Such are motor vehicle violations, i.e., stop sign and red light cases.

All this for a <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>fine of $25.00!
