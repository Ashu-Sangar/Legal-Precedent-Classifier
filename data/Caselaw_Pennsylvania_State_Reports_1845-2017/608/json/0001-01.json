        "text": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nThis appeal concerns the appropriate method, under the Third Class City Code, for calculating police pension benefits.\nAppellants, Ronald Gontarchick and Marlin Reed, each served as full-time police officers for Appellee, City of Potts-ville, for more than twenty years. Upon retirement, both submitted demands for pension benefits to the City\u2019s police pension fund, as established under the Third Class City Code. The demands were based on each officer\u2019s total gross compensation in the last month of his service, including compensatory-time, overtime pay, clothing allowance, and service increments.\nIn calculating benefits, the City\u2019s pension board used a gross-compensation figure consistent with the demands. Nevertheless, the board refused to base the calculation on the actual, last-month-of-service rate of compensation as Appellants sought. Instead, consistent with past practices, the board averaged Appellants\u2019 compensation over their last twelve months of service, before reducing the resultant figure by one-half to determine the monthly pension benefit. See Pottsville, Pa., Ordinances ch. 46, art. I, \u00a7 10(B) (providing for police pension benefits at one-half of monthly salary or the highest annual salary from the last five years).\nIn response, Appellants commenced a civil action in the court of common pleas \u2014 containing declaratory judgment, mandamus, and civil rights counts \u2014 seeking a recalculation of benefits consistent with their demands. Appellants relied on Article XLIII, Section 4303 of the Code, which provides, in relevant part, that police pensions are to be based on officers\u2019 \u201crate of monthly pay\u201d as of the retirement date, as follows:\nThe basis of the apportionment of the pension shall be determined by the rate of the monthly pay of the member at the date of ... retirement, or the highest average annual salary which the member received during any five years of service preceding ... retirement, whichever is the higher[.]\n53 P.S. \u00a7 39303(a) (emphasis added). Although the phrase \u201crate of monthly pay\u201d is not defined in the statute, Appellants took the position that the words denote the actual gross rate of all compensation paid in the last month of service.\nOn cross-motions for summary judgment, the common pleas court agreed with Appellants\u2019 position, which it regarded as consistent with Section 4303\u2019s governing language. The court reasoned that, had the General Assembly intended the use of an average of the last twelve months\u2019 salaries, it would have expressly said as much. Thus, the common pleas court entered judgment in Appellants\u2019 favor.\nOn appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of the City. See Gontarchick v. City of Pottsville, 962 A.2d 703 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008). Initially, the court expressed concern that Appellants\u2019 construction of Section 4303 resulted in an inexplicable disparity between police and firefighter pensions, which it characterized as inequitable and unreasonable, and thus, contrary to presumptions applicable in statutory construction. See, e.g., 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1) (reflecting the presumption that the Legislature does not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable). Furthermore, the Commonwealth Court highlighted the presumption that the General Assembly intends to favor public over private interests. See Gontarchick, 962 A.2d at 708 (referencing, indirectly, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(5)). The court reasoned that Appellants\u2019 construction would not serve the interests of the City and the public, as it would generate uncertainty regarding future pension fund needs. The Commonwealth Court thus concluded that the City\u2019s approach of using an average of the last twelve months of salary to arrive at a rate of monthly pay for police officers was a reasonable and appropriate reading of the governing statute.\nAs reflected in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion, this case presents an issue of statutory construction, over which the appellate review is plenary.\nIn their arguments to this Court, Appellants maintain that the plain terms of Section 4303 unambiguously require consideration of a retiring officer\u2019s actual last month\u2019s gross compensation. See, e.g., Brief for Appellants at 13 (\u201cIf the General Assembly intended a twelve (12) month average, as advocated by the City, it would have expressly done so as it did in the second calculation method, which requires the high [sic] annual average salary over the last five years.\u201d). They also emphasize the mandatory language of the statute, highlighting that the required method of calculation is non-discretionary. According to Appellants, averaging to determine a \u201cmonthly rate\u201d renders the five-year look-back alternative superfluous (based on the assumption that a final years\u2019 compensation will always be highest). Thus, Appellants contend that, if the General Assembly had intended pensions to be calculated as advocated by the City, the statute would have been drafted to include only the highest-annual-salary method.\nThe City, on the other hand, takes the position that the phrase \u201crate of monthly pay,\u201d by its terms, contemplates an average of the employee\u2019s pay, assessed at the time of retirement and based on comparative earnings per month over time. In particular, the City focuses on the word \u201crate,\u201d which it suggests connotes an amount of charge or payment with reference to some basis of calculation; a certain quantity or amount of one thing considered in relation to another thing and used as a standard or measure. See Brief for Appellee at 9-10 (citing, inter alia, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed.1991), and Webster\u2019s Dictionary (9th ed.1988)). In the City\u2019s view, had the General Assembly intended for municipalities to calculate pension amounts upon the retiring employee\u2019s \u201cfinal month\u2019s salary,\u201d it would have done so on such terms.\nThe City references City of Lower Burrell v. City of Lower Burrell Wage and Policy Committee, 795 A.2d 432 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002), and Kosey v. City of Washington Police Pension Board, 73 Pa.Cmwlth. 564, 459 A.2d 432 (1983), as supportive. In these cases, the City observes, a twelve-month average rate of monthly pay was utilized as the base figure in pension calculations, albeit the City recognizes that the validity of the averaging practice was not before the Commonwealth Court in either case. The City maintains that a method of calculation employing averaging \u201cfosters payment of consistent and fair pension benefits, deters any possibility of disparate treatment amongst employees, and furthers the orderly administration and financial soundness of [city] pension system[s].\u201d Brief for Appellee at 17.\nUpon our review, we find Section 4303 to be ambiguous. In addition to the connotations accompanying the word \u201crate,\u201d the adjective \u201cmonthly\u201d also suggests the Legislature may have contemplated some sort of regularity. See, e.g., Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 806 (11th ed.2003) (defining \u201cmonthly,\u201d inter alia, as \u201coccurring or appearing every month\u201d). Thus there is potential disharmony in the inclusion of variable forms of compensation, such as unscheduled overtime. In light of the resultant, material ambiguity, we refer to the tools of statutory construction, including consideration of the occasion and necessity for the statute, the object to be attained, and the consequences of a particular interpretation. See DPW v. WCAB (Harvey), 605 Pa. 636, 653, 993 A.2d 270, 281 (2010) (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)). We also recognize the relevance of the presumption that the Legislature intends to favor public over private interests, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(5), and the competing precept that social legislation, such as the statutory conferral of police pension, is to be construed liberally in favor of its intended beneficiaries. See Crouse v. DGS, 529 Pa. 26, 36, 601 A.2d 789, 794 (1992).\nWith the above relevant principles in mind, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that the City\u2019s calculation practice comports with a reasonable construction of Section 4303. There is simply too much opportunity for arbitrariness, disparity, and/or manipulation \u2014 arising from a system that contemplates a single month\u2019s total gross compensation as the litmus for lifetime pension benefits \u2014 for us to infer that the Legislature contemplated such a scheme. For example, benefits can be inflated or depressed substantially through the granting or withholding of extra work assignments over a short period of time. Thus, the outcome may be dependent on such unpredictable factors as the retiring officer\u2019s awareness of the significance of his last month\u2019s pay and understandable desire to maximize his pension; the cooperation or noncooperation of local police supervisors; the department\u2019s prevailing work demands; and/or an officer\u2019s physical abilities in his last work month.\nAs the intermediate court and the City have stressed, had the Legislature intended to open the potential for such a range of variables to factor so greatly in the determination of pension benefits, it readily could have said so directly by designating the last\u2019s month\u2019s total gross compensation as the base figure. As it is, Pennsylvania courts and local governments have applied sufficient liberality in their construction of police pension provisions by including non-regular compensation, such as unscheduled overtime, in the base figure from which pension benefits are calculated. In the absence of clearer direction from the General Assembly, we conclude that the unpredictability inherent in Appellants\u2019 construction of Section 4303 impedes pension fund administration, and such result is sufficiently unreasonable to counsel against that construction\u2019s adoption.\nWe hold that the City\u2019s practice of twelve-month averaging reflects a reasonable construction of Section 4303.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices BAER, TODD, McCAFFERY and ORIE MELVIN join the opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\n. Act of June 23, 1931, P.L. 932 (as amended 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 35101-39701) (the \"Code\u201d).\n. Under the rationale of Borough of Nazareth v. Nazareth Borough Police Association, 545 Pa. 85, 680 A.2d 830 (1996), inclusion of additional compensation, such as overtime, in a \"salary\u201d-based pension calculation is appropriate, where the employee makes pension contributions from the relevant payments. See id. at 92-93, 680 A.2d at 834. Presently, there is no argument that \"salary\u201d and \u201crate of monthly pay\u201d should be treated differently in this regard. Rather, the dispute centers over whether the use of an actual or average monthly pay figure should be used in the pension calculation.\n. Borough of Nazareth indicates that payroll deduction of employee pension contributions may be a prerequisite to enforcement. See Borough of Nazareth, 545 Pa. at 92-93, 680 A.2d at 834. The rule in at least a number of other jurisdictions appears to be that salary, for purposes of pension calculations, does not include overtime. See 63 C.J.S. Municipal Corporations \u00a7 530 (2010).\n. We also differ with Appellants\u2019 perspective that the above construction creates a redundancy among the alternative methods for calculating benefits, since the underlying assumption that an officer\u2019s last year will always reflect his highest rate of compensation is not an accurate one.",

Thus, a calculation based on a 12-month average is not an inappropriate method under \u00a7 4303.\nIn calculating the pensions, the City added the officer\u2019s compensation over the year prior to retirement and divided that number by 12 to find an average monthly pay. A more precise approach, assuming the officer was paid by the hour, would be to average the hours worked, rather than the salary received. That is, add the total number of hours worked over the year prior to retirement, and divide that number by 12; this results in the average hours worked per month. Multiply this by the hourly rate the officer was being paid on the date of retirement and one finds a figure that more accurately reflects the \u201crate of monthly pay ... at the date of ... retirement....\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 39303(a). This still uses the reasonable 12-month time-frame necessary to lessen the possibility of manipulation, but allows application of the actual rate of pay at retirement to be applied to the average hours worked each month, ie., the \u201crate of monthly pay.\u201d",
