Whether the Commonwealth Court in a case of first impression \u2014 for the first time in SEPTA\u2019s 46 years existence \u2014 incorrectly held, because the court failed to follow the United States Supreme Court\u2019s mandated \u201carm of the state\u201d jurisprudence, that SEPTA is not obligated to comply with federal laws, stripping SEPTA employees of the rights and protections railroad employees have enjoyed for a century under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act.\n2. Whether the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision should be reversed because the decision (a) ignores the United States Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in Lake County and Hess that sovereign immunity must be determined based upon a detailed analysis of several specific factors against which to determine an entity\u2019s nature and structure and (b) was only based on the state legislature\u2019s label of SEPTA as a \u201cCommonwealth Agency and Instrumentality,\u201d and the Commonwealth\u2019s partial voluntary funding of SEPTA.\n3. Whether the Commonwealth Court improperly held, in a case of first impression, that all claims brought under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-60, were completely barred by the Pennsylvania Sovereign Immunity Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(B), rather than leaving it to the trial courts to decide each FELA accident on a case by case basis as is done in all other personal injury actions.",
