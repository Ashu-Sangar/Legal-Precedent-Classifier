The following sequence of events gave rise to the present appeal, as aptly described by the Superior Court in its opinion,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and further gleaned from the record in this matter. In. 1972, Appellant, Diane L. Fastuca, in conjunction with her siblings, Louis W. Molnar, Jr. and Mary Lou Molnar, formed L.W. Molnar and Associates (collectively “Appellees”). The partnership managed real estate investment properties, and it endured for nearly 26 years with no major disputes among the partners until 1998 when Appellant became disenchanted with the way partnership revenues were being divided. Although Appellant tried, with the aid of counsel, to work out her dispute with the other partners for nearly five years thereafter, no amicable resolution could be reached. Accordingly, she sent Appellees a letter on September 20, 2003, notifying them of her intent to dissolve the partnership under Section 8353 of our Commonwealth’s Uniform Partnership Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>15 Pa.C.S.A. § 8353, and requesting that her partnership share be distributed to her.</p>

Therefore, the arbitrator required Appellees to pay Appellant the value of her interest in the partnership at the time of dissolution, less any damages Appellees suffered on account of the wrongful dissolution. <em>Id. </em>The arbitrator further decreed that the purchase price for Appellant’s partnership interest was to be computed according to either ¶ 12(d) of the partnership agreement, which provided the purchase price of the partners’ share was to be its fair market value for the latest fiscal year preceding the sale as determined by general accounting principles,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> or under Section 8360(b)(2) of the Uniform Partnership Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Findings of Arbitrator at ¶ 9.

Additionally, although Appellees granted Appellant access to some partnership records, a dispute arose regarding Appellant’s request that Appellees grant her experts access to certain documents which Appellant claimed were pertinent to the determination of the value of the partnership — a claim which Appellees contested. Further, Appellant sought the release of a master’s report regarding the value of the partnership prepared as part of the divorce case of Appellee, Mary Lou Molnar, and Appellees requested a copy of Appellant’s expert report valuing the partnership. On November 2, 2004, the arbitrator denied Appellant’s motion for clarification, directed the parties to provide the judge overseeing the divorce case a consent order to release the master’s report, instructed Appellees’ counsel to meet with her clients and submit a status report on the disclosure of documents, and required Appellant to submit a status report estimating the time necessary to review the documents and prepare an appraisal of the partnership value.</p>

Trial Court Opinion, 6/26/07, at 7. The trial judge characterized the arbitrator’s findings made on September 17, 2004 as an “Award,” which he regarded as “unjust, inequitable and unconscionable” because it rested on arguments and no sworn testimony was taken by the arbitrator, even though Appellant had requested it. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge also characterized as “mind boggling” the arbitrator’s finding that Appellant’s resort to the Uniform Partnership Act to dissolve the partnership was “wrongful” and a basis for the award of damages.

The Superior Court reasoned that, since the original complaint filed by Appellant had been dismissed by then-judge Baldwin’s order of February 4, 2004, which also directed the parties to arbitrate all issues raised in the complaint, “the arbitration process ... was the only avenue of relief remaining, upon termination of which both the parties and their claims were ‘out of court.’ ” <em>Fastuca, </em>950 A.2d at 987. Thus, <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>the Superior Court concluded that these “practical ramifications” of the trial judge’s order rendered it final. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Superior Court held that “a trial court’s order purporting to terminate arbitration when the arbitration proceeding is the only means then of record for resolution of the parties’ dispute is a final order for purposes of appellate review.” <em>Id.</em>

They also claimed that the trial judge exceeded his lawful authority when he terminated the ongoing arbitration. The Superior Court observed that the proper resolution of both questions was intertwined and dependent on the scope of the authority of a trial court to intervene in an arbitration before an arbitrator enters what he or she designates as an award.</p>

The Superior Court viewed this omission from the statute as an intentional restriction of the trial court’s power, not an accidental one. The Superior Court noted that, prior to the arbitrator’s entry of an award, the trial court is statutorily empowered to merely issue orders which compel or stay an arbitration proceeding, as authorized by Sections 7304(a) and (b) of the Uniform Arbitration Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> The Superior Court also held that the power to stay an arbitration under Section 7304(b) is further limited to only determining whether the parties agreed to arbitrate their dispute.</p>

The Superior Court noted that these findings did not resolve the <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>dispute between the parties, but, rather, were simply preliminary determinations by the arbitrator, as evidenced by the fact that the arbitrator expressly retained jurisdiction to address the value of Appellant’s partnership share and any further disputes that pertained to the dissolving of the partnership. The Superior Court found that, “by determining facts and focusing on remaining legal issues, such as the continuity of the partnership and Fastuca’s putative breach of the partnership agreement, the Findings frame the issues that remain subject to resolution at subsequent hearings.” <em>Fastuca, </em>950 A.2d at 989. The Superior Court also viewed the arbitrator’s order for the parties to exchange all relevant information regarding the valuation of Appellant’s partnership share as an additional indication that his findings were merely preliminary. Consequently, the Superior Court concluded that, since the findings did not constitute an award, the trial judge lacked express authority under Section 7341 to modify or vacate those findings, and he only had authority to issue a stay for the limited purpose of determining the arbitrability of the underlying claims. The Superior Court therefore deemed the trial judge’s order terminating the arbitration to be a “nullity.” <em>Fastuca, </em>950 A.2d at 990.</p>
    <p id="b260-4" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[247,1541,1149,688]]]'>The Superior Court further observed that any petition to vacate or modify an award must be filed within 30 days of the entry of the award as specified by Section 7342(b). Hence, the court reasoned that, even if it were to consider the arbitrator’s findings to be equivalent to an award, and Appellant’s motion to terminate to be comparable to a petition to modify or vacate, Appellant was still entitled to no relief since the motion to terminate was filed over two years after the arbitrator rendered his findings — well more than the thirty day period allowed by Section 7342. The Superior Court, therefore, reversed the order of the trial court and reinstated the arbitration proceedings so that the arbitration ordered by Judge Baldwin could be completed.</p>

Additionally, both parties agree that the plain language of Section 7341 does not permit judicial review of any ruling of the arbitrator other than a final award.

In <em>Great American, </em>an individual injured in an automobile accident pursued a claim against her brother’s automobile insurance company for uninsured motorists’ benefits, and the matter was referred, under the terms of the policy, to common law arbitration before an arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator divided the proceedings into two parts: the first was to determine whether the injured individual was covered under the policy, and the second was to calculate her damages. After conducting the first hearing, the arbitrator ruled that coverage existed under the policy, and he scheduled a second hearing. Prior to the second hearing, the insurer filed a complaint in equity against the American Arbitration Association seeking to enjoin the second arbitration hearing on the basis that the arbitrator had committed an error of law in interpreting the insurance contract. The trial court refused to grant the injunction on the basis that there had been no misconduct by the arbitrator.</p>

We also observed that allowing equitable intervention under such circumstances “would mean that arbitration proceedings, instead of being a quick and easy mode of obtaining justice, would be merely an unnecessary step in the course of litigation, causing delay and expense, but settling nothing finally.” <em>Great American, </em><a href="/pa/436/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="436 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1926109" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0370-01">436 Pa. at 373</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=260%20A.2d%20769" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="260 A.2d 769">260 A.2d at 770</a>. Our Court further remarked that a complaint in equity was not the proper manner for a party to obtain judicial review of an arbitrator’s decision; rather, we reminded that a petition to vacate the arbitration award was the correct method to obtain such review. We noted that the decision of the arbitrator after the first hearing was not an award since it did not address the issue of damages, pointing out that it was quite possible that the arbitrator would award no damages at the second hearing, or that the arbitrator’s final damage award would be satisfactory to the insurer. We therefore concluded that “the insurer was attempting to gain interlocutory review by the equity route rather than await a final award and then petition to vacate it,” <em><a href="/citations/?q=260%20A.2d%20769" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="260 A.2d 769">id.</a> </em><a href="/pa/436/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="436 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1926109" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0370-01">436 Pa. 370</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=260%20A.2d%20769" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="260 A.2d 769">260 A.2d at 771</a>, and we indicated that dismissal of the equitable complaint by the trial court would have been proper on these grounds as well. Thus, applying this rationale to the case at bar, it is clear that since the arbitrator’s findings of September 17, 2004 which did not resolve all outstanding issues arising from the dispute between Appellant and Appellees were, likewise, interlocutory, they did not constitute an award.</p>
    <p id="b263-4" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[187,1792,1151,579]],["BL_264.1",264,[245,326,1149,356]]]'>Various secondary legal authorities have also recognized a requirement that an arbitrator’s decision must resolve all disputed matters presented to him or her in order for that decision to constitute an award. <em>See, e.g., </em>3 P.L.E. Arbitration § 12 (defining award as the final judgment or decision pronounced by the arbitrators in settlement of the controversy submitted to them); <em>Black’s Law Dictionary </em>(8th. Edition) (defining award as “[a] final judgment or decision, esp. one by an arbitrator ... assessing damages.”) Thus, in accord with our prior precedent, and the common and accepted meaning of the term award as it is generally used in the context of <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>arbitration proceedings, we hold that, for an arbitrator’s decision to constitute an award within the meaning of Section 7341, it must be a ruling by the arbitrator which finally resolves all disputed matters submitted to him or her by the parties and must, therefore, include the arbitrator’s decision on all outstanding legal issues, and all necessary factual determinations.</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[244,712,1150,1414]]]'>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is clear the arbitrator bifurcated the resolution process of the claims of Appellant and Appellees which they wished him to address into two phases. In the first phase, he determined all legal issues surrounding the dissolution of the partnership — i.e., the basis on which it transpired and the relative rights of the parties in its aftermath — and he set forth his decision on those issues in his findings of September 17, 2004. At that time, however, he clearly did not attempt to address the factual question of the proper valuation of Appellant’s partnership share. Instead, he recognized the need for the parties to gather information and prepare valuation figures so that he could later issue a final ruling on the amount Appellees were required to pay Appellant for her share. Towards that end, he ordered the aforementioned exchange of documents and expert reports, and he expressly retained jurisdiction to resolve any other issues arising out of the dissolution of the partnership. Thus, the arbitrator clearly contemplated that there would be a second phase of the proceedings in which the value of Appellant’s partnership share would be finally determined by him. Consequently, since the arbitrator’s findings of September 17, 2004 were not a full and final determination of all matters submitted to him for his consideration, the Superior Court’s conclusion that these findings did not constitute an award under Section 7341, and were therefore not subject to judicial review under that statutory provision, was well founded and correct.</p>

In that case, an electric utility company sought to build a power transmission line through a residential area of a first class township. The utility sought approval from the PUC to do so, pursuant to the state law governing the proper procedure utility companies were to follow to obtain easements.

Our Court upheld the court’s grant of injunctive relief on the grounds that the township code was preempted by the state public utility code and, thus, the township zoning ordinances were unenforceable against the utility company. We further noted that the utility was exposed to a potential fíne of $3,000 per day if it chose to continue construction, and, while construction was halted, it was unable to meet the excess power demand of its customers and was consequently losing $150.00 to $300.00 per hour. Our Court held that these facts established that the utility had no adequate remedy at law since the administrative procedures afforded by the first class township code were time consuming and that the utility would be incurring these mounting daily losses “while waiting for [the township’s] administrative machinery to grind out an appealable order, or for a test case on the criminal side to run its course.” <em>Duquesne Light, </em><a href="/pa/377/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="377 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1249623" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0323-01">377 Pa. at 341</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.2d%20287" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="105 A.2d 287">105 A.2d at 295</a>.

Consequently, when the arbitrator implemented his various conciliatory measures to settle the conflict between Appellant and Appellees over what documents Appellant would be entitled to review prior to the final hearing, Appellant received precisely what she had bargained for, namely, the services of a neutral arbitrator who would resolve the dispute. Merely because she was dissatisfied with the particular remedies the arbitrator attempted to implement, Appellant was not entitled to immediate equitable intervention by the court of common pleas to restrain the arbitration process before its completion. Moreover, like the disgruntled insurer in <em>Harleysville, </em>she, too, had other legal avenues by which she could have sought relief for her complaints concerning the alleged lack of access to documents and purported procedural flaws in the arbitration process.</p>

The trial judge’s order terminating the arbitration prevented the arbitrator from holding a final hearing, during which time Appellant could directly have raised to the arbitrator the complaints she now raises regarding the manner in which the arbitration process was conducted, and she could have requested that the arbitrator consider them as factors in his ultimate valuation decision. Moreover, and most importantly, had the arbitration process not been circumvented by the trial court’s response to Appellant’s motion to terminate the arbitration, once the arbitrator entered his final award, if dissatisfied, Appellant could have then properly sought judicial review under Section <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>7341 and requested vacation or modification of the award based on the alleged “glaring irregularities” she claims occurred in the conduct of the arbitration. Appellant’s Brief at 26. Consequently, Appellant suffered no denial of her due process rights which warranted the trial court’s exercise of equitable jurisdiction, as, had she simply allowed the arbitrator’s entry of a final award, Section 7341 would have provided her a “complete method of statutory relief.” <em>Harleysville, supra.</em>

If an arbitrator fails to act, a court is specifically empowered to remove the arbitrator and replace him or her. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 7305 (“[W]hen an arbitrator appointed fails to act or is unable to act and his successor has not been appointed, the court on application of a party shall appoint one or more arbitrators.”)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a>

To the contrary, our review of the record, as discussed above, suggests that the arbitrator acted in a prompt, diligent manner to resolve the myriad difficulties that arose between the parties regarding the review of the relevant partnership records. The arbitrator conducted many proceedings after his findings of September 17, 2004 in order to settle the issues that arose over the scope and manner by which review of those records was to be conducted. His attentiveness to the parties’ concerns was evidenced by his prompt scheduling of conferences and hearings to address additional issues presented to him by <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>the parties as they arose, as well as his diligent efforts to fashion a workable, mutually acceptable solution to the document disclosure dispute between the parties.</p>

Assn. Commercial Arb. Rules and Mediation Procedures, supra, </em>Rule 41, (R.R. at 494a) (“The award shall be made promptly by the arbitrator and, unless otherwise agreed by the parties or specified by law, no later than 30 days from the date of closing the hearing, or, if oral hearings have been waived, from the date of the AAA’s transmittal of the final statements and proofs to the arbitrator.”) Consequently, because the arbitrator had scheduled the final hearing to determine the value of Appellant’s partnership share for January 8, 2007, a conclusive end to the arbitration proceedings was in sight for Appellant, since the arbitrator’s decision had to be rendered within 30 days after that hearing. If the arbitrator failed to render a decision within a reasonable period after that 30 day period elapsed, then Appellant could have gone to the trial court seeking relief under Section 7305. However, such relief, as provided by the plain language of that statutory provision, is limited to replacement of the arbitrator, not termination of the entire arbitration proceeding, as the trial court in the present matter did.</p>

Permitting micromanagement by a court of ongoing common law arbitrations in situations such as that which transpired in the present case would defeat the contractual intent of the parties who bargained for their disputes to be resolved with minimal court intrusion. If we were to allow the type of pre-award equitable court intervention which Appellant presently seeks, it would result in the omnipresent prospect of a trial court being dragged into the minutiae of the arbitral process by any party who wants immediate judicial review of every unfavorable discovery ruling by the arbitrator, or who desires to escape from the arbitration process altogether through its termination, if he or she perceives it to be unfolding in an unfavorable manner. This would severely undermine the legislature’s intent, as reflected by its enactment of the Uniform Arbitration Act, to restrict the degree of permissible judicial intrusion into common law arbitrations once they have commenced.</p>

The trial judge’s order of June 26, 2007, purporting to terminate the arbitration, was not. As the Superior Court properly concluded, such an order was not authorized by law, nor, for the reasons which we have outlined above, did the trial judge have inherent equitable authority to enter such an order.

The trial court therefore acted to preserve the <em>status quo </em>between the parties so that the efficacy of the arbitration process would not be irrevocably harmed by the actions of one of the parties. The trial court in the instant case, by contrast, did not act to facilitate the conduct of the arbitration; rather, it fatally impeded the ongoing arbitration process by terminating it.</p>

      <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>As this case reflects, the expediency, inexpensiveness, and certainty of arbitration sometimes may be seen as more of an ideal than a practical reality. I continue to support arbitration nonetheless, in light of the comparative advantages it offers, which I believe are realized in many situations. Moreover, I agree with the majority that, if greater net benefits are to be achieved, judicial intervention must be restrained, consistent with the legislative direction. Finally, with no disrespect intended to the arbitrator — who very well may have performed admirably — I see it as beyond the scope of our review to comment on his handling of the discovery disputes. From my perspective, it is more than enough to say that, on this record, the common pleas court erred both in intervening and in the form of intervention chosen.</p>
