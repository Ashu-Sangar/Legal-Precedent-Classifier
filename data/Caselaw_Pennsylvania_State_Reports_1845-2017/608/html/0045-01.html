Helpin, D.M.D., (“Dr. Helpin”) accepted a position in 1989 at the School of Dental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, with primary responsibilities as the Director of Pediatric Dentistry at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (“CHOP”). In an offer letter to Dr. Helpin dated September 1, 1989, then-Dean Raymond J. Fonseca, D.M.D., informed Dr. Helpin that his base salary for the 1989-90 academic year would be $60,000. In addition, this base salary was to be supplemented with bonuses and salary increments, which the offer letter set forth as follows:</p>

Dr. Helpin remained at CHOP until December 2003, each year having available 50% of the profits from the CHOP dental clinic to use for any purpose he wished, including paying himself or reinvesting in the clinic. In December 2003, Marjorie Jeff-coat, D.M.D., the then-new dean of the School of Dental <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>Medicine, transferred Dr. Helpin from CHOP to Penn’s dental clinic in Bryn Mawr. In September 2004, Dr. Helpin gave notice of his intention to resign from Penn at the end of the year, citing intolerable working conditions and a reduction in his salary, which was no longer linked to the CHOP dental clinic profits.</p>

Levin, the Chief of the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. A jury heard testimony over a period of three weeks in June 2007.</p>

Jeffcoat, Freitag, and Levin from the action. However, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. Helpin on the breach of contract claims and awarded him $4.04 million in damages. The jury found that Penn had constructively discharged Dr. Helpin without “just cause,” and had improperly failed to continue to pay him 50% of the profits from the CHOP dental clinic. Penn filed a post-trial motion seeking judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial, and Dr. Helpin filed a “conditional motion for post-trial relief and to award interest.” The trial court denied all post-trial motions and entered judgment on the jury’s verdict on December 10, 2007.</p>

Penn argues that “the central rationale” of <em>Kaczkowski, i.e., </em>that “ ‘in the long run, future inflation and the discount <em>lie., </em>interest] rate will offset each other[,]’ ... applies only to types of future damages, like wages, that co-vary with inflation because only in that context does the ‘offset’ concept even arguably make economic sense.” Penn’s Brief at 15 (citing <em>Kaczkowski, </em><a href="/pa/491/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="491 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1765676" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0561-01">421 A.2d at 1037</a>).

There is no doubt that the rate of inflation in succeeding years will affect the ultimate value of Dr. Helpin’s lump-sum award. Therefore, to compensate Dr. Helpin fully and fairly, it is necessary to make some estimations regarding not just the earning capacity of the award as realized through interest payments, but also the ultimate value of the award as diminished by inflation. To ignore the impact of years of inflation on a substantial proportion of Dr. Helpin’s lost future earned income, while simultaneously applying a discount to present value based on the prevailing interest rate, would lead to unacceptable under-compensation of Dr. Helpin. The approach we set forth in <em>Kaczkoivski </em>was designed to address such under-compensation, by taking into account not only future interest rates, but also future inflation rates. The concerns, the rationales, and the analysis set forth in <em>Kaczkowski </em>for lump-sum damages awards for lost future earnings are simply not altered by the fact that a substantial percentage of Dr. Helpin’s lost future earned income derives from profits of the CHOP clinic.</p>

I am not convinced that systematically over-penalizing civil defendants is appropriate, not only because it runs counter to basic notions of corrective justice, but because civil liability is decided on a preponderance of the evidence, which subsumes a risk that civil defendants will wrongly be found liable. <em>See generally Commonwealth v. Maldonado, </em><a href="/pa/576/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="576 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="16703" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0101-01">576 Pa. 101</a>, 109, <a href="/pa/576/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="838 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="16703,9299392" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0101-01,/a2d/838/0710-01">838 A.2d 710</a>, 715 (2003) (observing that the preponderance standard stems from a belief that the plaintiff and defendant should equally share the risk of an erroneous verdict). Thus, as we already accept that a significant number of liability verdicts may be incorrect, it does not seem equitable to incorporate a structural inaccuracy inflating the amount of damages.</p>
