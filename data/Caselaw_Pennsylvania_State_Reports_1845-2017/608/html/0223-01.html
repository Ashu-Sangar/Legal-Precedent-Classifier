As the Court of Judicial Discipline was established as part of the Constitution’s judiciary article, and because Pennsylvania has a unified judiciary, appellant argues this constitutional restriction should apply to the court.

Similarity of misconduct does not require identicality of sanction, for there are other factors that bear on that decision, including mitigating and aggravating considerations and how a particular jurist’s misconduct undermines public confidence in the judiciary.

Even after disregarding the testimony of Conahan, Ciavarella, Sharkey, and Moran, the conclusions of the CJD remain fully supported by testimony of over twenty witnesses. Indeed, while implying that the events the witnesses described never occurred, Judge Lokuta is careful not to assert directly that the testimony presented was false, instead, claiming that the witnesses “embellished” their testimony in an effort to please the president judges. As discussed below, she fails to produce any specific evidence supporting her bald contention that these witnesses “embellished” any of their testimony during her trial, nor her unspoken implication that they committed perjury.

Judge Lokuta fails to note that while Conference Judge Sprague sustained twenty-one of the JCB’s thirty objections to trial exhibits, he did nothing to impede Judge Lokuta’s introduction of over one thousand exhibits, as compared to the approximately thirty exhibits introduced by the JCB.

The Majority Opinion approves the CJD’s narrow reading of the order limiting Judge Lokuta to claims in the nature of after-discovered evidence that relate only to corruption revealed shortly before the remand order, and concomitantly prohibiting inquiry into any revelations of misconduct in Luzerne County discovered after this court’s ordered remand. Maj. Op. at 241-43, 11 A.3d at 437-38. Indeed, in the aftermath of the May 13, 2009 oral argument regarding, <em>inter alia, </em>the scope of remand, the CJD defined the phrase from the remand order— “claims in the nature of after-discovered evidence, arising from the recent revelations of corruption in Luzerne County,” — to apply solely to “those filings that have been placed on the public record in Luzerne County, meaning the pleas of guilt by Judge Conahan, Judge Ciavarella, Mr. Sharkey, and <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>even including the agreement involving Moran, but it is the position of this Court that all arguments are to be from those matters.” Tr., 5/13/09, at 46.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Thus, the CJD’s interpretation of our remand order was arguably even narrower than as described in the Majority Opinion.</p>
    <p id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[201,607,1154,721]]]'>Judge Lokuta asserts that the CJD’s interpretation was an “artificially narrow interpretation of the scope of the remand.” Brief for Lokuta at 19. She contends that the remand should have extended to “the growing body of evidence in the public record speaking directly to Conahan and Ciavarella’s corrupt influence over others.” Brief for Lokuta at 19. I agree that it would have been better to allow investigation concerning any information even potentially related to a connection between the culture of corruption created by the former president judges and the prosecution of Judge Lokuta, in that this Court’s remand was to permit full exploration of the unprecedented corruption in Luzerne County, its impact upon the CJD’s removal of Judge Lokuta, and the nexus between the two.</p>
    <p id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.6",329,[201,1360,1153,780]]]'>Nonetheless, I agree with the Majority Opinion’s affirmance of the decision below, despite the narrow scope of review on remand, because Judge Lokuta was unable to show any prejudice resulting from the CJD’s restrictive interpretation of our remand order. While she appropriately presents damning evidence of the former judges’ power and corruption, she fails to discredit the vast majority of the copious evidence from more than twenty witnesses who testified for day upon day to the litany of improper judicial conduct described at the beginning of this concurrence. Moreover, she fails to allege what evidence she would have presented to the CJD if she had been allowed. Accordingly, I agree with the Majority Opinion to the extent that it concludes that the CJD’s interpretation of this Court’s remand order does not justify overturning the decision.</p>

      <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>Finally, I consider the issue of the appropriateness of a new sanction hearing following the revelations of the corruption in Luzerne County. The Majority addresses this issue as a question of the sufficiency of the evidence and appropriately observes, “[questions of credibility and conflicts in the evidence presented are for the trial courts to resolve, not our appellate courts.” Maj. Op. at 255, 11 A.3d at 445-46. Nonetheless, I am compelled to note the argument in favor of a new sanction hearing convincingly articulated by Judge Streib in her dissent following our remand:</p>
    <blockquote id="b330-5" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[279,858,1108,461]]]'>Indeed, it is most ironic that Judge Lokuta would be criticized by this Court for isolating herself and her staff from the very people who have now been indicted for misusing their public office and position to commit crimes that strike at the heart of our judicial system. And, it is also most ironic that these same people are called by the Board to bear witness against Judge Lokuta, but yet she is precluded from presenting evidence regarding their far more serious misdeeds and criminal activities.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b330-6" data-blocks='[["BL_330.5",330,[277,1342,1111,621]]]'>More importantly, however, I find Judge Lokuta’s proffered evidence most pertinent to the sanctions imposed by this Court as a result of the charges brought against her by the Board. That evidence demonstrates that this was no ordinary judicial environment and no environment to which any judge should be exposed. That, to me, is a serious mitigating factor which does indeed militate in favor of an altered sanction in this case. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority’s determination that the evidence proffered by Judge Lokuta does not meet the requirements of after-discovered evidence and would not, in any event, have affected the outcome of this case.</blockquote>
