On the morning of Wednesday, March 31, 2004, Appellant was eating breakfast with his then-girlfriend April <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>Harris Duva (“Duva”) at the Bradford County home where he lived with his father, Arlan Briggs. N.T. Trial, 1/24/06 AS,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> at 72,115. A driveway led to Briggs’ house from Congdon Road, and the house was the first structure a person traveling the driveway from that road would encounter. As the driveway continued past the house, it divided into two parts, with the left fork leading to a barn and the right fork to a stand of pine trees. The majority of the Briggs property behind the house was used as an automotive junkyard and was littered with hundreds of derelict vehicles. N.T. Trial, 1/24/06 MS, at 6-7; N.T.

Trial, 1/25/06 MS, at 18. As he hung up the phone, he noticed a car parked outside of the house. N.T. Trial, 1/24/06 AS, at 72-73. The car was an unmarked police vehicle driven by Bradford County Sheriffs Deputies Christopher Burgert and Michael VanKuren, who had come to serve arrest warrants on Appellant and Duva. Appellant’s warrant was for non-payment of fines, costs, and restitution, while Duva’s warrant was for the alleged manufacture of methamphetamine on the Briggs property. N.T. Trial, 1/24/06 AS, at 45-46, 71-72. Arlan Briggs knew of the existence of these warrants and, thus, told Duva to hide — whereupon she hurriedly ran to the basement. N.T.

After he had found two in acceptable condition, he carried them out of the barn and began walking with them towards the right fork of the driveway. At this point, he noticed the deputies’ car parked in the drive about 200 feet from the house, with Appellant’s Chevy Blazer positioned directly in front of it. N.T. Trial, 1/25/06 MS, at 25. After Arlan Briggs had walked further up the driveway into the junkyard to where his own pickup truck was parked he, at that point, noticed Deputy VanKuren prone and unmoving on the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 29. He also observed Deputy Burgert lying in the yard nearby, gravely wounded. <em>Id. </em>at 30.

Appellant was in the process of pulling a radiator out of a car when the deputies walked up behind him and called his name. N.T. Trial, 1/26/06 MS, at 13. Appellant claimed that he had a previous altercation with Deputy VanKuren and, hence, felt he was in fear for his life. As Appellant turned around in response to the deputies’ call, he reached for his hip, on which he had a holstered revolver. <em>Id. </em>at 13.

Appellant demanded Deputy Burgert throw his service weapon, a .40 caliber “Glock” semiautomatic pistol, to the ground and, after Deputy Burgert complied, Appellant picked it up and pointed it at him. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16; N.T.

Dr. Land opined that Deputy VanKuren was immediately paralyzed by this wound and suffered massive bleeding into his chest, which caused his death within minutes. <em>Id. </em>at 46, 52. Dr. Land noted that Deputy VanKuren was additionally shot a second time in his right forearm. <em>Id. </em>48. When this bullet entered Deputy VanKuren’s forearm it fractured it. <em>Id. </em>at 49.

Saunders’ home was located within a mile of the Briggs’ property. N.T. Trial, 1/23/06, at 50. Appellant asked Saunders for a drink of water, and Saunders allowed him to drink from an outdoor spring. N.T. Trial, 1/25/06 AS, at 60. Appellant also requested to use Saunders’ phone to call his brother, and Saunders agreed. Appellant dialed his brother’s number twice and received no response. After Appellant hung up the phone, Appellant asked Saunders what “the word” was in the community, and Saunders told him people were blaming him for killing the two deputies. <em>Id. </em>at 62.

To the contrary, Appellant’s statement to Brown establishes that the deputies merely spoke to Appellant and called him by name, and Appellant responded to their simple attempt to communicate with him by reaching for his weapon, drawing it, and shooting them both.

Though acknowledging it was discussed widely in the newspapers at various points, the Commonwealth pointed out the coverage had diminished significantly by the time of the hearing. The Commonwealth further maintained that the defense had established in the media coverage its position that the comments Appellant made in the jail were not an admission of guilt but rather an expression of regret so the prejudice had been minimized. <em>Id. </em>at 12-13.

While there were admittedly a few references to arguably presumptively prejudicial information, such was not sustained or pervasive, nor so inculpatory or inflammatory ... to support a change of venue/venire without establishing a nexus between the publicity and actual juror prejudice. Clearly, the deaths of two respected law enforcement officers in a small county such as Bradford, warrants caution and careful consideration as to a change of venue/venire to insure a fair trial.

The Commonwealth proffered that the true question before the court was whether a fair and impartial jury could be selected in Bradford County, and it submitted that the questionnaires showed that one could be.

The mere existence of pretrial publicity alone, however, does not constitute actual prejudice. Simply because prospective jurors may have heard about a case through media reports does not render them incapable of jury service, since, in today’s “information age,” where news of community events <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>are disseminated virtually instantaneously by an ever multiplying array of delivery methods, it would be difficult to find 12 jurors who do not at least have some knowledge of the facts of an important and tragic incident like this one. Indeed, almost half a century ago, when the significant impact on people’s awareness of events caused by forms of mass media such as television was just beginning to be realized, the United States Supreme Court recognized that securing a defendant’s due process right to a fair trial did not require a trial court to seat a jury whose members were completely oblivious of the facts of the crime as they were reported by news sources. Thus, the high Court made clear that an individual’s eligibility for jury service could not be conditioned on his or her maintenance of a hermetic state of unawareness of community and world events, reasoning:</p>
    <blockquote id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[236,1138,1112,741]]]'>It is not required, however, that the jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved. In these days of swift, widespread and diverse methods of communication, an important case can be expected to arouse the interest of the public in the vicinity, and scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case. This is particularly true in criminal cases. To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror’s impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.</blockquote>

Instead, the trial court conducted a painstaking and searching <em>voir dire </em>of the remaining pool of prospective jurors who were not excused by consent or for other reasons such as hardship. During this process, the trial court assiduously sought to ascertain whether any of the prospective jurors had formed a fixed and unalterable opinion about Appellant’s guilt, and whether the prospective jurors could, in fact, follow its instructions on Appellant’s presumption of innocence, the Commonwealth’s burden of proof and, most importantly, its admonition that guilt or innocence must be based solely on the evidence presented at trial.

Although 64 of the 138 prospective jurors questioned by counsel and the trial court admitted to having gained some knowledge of the case through media reports — i.e., reading about the case in the newspaper or watching it on television — the majority of those, 39 of the 64, indicated that the coverage they recalled seeing was that which occurred nearest in time to the shooting of the deputies, i.e., the coverage of the incident and the hunt for the perpetrator. Only 25 had followed the media coverage of the case throughout, and 22 of those 25 had formed no fixed opinion of guilt as a result of the coverage. Ultimately, of the 138 prospective jurors examined during <em>voir dire, </em>only 17, or 12 percent, stated that they had a fixed, unalterable opinion of Appellant’s guilt. Because this was not an inordinately high percentage, and all jurors possessing such a fixed opinion were rightfully excused for cause, we find no merit to Appellant’s claim that his right to an impartial jury was compromised by the selection of the final jury from this group. <em>See Tharp, supra </em>(holding no change of venue required when 30 of 100 prospective jurors (30%) questioned in voir dire had a fixed unchangeable opinion of guilt and were excused for cause); <em>Commonwealth v.

To the contrary, the focus of Trooper Pelachick’s discussion with Appellant was to apprise him of the status of his request for Attorney Agnellino’s assistance, which he had made the evening before at the barracks, and to attempt to ascertain Appellant’s wishes about whether he wanted the services of another attorney. This was not an improper subject of conversation since Appellant had specifically indicated his desire to speak with the troopers once he had obtained an attorney, and, thus, the troopers were attempting to facilitate the process of his retention of counsel through their talk with him at the jail. After Appellant said he wanted the services of the public defender, the troopers properly stated to him that they would not be able to speak with him about the case and indicated they would talk to him later with his attorney. It was in this context, i.e., the prospect of a future conversation with Appellant once he had retained counsel, that Trooper Pelachick made his off-hand reference to the Kohler case. <em>See supra </em>at 451, 12 A.3d at 304. Thus, this reference cannot, under these circumstances, be construed as an attempt by Trooper Pelachick to overcome Appellant’s will and induce him to speak about the case without the assistance of counsel.

Although Appellant had invoked his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment by his request for counsel after he had been arraigned, the record is devoid of evidence that Trooper Pelachick deliberately utilized any methods designed to improperly induce him to make a statement in the absence of counsel, such as making emotional appeals to conscience, discussing the facts of the case with him, or confronting him with evidence calculated to provoke a response such as statements of other individuals. <em>Cf.

Because the record does not support the conclusion that Trooper Pelachick “deliberately and designedly” provoked Appellant’s spontaneous declaration, there was no violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in this instance.

Marcoccia’s testimony established the prior relationship between himself and Appellant, and his interest in learning from Appellant the details surrounding the shooting of the deputies. This explained the manner by which Marcoccia and Appellant came to have their later conversation in which Appellant showed Marcoccia the content of his cellmate’s statement containing Appellant’s inculpatory admissions which Appellant admitted to Marcoccia were accurate. Further, as the trial court found, this aspect of Marcoccia’s testimony was relevant to show Appellant’s ability to acquire handguns. <em>See Commonwealth v.

We note also that the Commonwealth did not further exploit the remark to the jury and immediately ceased questioning. Although Appellant’s counsel indicated at that time that he did not want a curative instruction, the trial court did not allow the trial to continue, but, instead, elected to take the entire matter under advisement and entertain further arguments from the parties regarding an appropriate course of action. Since this occurred late on Friday afternoon, the trial court adjourned the proceedings for the weekend. When court reconvened the following Monday, the trial court again heard argument from the parties and, afterwards, gave the jury a curative instruction in which it expressly informed the jury that polygraph test results are not admissible, as such results are unreliable. The trial court explicitly directed the jury to disregard what they had heard regarding the polygraph test. N.T. Trial, 1/30/06 MS, at 33-34. Additionally, the trial court asked the jury panel, collectively, whether any of them could not follow this instruction, or if any of them had previously taken a polygraph test. No juror answered in the affirmative. Under these circumstances, Appellant suffered no prejudice from Marcoccia’s fleeting reference to a polygraph test, and Appellant’s request for a mistrial was properly denied by the trial court. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Nevertheless, I am in agreement with the majority here concerning the general parameters of the presently extant principles we are bound to enforce, as set forth above.</p>
