Farrell, Esquire (hereafter “counsel”), filed a Motion to Withdraw on July 21, 2010, alleging that appellant sent correspondence to counsel “terminating” counsel’s representation. Counsel believed that appellant’s correspondence created an obligation to move to withdraw.

First, according to counsel, the constitutional right to self-representation is grounded in the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Counsel argues that in 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court held that there is no Sixth Amendment right to self-representation for purposes of appeal. <em>See Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California, </em><a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">528 U.S. 152</a>, <a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">120 S.Ct. 684</a>, <a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">145 </a><a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a><a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">L.Ed.2d 597</a> (2000). Counsel asserts that this Court’s cases holding that there is a right to self-representation for purposes of appeal have consistently cited to the U.S. Supreme Court case of <em>Faretta v. California, </em><a href="/us/422/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="422 U.S. 806" data-case-ids="9431" data-case-paths="/us/422/0806-01">422 U.S. 806</a>, <a href="/us/422/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="422 U.S. 806" data-case-ids="9431" data-case-paths="/us/422/0806-01">95 S.Ct. 2525</a>, <a href="/us/422/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="422 U.S. 806" data-case-ids="9431" data-case-paths="/us/422/0806-01">45 L.Ed.2d 562</a> (1975). <em>Faretta </em>held that the Sixth Amendment established a right to self-representation at trial, <em><a href="/us/422/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="422 U.S. 806" data-case-ids="9431" data-case-paths="/us/422/0806-01">id. </a></em><a href="/us/422/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="422 U.S. 806" data-case-ids="9431" data-case-paths="/us/422/0806-01">at 819-20</a>, <a href="/us/422/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="422 U.S. 806" data-case-ids="9431" data-case-paths="/us/422/0806-01">95 S.Ct. 2525</a>; counsel argues that, following <em>Martinez, </em>it is now clear that there is no analogous federal right to self-representation on appeal. Counsel points out that the <em>Martinez </em>Court distinguished <em>Faretta </em>because the federal right of appeal is not constitutional, but statutory. Counsel further notes that in <em>Martinez, </em>the High Court recognized that states obviously could “recognize such a right under their own constitutions,” but alleges that this Court has never decided whether Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution is distinct from the U.S. Constitution for purposes of determining if there is a Pennsylvania constitutional right to self-representation on appeal. Thus, counsel concludes that this Court must determine whether a constitutional right of self-representation on appeal exists in Pennsylvania before we may consider granting the motion to withdraw to allow for such representation.</p>
    <p id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[236,1544,1151,744]]]'>Second, counsel argues that even if this Court were to recognize a right to self-representation on appeal under the Pennsylvania Constitution, the right is not absolute. Instead, this Court has indicated that it will limit the right to self-representation when it would lead to unnecessary delay or disruption of the judicial process. <em>See Commonwealth v. Rogers, </em><a href="/pa/537/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="537 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="775556" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0581-01">537 Pa. 581</a>, <a href="/pa/537/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="645 A.2d 223" data-case-ids="775556,7861218" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0581-01,/a2d/645/0223-01">645 A.2d 223</a>, 224 (1994) (no Grazier<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> hearing warranted when request to proceed <em>pro se </em>was forwarded after counsel filed appellate briefs). In this case, counsel urges us to invoke the <em>Rogers </em>procedural limitation on a claim for self-representation, as it is clear that appellant is of the mistaken belief that post-trial proceedings have not been completed, and because granting his request will only delay the already-delayed proceedings on appeal.</p>

Counsel also asserts that he was prepared to submit a brief in this matter, as required, on August 11, 2010, again suggesting that allowing appellant to proceed <em>pro se </em>at this juncture would only delay this matter further, as it certainly would.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b467-4" data-blocks='[["BL_467.4",467,[193,768,1149,414]]]'>The Commonwealth has not filed a substantive reply to the issues raised by counsel. Instead, the Commonwealth has filed a No Answer Letter in reply to the Motion to Withdraw. In the letter, the Commonwealth states that it “believes that the first inquiry in this matter needs to be whether or not the Appellant has a right to represent himself on this appeal.” The Commonwealth offers no view on the merits of that first inquiry.</p>
    <p id="b467-5" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[192,1208,1150,525]],["BL_468.1",468,[243,327,1151,528]]]'>Counsel’s withdrawal motion presents an issue, novel in Pennsylvania, respecting the question of entitlement to self-representation on appeal. When an appellate court, including this Court, has been presented with a timely request to proceed <em>pro se </em>on appeal, the court generally has remanded for a <em>“Grazier </em>hearing” to determine if the waiver of counsel is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. In <em>Grazier, </em>which was decided before <em>Martinez, </em>this Court indicated that a defendant-appellant in a criminal case has a right to self-representation on appeal, citing to <em>Ellis </em>and Faretta,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
      <em>Grazier, </em>713 <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>A.2d at 82 <em>(“Ellis </em>expressly recognized the right to proceed without the assistance of counsel: ‘[a] represented appellant may petition to terminate his representation; he may, acting pursuant to the rules of criminal procedure, proceed on his own behalf.’ ”). We then directed that when an appellant in a criminal case asks leave to proceed <em>pro se, </em>a remand for a hearing was necessary to determine whether the appellant wishes to waive counsel, and if so, whether the waiver of the right to counsel for purposes of appeal is knowing, intelligent and voluntary. <em>Id.</em>

The Court first explained that in <em>Faretta, </em>it had held there was a Sixth Amendment right to self-representation for purposes of trial. The Court then distinguished the circumstances on appeal, noting that there was no historical consensus establishing a federal right to self-representation on appeal. Indeed, the Court pointed out that appeals as of right in federal court were non-existent until more recent times and thus appellate review of any sort was rarely allowed. <em><a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">at 157-59</a>, <a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">120 S.Ct. 684</a>. The Court also indicated that <em>Faretta’s </em>reliance on the rights embodied in the Sixth Amendment was not relevant. This was so because those rights were particular to the basic rights that a defendant shall have in “all criminal prosecutions,” <em>i.e., </em>rights at trial, but do not speak to rights on appeal. Instead, the Court explained, the federal right to appeal in criminal cases is purely statutory in nature. <em><a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">at 159-60</a>, <a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">120 S.Ct. 684</a>. Turning then to the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court rejected the notion that a right of self-representation on appeal, binding upon the states, could be found in that provision; in so holding, the Court noted that a state’s interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice at the appellate level outweighs any interest in appellate self-representation. <em><a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">at 162</a>, <a href="/us/528/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="528 U.S. 152" data-case-ids="9476208" data-case-paths="/us/528/0152-01">120 S.Ct. 684</a>.

Rogers sought to waive his right to counsel on the basis of appellate counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness. Rogers also filed a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief purporting to amend the counseled brief and add new issues. The Superior Court denied the request and refused to consider the additional issues. Upon further review in this Court, we first noted that it was well-settled that “a criminal defendant or appellant has the right to proceed <em>pro se </em>at trial and through appellate proceedings.” <em>Rogers, </em><a href="/pa/537/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="645 A.2d 223" data-case-ids="775556,7861218" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0581-01,/a2d/645/0223-01">645 A.2d at </a>224 (citing <em>Faretta, Ellis, </em>and Pa.R.Crim.P. 121<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>). We intimated, however, that the right to proceed <em>pro se </em>on appeal once the appeal has been filed is less clear.

In finding that the lower court did not abuse its discretion, we indicated that there was a timeliness aspect to any such request; further, we noted, courts have refused such requests based on the need to minimize disruptions, to avoid inconvenience and delay, to maintain continuity, and to avoid confusing the jury. <em><a href="/a2d/709/0849-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="709 A.2d 849" data-case-ids="11836633,507814" data-case-paths="/a2d/709/0849-01,/pa/551/0096-01">Id.</a></em>
