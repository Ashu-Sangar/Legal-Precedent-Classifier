Instead, consistent with past practices, the board averaged Appellants’ compensation over their last twelve months of service, before reducing the resultant figure by one-half to determine the monthly pension benefit. <em>See </em>Pottsville, Pa., Ordinances ch. 46, art.

Appellants relied on Article XLIII, Section 4303 of the Code, which provides, in relevant part, that police pensions are to be based on officers’ “rate of monthly pay” as of the retirement date, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b61-6" data-blocks='[["BL_61.6",61,[240,1613,1110,257]]]'>The basis of the apportionment of the pension shall be determined by the <em>rate of the monthly pay </em>of the member at the date of ... retirement, or the highest average annual salary which the member received during any five years of service preceding ... retirement, whichever is the higher[.]</blockquote>

The court reasoned that, had the General Assembly intended the use of an average of the last twelve months’ salaries, it would have expressly said as much. Thus, the common pleas court entered judgment in Appellants’ favor.</p>
    <p id="b62-5" data-blocks='[["BL_62.5",62,[245,832,1148,1119]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of the City. <em>See Gontarchick v. City of Pottsville, </em><a href="/a2d/962/0703-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="962 A.2d 703" data-case-ids="8187647" data-case-paths="/a2d/962/0703-01">962 A.2d 703</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2008). Initially, the court expressed concern that Appellants’ construction of Section 4303 resulted in an inexplicable disparity between police and firefighter pensions, which it characterized as inequitable and unreasonable, and thus, contrary to presumptions applicable in statutory construction. <em>See, e.g., </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (reflecting the presumption that the Legislature does not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable). Furthermore, the Commonwealth Court highlighted the presumption that the General Assembly intends to favor public over private interests. <em>See Gontarchick, </em><a href="/a2d/962/0703-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="962 A.2d 703" data-case-ids="8187647" data-case-paths="/a2d/962/0703-01">962 A.2d at 708</a> (referencing, indirectly, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(5)). The court reasoned that Appellants’ construction would not serve the interests of the City and the public, as it would generate uncertainty regarding future pension fund needs. The Commonwealth Court thus concluded that the City’s approach of using an average of the last twelve months of salary to arrive at a rate of monthly pay for police officers was a reasonable and appropriate reading of the governing statute.</p>

They also emphasize the mandatory language of the statute, highlighting that the required method of calculation is non-discretionary. According to Appellants, averaging to determine a “monthly rate” renders the five-year look-back alternative superfluous (based on the assumption that a final years’ compensation will always be highest). Thus, Appellants contend that, if the General Assembly had intended pensions to be calculated as advocated by the City, the statute would have been drafted to include only the highest-annual-salary method.</p>
    <p id="b63-4" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[193,1034,1149,739]]]'>The City, on the other hand, takes the position that the phrase “rate of monthly pay,” by its terms, contemplates an average of the employee’s pay, assessed at the time of retirement and based on comparative earnings per month over time. In particular, the City focuses on the word “rate,” which it suggests connotes an amount of charge or payment with reference to some basis of calculation; a certain quantity or amount of one thing considered in relation to another thing and used as a standard or measure. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 9-10 (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed.1991), and Webster’s Dictionary (9th ed.1988)). In the City’s view, had the General Assembly intended for municipalities to calculate pension amounts upon the retiring employee’s “final month’s salary,” it would have done so on such terms.</p>

In these cases, the City observes, a twelve-month average rate of monthly pay was utilized as the base figure in pension calculations, albeit the City recognizes that the validity of the averaging practice was not before the Commonwealth Court in either case.

    <p id="b64-4" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[249,520,1149,1062]]]'>Upon our review, we find Section 4303 to be ambiguous. In addition to the connotations accompanying the word “rate,” the adjective “monthly” also suggests the Legislature may have contemplated some sort of regularity. <em>See, e.g., </em>Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 806 (11th ed.2003) (defining “monthly,” <em>inter alia, </em>as “occurring or appearing every month”). Thus there is potential disharmony in the inclusion of variable forms of compensation, such as unscheduled overtime. In light of the resultant, material ambiguity, we refer to the tools of statutory construction, including consideration of the occasion and necessity for the statute, the object to be attained, and the consequences of a particular interpretation. <em>See DPW v.

There is simply too much opportunity for arbitrariness, disparity, and/or manipulation — arising from a system that contemplates a single month’s total gross compensation as the litmus for lifetime pension benefits — for us to infer that the Legislature contemplated such a scheme. For example, benefits can be inflated or depressed substantially through the granting or withholding of extra work assignments over a short period of time. Thus, the outcome may be dependent on such unpredictable factors as the retiring officer’s awareness of the significance of his last month’s pay and understandable desire to maximize his pension; the cooperation or non<a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>cooperation of local police supervisors; the department’s prevailing work demands; and/or an officer’s physical abilities in his last work month.</p>
