We recognized that, in enacting the PEPFA, the General Assembly sought to promote integrity in public employment by deterring criminal conduct. In addition, we recognized a second, implied objective of the General Assembly in enacting PEPFA, <em>ie., </em>to ensure that individuals who have accumulated pension savings are not unjustly deprived of this important property interest. In sum, in <em>Mazzo, </em>we held the city ordinance invalid because it was in “plain conflict with PEPFA’s directive that benefits be paid if the accused employee is not found guilty” of the charged criminal misconduct. <em><a href="/pa/531/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="531 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1834372" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0078-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/531/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="531 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1834372" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0078-01">at 197</a>. <em>Mazzo </em>is an example of a case in which the conflict between the state and local enactments was irreconcilable because the ordinance added an additional requirement, which was implicitly barred by the statute and which stood as an obstacle to one of the implied objectives of the legislature.</p>

The Restaurant Association challenged the ordinance, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was inconsistent with, and thus was preempted by the Act of 1945, P.L. 926, which had the same purpose and covered the same area as the ordinance. <em>Restaurant Association, supra </em>at 618.</p>

The City argues that, pursuant to <em>Nutter, supra, </em>such silence should not be interpreted as a legislative intent to prohibit local regulation of the sale of dual-use items in a manner free of a scienter requirement. <em>See Nutter, supra </em>at 403, 409-10 &amp; n. 19, 413-14, 416 (declining to conclude that local regulation of campaign contributions to candidates for municipal office was preempted by the Election Code,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> where the General Assembly was silent as to statewide contribution limits). Again, we cannot agree with the City, and we conclude that <em>Nutter </em>is inapposite. With regard to offenses involving delivery of drug paraphernalia, the General Assembly was far from silent as to the <em>mens rea </em>element. The Act expressly requires that an offender know or reasonably should know that the drug paraphernalia would be used in conjunction with a controlled substance in violation of the Act; thus, a seller of a dual-use item for legitimate purposes is protected from any penalty under the Act.</p>

Rather, the primary focus was on whether the Philadelphia ordinance followed “the broad outlines of the mother legislation” and whether the enactment promoted the General Assembly’s objectives as expressed in the BCA. <em><a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.2d%20326" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="147 A.2d 326">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.2d%20326" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="147 A.2d 326">at 329</a>.

Loosies and flavored tobacco, as defined in the Ordinance, are not included by name in the drug paraphernalia definition of the Act and are, therefore, not among the dual-use items specifically addressed by the state enactment. Nonetheless, appellants raise the same conflict preemption arguments regarding all the challenged provisions of the Ordinance, whether they address loosies and flavored tobacco, § 622(5)(a)(. 1), (.4), or they address drug paraphernalia by reference to the Act, § 629(2). As neither party argues to the contrary, like the Majority, I proceed on the assumption that loosies and flavored tobacco are included in the Act’s broad definition of "drug paraphernalia” and are, therefore, addressed by the Act. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 780-102.</p>

In <em>Huntley, </em>this Court noted that the doctrine of conflict preemption has traditionally been employed to invalidate state laws that stand in the way of the national Congress’s objectives, but that the doctrine also fully applies on an intrastate level, to municipal ordinances that interfere with the operation of state statutes. <a href="/pa/600/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="964 A.2d 855" data-case-ids="4193892,8218515" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0207-01,/a2d/964/0855-01">964 A.2d at 863, n. 6</a>.

To the extent that appellants argue that the Ordinance is an unreasonable restraint on sales of dual-use items that supposedly destroys the tobacco industry and appellants’ businesses in Philadelphia, that argument is better suited to support vagueness or overbreadth legal arguments — questions of constitutionality — rather than of application of the conflict preemption doctrine.

The Majority also cites this Court’s sixty year-old opinion in <em>Restaurant Association </em>as support for its conclusion that the Ordinance is preempted. Majority Op. at 157-58, 164-65, 10 A.3d at 909, 913. But, <em>Restaurant Association </em>does not shed any greater light than more recent precedent in this area of law. <em>Restaurant Association's </em>analysis of the local ordinance provisions which were invalidated is limited to the following: "some of the provisions of the ordinance are inconsistent with those of the 1945 Act. For example, the penal provisions of the ordinance are more drastic, and the fines to be imposed for violations are made payable to the city instead of, as in the statute, to the county where the restaurant is located.

I also recognize the potential persuasiveness of these arguments for invalidating the Ordinance under some of the other legal theories offered by appellants to the trial court, but which the trial court did not reach after finding preemption. Those theories are not before us here. The question before us is conflict preemption, and consideration of whether the municipality pursued the best means to accomplish its stated purpose is not a salient factor in that analysis. Whether one enjoys cigars or not, for conflict preemption analysis, a cigar is just a cigar.</p>
