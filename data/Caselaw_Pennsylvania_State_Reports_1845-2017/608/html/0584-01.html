The existing structures are steel-deck truss bridges, the same general type of construction involved in the fatal bridge collapse in Minneapolis on August 1, 2007. The Erie County bridges were built in 1957 and redecked in 1976. They are each nearly 800 feet long, and their height is 180 feet from the stream bottom to the roadway deck, making them among the highest state-owned bridges in Pennsylvania. Traffic over these bridges consists of 40,000 vehicles daily, a figure that includes some 12,000 trucks. According to PennDOT, the bridges must be rebuilt because their structural integrity has been compromised by cracks, corroding, and other defects. To replace the bridges, PennDOT sought to select a contractor in accordance with procedures outlined in its relatively new internal publication, entitled, “Publication 448, Innovative Bidding Toolkit” (“Publication 448”).</p>

It explains that innovative bidding seeks, among other things, to account for social costs, such as disturbance to the traveling public, in addition to taxpayer dollar costs. Publication 448 also recites that there are a variety of methods of innovative bidding, such <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>as the design-build method, which is a “process by which a single entity bids to provide both the design and construction under a single contract between the Department and the design-build contractor.” Publication 448 at 1-3. <em>See generally </em>62 Pa.C.S. § 103 (defining a design/build contract as a “construction contract in which the contractor is responsible for both the design and construction of any public structure or building or other public improvements.... ”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b647-4" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[184,772,1151,799]]]'>The design-build method differs from traditional bidding, in which PennDOT designs (or hires an engineering firm to design) the project and then solicits bids for its construction, a process known as design-bid-build procurement. Under design-build, by contrast, PennDOT supplies general technical criteria, and each design-build team formulates a design satisfying those criteria. Thus, the team supplies both design and construction services. <em>See </em>Publication 448 at 2-2. Moreover, there are multiple variants of the design-build method, including “design-build best-value” (DBBV). According to Penn-DOT, DBBV provides the agency “with the most potential for multiple design solutions and innovation in the use of materials.” <em>Id. </em>at 3-1. Its goal is to “reduce overall time from design start to completion of the project, which provides for a shorter project completion time at a lower cost.” <em>Id. </em>at 2-2.</p>

To arrive at this list, PennDOT first publishes advertisements containing, <em>inter alia, </em>a general description of the work and its requirements, any additional technical qualifications desired, and the time frame for submitting responses. <em>See id. </em>at 2-1. Prospective design-build teams respond by submitting statements of interest detailing their qualifications, the resumes of key personnel, and organizational charts. The statements of interest, however, do not include any monetary bid on the project in question. From the list of timely-submitted statements of interest, PennDOT picks a short list of three to five teams that it considers best suited to the project. It communicates with the short-listed teams to ensure they have a clear understanding of the work involved and that any technical approach they may be considering is responsive to the project’s needs. PennDOT additionally debriefs the non-short-listed teams, on request, concerning how they can improve their statements of interest for the next DBBV project. <em>See id. </em>at D-20.</p>
    <p id="b648-4" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[250,1357,1149,676]]]'>The second step in two-step DBBV is for each short-listed team to submit a technical approach and a price, which becomes the basis for a negotiated stipend agreement. To accomplish this, PennDOT enters into a separate stipend agreement with the teams on the short list, under which PennDOT agrees to pay the team a stipend to develop a proposed design for the project. Thereafter, the design partner for each team develops a proposed technical approach and submits it, along with a price bid, to PennDOT. <em>See id. </em>at 1-3. The agency utilizes its best-value assessment methodology to determine which proposal supplies the best value for the cost of the bid. The team that submitted the winning proposal is awarded the contract.</p>

The <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>statements were due by July 17, 2008. The advertisement stated that PennDOT would short-list three firms to receive stipend agreements based upon the agency’s evaluation of all of the statements it received. The advertisement did not include the scope of the work involved, and it did not indicate that the teams could supply a price bid for the project. Appellant Brayman Construction Corporation, together with the design firm of Drewberry-Goodkind, Inc., submitted a timely statement of interest to PennDOT for consideration. Six other teams also submitted timely statements.</p>

The short-listed teams entered into a stipend agreement with PennDOT, and they were invited to submit a technical approach for the project. Brayman-Drewberry was not one of the short-listed teams.</p>
    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[188,1465,1153,785]]]'>In early September 2008, PennDOT again advertised the Erie County Project on its ECMS system <em>(see supra </em>note 1), and, for the first time, stated that bids for the project’s construction costs would be accepted. Bids were due November 13, 2008. Brayman’s vice president testified that this second advertisement was akin to the typical notice that PennDOT provides when it seeks competitive bids on a construction job pursuant to its ordinary design-bid-build procedure, as the notice included a description of the scope of the work and a place for the construction contractor to submit a price bid. However, the advertisement also contained a qualifier in its “Special Provisions” section, indicating that bids would only be accepted from the design-build teams that were short-listed by PennDOT, and that all other bids would be rejected.</p>

Muck (collectively, “Brayman”), filed in the Commonwealth Court a petition for review in the nature of a complaint in equity (the “Petition”), directed to the court’s original jurisdiction. Brayman asserted taxpayer standing, and alleged that PennDOT’s actions in using a two-step DBBV process to select a contractor for the Erie County Project was contrary to the Commonwealth Procurement Code (the “Code”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and would compromise the integrity of the competitive bidding process by reducing competition. Brayman contended that the Code sets forth the system of competitive bidding required for all public construction jobs in the Commonwealth, and that it does not authorize PennDOT to use DBBV procurement for such undertakings. Specifically, Brayman averred that Section 512 of the Code, 62 Pa.C.S. § 512, requires competitive sealed bidding except as otherwise provided in Section 511, which in turn refers to Section 513, which does not authorize a “best value” approach. Brayman stated, in this respect, that PennDOT’s utilization of that approach results in an over-expenditure of public funds, as compared to the competitive sealed-bid process that the Code directs PennDOT to utilize.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Brayman asserted that it had no adequate remedy at law and that the relief it sought represented the only means available to abate the harm caused by PennDOT’s conduct. In this regard, Brayman averred that it was precluded from using the administrative appeal process set forth in the Code, <em>see </em>62 Pa.C.S. <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>§ 1711.1, because it was not technically a disappointed bidder. Brayman contended that the statement-of-interest process — as contemplated by Publication 448 — essentially constitutes a prequalification procedure to narrow the list of prospective bidders to the short list of design-build teams. Thus, according to Brayman, only the short-listed teams who are not awarded the final contract are entitled to make use of the Code’s administrative protest procedures. <em>See </em>Petition at 27-28. PennDOT filed a preliminary objection, contending that exclusive jurisdiction over Brayman’s claims regarding the agency’s procurement procedures is vested in the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to the administrative appeal process, i.e., the bid protest procedure set forth in Section 1711.1 of the Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

As for the preliminary objection, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that Brayman was not required to use the Code’s bid-protest mechanism, available to bidders and prospective bidders, because the short-listing process did not involve any bidding or bid solicitation, but instead amounted to a prequalification process by which PennDOT determined which teams were eligible to submit bids during the second step of the process. <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>Since Brayman-Drewberry never advanced to that step, the court did not view Brayman as a bidder or prospective bidder.

    <p id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.4",652,[245,557,1153,949]]]'>After receiving further pleadings and advocacy, the court issued a single-judge, unpublished opinion and order, concluding that DBBV procurement, as implemented by PennDOT, is overly subjective and not authorized by the Code. It thus preliminarily enjoined PennDOT from seeking and evaluating design-build contracts using two-step DBBV “or any other ‘innovative method’ that does not award the bid based on sealed competitive bids.” <em>Brayman Constr. Corp. v. Penn-DOT, </em>No. 527 M.D. 2008, <em>slip op. </em>at 19 (Pa.Cmwlth., Feb. 17, 2009). In the interest of public safety, however, the court denied relief as to the Erie County bridges, allowing Penn-DOT to continue with the best-value method to award the contract for that project. The court further directed that, if there are other bridges for which proposals have already been sought under the best-value method, PennDOT “may seek an exception to this injunction by showing that the traveling public will be harmed if it is not permitted to proceed.” <em>Id. </em>at 19-20.</p>

PennDOT notes, further, that the statutory appeal provision is exclusive, both by its terms, <em>see id. </em>§ 1711.1(£), and by longstanding precedent requiring that administrative remedies be exhausted. <em>See Jackson v.

PennDOT also states that Stephen Muck, Brayman’s owner, cannot separately maintain a taxpayer lawsuit, when his real interest is having his company win the contract to rebuild the Erie County bridges, thus giving him standing in his own right to invoke the Code’s grievance process.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Brayman responds by pointing out that PennDOT’s first step in procuring the bridges in question was the issuance of the advertisement on July 8, 2008, which only solicited statements of interests, and not bids, offers, or any other binding promise to perform work. Thus, Brayman submits that, under the two-step DBBV procedure that PennDOT used, Brayman never became a prospective bidder or contractor, and it was not aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract — both necessary prerequisites to the application of Section 1711.1.</p>

In answering this question, we inquire whether Bray-man was a prospective bidder or contractor who was aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract, thereby facially coming within the scope of Section <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>1711.1(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> This is a mixed question of fact and law, as it requires consideration of PennDOT’s actions, as well as the significance of terms that appear in Section 1711.1 — most notably, “prospective.”</p>

The advertisement did not request any technical approach, price bid, or other binding offer to perform work for the agency, and bidding was not accepted at that juncture. No bond or insurance was requested, and there was no defined scope of work or pre-bid meeting, as normally occurs prior to bidding. <em>See </em>N.T., Jan. 13, 2009, at 18. This first step was intended by PennDOT to narrow the field of participants to a short list of three, from which technical approaches and price bids would be requested, and the “best value” proposal would be selected. Any short-listed team could elect to enter into a stipend agreement with PennDOT, or withdraw from contention. In light of these factors, the Commonwealth Court concluded that: in the first step of two-step DBBV, “all you have are expressions of interest,” N.T., Jan. 15, 2009, at 207; the only firms that are permitted to bid for the work are the three short-listed teams, <em>see id. </em>at 211; and, therefore, the first step involves “essentially a high-end prequalification” to bid. <em>Id.</em>

Jan. 13, 2009, at 105. Under this view, Brayman was aware that PennDOT would eventually engage firms in some type of contract bidding relative to the Erie County bridges, and that Brayman, as a prequalified Penn-DOT contractor, would benefit financially if it ultimately won the contract. In this broader sense, Brayman was a prospective (in the sense of “potential”) bidder or contractor until the selection of the short list, and was aggrieved in connection with the solicitation of a contract, either because the contract was solicited from a group of design-build teams from which Brayman was excluded, or because the solicitation began when <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>PennDOT published its initial advertisement. Since Bray-man’s underlying complaint challenges the legality of two-step DBBV generally, moreover, Brayman knew of the facts giving rise to the protest on or about July 8, 2008, because, as of that date, Brayman became aware that PennDOT might exclude it from the short list — and, hence, might refuse to consider its bid — contrary to what Brayman believed the law required.</p>

However, the Legislature clearly did not intend all such persons to be swept into the categories of prospective bidder or prospective contractor. The issue for resolution involves where the Legislature intended the line to be drawn. We need not formulate an answer to that question general enough to apply in all cases — which, in any event, may be impossible to do at this juncture. We conclude, however, that where (as here) PennDOT implements a procedure that entails some form of competitive bidding on a construction project, and additionally divides the group of hopeful bidders into a subset of companies from which it is willing to consider bids, and another subset from which it is not willing to consider bids, the members of the latter group never become “prospective” bidders or contractors in more than a highly attenuated sense. Although they may hope to bid or win the contract at the beginning of the process, there is never an identifiable point in time during that procedure when it is possible for them to bid. Under these circumstances, the complaining entity’s potential for bidding or contracting with the agency is highly attenuated and, in our view, insufficient to allow it to come within the meaning of the “prospective” qualifier as used in the statute. <em>Cf.

PennDOT did not accept bids in response to its initial advertisement. Then, after the statements of interest were received, it clarified in its second announcement that bids would be accepted, but only from the short-listed teams, of which Brayman-Drewberry was not one. Brayman-Drewberry was thus excluded from bidding before any bids were solicited and, hence, never had any affirmative expectation of being able to bid. In short, although Brayman-Drewberry had hoped to be able to submit a bid to design and build the bridges (and have that bid considered on a competitive basis with other bids), it was precluded from doing so via the portion of the process that the Commonwealth Court analogized to a “high-end prequalification” step.</p>

There was no discussion about procurement through methodologies independent of the “innovative” approaches utilized by the agency and, as Brayman points out, PennDOT never indicated, during the course of the proceedings, that it has sought contracts under Section 513 or intends to do so in the future. <em>See </em>Reply Brief for Appellants at 45.

The court was of the view that the “best value” methodology, as applied by PennDOT pursuant to Publication 448, violates the Code due to its subjectivity. This aspect of the challenged procurement method was in sharp focus during the proceedings, and the court ultimately emphasized its concern over the lack of a clear definition or explanation of the best-value process. <em>See id. </em>at 10-12 n. 9; <em>see also id. </em>at 13. Indeed, much of the questioning by the court and counsel pertained to whether there were any objective standards that PennDOT could employ pursuant to Publication 448. The agency’s employees, however, were unable to give a clear description of how its best-value analysis works. To the contrary, they ultimately: agreed with the court that the best-value selection method is “kind of nebulous,” N.T., Jan. 13, 2009, at 75; conceded that the process includes “some subjectivity,” <em>id. </em>at 80; and indicated that it entails a qualitative assessment based on whether PennDOT believes the particular personnel assigned to the project within the design-build teams are good performers. <em>See </em>N.T., Jan. 15, 2009, at 192; <em>see also </em>N.T., Jan. 13, 2009, at 86 (reflecting the testimony of the director of PennDOT’s Bureau of Construction and Materials that having a common, objective standard by which to measure bids is important to the procurement process). We need not opine concerning whether best value, as thus described, constitutes good or bad policy. Rather, our point here is that the first paragraph of the injunction was evidently aimed, among other things, at preventing PennDOT from employing a Publication 448-based best value analysis when assessing design-build teams during any aspect of the procurement process.

Even if we assume that Section 905 allows DBBY-type short-listing of design firms when obtaining design professional services, the Commonwealth Court determined that design-build agreements do not qualify as contracts for design professional services because the Code defines them as a type of construction contract, <em>see </em>62 Pa.C.S. § 103, and PennDOT does not attempt to <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>cast doubt upon that determination.

Brayman maintains, instead, that the record suggests there would have been no delay, and PennDOT had numerous other ways to procure the project through legal means. Penn-DOT responds that the hearing testimony supported several factual predicates that could have given the Commonwealth Court reasonable grounds to conclude that the public would be harmed by any delay in reconstructing the bridges.

The parties argue this point primarily in terms of whether the Commonwealth Court had jurisdiction. However, the rule requiring exhaustion of available administrative remedies pertains, not to the existence of subject matter jurisdiction, but to whether such jurisdiction is properly exercised. <em>See Beattie v. Allegheny County, </em><a href="/pa/589/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="589 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="2574437" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0113-01">589 Pa. 113</a>, 124 n. 5, <a href="/pa/589/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="907 A.2d 519" data-case-ids="2574437,2574997,8932556,8932658" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0113-01,/pa/589/0112-01,/a2d/907/0519-01,/a2d/907/0519-02">907 A.2d 519</a>, 526 n. 5 (2006). Moreover, PennDOT has not asserted that the Commonwealth Court should have refrained from exercising its jurisdiction pursuant to a residual exhaustion requirement independent of Section 1711.1. That particular issue is therefore not before us. <em>See generally Shenango Valley Osteopathic Hosp. v. Dep't </em>

PennDOT does not dispute, in general terms, the Commonwealth Court’s directive that, due to a lack of objective standards, its Publication 448-based best-value methodology may not be utilized during procurement. Indeed, the court's evaluation was expressed against a backdrop of case law explaining that competitive bidding rules exist, not only to secure work and supplies at the lowest possible price, but to guard against favoritism in the awarding of contracts. <em>See Brayman, </em>No. 527 M.D. 2008, <em>slip op. </em>at 9 n.7 (quoting <em>Yohe v. City of Lower Burrell, </em><a href="/pa/418/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="418 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1896130" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0023-01">418 Pa. 23</a>, 28, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20847" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="208 A.2d 847">208 A.2d 847</a>, 850 (1965)); <em>see also Louchheim v.

Accordingly, to the extent any question remains as to the propriety of this part of the order, we find that it is supported by the hearing testimony concerning the lack of objective standards in best-value assessment, and the consequent potential for subjective factors to play a substantial role in the awarding of contracts.</p>

PennDOT defines the status quo as Brayman’s "acceptance and active participation” in two-step DBBV procurement. Brief for Appellee at 34. By the time Brayman filed its petition, however, it no longer accepted the legitimacy of two-step DBBV. Thus, PennDOT’s argument is based on an erroneous factual premise.</p>

Brayman suggests that this Court disregard Mr. Thompson’s testimony because his credibility was suspect. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 27. Evidently, the Commonwealth Court thought otherwise, and it is not an appellate court’s function to reweigh the testimony or second-guess the trial court's credibility determinations. <em>See Summit Towne Ctr., </em><a href="/pa/573/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="573 Pa. 637" data-case-ids="197230" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0637-01">573 Pa. at 652-53</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="828 A.2d 995" data-case-ids="197230,9107810" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0637-01,/a2d/828/0995-01">828 A.2d at 1004-05</a>.</p>

Brayman also proffers that, because the court found PennDOT’s procurement method to be illegal, its decision to permit the Erie County Project to proceed to completion under two-step DBBV amounted to allowing PennDOT to spend public funds pursuant to an illegal contract, resulting in <em>per se </em>irreparable harm. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellants at 23 (quoting <em>Shaeffer v. City of Lancaster, </em><a href="/a2d/754/0719-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="754 A.2d 719" data-case-ids="11214873" data-case-paths="/a2d/754/0719-01">754 A.2d 719</a>, 723 (Pa.Cmwlth.2000)). This argument pertains to the irreparable-harm prong of the standard for granting a preliminary injunction. As all six prerequisites must be satisfied for an injunction to issue, and as we have found that the no-public-harm requirement has not been met, we need not address Brayman’s argument in this regard.</p>
