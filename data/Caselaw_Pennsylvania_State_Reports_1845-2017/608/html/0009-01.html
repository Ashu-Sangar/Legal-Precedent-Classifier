We granted review to consider whether the Superior Court erred in determining that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the goal change requested by the Allegheny County Office of Children, Youth, and Families (“CYF”). Upon review, we conclude that the Superior Court erred. Accordingly, we reverse the Superior Court’s decision and reinstate the trial court’s order.</p>

Initially, Child was placed with his paternal grandmother. In February 2007, the trial court adjudicated Child dependent based on the domestic violence concerns and Parents’ drug and alcohol use, and placed Child in foster care. A Family Service Plan (“FSP”) was developed by CYF to address the domestic violence, drug, and alcohol issues that led to Child’s placement. Permanency review hearings were held in May 2007, August 2007, December 2007, March 2008, June 2008, and August 2008, and, relevant to the current appeal, in January 2009, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351.</p>

N.T. at 9-11. Conversely, Dr. Rosenblum recognized that Child had been in placement for an extended time, which would counsel in favor of a goal change, but noted that Foster Parents’ recent filing and recantation of their request to remove Child from their home raised doubts about their commitment to Child. N.T. at 9-11. Premised upon these concerns, Dr. Rosenblum testified that he would like to conduct further evaluations of Foster Parents. After considering Dr. Rosenblum’s testimony and the other <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>evidence presented, the trial court denied the motion for goal change for the reasons set forth below.</p>

Noting that the relevant statute, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(f.1), provided several permanency plan options for Child, including reunification and adoption, the court opined that reunification is the “preferred option” and that “[i]n order for the goal to be changed to adoption, it must be proven that this option is best suited to the child’s safety, protection, and physical, mental, and emotional welfare and reunification is not the best option.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 4. The court further viewed the law to require that “when the parents of a dependent have cooperated with [the] child welfare agency, achieved the goals of their permanency plans, and alleviated the circumstances that necessitated the child’s original placement, the agency should continue to put forth efforts to reunite the child with [his] parents.” Tr.

Ct. Op. at 5. As the first reason for its conclusion regarding adoption, the court stated that “it is uncertain whether Foster Parents are fully dedicated to Child, thus calling into question the long-term stability of Child’s current placement.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 5. As evidence to support its finding, the court noted that “Dr. Rosenblum testified that the [October 2008 notice requesting removal of Child] changed his opinion of the situation and [that Dr. Rosenblum] would want to conduct further evaluations with Foster Parents and Child to determine if this home is the best fit for Child.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 5. The court also expressed concern regarding the “pressure exerted by [Foster Parents’] extended family [that] shows that the extended family does not have a close relationship with Child or <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>see him as part of the family, which could be detrimental to the emotional and mental welfare of Child.” Tr.

Ct. Op. at 5. The trial court was not blind to issues that remained as obstacles to reunification including Mother and Father’s history of domestic violence. The court, however, noted that Father had attended a seventeen-week anger management and domestic violence class and that Mother intended to withdraw the PFA order she attained against Father to allow them to attend marriage-counseling classes together. The court also observed that both Mother and Father had attended at least some of the required behavioral health therapy sessions. In addition, the trial court noted that Father testified that he would treat Mother’s unborn child (for which he was not the biological parent) as his own, if reunification was granted.

Ct. Op. at 7. Although the court did not use the term “concurrent planning” in the phrasing of its conclusion, his final two sentences address the consideration of two tracks for Child. First, the court observed that not changing the goal would allow Mother and Father to come into full compliance with their FSP goals. Second, the court noted that not changing the goal would also allow “additional time to satisfy this Court’s serious concerns about the permanence of Child’s current placement and Child’s attachment to Foster Parents.” Tr.

The Superior Court noted prior caselaw supporting the need for the child welfare agency and the courts to move a child toward adoption if reunification efforts have been unsuccessful, apparently not recognizing that concurrent planning allows an agency to move toward adoption and termination of parental rights while still maintaining a goal of reunification. Accordingly, the Superior Court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to change the permanency plan goal to adoption, reversed the trial court’s order, and remanded for entry of an order changing the goal to adoption.</p>

Moreover, we recognize that public policy supports the Superior Court's position given the need to channel limited agency resources to services that will provide the most benefit to the dependent child. Our research, however, discloses nothing in Federal or Pennsylvania statutory law or this Court's jurisprudence specifically stating that a decision to change a permanency plan goal to adoption permits an agency to stop providing services to the parents. In fact, ASFA’s designation of when reasonable efforts are not required does not reference goal change as one of those instances. <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20671" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 671">42 U.S.C. § 671</a>(a)(15)(D) (specifying that services are not required in situations including where the parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances as defined by statute, the parent has murdered another child of the parent, and termination of parental rights to a sibling). Rather, genetically, ASFA provides that "reasonable efforts shall be made to preserve and reunify families,” and specifically contemplates concurrent planning: “reasonable efforts to place a child for adoption ... may be made concurrently with reasonable efforts of the type described in subparagraph (B) [reunification of families].” <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20671" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 671">42 U.S.C. § 671</a>(a)(15)(B), (F).

Thus, we leave for another day the question of whether a cessation of funding for reunification services is a condition subsequent to a goal change. Moreover, we note that CYF in the case at bar asserted to the trial court that it would continue providing services, and thus allow for concurrent planning in the event the court had granted the goal change.</p>

We recognize that the trial court could have made specific findings regarding some of the additional subsection (f) and (f.l) factors and encourage trial courts in the future to make findings on the record regarding factors pertinent to the case being decided. We note that the practical effect of this opinion, which reinstates the trial court’s order denying the goal change, and Mr. Justice Saylor’s concurring and dissenting opinion, which advocates vacating the Superior Court’s order and remanding to the trial court, both result in placing the case before the trial court for consideration of which placement is best suited to the Child under the current circumstances.</p>

R.J.T. was adjudicated dependent on February 7, 2007. Although he initially was ordered to remain in Grandmother’s care, he was placed in foster care forthwith after Grandmother permitted unauthorized visits with Father in her home, and Father absconded to Fayette County with him. Father has a long history of criminal activity and antisocial behavior, and Mother has a history of criminal activity, substance abuse, and involvement with CYF as a child and a victim.

The August 15, 2008 family service plan (“FSP”) indicates that both Mother and Father have drug and alcohol abuse issues requiring treatment. Father was imprisoned for a variety of crimes from the time of R.J.T.’s removal in 2007 until September 2008.

In my view, the key aspects of § 6351(f)(9), broken down to its elements, are as follows: If the child has been in placement for fifteen <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>of twenty-two months, or Aggravated circumstances exist and reasonable efforts to prevent removal need not be made or continued, then the juvenile court must determine whether the agency has filed or joined in a termination of parental rights petition and identified a qualified family to adopt the child, unless the child is with a relative, the agency has a compelling reason why a termination of parental rights petition would not serve the child’s needs and welfare, or the family has not been given the necessary services. In other words, after fifteen of twenty-two months, if there is no compelling reason not to file a petition to terminate parental rights, the agency should move forward to remove the child from indefinite foster care.</p>

I also disagree with the Majority's suggestion that ”[a]lthough the [trial] court did not use the term 'concurrent planning’ in the phrasing of its conclusion, [its] final two sentences address the consideration of two tracks for [R.J.T.],” Majority Opinion at 18, 9 A.3d at 1184. I believe we must evaluate the lower courts’ actions based on what trial judges say, not on what they imply, and the trial court never used the term concurrent planning. The final two sentences referenced above are equally consistent with mere reluctance by the trial court to change the goal to adoption in order to allow Parents "more time” to achieve the FSP goals that should have already been met.</p>
