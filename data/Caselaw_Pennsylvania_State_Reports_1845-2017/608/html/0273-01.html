For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the order of the Superior Court, which remanded for entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of Lafayette College (“College”).</p>
    <p id="b335-6" data-blocks='[["BL_335.6",335,[194,910,1153,950]]]'>By way of background, Lafayette College (“the College”), located in Easton, Pennsylvania, is an educational institution offering degree programs in the liberal arts and engineering. The College hired Telesis Construction, Inc. (“Telesis”) as a general contractor to renovate the engineering building, also known as the Acopian Building, on the College’s campus. The College and Telesis entered into a Construction Management Agreement (“CMA”). Telesis’ on-site project manager was Edward Baer. The College designated one of its employees, Andrew Roth, as its project manager. The College and Telesis understood that Telesis would subcontract the renovation work to another entity. Telesis subcontracted with Kunsman Roofing and Siding (“Kunsman”) to perform the roofing work on the building. Appellant David Beil was employed by Kunsman as a roofer. The College separately contracted with Masonry Preservation Services, Inc. (“MPS”) to restore stonework on the outer walls of the building. Robert Bajda was MPS’ foreman.</p>
    <p id="b335-7" data-blocks='[["BL_335.7",335,[193,1894,1151,476]],["BL_336.1",336,[244,324,1149,361]]]'>On a rainy June 13, 2003 morning, Beil arrived at the site to install termination bars. These bars, also known as flashing, are thin aluminum strips, three inches wide and eight feet long, that are wrapped around the top of a protrusion through the roof, screwed into place, cuffed, and caulked to prevent leaking through the roof. The installation of the termination bars is the last step a roofer takes to seal a roof. The masonry work to be completed by MPS required the erection of a scaffold. The scaffolding erected by MPS included a <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>vertically-mounted ladder that was not equipped with fall protection. Beil used MPS’ scaffolding to access the roof. While ascending the vertically-mounted ladder in the rain, with approximately 10 to 15 pounds of termination bar over his shoulder, Beil fell approximately 30 feet, and, as a result, sustained a concussion, injuries to his head and neck, a fractured right shoulder, and a fractured left heel.</p>
    <p id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[247,708,1148,409]]]'>On June 6, 2005, Beil filed a personal injury action against the College, as owner of the property, Telesis, as the general contractor, and MPS, as owner of the scaffolding, in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Beil averred that all three defendants were negligent. Beil also asserted a strict liability action against MPS. Appellant Cheryl Beil, Beil’s wife, asserted a claim against all three defendants for loss of consortium.</p>
    <p id="b336-5" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[244,1147,1150,521]]]'>Prior to trial, the College filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis that it was an owner of the premises, that it had hired an independent contractor, Telesis, to perform construction on those premises, and that, under Pennsylvania law, the College was not liable for injuries to employees of the independent contractor or its subcontractors. The College further asserted that the limited exception for situations where an owner had retained the right of control over the work was not applicable because the College did not retain such control. The motion was denied without opinion.</p>

On March 27, 2007, the trial court molded the verdict to reflect delay damages and denied the College’s motions. One month later, on April 27, 2007, the court entered judgment against the College in the amount of $2,488,348.20.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thereafter, the College appealed to the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b337-4" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[203,776,1151,516]]]'>On August 12, 2008, by unpublished opinion and order, a unanimous panel of the Superior Court reversed and remanded for entry of judgment n.o.v. in favor of the College. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellants as verdict winners, the Superior Court concluded that the College was not liable as a matter of law under the “owner control” or “peculiar risk” exceptions to the general rule that one who hires an independent contractor is generally exempt from liability for injuries sustained by employees of the contractor or its subcontractor.</p>
    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.6",337,[201,1325,1151,903]],["BL_338.1",338,[240,323,1149,520]]]'>The Superior Court first noted the general rule in Pennsylvania that a party who hires an independent contractor is generally exempt from liability for injuries sustained by the contractor’s employees. Thus, a property owner has no duty to warn the contractor or its employees of conditions that are at least as obvious to the contractor and its employees as they are to the landowner. Responsibility for protection, and liability for negligence, therefore, are placed on the contractor and its employees. The court acknowledged, however, an exception to this general rule where a property owner who hires an independent contractor retains control of the means and methods of the contractor’s work. This “retained control” exception, set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 414 (1965), has been adopted in Pennsylvania. <em>See Farabaugh v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, </em><a href="/pa/590/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="590 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="3851548" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0046-01">590 Pa. 46</a>, <a href="/pa/590/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="911 A.2d 1264" data-case-ids="3851548,8405941" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0046-01,/a2d/911/1264-01">911 A.2d 1264</a> (Pa.2006). As stated in the Restatement, “It is not enough that [the property owner] has merely a general right <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>to order the work stopped or resumed, to inspect its progress or to receive reports, to make suggestions or recommendations which need not necessarily be followed, or to prescribe alterations and deviations.... There must be such a retention of a right of supervision that the contractor is not entirely free to do the work in his own way.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 414, cmt. c. Further, the court recognized that Pennsylvania courts have declined to apply the retained control exception to an owner who is concerned about safety, citing <em>Farabaugh.</em>

    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[239,866,1150,1004]]]'>The Superior Court recognized the somewhat unique nature of the relationship between the College and Telesis and of that between the College and MPS, finding it necessary to analyze both relationships to determine the College’s liability. First, regarding the relationship between the College and MPS, the court observed that the College hired MPS directly to restore the stonework on the engineering building. Under its purchase order with MPS, the College retained a right to inspect and approve “all material and equipment purchased” by MPS. Roth, the College’s project manager, maintained a regular presence on the work site and knew the scaffolding did not have fall protection. Furthermore, MPS consulted the College as to the placement of the scaffolding. The Superior Court found that, because Beil was not an employee of MPS, •with whom the College had a direct relationship, this distinguished case law finding liability for an owner of property who hired a contractor and instructed it when and where to begin its work. <em>See Byrd v. Merwin, </em><a href="/pa/456/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="456 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="584463" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0516-01">456 Pa. 516</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20280" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="317 A.2d 280">317 A.2d 280</a> (Pa.1974) (plurality).</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[241,1894,1147,470]],["BL_339.1",339,[199,330,1152,755]]]'>Furthermore, the court offered that, here, Telesis testified that it was in complete control of the project and responsible for the safety of its subcontractors, including Kunsman and its employees. Additionally, according to the court, the College did not retain control over the means and methods of the operative details of MPS’ masonry work. The court found the facts that the College had a project manager on the site, had the right to inspect and approve, and had the authority to make suggestions or recommendations were insufficient to <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>demonstrate control for purposes of Section 414 of the Restatement. Finally, and related thereto, the Superior Court reasoned that the record did not support the trial court’s conclusion that the College retained control because it told MPS when and where to erect the scaffolding. First, the Superior Court found there was no evidence that the College told MPS when to erect the scaffolding. Additionally, with respect to the location of the scaffolding, the College wanted to make sure the scaffolding was in a safe position and did not interfere with its conducting classes. According to the Superi- or Court, even if the College directed MPS where to position the scaffolding, doing so did not amount to such a retention of a right of supervision that MPS was not entirely free to do the work in its own way.</p>
    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[196,1129,1153,1245]],["BL_340.1",340,[251,329,1143,96]]]'>Regarding the relationship between the College and Telesis and its subcontractor Kunsman, who employed Beil, the Superior Court determined that Telesis was responsible for the work performed at the site. Furthermore, Kunsman agreed to all safety requirements set by Telesis. The court opined that the College did not retain control of Telesis’ construction management or Kunsman’s roofing, even though it hired a project manager and placed certain restrictions on the use of its property. Specifically, by the terms of the construction management agreement, the College contractually delegated all responsibility for the work, with the exception of the MPS masonry work, to Telesis and the subcontractors. As for restrictions on use of the College property, the Superior Court considered the College’s limitations on parking to avoid interference with school operations, and a ban on the use of the third floor as a short-cut to the roof based upon that being an occupied area. Moreover, workers were banned from using school bathrooms due to concerns about tracking mud and smoking in these areas. Finally, lunch breaks were restricted to the back of the building due to inappropriate comments having been made to a female student. These, according to the Superior Court, were reasonable restrictions to safeguard the College’s students, faculty, and property. Thus, the re<a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>strictions did not rise to the level of control required to impose liability.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[248,449,1150,959]]]'>Finally, the Superior Court addressed the “peculiar risk” exception to the general rule of non-liability for an owner when employing an independent contractor. Under this exception, when work is done under unusually dangerous circumstances involving a special danger or peculiar risk, liability attaches to the property owner. The Superior Court found the peculiar risk exception to be inapplicable for two reasons. First, the court reasoned that the risk associated with the roofing job was no different from the usual or ordinary risk associated with this type of work. Second, the court explained that the use of the ladder did not create the risk of harm; rather, it was created by the violation of a safety condition by Beil, his employer, or the general contractor in not using fall protection or safety lines. Thus, the “peculiar risk” exception did not apply. Therefore, the Superior Court concluded that the College was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reversed the judgment entered against it. Appellants filed a petition for allowance of appeal to our Court.</p>

Specifically, Appellants point to our Court’s decision in <em>Farabaugh. </em>In that case, the decedent, an employee of the general contractor on a project owned by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, was involved in a fatal accident while driving an off-highway dump truck. The general contractor had no contractual relationship with the con<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>struction manager of the project. Furthermore, the general contractor assumed all liability for injuries to employees on the site in its contract with the Commission. Our Court rejected liability on the part of the Commission. Additionally, we found it preferable to permit owners and construction managers to define their roles and responsibilities in each contract according to the needs of each project.

Similarly, according to Appellants, the College instructed MPS when to begin its work and in what area MPS was permitted to erect its scaffolding. Moreover, the College controlled when Kunsman was to work on the project due to the rain and a leak in the roof of the building. According to Appellants, the general contractor had no knowledge of the Kunsman roofers working on the roof on the day of the accident. Viewed in the light most favorable to Appellants as verdict winners, the College made the decision to have the roofers work in the rain to repair the leak in the roof, and thus, exercised control over the work. Similarly, the College directly hired MPS, the masonry contractor which erected the scaffolding from which Beil fell. Telesis had no control over MPS and its scaffolding as the College directly hired MPS.

Contrary to the Superior Court, Appellants urge that Roth admitted that he could have required MPS to fall-protect its scaffolding or allow workers such as Beil to use the elevator or the interior stairs to access the roof. According to Appellants, it makes no sense to allow an employee of MPS, which was more knowledgeable and contractually required to erect a scaffold, to be able to recover from the College, but prevent Beil from recovering for his injuries.</p>

Furthermore, Epstrin opined that the College was negligent because it failed to properly exercise control over the jobsite, allowed an OSHA-defective scaffold to be used, and mandated the use of a dangerous ladder.

The regulation of the work site by the College in this appeal underscores the point. It is undisputed that the College regulated certain aspects of the use of the engineering building. The College prohibited smoking in the building. It limited construction worker access to the occupied part of the building. As professors and students continued to use the part of the building that was not under renovation, a partition door separating that area from the renovation area was required to be kept locked. Related thereto, after a construction worker uttered an objectionable comment to a female student passing by, the workers were not permitted to take breaks in front of the building. More directly related to Appellants’ averments, Roth walked and inspected the jobsite on a daily basis.
