For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Superior Court’s order as to the first issue, albeit on different grounds.

These included three cross-lay compartments spanning the width of the truck, designed to house and carry fire hoses pre-connected to an on-board water supply. The successful bidder was the Boardman Company, a division of TBC Fabrication, Inc. (“Boardman”), which manufactured and delivered the fire <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>engine. CVFD separately acquired the necessary hoses, and the pumper was commissioned for use throughout the next decade.</p>
    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[239,499,1150,1046]]]'>In 1995, soon after CVFD acquired the Boardman fire engine, TBC liquidated based on the assertion that it was insolvent. Management of Sinor Manufacturing, Inc. (“Si-nor”) was interested in manufacturing and marketing ambulances and rescue vehicles, and apparently it was believed that name recognition associated with Boardman’s fire-engine business would facilitate such an enterprise. Thus, Sinor purchased the Boardman name from TBC for use in relation with emergency vehicles. The purchase included engineering drawings for Boardman fire engines; additionally, Sinor bought certain inventory and equipment from TBC at an auction. Other facilities and assets of TBC — including manufacturing and sale facilities which were used in producing fire engines; assets and facilities associated with TBC’s other principal line of business in custom steel fabrication; and the Boardman name relative to this latter line of products — were acquired by Boardman, Inc. (“BI”). Apparently BI was a sister company to TBC.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Finally, TBC sold proprietary rights associated with telescoping aerial platforms used in fire suppression to Aerial Innovations, Inc., an unrelated company.</p>

While en route, unbeknownst to the operators, a 200-foot, pre-connected fire hose fell from one of the cross-lay compartments, unraveled, and lodged under the <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>tire of a parked car. After it broke free with accumulated force, the hose or nozzle struck two ten-year-old bystanders, Erin Schmidt and Joeylynne Jeffress, causing severe injuries to both. Erin died the next day. The accident was witnessed by: Erin’s mother, Joyce Schmidt;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Erin’s sister, Lindsay Schmidt; and Joeylynne’s sister, Lauren Jeffress.</p>
    <p id="b391-4" data-blocks='[["BL_391.5",391,[210,673,1150,1176]]]'>Subsequently, Appellees, the Schmidt and Jeffress families, commenced civil actions in the court of common pleas, naming as defendants: CVFD; TBC and its Boardman division; BI; and Appellant (denominated in the complaint both as Sinor and Freightliner Specialty Vehicles, Inc.). Redress was sought for the wrongful death of Erin Schmidt, the injuries sustained by Joeylynne Jeffress, and the emotional distress suffered by Joyce and Lindsay Schmidt and Lauren Jeffress. Despite the prevailing general rule of law that the purchaser in an asset sale does not acquire the seller’s tort liabilities, Appellees asserted that BI was liable as a mere continuation of TBC. Appellees grounded their claims against Appellant on the theory that it perpetuated the relevant Boardman product line, thus triggering the “product-line exception” to the rule against successor liability, as reflected in prevailing Superior Court precedent. <em>See, e.g., Dawejko v.

Appellant unsuccessfully sought to preclude plaintiffs Joyce and Lindsay Schmidt and Lauren Jeffress from pursuing recovery for emotional distress damages on the ground that such damages are not recoverable in a strict products liability action. CVFD settled with Appellees, ten<a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>dering the maximum damages recoverable under the law consistent with governmental immunity. Nevertheless, trial proceeded against CVFD on Appellant’s cross-claim for indemnity and contribution. Appellees also discontinued their claims against TBC.</p>

Further, on Appellees’ motion, Appellant was precluded at trial from adducing evidence concerning BI’s retention of TBC management personnel and acquisition of various of its assets, facilities, and business operations in the 1995 liquidation.</p>
    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[245,997,1150,1377]]]'>At trial, the jury was tasked with resolving three principal liability issues: 1) was there a product defect in the Boardman fire truck; 2) could Appellant be held liable under the product-line exception to the general rule of successor non-liability; and 3) was CVFD negligent. Appellees asserted that the Boardman fire engine was defective, because it lacked a retaining device to secure fire hoses in the cross-lay compartments. Expert testimony was offered in support of this proposition. To advance the product-line exception, Appellees adopted the theme that, under Pennsylvania law, “you take the good with the bad.” N.T., Sept. 5, 2006, at 110; <em>see also id. </em>at 112-13, 129, 132, 138. In this regard, they relied substantially on Sinor’s sales advertising, which misleadingly portrayed Sinor as a continuation of Boardman, for example, as by possessing the latter’s 65 years’ experience in the manufacture of emergency vehicles. Further, Appellees highlighted that Sinor claimed in its product literature to make fire suppression vehicles and, in fact, had manufactured “woods trucks” with fire suppression capability. Appellees also offered proof that Sinor acquired the engineering drawings for full-scale fire trucks from TBC in connection with its limited purchase of the Boardman name, and of its auction purchase of some of TBC’s material assets. To support the emotional-distress claims, Appellees adduced substantial evidence of the mental anguish and post-traumatic stress suffered by Joyce and Lindsay Schmidt and Lauren Jeffress.</p>

    <p id="b393-9" data-blocks='[["BL_393.7",393,[211,1259,1152,812]]]'>Additionally, Appellant stressed the substantial differences between pumper fire engines and the smaller rescue vehicles that Sinor had manufactured, which did not serve a fire suppression function. In response to the contention that the woods trucks were in the same product line as Boardman fire engines, Appellant demonstrated that the two trucks Sinor manufactured were based on a Ford pickup truck platform, equipped with a removable skid unit equipped with a bladder designed to hold a modest amount of water. Appellant did not deny the emotional distress suffered by family-member witnesses to the accident but sought to mitigate the damages. Further, Appellant set out its case of negligence against CVFD, asserting that the accident could not have happened had the hoses been packed into the cross-lay compartment properly.</p>

Fourth, it is the sale of the assets to the successor which causes the predecessor to dissolve and go out of business, thereby effectively eliminating any remedy the plaintiff may have against the original product maker.

This Court held that the plaintiff had the right to recover damages for his physical injury (the heart attack), even though he was not “impacted” by the defendant’s vehicle, since this injury resulted from the plaintiffs fear of impact (mental anguish). <em>See id. </em>at 413, <a href="/citations/?q=261%20A.2d%2084" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="261 A.2d 84">261 A.2d at 90</a> (adopting the “zone of danger” rule, which affords a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress “where the plaintiff was in personal danger of physical impact because of the direction of a negligent force against him and where plaintiff actually did fear the physical impact.”). In reaching this conclusion, this Court explained that the three basic arguments for perpetuating the impact rule — “medical science’s difficulty in proving causation between the claimed damages and the alleged fright,” “the fear of fraudulent or exaggerated claims,” and “the concern that ... a [zone of danger] rule will precipitate a veritable flood of litigation” — were outdated and flawed. <em>Id. </em>at 404-12, <a href="/citations/?q=261%20A.2d%2084" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="261 A.2d 84">261 A.2d at 85-90</a>.</p>

By way of further background, the risk-balancing approach became integrated into our jurisprudence as products litigation evolved from the "prototype” cases involving manufacturing defects to design and warning cases, because the application of strict liability proved to be far more problematic in the latter category of cases. Design and warning cases presented a particular problem under the then-existing approach, because, given the tort system's largely open-ended damages scheme, and the impossibility of designing products incapable of contributing to human injury, there was a risk of creating an absolute liability regime. <em>See, e.g., Prentis v. Yale Mfg.

According to Professor George L. Priest of Yale University Law School, the result of the expanded tort liability has been to "shift insurance delivery to a third-party mechanism.” He views such a system as inefficient. It provides insurance in excess of consumer demand, and the administrative burden is approximately 2.75 to 5.75 times greater than a first-party delivery system.</blockquote>

Contrary to the OISR’s holding herein, Section 402A does not require a “physical impact” for recovery for injuries sustained from a defective product. Rather, the Restatement merely requires that one be “physically harmed.” Indeed, the OISR notes that “[pjhysical impact and physical injury are not synonymous terms....” OISR Slip Op. at 41. In common usage, “to injure” relates specifically to the harm done to another: “to cause physical harm; to hurt.” The American Heritage College Dictionary 714 (4th ed.). “To impact” someone or something, however, does not require harm; rather, it is “the striking of one body against another; collision.” <em>Id. </em>694. Further, Section 7 of the Restatement, which contains definitions of terms to be used throughout the Restatement, defines “physical harm” as “physical impairment of the human body.... Where the harm is impairment of the body, it is called ‘bodily harm,’ as to which see § 15.” Restatement (Second) Torts § 7 cmt. e. Section 15 then defines “bodily harm” as “any physical impairment of the condition of another’s body, or physical pain or illness.” Restatement (Second) Torts § 15. Critically, comment b to Section 15 states that disturbances to nerve centers caused by fear or shock do not constitute bodily harm, but such fear and shock may “result in some appreciable illness or have some other effect upon the physical condition of the body which constitutes bodily harm.” Restatement (Second) Torts § 15 cmt. b. Conspicuously absent from these definitional sections is any reference to the term “impact.” Thus, Section 402A, by its plain language, and in accord with its accompanying sections and expansive commentary, does not require, or even infer, that one must be “physically impacted” by a defective product in order for a plaintiff to recover damages. Instead, the Restatement merely requires “physical harm,” or, alternatively stated, “bodily harm” or “physical impairment.” All these terms, used inter<a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>changeably in the Restatement (Second) of Torts and this Court’s jurisprudence, are functionally identical and distinct from “physical impact.”</p>

The plaintiff narrowly escaped being impacted by a collapsing crane, but witnessed his co-worker being crushed to death. Although the plaintiff did not suffer any immediate physical injuries, he did suffer severe mental anguish and emotional distress, which, the court found, resulted in the plaintiff suffering severe headaches, weakness under stress, insomnia, recurring nightmares, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The Third Circuit reasoned that Section 402A’s “physical harm” requirement encompassed harm resulting from emotional distress because Section 7 of the Second Restatement defined physical harm as “the physical impairment of the human body” and did not impose any restrictions on the source of that harm. The court noted that Section 7 provided a definition of physical harm that is to be used consistently throughout the entire Restatement. Additionally, the court reasoned that, based on Section 7, in conjunction with Section 436, which discusses physical harm resulting from emotional distress, the authors of the Restatement believed that emotional distress could cause physical harm. <em><a href="/f2d/758/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="254" data-cite="758 F.2d 73" data-case-ids="311842" data-case-paths="/f2d/758/0073-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f2d/758/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="254" data-cite="758 F.2d 73" data-case-ids="311842" data-case-paths="/f2d/758/0073-01">at 77</a>.

More specifically, the bystander plaintiffs must still plead and prove that the defendant sold a product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer. To that end, while Section 402A lists “users and consumers” of the defective product as the members of society to whom recovery of damages is available, this Court has implicitly permitted persons who are physically harmed by a defective product, yet not the ultimate user or consumer, to recover under Section 402A. The factual circumstances of this case provide such an example — Erin Schmidt and Joeylynne Jeffress, the two young girls actually struck by the fire hose, did not use or consume the defectively designed product.

In recognizing the “inherent humanitarianism of our judicial process,” as well as the ridiculousness of affording liability based solely on spatial fortuity, this Court in <em>Niederman v. </em>Brodsky, <a href="/pa/436/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="266" data-cite="436 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1926120" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0401-01">436 Pa. 401</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=261%20A.2d%2084" class="citation" data-index="267" data-cite="261 A.2d 84">261 A.2d 84</a>, 85 (1970), deviated from the “impact rule” to allow persons within the “zone of danger” to recover for emotional distress. For arguably the same reasons, a second deviation occurred, when we further permitted bystanders to an incident recover for emotional damages, so long as said bystander was (1) located near the scene of the accident; (2) the emotional distress resulted from a contemporaneous and sensory observation of the accident; and (3) the plaintiff was closely related to the ultimate victim of the accident. <em>Sinn v. Burd, </em><a href="/pa/486/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="268" data-cite="486 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="1757610" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0146-01">486 Pa. 146</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="269" data-cite="486 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="1757610" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0146-01">404 A.2d 672</a> (1979).</p>

Indeed, in <em>Pasquale, supra </em>p. 955, the Illinois Supreme Court recognized that, while the plaintiff therein ultimately was not entitled to damages because his emotional distress did not manifest physically (and, thus, he was not physically harmed <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>pursuant to Section 402A), he both was within the zone of danger of a defective product, and contemporaneously witnessed the death of his wife from that defective product. Had the plaintiff in that case suffered physical harm, he unquestionably would have been entitled to damages.</p>

First, as a direct answer to the question as posed in our grant of allocatur, the record contains unrebutted and irrefutable evidence that Appellees each have physical manifestations of emotional trauma, which resulted from witnessing the incident underlying this appeal, such that they suffered “physical harm” or “physical injury” as contemplated by Section 402A. Indeed, Appellees began to suffer emotional strain and distress almost immediately after the incident. Within weeks, each was under the care of various social workers and psychiatrists. During this time, Lindsay Schmidt could not sleep or eat, suffered from panic attacks at the mere sound of a siren, and became clinically depressed. Ms. Sandra Faulkner, Lindsay’s clinical social worker, diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b440-5" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[246,1540,1149,479]]]'>Mother Joyce Schmidt suffered from an even more severe case of PTSD. She was clinically depressed, no longer possessed energy or emotion, and also suffered from panic attacks and hysteria associated with sensory observation of a fire engine or emergency siren. Moreover, as of July of 2006 (almost two years after the accident), both Lindsay and Joyce continued to suffer from the effects of chronic PTSD. Lauren Jeffress similarly endured chronic effects of PTSD, including sleeplessness and severe anxiety.</p>

      <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>Second, consistent with <em>Pegg </em>and <em>Zem, </em>while not “users and consumers,” Appellees are afforded the protections of Section 402A as persons injured by “the product after ... its manufacturer has released it” into the stream of commerce. <em>Pegg, </em><a href="/citations/?q=391%20A.2d%201074" class="citation" data-index="270" data-cite="391 A.2d 1074">391 A.2d at 1079</a>. Finally, Appellees sought emotional harm damages under the three-part rule established in <em>Sinn, supra </em>pp. 957-58. They easily satisfy those three requirements to fall within the narrow avenue of available recovery: they were each located within feet of the incident when it occurred; they contemporaneously witnessed the fire hose strike Erin Schmidt and Joeylynne Jeffress, resulting in emotional distress; and each were sufficiently related to the injured victim. Thus, they are excepted from the general prohibition against emotional damages.</p>

As made clear by the above construct, Appellees were required to plead and prove, and any recovery should have been limited to, physical harm suffered as mandated by Section 402A. The jury in this case, however, was not instructed concerning this requirement or that the verdict should be only for that physical harm endured. Rather, the trial court instructed the jury merely upon the three <em>Sinn </em>factors, and additionally that it should order compensation for the “mental pain, anguish, suffering, and distress, if any, which [Appellees have] endured since [the incident].”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> Notes <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>of Testimony, Sept. 14, 2006, at 1266-67. The jury simply was not charged with the more objective task of “putting a number” on the amount and severity of physical harm arising as a consequence of the emotional injury. Accordingly, I would vacate the verdicts in favor of Appellees Joyce Schmidt, Lindsay Schmidt, and Lauren Jeffress, but would further remand for a new trial consistent with the construct developed herein.</p>
