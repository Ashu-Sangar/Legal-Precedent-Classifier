On January 12, 2000, the PCRA court appointed Lee Mandell, Esq., as counsel for appellant, but appellant soon requested permission to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Appellant filed <em>pro se </em>supplemental PCRA petitions on June 20, 2000 and November 3, 2000. In early 2001, the PCRA court ordered a mental health evaluation, which was conducted on February 23, 2001. The evaluation resulted in a report that appellant had no mental health issues or substance abuse issues at the time, understood the “proper roles” and “major principles involved in a court of law,” and was competent to assist in his own defense. Mental Health Evaluation Report of James G. Jones, M.D., 2/26/01, at 2 (unnumbered). The PCRA court also conducted an extensive colloquy with appellant on the record before granting his request to proceed <em>pro se </em>on March 23, 2001. The Court appointed Attorney Mandell as advisory counsel. Thereafter, appellant filed an additional <em>pro se </em>supplemental PCRA petition on September 19, 2001; the Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss on April 19, 2002; and appellant filed yet another supplemental <em>pro se </em>petition on May 30, 2002. The court sent appellant a notice of intention to dismiss pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907 on August 14, 2002. However, on September 13, 2002, the PCRA court found appellant incompetent to proceed <em>pro se, </em>based upon its further review of his submissions, and noted that appellant and Attorney Mandell had irreconcilable differences. The court thus allowed Attorney Mandell to withdraw and Daniel A. Rendine, Esq., was appointed as counsel for appellant on September 20, 2002. In November 2002, however, the PCRA court again permitted appellant to represent himself and directed Attorney Rendine to serve as back-up counsel. The court then held an evidentiary hearing on April 28, 2003 and, on June 27, 2003, denied PCRA relief and formally dismissed Attorney Rendine from the case.</p>

The Federal Defender responded that in its view, appellant was not competent to waive counsel and that it had a written report from a doctor who did not believe appellant was competent. The Federal Defender sought to have a competency proceeding held prior to the <em>Grazier </em>hearing. The PCRA court took note of the “stalemate” created when appellant’s refusal to cooperate with the Federal Defender respecting his competency led the Federal Defender to conclude that appellant was incompetent. The court stated that the matter could not be delayed any further, denied the request for a <em>pre-Grazier </em>competency hearing, and scheduled the <em>Grazier </em>hearing for April 27, 2007. The Federal Defender’s appeal of that interlocutory ruling was quashed by this Court in an August 24, 2007 order.</p>

The PCRA court noted that its determination that appellant’s waiver of counsel was knowing and voluntary was supported by the court-ordered mental health evaluation, the <em>Grazier </em>colloquy, and appellant’s behavior at the <em>Grazier </em>hearing as well as at several previous hearings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Federal Defender’s unauthorized appeal from the grant of relief appellant himself had requested through the <em>Grazier </em>proceedings was ultimately quashed by order of this Court dated October 31, 2007.</p>

Appellant’s birth name was Emanuel Lester but, he argues, “Ali” is now his legal surname, which he has been using since 1975, and had legally changed in 1983, eight years before the murder of Sheila Manigault. Appellant contends that the prosecutor knew or should have known that “Ali” was his new surname and that the prosecutor’s description of it as an alias created an unfair and prejudicial impression of appellant’s evasiveness and consciousness of guilt and thereby deprived him of a fair trial under the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. Appellant adds that the Commonwealth failed to disclose to the defense that it would be introducing evidence of appellant’s use of different names on various documents and that this non-disclosure prejudiced him by preventing him from rebutting the Commonwealth’s misrepresentation of the evidence and addressing the eventual jury instruction on flight/evasion. Appellant contends that if the jury had been made aware that at the time of his arrest, the <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>name he gave was his then-legal name (Imanuel Ali) and that he possessed documents identifying him by that name, there is a strong possibility that it would have concluded that he displayed no consciousness of guilt.</p>

Appellant contends that trial counsel should have objected to Mr. Mujica’s opinion that the substance was blood, which permitted the prosecutor to refer to the blood-smeared toy kitchen set in what appellant alleges was a “misrepresented” characterization of the events surrounding the murder as an “urban horror story.” That characterization, appellant argues, misled and inflamed the jury.

Furthermore, in the Commonwealth’s estimation, the mere fact that “one of the many places in which blood was found [at the scene] was on a child’s toy is a minor point; its exclusion would not have likely changed the trial result.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 17-18 n. 14.

The PCRA court also concluded that the trial court’s competency finding did not bolster N.M.’s credibility, particularly because the trial court said nothing to influence the jury’s consideration of her veracity. In the PCRA court’s estimation, the competency examination was conducted in accordance with governing legal requirements: both counsel questioned N.M. concerning her duty to tell the truth and her answers to those questions showed that she “possessed the requisite degree of awareness and ability to recall past events and ability to recount them accurately to be declared competent.” The PCRA court did not separately address appellant’s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a special instruction concerning the distinction between competence and credibility.

In addition to the fact that trial counsel could rely on these instructions to dispel any possible spillover of prejudice from the in-court competency examination of N.M., the instructions square well with the modest nature of the court’s finding on competency which, again, spoke in terms of N.M.’s capacity and obligation, and not her credibility.</p>

Madeline Dickerson, the victim’s neighbor, testified that the morning after the murder, N.M. came to her door and told her that “Manny” had hit her mother in the head with an iron and put her in the bathtub; N.M. also described to Ms. Dickerson all the blood at the scene. The emergency room doctor who treated the injuries appellant inflicted on N.M. testified from her own notes that N.M. told her: “Manny took me and put me on the bed. He hit mommy.

The Commonwealth submits that appellant’s claim is really an improper back-door challenge to N.M.’s credibility and is not within the ambit of <em>Kloiber, </em>which focuses on the circumstances of the out-of-court event and the actual physical ability of the witness to see and identify a defendant. The Commonwealth posits that N.M. plainly had an opportunity to view appellant, whom she knew well, during the length of the altercation, both when appellant was attacking her mother and when he was attacking her. The Commonwealth maintains that, even if the entirety of the assault was not in N.M.’s direct line of vision at every moment, the fact remains that she was close enough to see and identify appellant clearly during crucial moments in the ordeal. The Commonwealth adds that any uncertainty in N.M.’s testimony did not involve the identity of the attacker, but was limited to certain aspects of the ordeal. But, at no point, the Commonwealth emphasizes, was N.M. equivocal in her unfailing, repeated identification of appellant, whom she knew, as her mother’s killer: to her neighbor, to the police, to her treating doctor, from a photographic array, at the preliminary hearing, and at trial. As there was no basis for a <em>Kloiber </em>instruction, the Commonwealth asserts, appellant cannot prove his layered claim of counsel ineffectiveness. -</p>

In short, the Commonwealth asserts that here, it presented a live witness at appellant’s trial — the supervising medical examiner of the autopsy — who had observed the procedure, drawn his own conclusions as to the victim’s cause of death, and was subject to cross-examination by the defense. Furthermore, the Commonwealth contends, appellant has not established: that Dr. Heilman would have testified differently; that Dr. Hood’s testimony was in error; or even that a different cause of death was possible, given that the victim was found in a bloody bathtub with fluid in her lungs and pulmonary edema. The Commonwealth adds that since appellant’s trial counsel did in fact object to Dr. Hood’s testimony, his ineffectiveness on this point cannot be established; nor, similarly and derivatively, can direct appeal counsel be found ineffective.</p>

The Commonwealth notes also that the verdict slip properly listed “not guilty” as a possible verdict for both the first-degree and third-degree murder charges and that appellant has not shown that the jury was mistaken or confused in its completion of the verdict slip. The Commonwealth argues that <em>Edwards </em>is inapplicable because the trial judge there omitted “not guilty” from the list of possible verdicts, which was not so here. The Commonwealth adds that appellant confuses the nature of the discussion between the prosecutor and the trial court regarding the verdict slip. In actuality, the Commonwealth explains, the prosecutor had merely expressed concern, ultimately unfounded, that the layout of the jury verdict slip might lead the jury to believe that it could return convictions of both first-degree murder and third-degree murder, not just one or the other. Concerning appellant’s claims as to the court crier, the Commonwealth distinguishes <em>Parker </em>as having presented obviously improper conduct by the bailiff, who told several jurors that the defendant was “wicked” and “guilty” and that “[i]f there is anything wrong (in finding petitioner guilty) the Supreme Court will correct it.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 34 (citing <em>Parker, </em><a href="/us/385/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="385 U.S. 363" data-case-ids="11337414" data-case-paths="/us/385/0363-01">385 U.S. at 363-64</a>, <a href="/us/385/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="385 U.S. 363" data-case-ids="11337414" data-case-paths="/us/385/0363-01">87 S.Ct. 468</a>).

The verdict slip here, as drafted and as executed by the jury, was consistent with the trial court’s charge and instructions to the jury. Thus, contrary to appellant’s assertions, the verdict slip made clear that a “not guilty” verdict was available as to each of the charges. Although offering the jury a global “not guilty” option is possible, nothing in the law requires that sort of redundancy on the verdict slip, and counsel could trust in the court’s charge as well as the fact that the slip made clear that individual not guilty verdicts were available. Furthermore, it is difficult to discern any prejudice arising from the lack of a global “not guilty” option on the verdict slip.

Edwards admitted shooting his friend’s abusive father (who survived the shooting), but claimed insanity. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find Edwards guilty of first-degree murder with the death penalty, first-degree murder with life imprisonment, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, or not guilty because of insanity. However, the jury instruction did not present the option of a simple not guilty verdict. This Court reversed and ordered a new trial, concluding that even though Edwards had admitted the shooting, he was still entitled to the presumption of innocence and it was for the jury to decide whether he had a justification or excuse for the shooting such that outright acquittal was appropriate. <em>Edwards </em>reaffirms the importance of accuracy in the court’s charge.</p>

A court crier’s responsibilities are properly limited to logistics and purely ministerial functions, such as escorting the jury in and out of the courtroom. Instructions on the law, and the deliberative process, should come from the court alone, and should be on the record. The verdict slip falls in a gray area. As noted, the slip is intended merely to record the result of the jury’s substantive deliberation.

Our review of the court’s charge to the jury here reveals no discussion of the verdict slip. <em>See </em>N.T., 11/12/91, at 42-62.

If the court crier meant to convey that he had informed the jury that it was to render a verdict on only one of the murder “options” on the verdict slip, that advice would be accurate only for purposes of recording a murder conviction; an acquittal on both murder charges would require the jury to pass upon both charges, and the slip should be executed to reflect verdicts on both charges. But, the court crier’s account was posed in response to the trial court noting the prosecutor’s concern that it would be simpler if the jury were told that it could render one of three possible verdicts on the murder charges (ie., guilty of first-degree murder, guilty of third-degree murder, or not guilty of either). Notably, the court crier began his response by saying, “[t]he jurors know that,” and then recounting that he had informed the jurors that they could only choose first-degree or third-degree murder, which, presumably, was the court crier’s way of addressing the conviction scenario.</p>

But, given the context of the exchange we have set forth above, it is not clear that that is what the crier conveyed to the jury; it is just as likely that all he conveyed was that any recorded guilty verdict for murder had to be limited to first-degree or third-degree murder, and not both. More importantly, appellant’s suggestion of juror confusion during deliberation over the availability of a “not guilty” verdict on both murder charges conflates the verdict slip with the court’s charge. As noted above, the verdict slip exists merely to record the jury’s conclusion after it has deliberated. The verdict slip does not frame deliberations; the court’s charge does. Nothing in the truncated explanation of the court crier, or in appellant’s proffer, suggests that the court crier’s communication with the jury, concerning the mere logistics of recording the verdict on the slip, affected the court’s charge or the actual deliberative process of the jury.</p>

There has been no showing of actual prejudice arising from the trial court’s admittedly unfortunate practice of permitting the court crier to explain the logistics of executing the verdict slip.

The Commonwealth posits that the only potentially applicable hearsay exception would be Rule 804(b)(3), “statement against interest,” in which case the police detectives’ testimony might be admissible to corroborate the statement’s trustworthiness.

This is so because the evidence would not conclusively exclude appellant as the murderer since, according to Dr. Hood’s testimony, the killing occurred between 4:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., and perhaps even as early as midnight. That time frame left sufficient time for appellant to both commit the murder and appear at El’s residence afterwards. The Commonwealth also notes that several aspects of El’s statement would have been harmful to appellant even if the statement was admitted, including: El’s assertion that it was unusual for appellant to appear at his home in the early morning; that appellant’s appearing at that time gave El a feeling “that something had happened”; and El’s description of suspicious conduct on appellant’s part, including that when El told appellant that the police were looking for him, appellant did not inquire as to a reason, but simply left El’s apartment; and that appellant “disappeared” <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>and had no contact with El after the attack on the victim became known.

Nevertheless, because appellant’s claim of direct appeal counsel ineffectiveness for failing to "federalize” appellant’s claims is easily resolvable on the record and the briefs, we will decide it.</p>

In a footnote, appellant indicates that he undertook to identify additional insufficiently federalized claims in an "addendum” that he provided to "the courts.” This "addendum,” which was attached to appellant’s <em>pro se </em>supplemental PCRA petition of June 20, 2000, set forth twenty allegations of trial court error and ineffective assistance of counsel. In each such allegation, appellant claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection violations and cited various purportedly supportive cases. Appellant has not, however, attended to any of these twenty claims with specificity in his brief to this Court. As such, these claims warrant no further review. <em>Commonwealth v.
