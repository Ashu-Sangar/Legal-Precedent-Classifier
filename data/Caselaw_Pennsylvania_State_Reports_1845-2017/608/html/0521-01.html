Article 33, Section 21 of the CBA provided employees with legal representation and indemnification for civil judgments in various types of proceedings brought against them. It provided that the Commonwealth, as employer, must supply liability coverage and a legal defense in civil suits as detailed in, <em>inter alia, </em>Chapter 39 of Title 4 of the Pennsylvania Administrative Code. <em>See </em>4 Pa.Code §§ 39.1-39.6 (pertaining to the defense of actions against Commonwealth employees). Pursuant to Chapter 39, the Commonwealth provides employees with counsel in civil cases where the conduct is alleged to have been unintentional. If the conduct is alleged to have been malicious or intentional, the General Counsel retains the discretion to determine whether the employee is to be provided with a defense and indemnification. Under the CBA, the Commonwealth was also authorized to provide an employee with counsel in criminal cases, and if it did not do so, it would be obligated to advance reasonable attorney fees. In the event of a conviction, the fees would be recouped from the employee’s retirement account. With an acquittal, the Commonwealth was responsible for all reasonable attorney fees.

It submitted evidence regarding the lack of reimbursement where certain criminal matters had been dismissed, and referenced two instances where an employee was not reimbursed for civil actions that were settled or dismissed. The Union thus proposed changes to Article 33, Section 21, to require the Commonwealth to provide legal representation for all civil and criminal cases, regardless of whether the underlying conduct was alleged to have been malicious or negligent. The Commonwealth opposed the Union’s proposal and offered testimony from the DOC’s Chief Counsel that it contradicted the regulations promulgated by the Executive Board of the Commonwealth (the “Executive Board”), which prohibit Commonwealth attorneys from representing employees in criminal matters. <em>See </em>4 Pa.Code § 39.1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The Chief Counsel ex<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>plained that this prohibition seeks to avoid a conflict of interest and that it was rare that a Commonwealth employee was not reimbursed for legal expenses.

The Union first urges that the regulations in question simply reflect the manner in which the Office of General Counsel has elected to exercise its discretion going forward and, as such, they amount to mere policy statements lacking the force of law. Moreover, even if the regulations are deemed to contain binding norms, and thus to constitute substantive regulations, the Union proffers that Paragraph 18 is valid nonetheless because it does not require the Commonwealth to perform any act that it could not already have done voluntarily through the exercise of its discretion. The Commonwealth responds that Chapter 39 of Title 4 of the Pennsylvania Code has the force and effect of law because it contains reasonable regulations that were properly promulgated pursuant to the Commonwealth Attorneys Act and the Regulatory Review Act. The Commonwealth continues that Paragraph 18 is contrary to law because it divests the Office of General Counsel of the discretion that it is required to exercise under Chapter 39 in relation to civil matters, and, further, requires the Commonwealth to provide representation and/or attorneys’ fees in criminal matters. In this latter regard, the Commonwealth emphasizes that Chapter 39 prohibits Commonwealth attorneys from representing employees in criminal matters, as to do so would constitute a conflict of interest.

We do not consider this to be an adequate basis on which to void subsection (a). First, the Commonwealth’s objection predicated upon a possible conflict of interest cannot rest solely on the furnishing of legal fees, because its own regulations already permit fees to be advanced and/or reimbursed in criminal cases under some circumstances. <em>See 4 </em>Pa.Code § 39.1. To the degree the Commonwealth echoes the Commonwealth Court’s assertion that paying legal fees and consulting on the selection of an attorney “is tantamount to providing an attorney,” <em>Pa.

    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[243,454,1149,1762]]]'>As noted, Paragraph 18(a) states, quite simply, that the Commonwealth must pay an employee’s reasonable attorney’s fees in any criminal action arising from the performance of the employee’s duties. Section 39.1(a) addresses criminal cases that the Office of General Counsel deems frivolous, and requires reimbursement of all such fees, as well as advancement of the same limited only by the balance in the employee’s retirement account. This provision is mandatory in the sense that it does not give the employer any discretion to decide whether or not to either advance or, ultimately, reimburse, the employee for reasonable counsel fees: the employer must advance fees up to the employee’s retirement account balance, and may not advance fees beyond that amount; the employer also must reimburse the employee after-the-fact for any fees incurred that were not previously advanced. In light of these mandatory provisions, Paragraph 18(a) cannot be given effect to alter this scheme. Section 39.1(b), however, which addresses non-frivolous criminal cases, is of a somewhat different nature. While it does not authorize the General Counsel to pay attorney’s fees as they become due, it does give her the discretion to reimburse those fees in the event that the employee’s defense is ultimately successful. Hence, although Paragraph 18(a) cannot require contemporaneous payment of fees in these circumstances (as this is not authorized or permitted by the regulations), it can, in accordance with the analysis provided above, be implemented to require reimbursement of such fees where reimbursement would be permitted under Section 39.1(b) pursuant to an exercise of the employer’s discretion — that is, where the employee’s defense is successful. Of course, if the employee’s defense is unsuccessful, Section 39.1(b) does not allow for payment or reimbursement of fees and, thus, Paragraph 18(a) cannot be given effect to require the same.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a>

The Chapter 39 regulations, which the majority here determines limit the authority of the arbitration panel, are not compelled by any statute. These regulations are purely the product of the executive arm of the Commonwealth. Accordingly, that executive arm can voluntarily comply with Paragraph 18 by simply altering its regulations, which it may freely do without fear of <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>violating any act of the legislature. Otherwise, the Commonwealth here simply hides behind its own self-imposed limitations. I thus strongly disagree with the majority that the arbitration award in this case compels the Commonwealth to perform an illegal act.

The matters addressed in Paragraph 18 of the award are bargainable terms and conditions of employment. The award is final and binding pursuant to Section 805 of PERA. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court’s invalidation of Paragraph 18 is not in accordance with Section 805.

Section 702 of PERA, 43 P.S. § 1101.702, does provide that items of inherent managerial policy are not bargainable. However, the provision applicable in this case— Section 805 of PERA, which applies to unique populations of public employees that are closely akin to Act 111 employees — relevantly provides that "[njotwithstanding any other provision of this act ... [the decision of] the panel of arbitrators ... shall be final and binding....” 43 P.S. § 1101.805 (emphasis added). Section 805 thus eschews Section 702, and I take this circumstance as further evidence that <em>City of Philadelphia </em>and <em>Borough of Ellwood City, </em>albeit both Act 111 cases, came to erroneous conclusions on the issue of the primacy of managerial prerogatives or responsibilities.</p>

Finally, I must respectfully disassociate myself from the majority’s observation, in the last sentence of Section IV, that the majority's invalidation of the significant part of Paragraph 18 of the award is "not untoward.” Op. at 552-53, 12 A.3d at 365. The overarching question here is whether any court, including this one, may review the final and binding arbitration award in the first instance. Any judicial review is permissible only under the highly circumscribed narrow <em>certiorari </em>scope of review. That scope of review is confined to four selectively narrow considerations. Whether a judicial correction of an arbitration award is "untoward” or “not untoward” is not one of them.</p>
