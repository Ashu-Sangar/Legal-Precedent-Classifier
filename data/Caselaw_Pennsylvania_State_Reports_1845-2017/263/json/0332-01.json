A person may be convicted for \u00e1 violation of tbe Act of May 13, 1909, P. L. 520, in selling an article of food and an article used for and entering into the composition of, and intended for use, as an ingredient in tbe preparation of food, described as a canning compound, wbicb was adulterated in tbat it contained a proportion of boric acid. In sucb a case it is immaterial that tbe compound contained 95 per cent, of boric acid and only five per cent, of salt. Such a compound is an article \u201centering into tbe composition of, or intended for use as, an ingredient in tbe preparation of food for man,\u201d and is adulterated within the meaning of tbe act.\nConstitutional law \u2014 Title of act \u2014 Act of May IS, 1909, P. L. 620.\n2. Tbe Act of May 13, 1909, P. L. 520, entitled \u201cAn Act relating to food,\u201d etc., is sufficient in its title to give notice of its contents, and is constitutional.\nArgued Oct. 22, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 161, Jan. T., 1919, by defendant, from judgment of Superior Court, Oct. T., 1918, No. 13, reversing judgment of Quarter Sessions of Bedford Co., April Sessions, 1917, No. 24, sustaining motion in arrest of judgment in case of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. J. R.

L. 520.\nVerdict of guilty. The trial court sustained defendant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment.\nOn appeal by the Commonwealth, the Superior Court, in an opinion by Henderson, J., reversed the judgment of the trial court. The opinion of the Superior Court, reported in 70 Pa. Superior Ct. 95, is as follows:\nThe defendant was indicted for a violation of the Act of May 13, 1909, P. L. 520, in selling an article of food and an article used for, and entering into the composition of, and intended for use as, an ingredient in the preparation of food, described as \u201cMrs. Price\u2019s Canning Compound,\u201d which was adulterated in that it contained a proportion of boric acid. A verdict of guilty was returned by the jury and afterward judgment was arrested by the court and from that order the Commonwealth appeals. The title of the act is in part: \u201cAn Act relating to food; defining food, providing for the protection of the public health, and the prevention of fraud and deception, by prohibiting the manufacture or sale, the offering for sale or the having in possession with intent to sell, of adulterated, misbranded, or deleterious foods.\u201d The second sectipn contains a definition of the word \u201cfood\u201d as follows:/\u201cThe term Tood\u2019 as used in this act shall include not only every article used as food by man but also every article used for or entering into the composition of or intended for use as an ingredient in the preparation of food for man.\u201d / Prohibition against the use of boric acid is contained in section 3 which provides /\u201cthat for the purpose of this act an article of food shall be deemed to be adulterated......5th. If it contains any added boric acid or borates,\u201d/etc- The learned judge of the1 court below based the decision on a determination that the compound was not food and that it did not contain added boric acid within the meaning of the act. It was shown by the Commonwealth that the compound was composed of boracic acid and salt; 94.93% of the former and 5.07 % of the latter. The compound was sold in packages which included among other statements the following*.\n\u201cMrs. Price\u2019s Canning Compound \u201cManufactured by\n\u201cThe Price Compound Company \u201cMinneapolis, Minn.\n\u201cMay be used in canning all kinds of fruit, and is specially valuable for com, beans, peas, asparagus, tomatoes, etc.\u201d\n\u201cMay also be used in making catsup, sweet pickles or anything that is liable to ferment. It saves money, time, labor, worry and insures the best results. See our receipt book for instructions on canning and pickling.\u201d\nThe contention of the Commonwealth is that the article sold was food and that it was also used and intended to be used as an ingredient in the preparation of food for man, and was, therefore, within the prohibition of the statute. It is conceded that the salt constituent of the compound was an article of food, but the learned judge of the court below was of the opinion that in view of the small proportion of the food product and the large proportion of boric acid in the compound it ought to be assumed that the law was not intended to apply to a preparation composed almost wholly of an article which is not food; that it could not consistently be held that 95% could.be added to 5% ; that the use of the word \u201cadded\u201d in the statute \u201cin common parlance\u201d signifies \u201cto unite the lesser in essence with the greater; the smaller in volume, magnitude or importance with the larger.\u201d Pursuing this line of argument with illustrations the court reached the conclusion that the legislature never had in mind such an article of commerce as is under consideration in this case as an adulterated food. This construction, however, overlooks an important part of the statute which covers every article \u201centering into the composition of or intended for use as an ingredient in the preparation of food for man.\u201d In either case, therefore, whether the article sold may be classed as food or is merely a compound intended to be used in the composition of or as an ingredient in the preparation of food, if it contains a constituent the use of which is prohibited in food it is within the purview of the statute. We are unable to agree with the learned court that the question must be disposed of on the basis of the proportion of the compound entering into the composition of food Under such construction the purpose of the law might be defeated. A much smaller quantity of the prohibited article than that used in the canning compound might be used without violating the statute. If the proportion of 95% may be allowed, by like reasoning 80% or 70% would be permitted for the larger could not be said to be added to the smaller quantity. The smaller quantity could not \u201ccontain\u201d the larger. But it was not the intention of the legislature to determine the proportion in which food might be adulterated except in the limited use of sulphur dioxide and sodium benzoate as applied to certain articles. The United States statute contains similar language to that used in the Act of 1909 and in United States v. Forty Barrels of Coca Cola, 211 U. S. 265, the court considered the meaning of the word \u201cadded\u201d and said \u201cNor can we accept the view that the word \u2018added\u2019 should be taken as referring to the quantity of the ingredient used. It is added ingredient which the statute describes; not added quantity of ingredient.\u201d This construction is required in the light of the purpose of the legislation which was not only to prevent fraud but to provide for the protection of the public health. What is necessary to promote this object is a legislative question within constitutional limits and the court is controlled by the legislative/declaration on the subject. The combination of boric acid with common salt amounts to an adulteration within the meaning of the statute. The term \u201cadulteration\u201d is used in a particular sense. It is the combining of a forbidden substance with an article of food to be sold to the public. But the case of the Commonwealth stands on a broader base than this. The act defines \u201cfood\u201d to be not only every article used as food for man but also every article entering into the composition of or intended for use as an ingredient in the preparation of food for man. It is not contended that the canning compound was not to enter into the composition of food or not intended for use as an ingredient in the preparation of it. The contrary expressly appears. It was not only to be used in the preparation of food but was to become a constituent part thereof. It cannot be contended that when a quantity of it was added to the can or jar in the preparation of food it. did not become a part of the contents of the can or jar and of course it entered into the food preparation. The letter of the statute prohibits this. If it was within the power of the legislature, therefore, to define what should be considered food the defendant offended against the law. It is not to be questioned that the legislature in passing an act may declare its meaning and construction and such declaration is binding on the courts: Com. v. Curry, 4 Pa. Superior Ct. 356; Com. v. Kebort, 212 Pa. 289. The definition of section two of the act is sufficiently comprehensive to cover tbe case of a sale of this compound intended for use as an ingredient in the preparation of food.\nIt is contended, however, on the part of the appellee that the title of the statute is not sufficiently clear to meet the constitutional requirements. We are unable to agree with this contention. The title relates to food; to the protection of the public health by prohibiting the sale or offering for sale or having in possession with intent to sell adulterated or deleterious foods. This title we regard as sufficiently comprehensive to impose the duty of inquiry as to the contents of the statute and persons dealing in food or in an article to be used in the preparation and composition of food are put on notice of all the statute contains. We are not required to apply critical or strained construction to legislation of this character nor are we at liberty to set aside the legislative will except from imperious necessity imposed by the Constitution. We find no such necessity in this case.\nThe judgment is reversed and the record remitted to the court below with direction to impose sentence according to law.\nError assigned was the judgment of the Superior Court.\nJanuary 4, 1919:\nTrafford N. Jayne, with him John H. Jordan, for appellant.\nEven though the word \u201cfood\u201d is defined to include articles not regularly intended for, or used as, foods, such as condiments, coloring and flavoring matter, appetizers and the like, it was not intended by the legislature to include preservatives of foods when sold by \u2022 themselves separately.\nThe intent of the legislature is evident, because of the fact that it does not mention the word \u201cpreservatives\u201d anywhere in the act. If the legislature had intended to include preservatives in its definition of the word \u201cfood\u201d it would have added the words \u201cand preservation\u201d so as to read: \u201cor intended for use as an ingredient in the preparation and preservation of food for man.\u201d The very fact that those two words were left out should be almost conclusive evidence on that point: Redman\u2019s App., 173 Pa. 59; Little Beaver Twp. School Directors\u2019 Election, 165 Pa. 233; Shrewsbury Savings Institution\u2019s App., 94 Pa. 309.\nWm. M. Hargest, Deputy Attorney General, and A. H. Woodward, with them H. C. James, District Attorney, and Francis Shunk Brown, Attorney General, for appellee.\nThis compound, being advertised for use in the preparation of food, is an \u201cadulterated\u201d food, within the , meaning of the act: Commonwealth v. Pflaum, 236 Pa. 294; United States v. Forty Barrels of Coca Cola, 241 U. S. 265; Price v. Illinois, 257 111. 101.\nThe title to this act is sufficient: Commonwealth v.' Pflaum, 236 Pa. 294."
