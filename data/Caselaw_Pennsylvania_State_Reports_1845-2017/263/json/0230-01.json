    "head_matter": "Nugent, Appellant, v. Bowerton Mining Company.\nEquity \u2014 Preliminary injunction \u2014 Irreparable injury \u2014 Tunnel under public street \u2014 Abutting landowner \u2014 Pending suit for damages.\nA preliminary injunction will not be issued at the suit of a landowner to restrain a mining company from using an entry or passageway to its mines under a public street, because of failure to establish irreparable injury to the plaintiff\u2019s lands, where it appears that the company obtained permission from the township authorities to construct its entries under the surface of the street in front of the plaintiff\u2019s land; that no mining operations have been conducted or are contemplated under the streets or within the lines of the plaintiff\u2019s property; that there has been no subsidence of the surface at any point except upon lands owned by the company; and that an action at law brought by the plaintiff to'recover damages for the same injuries is pending and undetermined.\nArgued Oct. 17,1918.\nAppeal, No. 104, Oct. T., 1918, by plaintiff, from decree of O. P. Allegheny Co., July T., 1918, No. 961, refusing a preliminary injunction in case of John Nugent v. Bowerton Mining Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Frazer, Waiting, Simpson and Fox, JJ,\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for preliminary injunction to restrain use of entry or tunnel to a mine under a public street. Before Swearingen, J.\nThe lower court refused a preliminary injunction in the following opinion, filed May 24, 1918, by Swearingen, J.:\nThe plaintiff is the owner of three lots in the plan of Domestic Land Company, Scott Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, together having a frontage of about seventy-five feet on Main street and extending back westwardly about 110 feet. Main street of the plan is a public road, which is maintained by Scott Township, it being one of the first class under act approved April 28, 1899, page 108. The plaintiff\u2019s land is on a hillside \u2014 the rear of the lots being about thirty feet below the level of Main street.\nThe defendant owns, inter alia, \u00e1 large number of lots in the plan, and it is engaged in mining coal. It obtained permission from,the commissioners of Scott Township to drive its entries under the surface of the streets of the plan, and it has constructed its pit mouth at Neville street, and has driven an entry along Main street in front' of the plaintiff\u2019s land. The entry is eight feet in width and about six feet in height. At the nearest point, the entry approaches within six feet of the plaintiff\u2019s front lot line. Here, the roof of the entry, is of rock, and the thickness of the strata is about thirty-five feet. No mining operations have been conducted by the defendant under the road in question. The plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the defendant has removed coal under the streets and alleys, in which he claims to have an interest that will support the bill. No coal within the lines of the plaintiff\u2019s lots has been removed, nor is it intended to remove any. There has been no subsidence of the surface at any point within the limits of Domestic Land Company plan, except upon that portion which is owned by the defendant, and that was caused by the removal of the coal- to the edge of the crop.\nThe plaintiff brought an action at law against the defendant to recover damages for the same injuries of which complaint is made in this case, and that action is still pending and undetermined. No irreparable injury to the plaintiff\u2019s land has been shown by the evidence.\nJanuary 4, 1919:\nIn view of the foregoing, the right of the plaintiff to the extraordinary relief for which he prays is not clear. Whatever may appear upon final hearing, no case is now disclosed, which warrants a court of equity to interfere by preliminary injunction. Accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction is refused.\nError assigned was the decree of the court refusing a preliminary injunction.\nJoseph Crown, for appellant.\nJohn C. Bane, for appellee, not heard."
