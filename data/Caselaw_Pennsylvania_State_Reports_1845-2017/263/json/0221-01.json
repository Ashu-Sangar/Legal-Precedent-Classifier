    "head_matter": "Farrell v. Boggs & Buhl, Inc., Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Automobiles \u2014 Collision \u2014 Negligence of driver\u2014 Question for jury.\nThe question of negligence of defendant\u2019s chauffeur as the cause of a collision in which the plaintiff sustained injuries while a passenger in defendant\u2019s autobus, is for the jury where there is evidence that the chauffeur saw the automobile truck with which he came in contact 45 feet away, coming out of an alley across his way; that he could have stopped within a few feet, but did not slacken his speed or give any signal, and that the machine he was driving ran into the side of the truck.\nArgued Oct. 18, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 108, Oct. T., 1918, by defendant, from order of C. P. Allegheny Co., July T., 1916, No. 1669, refusing defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v. in the case of Rose T. Farrell v. Boggs & Buhl, Inc.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Fox, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAction in trespass for personal injuries sustained while a passenger in defendant\u2019s autobus as a result of collision. Before Shaper, P. J.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $3,700.\nThe court refused a motion for judgment for defendant n. o. v. in the following opinion by Shaper, P. J.:\nThe action is against the owners of a department store for injuries alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the driver of an autobus operated by them in connection with the store. The defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to make out a case in two respects: (1) that there was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury of negligence on the part of their chauffeur; and (2) that it did not sufficiently appear that the injury complained of was caused by the accident.\nAs to the negligence, the jury was instructed that under the circumstances of the case the defendant was liable for that degree of care which a carrier of passengers owes to them. The defendant contends that this instruction was erroneous. If there had been no evidence to go to the jury other than the presumption arising from the accident, which was a slight collision with another automobile, this would present a case not free from difficulty and the instruction might possibly have been ground for a new trial, which is not moved for. The only question under the present motion is whether there was evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant was negligent. As to this, there was evidence from which the jury might well infer negligence. There was evidence that defendant\u2019s chauffeur saw the other automobile with which he came in contact, forty-five feet away, coining out of an alley across his way, and that he could have stopped within a few feet but did not slacken his speed or give any signal and that the autobus ran into the side of the other automobile.\nAs to the injury complained of having been caused by the accident, the case is one which could not have been taken from the jury, although in our opinion the verdict was greatly against the weight of the evidence and a new trial would probably have been granted if asked for.\nBeing of opinion, therefore, that the case was one in which the evidence was such as required its submission to the jury, the motion is refused.\nIt is ordered that judgment be entered on the verdict, upon payment of the verdict fee.\nDefendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were refusing defendant\u2019s point for . binding instructions and refusing defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v. '\nW. A. Griffith, with him John J. Kennedy, B. J.Jarrett, for appellant.\nThe case in hand we think belongs to the sudden emergency class of cases, and should be ruled under the law as laid down in the following cases: Downey v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 219 Pa. 592; Sekerak v. Jutte, 153 Pa. 117; Eastburn v. U. S. Express Co., 225 Pa. 33; McKee v. Harrisburg Traction Co., 211 Pa. 47.\nEach had the right to assume the other would use due care: Bell v. Jacobs, 261 Pa. 204.\nIn order to maintain the verdict the plaintiffs are bound to point to evidence which would justify men of ordinary reason and fairness in saying that the defendant\u2019s driver, if he had exercised ordinary care, could have avoided this accident: Eastburn v. U. S. Express Co., 225 Pa. 33.\nH. Fred Mercer, for appellee.\nA storage and transfer company which hauled and stored furniture in its storagehou.se was held- to be a common carrier: Lloyd v. Haugh, 223 Pa. 148, pp. 153-155.\nJanuary 4, 1919:\n- # The operator of taxicabs is held to be a common car: rier: Donnelly v. Philadelphia &. Reading Ry. Co., 53 Pa. Superior Ct. 78.\nAn automobile company which rents automobiles by the hour is a common carrier: Neumiller v. The Acme Motor Car Co., 49 Pa. Superior Ct. 183.\nThe rule of respondeat superior applies: Wallace v. Keystone Automobile Co., 239 Pa. 110.\nThe case was for the jury: Anderson v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 251 Pa. 517; Rauch v. Smedley, 208 Pa. 175."
