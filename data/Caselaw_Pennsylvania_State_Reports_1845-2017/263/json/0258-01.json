McKown and Lennie J. McKown, his wife, of Los Angeles, California, (John W. McKown being a nephew of my deceased husband) and I direct that no account shall be taken by my executor, of any money received by me from the estate of my deceased husband and expended or disposed of by me during my lifetime.\u201d On July 1, 1916, the testatrix gave an option to a lessee of a part of her real estate to purchase the same at any time prior to June 1, 1917. The offer was accepted some time during that month, nearly five months after the death of the testatrix, and the executors subsequently received the purchase money. The appellants claim it under the above quoted tenth clause of the will of the testatrix. Tbe proceeds of tbe sale claimed by them were not money in tbe possession or subject to tbe order and control of tbe testatrix at tbe time of ber death, and could not have been so, if sbe bad lived, until tbe acceptance of tbe option, and, under ber clearly expressed intention as to just wbat tbe appellants were to receive from ber estate, tbe learned court below properly dismissed tbeir claim.\nAppeal' dismissed at appellants\u2019 costs.",

T., 1918, by John W. McKown and Lennie J. McKown, from decree of O. O.

J., Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Fox, JJ.\nAppeal dismissed.\nExceptions to a decree of auditing judge making distribution of funds. Before Trimble, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that the question involved was whether part of the testatrix\u2019s estate representing proceeds of sale of real estate optioned by testatrix during her life and received by the executor after her decease should be distributed as money under the terms of the will.\nThe terms of the will appear in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nJanuary 4, 1919:\nGeorge W. Herriott, for appellants.\nA contract of sale works a conversion which takes place at the time the contract of sale is executed. The acceptance of an option relates back and takes effect as of the date of the contract: Kerr v. Day, 14 Pa. 112; Bender et al. v. Luckenbach, 162 Pa. 18; Peoples St. By. Co. v. Spencer, 156 Pa. 85; White\u2019s Estate, 167 Pa. 206.\nProceeds of sale were money within the meaning of the tenth clause of the will.\nEvery word or phrase in the will should be given some force and effect: Schott\u2019s Est., 78 Pa. 40; Wood v. Schoen, 216 Pa. 425.\nFred Shoemaker, of Shoemaker & Knoell, with him A. E. Kountz, Robert F. Malone, and J. T.
