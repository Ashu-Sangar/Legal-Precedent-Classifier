Lakoff.\nNegligence \u2014 Infant\u2014Collision between child and horse \u2014 City street \u2014 Stepping in front of horse \u2014 Nonsuit.\nA nonsuit is properly entered in an action for personal injuries sustained by an eight-year-old boy run over by a horse in a street where it appears that the boy stepped off the sidewalk when the horse\u2019s head was but three feet away, as it was proceeding on a trot, and that the horse was stopped after it had traveled about five feet further.\nArgued Jan. 15, 1919.\nAppeals, Nos. 61 and 62, Jan. T., 1919, by plaintiffs, from order of C. P. No. 2, Philadelphia Co., June T., 1916, No. 4252, refusing to take off nonsuit in case of John H. Cressman, by his father and next friend, Charles M. Cressman, and Charles M. Cress-man, in his own right, v. Isaac Lakoff, individually and trading as Cross Keys Furniture and Storage Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Wessel, J.\nAt the close of plaintiff\u2019s testimony a nonsuit was entered which the court subsequently refused to take off for the following reasons given for entering it:\nAt the time of the accident involved in this case, plaintiffs resided at No. 34 North Redfield street, which is a thoroughfare extending in a northerly and'southerly direction in West Philadelphia, their home being located between Market and Filbert streets. Salford street is another thoroughfare running parallel to and about one-half square east of Redfield street.\nAbout eight o\u2019clock in the evening of August 9, 1916, the father, Charles M. Cressman, was seated with some of the other members of his family on a porch in the rear of his residence. He sent his son, John H. Cress-man (who was eight years of age on December 2, 1916), to the northwest corner of Salford and Market streets for the purpose of purchasing ice cream. The boy proceeded from his home out the back gate northwardly to Filbert street, then oyer to Salford street, and was walking in a southerly direction upon that street toward Market street. Defendant\u2019s one-horse covered wagon was proceeding northwardly across Market street. Two boys were sitting in the wagon looking toward Market street. When the horse\u2019s head had reached a point in Salford street about ten feet north of the north crossing of Market street, the child started to step off the curb. At that time the head of the horse was three feet from the child and the horse was proceeding on a trot. Instantly thereafter the child came in contact with the horse and was injured. The horse was stopped after it had traveled about five feet further. Under these circumstances I do not see how defendant can be held liable.\nWhile contributory negligence cannot be charged against this eight-year-old child, nevertheless, before either of the plaintiffs are entitled to recover they must submit some evidence of negligence on the part of this defendant. That, in my opinion, they have failed to do. For that reason, I sustain the motion and enter a non-suit.\nThe court subsequently refused to take off the nonsuit. Plaintiffs appealed.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nJohn J. McDevitt, Jr., with him Harry A. Gorson, for appellants,\ncited: Gallagher v. Kahn, 223 Pa. 541; Castor v. Schaefer, 224 Pa. 208; Freel v. Wanamaker, 208 Pa. 279; Satinsky v. Mutual Brewing Co., 187 Pa. 57; Streitfeld v. Shoemaker, 185 Pa. 265; Ford et al. v. Deigendeseh, 261 Pa. 247; Brown v. Schellenberg, 19 Pa. Superior Ct. 286 p Corpies v..Sand Co., 31 Pa. Superior Ct. 107; Mulhern y. Phila. Homemade Bread Co., 257 Pa. 22.\nFebruary 17, 1919:\nWilliam Linton, with him Harry A. Mackey, for appellee."
