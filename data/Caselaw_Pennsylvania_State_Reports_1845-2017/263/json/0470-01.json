Connor, Appellant.\nWorkmen\u2019s compensation \u2014 Finding of fact by referee and compensation board \u2014 Gonclusiveness\u2014Review by court.\nA finding by the referee and the compensation board that a workman at the time he was killed was an employee and not an independent contractor is conclusive and not reviewable by the court on appeal.\nArgued Jan. 9, 1919.\nAppeal, No. 10, Jan. T., 1919, by defendant, from judgment of O. P. No. 2, Philadelphia Co., Dec. T., 1917, No. 1030, dismissing appeal from an award of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, which affirmed the award made by the referee, in the case of Catarina Belmonte v. Thomas Connor.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from award of compensation board.\nThe referee found that plaintiff\u2019s husband was an employee at the time he was injured and made an award of compensation, which was affirmed by the compensation board. The court affirmed the award. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was dismissing exceptions to the decision of the compensation board.\nWilliam G. Wright, with him R. P. F. Maxwell, for appellant.\nThe only issue before the referee at the hearing was whether the decedent was an employee of the defendant: Harrison v. Collins, 86 Pa. 153; Thomas v. Altoona, etc., R. R., 191 Pa. 361; Miller y. Merritt, 211 Pa. 127.\nThe burden of proof to establish this issue rested upon the claimant: Hunt v. Penna. R. R., 51 Pa. 475; Mc-Caullough y. Shoneman, 105 Pa. 169; Connor y. Penna. R. R. Co., 24 Pa. Superior Ct. 241.\nThe jurisdiction of this court is merely to \u201cinspect the record, to ascertain whether the judgment in question is in conformity therewith\u201d: McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., 261 Pa. 312.\nThe opinion of the board affirming the referee could not add anything to the referee\u2019s findings and opinion: McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., 261 Pa. 312.\nOwen J. Roberts, with him Francis S. Goglia, for appellee.\nThis court will not go beyond the record: MeCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., 261 Pa. 312; Messinger v. Lehigh Valley Railroad Co., 261 Pa. 336.\nFebruary 17, 1919:\nIt affirmatively appears in the referee\u2019s findings that defendant had the right to direct the details of the work: Smith v. State Workmen\u2019s Insurance Fund, 262 Pa. 251."
