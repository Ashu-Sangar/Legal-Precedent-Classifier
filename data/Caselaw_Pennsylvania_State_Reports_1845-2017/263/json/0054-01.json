    "head_matter": "Connelly\u2019s Estate.\nDecedents\u2019 estates \u2014 Occupation of real estate by widow \u2014 Children \u2014 Tenants in common \u2014 Intestate laws.\nUnder the intestate laws of Pennsylvania a widow is not a tenant in common with the heirs of land of which her husband died seized. If she occupies the real estate, her occupancy of the premises creates no obligation to account to the heirs of the husband for the rental value thereof; and this is especially true where the heirs are minor children of the husband, and live with the widow on the premises, and were educated, fed and maintained by her for several years.\nArgued Oct. 10,1918.\nAppeal, No. 178, Oct. T., 1918, by Patrick J. Anderson, from order of O. O. Beaver Co., Dec. T., 1917, No. 27, dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report in Estate of Mary J. Connelly.\nBefore Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer, Simpson and Fox, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to report of John A. Elliott, Esq., auditor.\nThe auditor found that John J. Connelly died on July 3,1913, intestate, leaving to survive Mm his widow, Mary J. Connelly, and two sons by a former wife, aged respectively eleven and thirteen years. He owned a hotel in which the widow and the two sons lived until the widow\u2019s death on October 8, 1916. During this time the widow conducted the hotel, and supported, maintained and fed the two sons. The guardian of the sons claimed $20,800 for the widow.\u2019s use of the hotel. The auditor disallowed the claim. On exceptions Baldwin, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nWe have carefully examined the auditor\u2019s findings and conclusions in this case and are of the opinion that the auditor was right in refusing the claim presented by Patrick J. Anderson, guardian of Thomas P. and John F. Connelly.\nAs pointed out by the auditor, the weight of authority is that under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania the widow is not a tenant in common with the heirs. Therefore, her occupancy of the premises in question created no obligation to account to the heirs of the husband for the rental value thereof. Besides, the heirs occupied the premises jointly with her. They were fed, clothed and educated out of the profits of the business which the decedent conducted in the premises. The master\u2019s findings show that the decedent expended in theii^ maintenance and education a sum equal to or in excess of their share of a fair compensation for the use- of the premises or the fair rental value thereof.\nJanuary 4,1919:\nWe are unable to see how the claim can be sustained, either in whole or in part, and the exceptions will accordingly be dismissed.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report.\nLawrence M. Sebring, with him George Wilson, for appellant.\nE. C. Higbee, of Sterling, Higbee & Matthews, with him S. R. Goldsmith, Arthur McKeen, and W. D. Craig, for appellees."
