    "head_matter": "Dohl v. Clement, Appellant.\nMaster and servant \u2014 Negligence\u2014\u2022Injury to employee \u2014 Safe place to worh \u2014 Duty to warn employee of concealed dangers \u2014 Excavation \u2014 Uneven bottom covered with discolored water.\n1. One who employs his servant to work in an excavation, when he takes upon himself the direction and control of the work is bound to see that the place is reasonably safe to work in when the servant enters it; and if it is actually unsafe and the danger is one which is concealed, he must inform the servant of the danger.\n2. An employer is liable for injury to an employee, caused by falling into a deep hole in the floor of an excavation while he was attempting to spread concrete over the bottom of the excavation which was covered with discolored water, where the master must have known of the unevenness of the bottom, and yet advised the employee that the place was safe to walk upon.\nArgued Jan. 17, 1919.\nAppeal, No. 99, Jan. T., 1919, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 4, Philadelphia Co., Sept. T., 1915, No. 4057, dismissing defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v., in the case of Charles H. Dohl v. Frank H. Clement, trading as F. H. Clement & Co.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before Audenried, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that defendant was engaged in constructing an addition to an intake from a river to a pumping station. This consisted of an excavation which was divided into sections or compartments. There was a seepage or a leakage of river water into the excavation which was about twelve feet below the surface of the river. The excavation had been roughly made by means of machinery. There was some question as to whether or not the floor of it was level or was pitted by depressions of various sizes, caused by the removal of bolders or large stones which formed part of the soil which had been removed. The plaintiff was sent into the compartment in question, to level concrete over the bottom of the excavation as the concrete was being poured into it from the chute from the concrete mixer on the outside. The plaintiff testified that it was impossible for him at that time to see the bottom of the excavation as there was then about eighteen inches depth of water in it and that the water was discolored by the concrete which had been dumped into the compartment, so that it could not be seen through. Plaintiff testified that the foreman in charge of the work, who directed him to level the concrete, explained to him that the bottom was level and safe to walk on and that he had no hesitation in stepping down into the water and starting the work of spreading the concrete. While working he stepped backward into a depression approximately fifteen to eighteen inches deep which caused him to fall. The fall brought him into the water up to his waist. He continued to work about one and one-half hours longer; then he left and dried his clothing as best he could, and went elsewhere. Plaintiff claimed his injuries were due to the fall and not to the exposure after getting wet.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $10,000. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were refusal to direct a verdict for defendant and in dismissing the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v.\nBayard Henry and Gerald Ronon, for appellant.\nAn employer is not required to supervise details of all work performed by an employee: Welch v. Carlucci Stone Co., 215 Pa. 34; Durst v. Carnegie Steel Co., 173 Pa. 162; Lee v. Dobson, 217 Pa. 352; lams v. Hazel Atlas Glass Co., 251 Pa. 443; Schneider v. Phila. Quartz Co., 220 Pa. 550 ; Weaver v\u00a1 Wohlsen, 254 Pa. 375.\nFebruary 17, 1919:\nEmployee cannot recover from employer where the dangers, if any, incident to the work, were as apparent to the employee as to the employer : Welch v. Carl\u00facci Stone Co., supra; lams v. Hazel Atlas Glass Co., supra.\nThe plaintiff, because of his own negligence and recklessness, is not entitled to recover from defendant: Ignash v. Murphy, Cook & Co., 249 Pa. 223.\nThe jury should not have been allowed to guess as to the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, when one of the causes was admittedly due to plaintiff\u2019s negligence. Plaintiff, on becoming soaking wet, should have cared for himself as any prudent person\u2019would have done: Alexander v. Penna. Water Co., 201 Pa. 252; Bruggeman et ux. v. City of York, 254 Pa. 430; Fullick v. South Penn Oil Co., 260 Pa. 5.\nAugustus T. Ashton, with him Victor Frey, for appellee.\nIt became the duty of the vice-principal in charge of the work to give sufficient warning to the workman so that he might guard against the danger: Nunkel v. Allentown Portland Cement Co., 249 Pa. 104; Gilbert v. Elk Tanning Co., 221 Pa. 176; Reber v. Alsace Township, 49 Pa. Superior Ct. 465; Dougherty v. Dob-son, 214 Pa. 252; Martin v.
