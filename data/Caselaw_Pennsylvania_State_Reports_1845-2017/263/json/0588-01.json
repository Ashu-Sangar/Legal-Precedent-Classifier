A contract of employment providing that the employee will not for a period of one year after the termination of the employment, enter into a similar line of business, nor enter into the employ of anyone engaged in a similar business within a city named, is founded upon a valuable consideration, and, being limited both, as to time and territory, is such a partial restraint of trade that it will be enforced by a court of equity.\nContract \u2014 Construction\u2014Liquidated damages \u2014 Penalty.\n2. The sum of $500 stipulated \u201cas liquidated damages\u201d in case an employee should enter into similar business within one year after the termination of his employment, must be held to be a penalty, and not liquidated damages.\nEquity \u2014 Injunction\u2014Breach of contract not to engage in similar business \u2014 Penalty\u2014Adequate remedy at law.\n3. In such a case, the mere fact that the contract provided for a penalty of $500 in case the employee should engage in similar business after the termination of his employment, does not oust the jurisdiction of a court of equity to enforce the contract.\nArgued Jan.
