        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nFelix Petrowski sued in trespass, alleging that, on March 31, 1915, when but twelve years old, he was seriously injured upon defendant\u2019s railroad, through its negligence; judgment was entered on a verdict for defendant and plaintiff has appealed.\nYoung Petrowski claimed, and presented evidence to prove, he boarded one of defendant\u2019s cars while it was standing still; that, when the train was. moving \u201cpretty fast,\u201d he was chased therefrom by a man, carrying a club and flag, who wore overalls and a cap, \u201cwith a shiny black band around it\u201d; that this man ordered plaintiff to \u201cget off,\u201d and, upon failure to obey, threw his club' at him; which made the boy dodge and fall, thus causing his injury.\nOn the other hand, defendant claimed, and produced numerous witnesses to prove, plaintiff was injured while attempting to steal a ride on a moving train, and that his story of the accident was a fabrication without basis of fact.\nThe issues thus raised were submitted to the jury; but plaintiff contends the trial judge erred in his charge and in the admission of certain evidence offered by defendant.\nBefcre considering the several points suggested by the assignments of error, we shall state some relevant principles of law, deducible from our recent decisions: When in a given case it is shown that a man, costumed in the garb usually worn by a brakeman, and carrying a red flag, or other implement with which such trainmen are generally equipped, was seen performing police duty upon a train of the defendant (as in the present case), this in the absence of controlling evidence to the contrary is sufficient to sustain a finding that such man was, in fact, an employee of the railroad (Dunne v. Penna. R. R., 249 Pa. 76, 78, 79; see also Bickley v. P. & R. Ry., 257 Pa. 369, 373; and Oberndorf v. P. & R. Ry., 53 Pa. Superior Ct. 74, 77), engaged in guarding its property (Dunne v. Pa. R. R., p. 80, supra; Stidfole v. P. & R. Ry., 261 Pa. 445); and, when an act of his is under investigation, which, if properly done, would be consistent with the performance of such duty (guarding property), it may be inferred, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the act was done and performed in the course of his employment .(Dunne v. Pa. R. R., supra, p. 80, and Bickley v. P. & R. Ry., supra, p. 374). Furthermore, privately imparted orders to employees of.the class to which the one in question belongs, that they shall perform their duties in a specified manner, differing from the way in which the particular employee acted at the time involved, will not serve to make the latter\u2019s act any less one done in furtherance of the master\u2019s business, if such act apparently falls within the general scope of the servant\u2019s employment (Dunne v. Pa. R. R., supra, p. 81, citing P. W. & B. R. R. v. Brannen, 1 Sadler 369; Brennan v. Merchant & Co., 205 Pa. 258, 261; McClung v. Dearborne, 134 Pa. 396, 406-408, and cases there cited); in other words, and speaking more particularly, it being the duty of a brakeman to guard from trespassers the train upon which he is employed (as here defendant\u2019s own witnesses testified it is), then, even though the orders from his employer, that this duty shall be performed in a certain way, are departed from, if, as a matter of fact, at the time of such departure, the employee is engaged in relieving the train from the presence of a trespasser, he none the less acts within the general scope of his employment.\nWhile trainmen are not required to search out and care for infant trespassers, yet, when a child of tender years is observed upon a railroad car, it is the duty \u00f3f those in charge to see that they do not start the- train until the infant trespasser has alighted therefrom (Pollack v. Pa. R. R. No. 1, 210 Pa. 631, 633; Trevethan v. P. & R. By., 244 Pa. 414; Di Meglio v. P. & R. Ry., 249 Pa. 319, 324); or, if the train is actually in motion when such infant is first observed, then the duty is not to commit any overt act which is likely to cause him injury (Pollack v. Pa. R. R., supra; Enright v. Pittsburgh J. R. R., 198 Pa. 166, 170; Stephanik v. B. & O. R. R., 243 Pa. 43, 45); and, if this duty is breached, it is not essential to recovery that there be present any element of recklessness or grossness, \u2014 proof of what under ordinary circumstances might be termed \u201cmere negligence\u201d is enough (Piepke v. P. & R. Ry., 242 Pa. 321, 326; Pollack v. Penna. E. R., supra, p. 634; Trevethan v. P. & R. Ry., supra, p. 417; Stidfole v. P. & R. Ry., supra); but, to justify the application of this rule, it must appear that the offending employee actually saw or was aware of the presence of the infant trespasser.\nFinally, where one, knowing that a child of tender years is trespassing upon a vehicle under his care, negli-. gently acts in such a manner as to injure the trespasser, the conduct of the transgressor is viewed in law as \u201cintentional,\u201d or wilful, and,\u201cwanton\u201d; and, although we have said, in a case of this character (McGinnis v. Peoples Bros., 249 Pa. 335, 338) that the defendant is entitled to the affirmance of a. point to the effect that the jury must find the injury was \u201cwantonly and intentionally\u201d inflicted, yet, in that case, those terms are used in the sense just stated ; this is consistent with the other cases hereinbefore cited.\nThe trial judge, against the objection of plaintiff, allowed the introduction of evidence by defendant that its brakemen were directed, when they saw train riders, to notify the conductors, whose duty it was to wire ahead to the next station for an officer to take off such trespassers ; and, apparently based on this testimony, the judge instructed the jurors that, unless they could find from the evidence \u201cit was within the scope of such brakeman\u2019s employment and duty to eject a trespasser, then there may be no recovery,\u201d .for \u201csuch brakeman would not be acting in the scope of. his authority.\u201d He further instructed, and reiterated several times, that, before plaintiff could recover, he must satisfy the jury \u201cdef\u00e9ndant\u2019s employee wilfully and with gross negligence caused the boy\u2019s injuries by recklessly driving him from the train.\u201d When these admissions of evidence and instructions are tested by our recent decisions, it.is plain they transgress the rulings there made. In cases of this character, involving alleged negligence towards children trespassers of tender years, the test is neither reckless conduct nor gross negligence, but lack of due care under the circumstances. In determining whether an employee acted in the course of his employment, the duties involved in the general scope of such employment are the criteria, and privately imparted orders limiting those duties have no bearing.\nThe substantial issue in this case is, was plaintiff injured through being either forced or scared from a moving train by a servant of defendant, the latter acting within the general scope of. his employment and in furtherance of his master\u2019s business; or was this child hurt while attempting to board a moving train? A reading of the printed testimony conveys the impression that the weight of the evidence decidedly favors defendant\u2019s contention that the accident happened in the way last mentioned, and the trial judge, who saw and heard the'witnesses, evidently was strongly so impressed. If, upon a rehearing of the cause, plaintiff recovers a verdict, and the court below again takes a like view, amounting to a conviction, that tribunal has a remedy at hand, by granting a new trial, which it should not hesitate to apply (Maloy v. Rosenbaum, 260 Pa. 466, 472; Hewitt v. Democratic Publishing Co., 260 Pa. 59, 61, 62); but it is not for us to pass upon the honesty of plaintiff\u2019s case. Our duty is simply to decide the points of law presented by the assignments of error; and these, on the present record, we must determine in plaintiff\u2019s favor.\nThe judgment is reversed with a venire facias de novo, and a like order is made in No. 98., Jan. T., 1919.",

Philadelphia & Reading Railway Co.\nNegligence \u2014 Railroads\u2014Infant trespasser \u2014 Putting off train \u2014 \u25a0 Brdkeman \u2014 Privately imparted orders \u2014 Wilful or \u201cwanton\u201d conduct.\n1. When in a given ease it is shown that a man, costumed in the garb usually worn by a brakeman, and carrying a red flag or other implement with which such trainmen are generally equipped, was seen performing police duty upon a train, this in the absence of controlling evidence to the contrary is sufficient to sustain a finding that such man was, in fact, an employee of the railroad company operating the train, engaged in guarding its property.\n2. When an act of such an employee is under investigation, which if properly done, would be consistent with the performance of the duty of guarding the property, it may be inferred, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the act was done and performed in the course of his employment.\n3. Privately imparted orders to brakemen that they shall perform their duties in a specified manner, differing from the way in which a particular brakeman acted at the time of an accident, will not serve to make the latter\u2019s act any less one done in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business, if such act apparently falls within the general scope of the servant\u2019s employment.\n4. While trainmen are not required to search out and care for infant trespassers, yet, when a child of tender years is observed upon a railroad car, it is the duty of those in charge to see to it that they do not start the train until the infant trespasser has alighted therefrom; or, if the train is actually in motion when such infant is first observed, then the duty is not to commit any overt act which is likely to cause him injury; and if this duty is breached, it is not essential to recovery that there be present any element of recklessness or grossness.\n5. Where one, knowing that a child of tender years is trespassing upon a vehicle under his care, negligently acts in such a manner as to injure the trespasser, the conduct of the transgressor is viewed in law as \u201cintentional,\u201d or wilful, and \u201cwanton.\u201d\n6. Where a child twelve years old is injured, through being forced or scared from a moving train by a brakeman, a judgment on a verdict for the railroad' company will be reversed where it appears that the trial judge, against the objection of plaintiff, allowed the introduction of evidence by defendant that its brakemen were directed, when they saw train riders, to notify the conductors, whose duty it was to wire ahead to the next station for an officer to take off such trespassers, and the judge, apparently on this testimony, instructed the jurors that, unless they could find from the evidence \u201cit was within the scope of such brakeman\u2019s employment and duty to eject a trespasser, then there may be no recovery,\u201d for \u201csuch brakeman would not be acting in the scope of his authority.\u201d\n7. It is also error in such a case to charge that before plaintiff could recover he must satisfy the jury that \u201cdefendant\u2019s employee wilfully and with gross negligence caused the boy\u2019s injuries by recklessly driving him from the train.\u201d The test in such a case is neither reckless conduct nor gross negligence, but lack of due care under the circumstances.\nPractice, Supreme Court \u2014 Common pleas \u2014 New trial \u2014 Weight of evidence.\n8. On the review of a jury trial the Supreme Court will not pass upon the honesty of plaintiff\u2019s evidence; that is for the court below by granting a new trial if convinced that the weight of the evidence is decidedly against plaintiff.\nArgued Jan. 16, 1919.\nAppeals, Nos. 97 and 98, by plaintiffs, from judgment of C.
