      <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>The plaintiff is the owner of three lots in the plan of Domestic Land Company, Scott Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, together having a frontage of about seventy-five feet on Main street and extending back westwardly about 110 feet. Main street of the plan is a public road, which is maintained by Scott Township, it being one of the first class under act approved April 28, 1899, page 108. The plaintiff’s land is on a hillside — the rear of the lots being about thirty feet below the level of Main street.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b263-3" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[164,893,1150,1186]]]'>The defendant owns, inter alia, á large number of lots in the plan, and it is engaged in mining coal. It obtained permission from,the commissioners of Scott Township to drive its entries under the surface of the streets of the plan, and it has constructed its pit mouth at Neville street, and has driven an entry along Main street in front' of the plaintiff’s land. The entry is eight feet in width and about six feet in height. At the nearest point, the entry approaches within six feet of the plaintiff’s front lot line. Here, the roof of the entry, is of rock, and the thickness of the strata is about thirty-five feet. No mining operations have been conducted by the defendant under the road in question. The plaintiff’s contention is that the defendant has removed coal under the streets and alleys, in which he claims to have an interest that will support the bill. No coal within the lines of the plaintiff’s lots has been removed, nor is it intended to remove any. There has been no subsidence of the surface at any point within the limits of Domestic Land Company plan, except upon that portion which is owned by the defendant, and that was caused by the removal of the coal- to the edge of the crop.</p>

No irreparable injury to the plaintiff’s land has been shown by the evidence.</p>
