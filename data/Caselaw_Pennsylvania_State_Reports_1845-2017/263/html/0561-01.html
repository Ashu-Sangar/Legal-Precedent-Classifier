Phila. &amp; Reading Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/249/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="249 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="1013565" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0326-01">249 Pa. 326</a>. In that case the covenant provided for'the payment of all taxes upon the yearly payments which the lessee was obligated to pay the lessor as rent. It was held that the lessee in that case was obliged to pay the amount assessed as income tax under the Act of Congress of October 3, 1913. In that case the tax was not imposed on the “yearly payments” or “rent” as such, but was laid upon the net income. In the case at bar the income tax is laid upon net income, and the so-called war excess profits tax is laid upon income, received during the calendar year preceding the time when the tax is assessed. <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>So far as the covenant under consideration is concerned we think it amply sufficient to cover both the income tax and the excess profits tax, in view of the fact that any tax assessed upon the earnings or profits of the plaintiff were to be paid by the defendant. The plaintiff having turned over all of its property to the defendant, the only earnings or profits it can receive are from the lease, and whether the tax be imposed upon income, net or gross, it is in fact imposed upon the rental. Earnings and profits under the circumstances must be regarded as was the yearly rent in the North Penn case.</p>
