The contract provided that plaintiff should pay 25 cents for each load and that the character of the material was to be earth and ashes from building excavations. The plaintiff at first hauled earth from building excavations and laier materials from buildings which consisted of broken plaster, broken tile and debris from buildings which had been torn down, consisting of broken bricks, slate from roofs, tar paper and other things.</p>

As to this, upon an examination of the evidence we are of opinion that there was enough to go to the jury and that the jury might well have found, as they did, that the contract was not merely that which was shown by the writing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.5",324,[268,1505,1150,798]]]'>The other ground set up by the defendant for this motion is that the defendant itself having a right to dump as much earth as it pleased on the lands in question, the plaintiff’s right to dump was not sufficiently definite to enable him to recover. The plaintiff had an exclusive right to use the land except as against the defendant itself. If the defendant in its own operations had used the dump and filled it up as rapidly as it was in fact filled up, the plaintiff would have no cause to complain, but the evidence showed the dump was rapidly filled up by the defendant throwing it open to all comers, in breach of its contract with him. It would therefore seem that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the loss of the dump so far as it was actually brought about by its use by persons other than the defendant. ■</p>
