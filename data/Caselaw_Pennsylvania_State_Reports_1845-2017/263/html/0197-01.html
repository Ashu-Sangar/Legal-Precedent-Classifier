Accumulation is forbidden under the Act of 1853, P. L. 503, Section 9, no less where it results by indirection than where it is expressly ordered: <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>Neel’s Est., <em><a href="/pa/252/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="252 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1021597" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0394-01">252 </a></em><a href="/pa/252/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="252 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1021597" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0394-01">Pa. 394</a>.

Super. 85" data-case-ids="457994" data-case-paths="/pa-super/64/0085-01">64 Pa. Superior Ct. 85</a>. It will be unlawful only as to that part of the income which accrues after the majority of the cestuis que trust; during its minority it is valid. This trust with respect to the payment of the income is not terminated at the present time. It is true that one of the cestuis que trust is now of full age and the other is a minor ; but when we refer to the will we find that the income is payable by the trustees in their discretion for “as good an education as said children may desire to get, each until it receive its share under this my will,” so that it is apparent that the trustees may continue to pay so much of the income as may be necessary for this education until their estates are relieved from the testamentary conditions imposed. There was no attempt made by the testator to limit the education of the children; everything is left to the discretion of the trustees. The testator did not -say that the education of his niece should end with her graduation at Wellesley College. The discretion in them is legal and not arbitrary. If these children desire to be educated in any manner whatever until such time as they are entitled to the corpus of this estate, they are entitled to receive from the income the cost of said education. Any person of experience knows that a college course is but a step in education, and it would be a very narrow construction of this will to hold that the payment of the income be confined to scholastic work. It is not necessary to decide at this time to whom the unlawful accumulated income may belong, for there may be none when the boy who is now a minor attains the age of twenty-one years, the time for distribution. The testator’s anxiety was that this income should not go to the father of the children directly or indirectly, and his intent will be carried out by an order which will provide for distribution of <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>the unexpended income shown by the account to the' trustees, to hold and use for the purposes of the trust and judicious management of the trust estate, until the youngest of the two children arrives at the age of twenty-one years and it will be so ordered.</p>

From an examination of the will it appears that under no circumstances could either of the children receive his or her share of the estate until twenty-five years of age. But the children are entitled to get as good an education: as they desire “each until it receives its share under this my will.” Does this provision make the income divisible so that one who is now twenty-one years old may demand one-half of it and leaving the other one-half in trust for the minor? It is clear that the will does not express this intention, and if it is to be so interpreted it must be by way of inference. But it is probable that the testamentary intent is found in considering that the extent of the education is left wholly with the child, and if it should so happen that the proper demands of the minor for this should exceed the one-half of the income at any time, before the time for distribution arrives, or until he may be lawfully entitled to elect to have distribution of the income, how can the testamentary discretion vested in him be effected by a denial, which may be the result if one-half of the income is now distributed to his sister, who is of age. A distribution of this kind at the present time may destroy the discretion given to the minor and substitute an arbitrary course for his education. This would make the intent to educate subordinate to an arbitrary discretion and the accomplishment of the ward’s desire may be dependent upon a whim of the trustees. The-testamentary <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>intent to give'an unlimited education may not be realized if the right hereto depends upon an arbitrary discretion in the trustees. The aid directed could be refused without any reason and the court would be powerless to interfere. The right is absolute and cannot be defeated by the trustees. The discretion to pay is legal and consequently under the control of the court. Hence, if it should appear to the court during the minority of the cestui que trust that all of the income should be applied for his education, after the other has no longer any desire to pursue the privilege, or is deceased, the fund should not be impaired. Each, while both are living, may demand one-half of the income and receive it during the time to which the enjoyment of the corpus is postponed, if there is honesty of effort and purpose to acquire a proper education, whatever it may be, and the amount of the income demanded is necessary therefor. But, if for any reason the payment of the share of the income to one is stopped as in the event of death or election to discontinue educational pursuits, the whole of the income must be preserved to satisfy the desire for education in the other, until the time for distribution arrives. The trustees have not attempted to exercise their judgment as to the necessity or advisability of limiting the education of either of the children. The accumulation of income is not void until the minor becomes 21 years of age. If it is suggested that the amount of the income now is more than necessary for the educational purposes of one, we reply that no person can know what the income or the desire for education may be in the future.</p>
