It also further set forth in the said petition that it was necessary to provide on the surface of the lands of the defendant a water course or right-of-way, and a right-of-way, partly under and partly over the surface, as a tramway from the proposed mine openings to the point where Poland Coal Company had located its contemplated plant for the manufacture of coke. This petition concluded with the prayer that the land be condemned and the court appointed a board of viewers for that purpose, and to assess any damages accruing by reason thereof to the defendant. Accordingly, on November 11, 1912, the said court appointed a board of viewers in accordance with the prayer of the petitioner. The said viewers, on January 31, 1913, filed their report, condemning the said property, to which report the defendant filed exceptions. The Poland Coal Company, the defendant, on February 21, 1913, presented its petition to the said Court of Quarter Sessions wherein it set forth its desire to exercise the privileges granted, to appropriate the lands, make the openings and construct the several ways <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>provided for at once, and at the same time it presented its bond in the sum of three thousand dollars to secure any damage that might accrue to the plaintiff.

It erected thereon, along the face of the bluff, for a distance of one thousand feet, or more, a tramway to convey coal from the mine openings to its coke ovens. It also erected on this land a fan house, two small buildings, machinery necessary to remove the coal not only from the Titus tract but also from other tracts adjoining it, owned by the company. It also made three new, and enlarged two, old openings through the outcrop coal on the disputed land in order to reach and be able to mine the coal within the boundaries of the Titus deed, and from adjoining tracts.

There is nothing whatever in the deed showing the grantor owned any adjoining land or any other land anywhere. It follows, therefore, that if the defendant company’s mining rights and privileges attach to the land in dispute they must so attach through and by virtue of the optional agreement which covers the said land.

We think not. Was not the maximum acreage to be accepted left to the choice and election of the second party to the contract? The contract provides: “In consideration whereof the said second party hereby covenants, promises and agrees to pay, or cause to be paid untoAhe said first party for said coal, if so purchased as aforesaid, at the rate of one hundred dollars per acre for each and every acre of the nine-foot vein of coal in said above-described tract, as the same may be determined by the engineer of said second party.” In pursuance of this provision we see no reason why the second party could not have elected to accept any number of acres of coal, not less than the number “with a nominal covering of not less than twenty feet” ■; or why he might not have elected to take any larger number of acres, to the inclusion of every acre within the description of the optional agreement. He did elect, however, to take only the 150.679 acres embraced in the deed. Having thus exercised his choice and election, in the absence of any allegation of either fraud, accident or mistake, and with no evident misconception of the deed by* either party, neither he nor his successor in title, the present defendant, can now be heard, in our opinion, to complain of his own voluntary act. He might have included in the survey, which was to be, and as the evidence shows was, made by his own engineer, all the coal to a line below the line of outcrop — as well as two additional acres lying across a deep ravine — but he has not seen fit to do so. The optional agreement clearly gave him that right, but he failed to exercise it. By his election not to include in the survey the two acres of coal lying “across the ravine” he did not even take the minimum amount — “all the coal with a nominal covering of twenty feet” — in accordance with the terms of the option. As we view it, therefore, <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>all the mining rights and privileges to which the defendant company is entitled are set out in the deed under which it holds, and attach to the land therein described, and to no other lands.</p>

Neff, and others, for the coal?” “One hundred and fifty acres and a fraction.” “Why is it that all the land embraced in the option is not embraced in the deed?” “Well, they elected not to take but 150 acres.”......“Mr. Howell has asked you about their electing not to take the outcrop coal. Was there other coal they elected not to take, and if so how much?” “About two acres.” “And where is that with reference to the 150 acres?” “It lays across a deep ravine — they decided not to take that.” This evidence, which is undisputed, throws pome light, at least on the understanding and intent of the parties, and discloses a mutual yielding of their respective rights under the option. It is evidence of a different agreement from the one contained in the option, of an agreement whose terms and conditions were embraced in the deed.</p>

In the present case it cannot be said that the deed was made in pursuance of the written optional agreement.
