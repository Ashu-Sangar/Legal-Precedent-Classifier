One who employs his servant to work in an excavation, when he takes upon himself the direction and control of the work is bound to see that the place is reasonably safe to work in when the servant enters it; and if it is actually unsafe and the danger is one which is concealed, he must inform the servant of the danger.</p>

This consisted of an excavation which was divided into sections or compartments. There was a seepage or a leakage of river water into the <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>excavation which was about twelve feet below the surface of the river. The excavation had been roughly made by means of machinery. There was some question as to whether or not the floor of it was level or was pitted by depressions of various sizes, caused by the removal of bolders or large stones which formed part of the soil which had been removed. The plaintiff was sent into the compartment in question, to level concrete over the bottom of the excavation as the concrete was being poured into it from the chute from the concrete mixer on the outside. The plaintiff testified that it was impossible for him at that time to see the bottom of the excavation as there was then about eighteen inches depth of water in it and that the water was discolored by the concrete which had been dumped into the compartment, so that it could not be seen through. Plaintiff testified that the foreman in charge of the work, who directed him to level the concrete, explained to him that the bottom was level and safe to walk on and that he had no hesitation in stepping down into the water and starting the work of spreading the concrete. While working he stepped backward into a depression approximately fifteen to eighteen inches deep which caused him to fall. The fall brought him into the water up to his waist. He continued to work about one and one-half hours longer; then he left and dried his clothing as best he could, and went elsewhere. Plaintiff claimed his injuries were due to the fall and not to the exposure after getting wet.</p>
