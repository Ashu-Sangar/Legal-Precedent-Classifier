There is testimony on the part of the defendant that the plaintiff’s eye had been injured long previous to the time of the accident. This testimony, however, we are not considering under the present motion. The question now before us is, did the plaintiff assume all risks naturally and reasonably incident to his employment; and did he have notice of all risks which, to a person of his experience and understanding, are or ought to be open and obvious? A careful examination of his testimony leads us to the conclusion that he did. That he was an experienced riveter is beyond dispute; that he knew that with every rivet driven hot sparks and scales flew from the rivet and might lodge on his person.</p>
