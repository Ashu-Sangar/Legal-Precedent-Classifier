In the afternoon of the day the accident occurred he was sent from the defendant’s storeroom in Baum boulevard near Beatty street, East End, Pittsburgh, to convey some baggage belonging to defendant’s salesmen to the Monongahela House in “down-town” Pittsburgh, using for that purpose the Ford delivery truck owned by defendant.</p>

Thomas admits giving him the permission to stop■ for his supper before returning the car to the garage, but denies that he was informed of, or assented to, the Homewood trip. He says that he told Dunlap that he would wait for him, his explanation being that he wished to see the car put away <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>for the night. Dunlap suggests that he was to report at the garage for further duty, but there was no evidence of any work awaiting him there. On the contrary, he says that when he left the Monongahela House he knew he was not going back to work, but that he would be late getting back to East Liberty.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[149,1005,1165,1123]]]'>About 7:30 p. m. he left there driving the defendant’s truck and stopped at the corner of Euclid and Mignonette streets to take oh a boy friend. He then proceeded to a skating rink at the corner of Broad street and Larimer avenue, where he met three other young men, whom he took on, thus making four passengers, all personal friends of Dunlap’s, and none of them in any way employed by or connected with the defendant. With two of these friends seated beside him and the others standing, one on each side of the car on the running board, Dunlap drove eastwardly along Larimer avenue, going, as he had previously been doing, in a direction opposite and away from the direction of defendant’s garage. He was driving at a high and dangerous rate of speed and just, before the accident had turned out of the right-hand driveway into the left side of the street to pass a car or a wagon, thus bringing his truck on to the wrong side of the street and to the corner of Meadow street and Larimer avenue, where he crashed into the taxicab in which the plaintiffs were seated, and which just then emerged from Meadow street.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[149,2146,1150,152]]]'>Dunlap attributes the accident to the failure of the brakes on the truck to respond properly when he saw the taxicab and tried to stop.</p>

The case cited at p. 461, explicitly decides that where the driver was employing the master’s car for an unusual purpose, the master was not liable merely because he had given the servant permission to do so. Dunlap was upon an expedition of his own, for his own purposes entirely, and altogether disconnected from any service or undertaking for his employer. He was going in a direction away from his place of employment and duty, with companions of his own choosing, who were enjoying a pleasure ride with him. Under these circumstances, the court properly instructed the jury to find for the defendant.</p>
