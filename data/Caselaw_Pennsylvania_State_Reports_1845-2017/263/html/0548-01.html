By this writing tbe plaintiff undertook to purchase from that corporation at $100 per share (their par value) thirteen shares of its capital stock. In consideration of this purchase and “as an inducement thereto” tbe International Loan <em>&amp; </em>Trust Company undertook “to have issued to tbe said Harold R. Edwards, through tbe supreme council of tbe Heralds of Liberty, an over<a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>writing contract at ten per cent on all the business written for the said Heralds of Liberty in certain counties in the State of Oklahoma, from the date hereof, no matter by whom said business may be written,” and that should the Heralds of Liberty ever be debarred from doing business in the State of Oklahoma, it (the International Loan &amp; Trust Company) would have the overwriting contract of ten per cent transferred to some other state or part of state to be mutually agreed upon, which will return an equal amount of business to the Heralds of Liberty. The International Loan &amp; Trust Company further agreed to render a statement of business derived from the territory above-named and furnish same to Mr. Edwards once a month, and to attach a check thereto to cover the ten per cent overwriting on said business. Whenever the plaintiff “desired to pay a visit to his territory, the purpose being to secure business and improve his contract” ■ it was agreed that the International Loan &amp; Trust Company should cause the Heralds of Liberty to advance toward his expenses at least ten dollars per week.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b583-4" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[157,568,1150,754]]]'>It appeared, however, that the statements in relation to the business of the Heralds of Liberty in Oklahoma were from time to time sent to the plaintiff from its office. That office was also the office of the International Loan &amp; Trust Company. It was under the charge of Emanuel Barrick. Mr. Barrick since long before the date of the plaintiff’s contract has been supreme recorder of the Heralds of Liberty. He is one of its supreme council and a member of the latter’s executive committee. He has also long been the treasurer of the International Loan &amp; Trust Company, and it was by him, as soi disant “fiscal agent” for the International Loan &amp; Trust Company that the contract of December 14, 1914, above referred to, was executed on its behalf.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[156,1330,1150,590]]]'>Evidence was offered by the plaintiff indicating that on several occasions Mr. Barrick spoke and wrote as if the defendant recognized the plaintiff’s right to demand an accounting from it in regard to the Oklahoma business, and it is certain that on December 14, 1916, writing as supreme recorder of the Heralds of Liberty, he notified the plaintiff that any agreement, written or oral, that he had with the corporation relating to an overwriting commission of ten per cent on business written for it in certain counties in the State of Oklahoma would be terminated December 31, 1916.</p>

It is conceded, of course, that a principal may not hold his agent out in the character of one having general authority and bind third persons who have relied thereon in good faith by secret limitations and restrictions upon the agent’s authority which are inconsistent with the <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>character bestowed. Although the agent violates his instructions or exceeds the limits s.et to his authority, he will yet bind his principal to such third persons, if his acts are within the scope of the authority which the principal has caused or permitted him to possess: Mecham on Agency, 710. While this is true, it is equally , well settled law that a principal may confer on his agent as much or as little of his authority as he sees fit, and may impose upon it all such lawful limitations as he thinks desirable. Such limitations., even in the case of what is known as a general agent, will be as binding and conclusive upon third persons who know of them or who are charged with notice of them as they are upon the agent. If one knows or has good reason to believe that an agent is exceeding his authority, he cannot claim protection under the rule above referred to, should he continue to deal with him. Another familiar principle of the law of agency which bears on the case before the court is that an agent entrusted with the management of the business of another may not exercise for his own benefit the power vested in him.

Of this provision of the defendant’s by-laws it may well be that the plaintiff had no actual knowledge. The power that the International Loan &amp; Trust Company sought to exercise in its dealings with him, was, however, of a most unusual and suspicious character. The offer by the corporation acting as agent of an association formed for fraternal and beneficial purposes to impose a charge of ten per cent in favor of the plaintiff upon the dues and other payments of the members of its principal residing within a certain territory, merely as an inducement to him to invest in its own shares of stock, was a thing so much out of the regular course of business as to put any ordinarily prudent man on his guard. Warned by the remarkable motive of the <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>transaction proposed to him, Mr. Edwards had no right to proceed blindly. He was bound either to refuse to deal further with the International Loan &amp; Trust Company or to ascertain by inquiry of the governing body of the Heralds of Liberty the true extent of the authority confided to its “general grand deputy.” His failure to make such an inquiry rendered him chargeable with notice of all that he would have discovered had he made it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b585-3" data-blocks='[["BL_585.4",585,[152,775,1151,1244]]]'>If the agreement which the plaintiff and the International Loan &amp; Trust Company executed on December 14, 1914, proposed to bind the defendant, it would not, under the facts and principles above stated, have served to impose upon the latter any liability unless subsequently ratified or adopted by it. That instrument, however, was not made in the defendant’s name. It does not profess to be the act and deed of the Heralds of Liberty. So far as its undertakings are not those of the plaintiff they are the promises of the International Loan &amp; Trust Company, which covenants in its own name and for its own acts. It nowhere stipulates that the Heralds of Liberty will do or refrain from doing anything whatever. It merely binds the International Loan &amp; Trust Company to procure certain things from the defendant. That the results contemplated by the contract did not come to pass was not occasioned by any breach on the part of the defendant. The breach of which the plaintiff may complain is that of the- International Loan &amp; Trust Company alone. In this connection, it may be observed that the wording of this statement was as fully indicative of the latter’s lack of authority to bind the defendant as was the singular character of its terms.</p>

If it was done by him as principal and on his own account <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>it cannot thus be ratified......The contract to be ratified must purport to have been made on account of the alleged principal so that when ratified it shall be capable of being enforced by and against that principal as a contract to which he was a party”: Mecham on Agency, ss 386 and 387.</p>

While ratification requires no new consideration for its support, the so-called “adoption” of a contract by a person not a party thereto, being of the nature of a novation, must be supported by one. No evidence was produced to show an advantage received by the defendant or a detriment sustained at its request by the plaintiff in this connection which might serve to make the defendant’s adoption of the contract, if any such thing was attempted, binding upon it in law.</p>
