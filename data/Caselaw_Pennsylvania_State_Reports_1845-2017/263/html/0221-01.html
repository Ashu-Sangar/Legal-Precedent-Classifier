The defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to make out a case in two respects: (1) that there was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury of negligence on the part of their chauffeur; and (2) that it did not sufficiently appear that the injury complained of was caused by the accident.</p>

The defendant contends that this instruction was erroneous. If there had been no evidence to go to the jury other than the presumption arising from the accident, which was a slight collision with another automobile, this would present a case not free from difficulty and the instruction might possibly have been ground for a new trial, which is not moved for. The only question under the present motion is whether there was evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant was negligent. As to this, there was evidence from which the jury might well infer negligence. There was evidence that defendant’s chauffeur saw the other automobile with which he came in contact, forty-five feet <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>away, coining out of an alley across his way, and that he could have stopped within a few feet but did not slacken his speed or give any signal and that the autobus ran into the side of the other automobile.</p>
