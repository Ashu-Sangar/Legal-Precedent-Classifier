    <p class="summary" id="b188-5" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[279,515,1153,697]]]'>For twenty-six years, to the time of his injury, July 14, 1914, plaintiff, an intelligent man, had been employed— during the summer seasons — by the defendant company and other companies, as helper to drivers engaged in delivering ice to customers of the companies. On this 14th day of July he and the driver of defendant were delivering ice to Albert Brehm, at his place of business— the place of delivery being an opening in a wall, an opening seven feet above the level of the floor. To reach this opening, plaintiff, with a lump of ice weighing 100 pounds on his shoulder, proceeded up a four-foot ladder; and in the act of trying to deliver the ice into the opening he fell to the floor and was injured.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b188-6" data-blocks='[["BL_188.6",188,[276,1224,1150,751]]]'>With twenty-six years’ experience in the use of ladders in the line of his work he placed the ladder in the way he desired to use it — but in what way he placed it and put it, for his safety, is not clearly disclosed by the testimony. The driver, who was also carrying ice, was not present when plaintiff used the ladder and fell. The ladder was not in any way broken. How plaintiff slipped, or lost his balance, or what caused him to slip, or the ladder to slip, is the purest conjecture: Reeser v. Metropolitan Electric Co., <a href="/citations/?q=246%20Pa.%2027" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="246 Pa. 27">246 Pa. 27</a>. The driver (Mr. Lewis) testified that he believed the ladder safe— intending to use it, and actually using it, shortly after the accident, in carrying up the ice and delivering it into the opening in the wall.</p>
