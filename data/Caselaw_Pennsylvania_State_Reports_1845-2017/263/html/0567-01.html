Cressman, was seated with some <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>of the other members of his family on a porch in the rear of his residence. He sent his son, John H. Cress-man (who was eight years of age on December 2, 1916), to the northwest corner of Salford and Market streets for the purpose of purchasing ice cream. The boy proceeded from his home out the back gate northwardly to Filbert street, then oyer to Salford street, and was walking in a southerly direction upon that street toward Market street. Defendant’s one-horse covered wagon was proceeding northwardly across Market street. Two boys were sitting in the wagon looking toward Market street. When the horse’s head had reached a point in Salford street about ten feet north of the north crossing of Market street, the child started to step off the curb. At that time the head of the horse was three feet from the child and the horse was proceeding on a trot. Instantly thereafter the child came in contact with the horse and was injured. The horse was stopped after it had traveled about five feet further. Under these circumstances I do not see how defendant can be held liable.</p>
