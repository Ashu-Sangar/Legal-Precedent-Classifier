As the compensation act undertakes to define the meaning of the phrase “injury by an accident in the course of his employment,” in each instance the question of law is presented as to whether pr not the underlying findings of fact are sufficient to bring the case within the statutory definition; but this, however, does not warrant any interference by the courts with such findings of fact whether they be based on proved facts or inference therefrom.</p>
