The mere fact that a carrier was unable to remove its cars on account of its tracks being flooded to such an extent as to entirely suspend its operations for a few days, does not absolve a shipper from liability for demurrage charges during that time on account of cars located on tracks that were not flooded and to which he had access.</p>

Under the rule providing that no demurrage shall he collected when shipments are frozen while in transit so as to prevent unloading during a prescribed free time, provided the consignee makes a diligent effort to unload such shipments, a consignee incurs no liability for failure to unload a shipment of ten cars during the free time where it appears that it was the frozen condition of the shipments and not the number of cars that caused the delay.</p>

The defense of the steel company divides the claim of the plaintiff into two classes: First, a claim amounting to $208, which was demurrage charges that accrued March, 26, 27 and 28, 1917, and during those three days the tracks of the railroad company were flooded above and below Kittanning to such an extent that the oper<a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>ations of the railroad were suspended in the immediate vicinity of Kittanning. The interchange tracks, however, were not flooded and there was no difficulty in the steel company getting to and from the interchange track. It is claimed by the defendant that as the railroad company could not during these three days have removed the cars from the interchange track, or in any manner made use of them, they cannot charge demurrage for the failure of the steel company to deliver them to the interchange track. To sustain such a contention would permit a shipper, whenever he was charged with demurrage for the detention of cars over the free time allowed, to set up a defense to any charge that if the cars had been delivered to the railroad company the railroad company was not in a position to make use of them. I do not think that is the law governing the question of the charge for the detention of cars over the free time.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b239-3" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[174,1293,1149,484]]]'>The other class is a claim amounting to $1,209 which accrued during the months of December, 1912, and February and March of 1913, and the defense of the steel company to this claim of demurrage is that the shipments were frozen, and that under the rules of the railroad company the steel company was not liable for demurrage if it used its best endeavor to unload the shipment in the condition in which it was delivered. The rule in regard to frozen ore is as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b239-4" data-blocks='[["BL_239.5",239,[173,1788,1150,362]]]'>That no demurrage shall be collected “when shipments are frozen while in transit so as to prevent unloading during the prescribed free time. This exemption shall not include shipments which are tendered to consignee in condition to unload. Under this rule, consignee will be required to make diligent effort to unload such shipments.”</p>

But the railroad company claims that, first, by reason of the steel company taking <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>advantage of what is known as the average agreement it was not entitled to take advantage of the “bunching rule,” i. e., the rule which applied to cars that were bunched by the railroad company either at the place of shipment, en route or at the place of consignment. And, second, that the rule above quoted applies to but .one car, and that if the steel company had facilities for unloading one car of frozen ore within the free time of forty-eight hours it must pay demurrage on all the cars delivered to it which it failed to unload within that time.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[287,905,1148,424]]]'>As to the first contention, it was not the bunching of the cars which prevented the steel company from unloading the cars within the free-time limit. If the ore had not been frozen the facilities of the defendant for unloading the cars would have taken care of all the cars delivered, and therefore it was the freezing of the cars and not the bunching of the cars which was the cause of the delay.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[284,1342,1150,698]]]'>As to the second contention of the railroad company, notwithstanding the very curt opinion of the secretary of the Interstate Commerce Commission, I am unable to give the interpretation to that rule contended for by the railroad company. Demurrage shall not be collected “when shipments are frozen while in transit.” A shipment is a consignment as delivered by the railroad company, be it one car or one hundred cars, and there is nothing in the averment of facts to justify the contention that the number of cars delivered at any one time during the period for which this demurrage is charged was due to the bunching of shipments either at the place of shipment, en route or at the place of delivery.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.6",241,[160,686,1151,1521]]]'>In a former opinion filed in this case, after discussing the questions of law involved, I directed that judgment be entered for the plaintiff in accordance with the above opinion. There was nothing in the statement of claim specifically stating what judgment should be entered in case of finding of the court in any particular way upon the questions involved, and, therefore, I assumed that the exact amount which the plaintiff was entitled to recover would be agreed upon by the parties. As I state, there was no specific statement in this stated case. As to whether or not the plaintiff was entitled to recover anything on the second class of cars discussed in the opinion in this case, I found in favor of the defendant’s contention that, if it unloaded five cars a day, it could not be charged demurrage on any extra cars which happened to be on the interchange track at that time. But an examination of the schedule attached to the stated case, marked Exhibit “C,” giving the date and number of the cars placed on the interchange track during the months of December, February and March, assuming that the plaintiff removed five cars a day, we have, at a dollar a day, just about the plaintiff’s claim of $1,209. I, therefore, find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the $2,-612, admitted to be due, and the $208, which accrued on cars during the time the tracks were flooded, and is not entitled to recover anything for the detention of the cars placed during the months of December, February and March, in which the ore was frozen.</p>
