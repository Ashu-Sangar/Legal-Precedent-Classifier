The plaintiff. Peoples Trust Company of Pittsburgh, opposed the proposed change of name. The Safe Deposit and Trust Company is located in the business center of the City of Pittsburgh in what is popularly known as “old city,” and the Peoples Trust Company is located between Seventeenth and Eighteenth streets, in that portion of the city popularly known as “south side.” The places of business of the plaintiff and defendant are approximately 1.9 miles apart. The sections of the city in which they are respectively located are separated by the Monongahela river.</p>

To this bill the defendants have filed separate demurrers, raising practically the same questions. We find nothing in the bill of complaint which shows or tends to show that the secretary of the Commonwealth has abused the legal discretion vested in him by allowing the change of name. The change of name had been approved by vote of the stockholders and the change was approved by the secretary of the Commonwealth in pursuance of the authority vested in him. We cannot control the legal discretion of an officer to whom is committed the right to approve or disapprove changes of corporate names. It appears from the briefs submitted that under date of December 27,1916, the Peoples Trust Company of Pittsburgh filed its bill in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to No. 2115 January Term, 1917, asking for a decree prohibiting the use of the name the Peoples Savings and-Trust Company of Pittsburgh. The allegations in this bill relating to the change of name and its alleged illegalities are substantially the same as in the bill now before us. Judge Carpenter of the Allegheny County Court dismissed the bill and we are informed that, upon appeal from that decision the decree dismissing the bill was affirmed by the appellate court. Independently of this we are of opinion <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>that we have no jurisdiction to restrain the discretion of the secretary of the Commonwealth under the allegations contained in the bill! We therefore sustain the demurrers and dismiss this bill at the costs of the plaintiff.</p>
