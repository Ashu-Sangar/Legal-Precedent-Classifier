Defendant offered no evidence. The verdict was for plaintiff. Defendant moved for judgment n. o. v. in its favor. On September 18, 1915, defendant was repairing the vessel “Mary Dow,” then lying at its docks at the foot of Mifflin street, in this city. Plaintiff, who for about thirty years had been a ship’s carpenter, at defendant’s direction descended to the keelson of that boat, where he was to work, and his tools were being lowered to him. He saw no other persons working upon the boat, but at least two other men in defendant’s employ (without knowledge that plaintiff was working in the hold of the vessel) were carrying a piece of pipe, about fifteen or sixteen feet in length and about one and a half inch in diameter, from between decks to the upper deck, using the hatchways for that purpose. One of the men released his hold upon the pipe, which caused it to fall through the hatchway, striking plaintiff on the back of the head. The method ordinarily adopted if men were working below the hatchways, was that when weighty objects were to be moved over the hatch, it would be covered or guarded, or some person would give warning by calling to persons below, “Stand from under,” or words to that effect, thereby enabling them to protect themselves from injury. This defendant failed to do. It did not cover the hatchway, either on the upper deck or the between deck; it had no person there to warn plaintiff of the danger; it took no measures to protect him from injury while at work, and, as the result of its <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>failure to do that which was usual under such circumstances, plaintiff has suffered serious and permanent injuries. It is the master’s duty to furnish his servant a reasonably safe place in which to work, and it is equally his duty to warn the servant of any change in conditions, methods or appliances whereby the dangers are increased. This is a direct, personal and absolute duty which the master owes his servant, and nothing but performance can relieve him. It cannot escape from liability for its negligence on the theory that the fellow-servant rule applies. The servant, on the other hand, may assume that the master has done his whole duty in this respect, and it is therefore not bound to exercise an active inspection of the place and appliances: Lillie v.

Defendant’s workmen were engaged in removing debris from the floor immediately above where plaintiff was working. Some of the material which was thrown down the hatchway by a fellow-servant injured plaintiff. Held, that the “failure to direct caution by signal or otherwise” was evidence of negligence; that it was the foreman’s “duty as a vice-principal to guard against the danger incident to such use,” and judgment in favor of plaintiff was affirmed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[277,816,1153,803]]]'>It was defendant’s duty to cover the hatchways or have some person there to warn the workmen so that they might protect themselves against just such a contingency as happened in this case, to wit, the falling of the heavy pipe. Plaintiff was doing that which defendant directed him to do and he had the right to assume that it would, while he was working, give him warning of any danger by reason of his place of employment becoming unsafe. That duty defendant failed to perform. Plaintiff’s injuries have not resulted by reason of any negligence on his part, but solely because defendant failed to furnish him a safe place within which to perform his labor. The case was for the jury and its conclusion was fully justified by the evidence. The motion for judgment non obstante veredicto is overruled.</p>
