    <p class="summary" id="b87-6" data-blocks='[["BL_87.12",87,[112,959,1153,588]]]'>The auditor found that John J. Connelly died on July 3,1913, intestate, leaving to survive Mm his widow, Mary J. Connelly, and two sons by a former wife, aged respectively eleven and thirteen years. He owned a hotel in which the widow and the two sons lived until the widow’s death on October 8, 1916. During this time the widow conducted the hotel, and supported, maintained and fed the two sons. The guardian of the sons claimed $20,800 for the widow.’s use of the hotel. The auditor disallowed the claim. On exceptions Baldwin, P. J., filed the following opinion:</p>

Therefore, her occupancy of the premises in question created no obligation to account to the heirs of the husband for the rental value thereof. Besides, the heirs occupied the premises jointly with her. They were fed, clothed and educated out of the profits of the business which the decedent conducted in the premises. The master’s findings show that the decedent expended in theii^ maintenance and education a sum equal to or in excess of their share <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>of a fair compensation for the use- of the premises or the fair rental value thereof.</p>
