    <p id="ALER" data-blocks='[["BL_329.12",329,[148,1100,1152,1308]]]'>This bill in equity was filed to secure the removal of encroachments upon an alleged public street. The case was heard upon the bill, answer, replication and testimony. The main question was the existence of the street known as South Water street, between Seventeenth and Twenty-sixth streets, Pittsburgh, and that depended largely upon documentary evidence. Many years ago Oliver Ormsby owned the eastern part and John Ormsby the western part of a tract of some 350 acres of land situate on the south bank of the Monongahela river in what is now the City of Pittsburgh. By proceedings in the Orphans’ Court the Oliver Ormsby land was partitioned in 1841, and that of John Ormsby in 1844, and a piece lying between the two, about which there had been some controversy as to the title, was also partitioned later in 1844, as land of the Oliver Ormsby estate. Numerous streets are referred to in the partition proceedings and shown on plots accompanying the same, including Water street represented as of the width of one hundred feet, more or less, and extending to the river. Subsequently much of the property was subdivided and passed by sundry conveyances wherein Water street is referred to and called for as a boundary, and some buildings were erected abutting upon the south line thereof.</p>
    <p id="b330-3" data-blocks='[["BL_330.3",330,[260,333,1156,1840]]]'>
      <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>At the time of the partitions, and for many years thereafter, there was an open coal mine located back from the river on this original tract, from which a railroad extended to the river, where the coal was transferred to boats by means of a coal tipple. This railroad was located in what is now Twenty-first street. There was then a block of lots extending south from the river on the west side of Twenty-first street of the width (east and west) of <em>147y2 </em>feet, known as “the railroad lots,” across which Water street was not extended in the first or second partitions above mentioned. The third partition did not include the railroad lots, but it was between parties who owned all the land embraced in the three partitions and they there stipulated that, “The streets and alleys laid out in the plan of the partition of that part of John Ormsby’s estate which lies above and adjoining Birmingham, and in the plan of the partition of the two hundred-acre tract belonging to the Oliver Ormsby’s estate, have been extended through the piece of land belonging to Oliver Ormsby’s heirs, which is included in this partition, and lies between the two pieces above mentioned.” The map accompanying that partition seems to show Water street extending across the railroad lots. In 1836, a small piece of this tract abutting on the river had been conveyed to Elias Phillips, a son-in-law of Oliver Ormsby, and that was excluded from the partitions. However, Phillips was a party to the third partition and joined in said stipulation, and in a later conveyance of the Phillips land Water street is called for as its northern boundary. In 1865 a petition was presented to the borough council signed by the-owners of that lot and by other property owners praying that the south line of Water street be removed fifty feet northward, which was not granted.</p>
    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[260,2183,1147,208]],["BL_331.1",331,[116,332,1167,1621]]]'>The Borough of East Birmingham, which included this original 350-acre tract, was incorporated in 1849 by an act of the legislature, section 15 of which is: “That the owners of the property known as the railroad lots in <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>said borough at the terminus of the railroad, and their heirs and assigns, shall and may hold and occupy the same to low-water mark in the Monongahela river, and in case any lot? of ground situate on the river fronts of said borough are or may hereafter be. occupied for manufacturing purposes, the owners or occupants of such lot or lots shall have the like right of holding and occupying the same to low-water mark of said river: Provided, That ih all such cases there shall be secured to the public a right of way along the river bank across such lot or lots.” Thereafter Water street is referred to in numerous borough ordinances. One orders earth deposited thereon and others fix the grade of that street. In 1849, at the request of council, R. E. McGowan, a civil engineer, made a complete map of the borough, whereon Water street is shown, extending from Seventeenth street to Twenty-sixth street, of the width of 100 feet, more or less, to low-water line. However, this map, which was not recorded but found among McGowan’s papers, shows the lines of the railroad lots extending . across that street to the river. In 1872, the borough became a part of the City of Pittsburgh and Water street is thereafter referred to in the city ordinances. The city in 1878 granted a franchise to the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Company to construct a line of railway upon and along said street; and later granted additional franchises to railroad companies to construct tracks therein, which was done; and the tracks so constructed have been in constant use upon the street here in question for over thirty years.</p>

Wharves, shops, mills, factories, etc., have been and still are located there, many of which have long encroached upon and still occupy portions of Water street, so called. About 1872 the municipality, pursuant to statutory authority, established wharfage charges, which in 1874 it attempted unsuccessfully to collect from certain parties <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>occupying the wharves. The borough and later the city made some expenditures in the construction and care of those wharves, but Water street was never formally opened as such nor improved upon the ground as a street. However, it has been used more or less by pedestrians since 1847, and some parts of it also by vehicles, largely in transportation to and from the wharves and other establishments above mentioned. A washout near Eighteenth street has for many years prevented the use of that part of Water street, and further east (up the river) it has always been to some extent obstructed by fences and other obstacles, the part most used for teaming being between Nineteenth and Twenty-second streets. The railroads in Water street are constructed largely upon trestles and so far as they occupy space prevent traffic by other vehicles.</p>

The purpose of the stipulation seems to have been to extend the street across and beyond those lots; and, having been made by all the parties in interest, it should be given effect. In the general plotting of the tract, it is not probable that they would desire to make a permanent break in the broad street along the river front, and no such break appears in the plot accompanying the third partition.
