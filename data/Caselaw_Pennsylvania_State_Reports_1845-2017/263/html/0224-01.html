The court below decided against that claim, and from its decree this appeal was taken.

Nor is there a gift to them of the gross rent from which there might be implied a gift of the property out of which the rent issues. This alone would prevent the operation of the rule in Shelley’s Case; for there must be a freehold estate in the first taker, before the rule can operate at all. It is argued, however, that the conclusion stated depends on whether or not the will creates an active trust; for if it be a passive or dry trust, the statute executes the use, and the first taker would have a freehold estate. Assuming this to be so, the same conclusion is reached.</p>

The third paragraph specifies how these rents are to be ascertained, viz: after the payment of “taxes, repairs, etc.” Some one must determine what repairs shall be made, and must pay the expense thereof, and the taxes. The sixth paragraph provides for this by devising the property to the executor as trustee.</p>
    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[167,1503,1152,702]]]'>Moreover, the son and daughters have no definite interest in the rents when ascertained. Under the ninth paragraph, in the contingency there expressed, testatrix’s debts must be first paid out of those net rents before the son and daughters receive any thereof. And even after the debts are paid, neither the son nor the daughters have any fixed proportionate interest in the balance of the net rents. If that balance amounts to seven hundred dollars a year or less, the son gets one-seventh, and each of the daughters three-sevenths thereof. But if that balance exceeds seven hundred dollars a year, the son . gets one hundred dollars thereout and each of the daughters one-half of the remainder.</p>
