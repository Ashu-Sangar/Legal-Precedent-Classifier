The events upon occurrence of which such defeasibility is to operate are contingent events to occur at a future time fixed by the testator ; he unquestionably intended that, if at that future time certain contingencies shall occur, the estate, or one or more shares thereof, shall go to distributees other than a daughter or daughters.” This being the case, appellants are not in a position to claim the income as legatees under their father’s will.</p>

There testator left one-third of his estate in trust during his son’s life, he to be paid the income ; but, by a subsequent provision, these payments were limited to $5,000 per annum, all over that amount to be accumulated and added to principal, and, at the death of the son, such principal, with the accumulation, to go to the latter’s children and their heirs. Afterwards by a codicil, these grandchildren were substituted in their father’s place as payees of the income. It was held (p. 439) that “even conceding accumulation was part of the [testamentary] scheme,” the trust must continue pur autre vie (i. e. for the life of the son) and, in the meantime, the released, illegally accumulated, income should go to those for whom it unquestionably was eventually intended — the son’s children; but it will be noted that the equitable limitation was to such children and their heirs, with no limitation over on default of heirs. Hence, in that case (with the direction that brought about the illegal accumulation stricken out), the children, respectively, were vested with an immediate interest in their shares of the trust estate, which, pending the time for ultimate distribution, was not liable to defeat by any contingency; and this drew to it the released income. All of which is quite different from the case at bar.</p>

As a consequence, until the date for final distribution of the principal arrives, all testator’s children will share such income, as those entitled at law; for, as already noted, no one is in a position to lay claim thereto under the will. In so ruling, the court below did not err: see Rhodes’s Est., ,<a href="/pa/147/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="147 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="829834" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0227-01">147 Pa. 227</a>,231,232.</p>

In doing this, it may aid to recite anew the seventh item of the will, eliminating all phraseology found therein which is not necessary to an understanding of the immediate point under discussion, and placing all references to accumulations in parentheses, so, for present purposes, the latter may be treated as stricken out. When the will is thus read, it will appear that testator, after directing the conversion of his residuary estate into money, vesting his executor with power of sale over real estate, and authorizing the latter to retain such personal securities-as in its “judgment” might be deemed safe, provides that the fund shall “be invested by my said executor at interest on bond and mortgage, or in such corporate bonds or securities as may be approved of by my said executor”; then,-that all “proceeds” of sales and “securities approved of as safe” (“and all accumulations thereon”) are “to be held in trust for the following uses and purposes”: First, to pay out of such income, to each daughter, “for a period of five years, the sum of $2,000 per annum in quarterly payments.” Next, “at the expiration of five years” after testator’s death, to pay to each of his daughters the sum of $10,000. Finally, he provides, “at the expiration of fifteen years after my decease I direct that the remainder of my estate (including all the accumulations of interest and income <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>•whatsoever) shall be divided and distributed equally among my three daughters, but in case either of my said daughters shall die without leaving lawful issue then living, prior to the date of this distribution, then her-share shall go to her sisters, and the issue then living of any daughter who may have died prior thereto- shall take his or her mother’s share.”</p>

To again quote from the opinion of the court belów, “The estate being personalty, the only way that he could insure the carrying out of this purpose [the distribution of principal, fifteen years after testator’s death] was to have the estate held in trust, and withhold it from his beneficiaries until it shall be determined, by the occurrence of the events to which the will refers, who shall become entitled to receive it”; and the fact that the executor is not termed a trustee makes no material difference in this regard: see Sheets’s Est., <a href="/pa/52/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="52 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1002227" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0257-01">52 Pa. 257</a>, 266.</p>

This is sufficient to create a valid subsisting trust, which the court would hesitate to disturb, even at the instance of all parties in interest; and which could not be set aside when, as here, those so requesting may not, when the time comes for final distribution, be the ones entitled to participate therein.
