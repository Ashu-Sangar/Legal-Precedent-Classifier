Peoples Bros., <a href="/pa/249/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="249 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1013577" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0335-01">249 Pa. 335</a>, 338) that the defendant is entitled to the affirmance of a. point to the effect that the jury must find the injury was “wantonly and intentionally” inflicted, yet, in that case, those terms are used in the sense just stated ; this is consistent with the other cases hereinbefore cited.</p>
    <p id="b568-6" data-blocks='[["BL_568.6",568,[270,2297,1147,98]],["BL_569.1",569,[161,342,1154,1242]]]'>The trial judge, against the objection of plaintiff, allowed the introduction of evidence by defendant that its <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>brakemen were directed, when they saw train riders, to notify the conductors, whose duty it was to wire ahead to the next station for an officer to take off such trespassers <em>; </em>and, apparently based on this testimony, the judge instructed the jurors that, unless they could find from the evidence “it was within the scope of such brakeman’s employment and duty to eject a trespasser, then there may be no recovery,” .for “such brakeman would not be acting in the scope of. his authority.” He further instructed, and reiterated several times, that, before plaintiff could recover, he must satisfy the jury “deféndant’s employee wilfully and with gross negligence caused the boy’s injuries by recklessly driving him from the train.” When these admissions of evidence and instructions are tested by our recent decisions, it.is plain they transgress the rulings there made. In cases of this character, involving alleged negligence towards children trespassers of tender years, the test is neither reckless conduct nor gross negligence, but lack of due care under the circumstances. In determining whether an employee acted in the course of his employment, the duties involved in the general scope of such employment are the criteria, and privately imparted orders limiting those duties have no bearing.</p>
    <p id="b569-3" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[162,1592,1153,807]],["BL_570.1",570,[256,337,1152,365]]]'>The substantial issue in this case is, was plaintiff injured through being either forced or scared from a moving train by a servant of defendant, the latter acting within the general scope of. his employment and in furtherance of his master’s business; or was this child hurt while attempting to board a moving train? A reading of the printed testimony conveys the impression that the weight of the evidence decidedly favors defendant’s contention that the accident happened in the way last mentioned, and the trial judge, who saw and heard the'witnesses, evidently was strongly so impressed. If, upon a rehearing of the cause, plaintiff recovers a verdict, and the court below again takes a like view, amounting to a conviction, that tribunal has a remedy at hand, by granting a new trial, which it should not <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>hesitate to apply (Maloy v. Rosenbaum, <a href="/pa/260/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="260 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="1040253" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0466-01">260 Pa. 466</a>, 472; Hewitt v.

Our duty is simply to decide the points of law presented by the assignments of error; and these, on the present record, we must determine in plaintiff’s favor.</p>
