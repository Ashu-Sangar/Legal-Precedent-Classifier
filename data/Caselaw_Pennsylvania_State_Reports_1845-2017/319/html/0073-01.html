This agreement was submitted for approval of the stockholders of each of the constitutent companies at a meeting held for that purpose on March 30, 1931. Rebecca Wenger did not attend this meeting in person, but gave a proxy to vote her stock at that meeting, granting to her proxy “full power and authority to act for [her] and ... to vote upon the adoption or rejection of a joint agreement of merger . . . and the transaction of all such other business as may come before the said meeting, as fully and effectively as [she] could do if personally present. . . .” Her proxy attended the meeting and voted in favor of the merger agreement.</p>

Her request for withdrawal was not <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>acted on by the association, although it was endorsed by the secretary’s clerk “Withdrawal” on January 27,1932.

L. 73, section 37, which provides that any stockholder in a building and loan association shall have power to withdraw from the association. The precise question is whether shareholders may waive for a limited time the right given by this statute. Appellant contends the statute contains a declaration of public policy and is such that the persons for whom the benefit was created cannot waive it by voluntary act or otherwise. See Bosler v. Rheem, <a href="/pa/72/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="72 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="434783" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0054-01">72 Pa. 54</a>; Firmstone v.

Whether the act in question contains a declaration of public policy or sets up a contractual right in the shareholder need not be discussed. Every statute based upon public policy does not impose on the person benefited an unalterable status as to the benefit conferred or the rights protected which cannot be modified, changed or waived by acts or agreements of the parties. The right therein granted is not so important as to command the general interest of the body politic as a whole and is of interest to but a class thereof. “Statutes grounded on public policy are those which forbid acts having a tendency to be injurious to the public good. The prime question is whether the thing forbidden is inimical to the public interest. Where public policy requires the observance of a statute, it cannot be waived by an individual or denied effect by the courts since the integrity of the rule expressed by the legislature is necessary for the common welfare. However, acts of assembly are not always based on the theory that the subject-matter legislated on is based on public policy or general public good in the sense that these terms are understood. . . . Where the provisions of an act are regulative or the law is made for the protection of a given class, it cannot always be said to be an act grounded on public policy as that term is understood”: <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>McCurdy’s Est., <a href="/pa/303/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="303 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="1130088" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0453-01">303 Pa. 453</a>, 461. Examples of statutes passed for the protection of individuals or classes of individuals not intimately bound up with the common welfare and which may, therefore, be waived by the parties are numerous. The statutes of limitations (Smith v. P. R. R., <a href="/pa/304/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="304 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="1132433" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0294-01">304 Pa. 294</a>), others providing for exemption from execution (Bowman v.

It was not until the Act of April 12, 1859, P. L. 544, that any right of withdrawal was provided for in the statutes of this State. This right was later carried over to the Act of April 29, 1874, supra, and now appears in the Building and Loan Code of May 5,1933, P. L. 457, section 612; see Judge Keller’s opinion in Morris Resnick B. &amp; L. Assn. v. Barnes, <a href="/pa-super/108/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="108 Pa.

Super. 218" data-case-ids="706348" data-case-paths="/pa-super/108/0218-01">supra.</a> This, the appellant contends, was the true effect of her withdrawal notice (see Savitz B. &amp; L. Assn. v. Lissman, <a href="/pa-super/101/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="101 Pa. Super. 501" data-case-ids="692879" data-case-paths="/pa-super/101/0501-01">101 Pa. Superior Ct. 501</a>). Appellant gave no express direction to so apply her stock, but relies on her notice of withdrawal as implying a request to pay off her note and credit her with the difference in the value of her shares. But if her withdrawal by implication included an appropriation, then the provision in the merger agreement prohibiting withdrawals equally, by implication, prohibited appropriations; and if the withdrawal did not include an appropriation, she has never requested that the shares be applied to the payment of her debt. The appropriation of the value of the shares of a borrowing member to the payment of the loan is as much a withdrawal of the shares as the ordinary form of withdrawal in the case of a non-borrower. The Act of April 10, 1879, supra, and the cases above cited merely eliminated the requirement that the borrower first pay his debt and then receive the withdrawal value of his share. An appropriation is a form of withdrawal and is within the merger agreement assented to by the appellant <em>herein; </em>if this were not so, the effect would be to place the entire burden resulting from the suspension of withdrawals upon nonborrowing members and thus place those indebted to the association in a preferred position. In view of the later insolvency of the association, she will not be allowed to take advantage of any preference obtained through an appropriation on the books of the association to the serious detriment of the re<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>maining members.
