A different debt maximum was provided for municipalities in article IX, section 8, still, however, adhering to the rule of “pay as you go,” subject to the specifically allowed exceptions. The word “debt,” as used in the limitation on municipalities, has frequently come before the court for consideration, and the meaning suggested in the first case, coming up after the adoption of the Constitution, has been followed since, and is the meaning attributed to the word by most, if not all, of the states in which the question has arisen (See Dillon, Municipal Corporations, Chapter VI, sections 193-5; McQuillen, Municipal Corporations, sections 2378, 2379; note (1934), <a href="/citations/?q=92%20A.L.R.%201299" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="92 A.L.R. 1299">92 A.

There is one, however, which we notice because of its general pertinency. In Dillon on Municipal Corporations, section 88, the learned author cites an Iowa case, involving the validity of a contract by a city for a supply of water, in which it is said: ‘When a contract made by a municipal corporation pertains to its ordinary expenses, and is, together with other like expenses, within the limit of its current revenues and such special taxes as it may legally and in good faith intend to levy therefor, such contract does not constitute the “incurring of indebtedness” within the meaning of the constitutional provision limiting the power of municipal corporations to contract debts.’ This, we hesitate not to say, is a sound constitutional interpretation, and in a similar case might well be adopted in the construction of our own Constitution. If the contracts and engagements of municipal corporations do not overreach their current revenues, no objections can lawfully be made to them, however great the indebtedness of such municipalities may be; for in such case their engagements do not extend beyond their present means of payment, and so no debt is created.” This has since become the rule of decision.

Union Trust Co., <a href="/pa/293/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="293 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="1111164" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0364-01">293 Pa. 364</a>, 371 et seq. and cases there cited; Scranton Electric Co. v.

Scranton, <a href="/pa/200/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="200 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="924409" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0130-01">200 Pa. 130</a>, 133, that the word “debt” in section 4 is used in a still more limited and technical sense than in section 8 restricting action by municipalities; certainly if a municipal obligation payable out of current revenues is not a debt within section 8, tax anticipation notes payable from current revenues levied and assessed are not within the prohibition of section 4. The section is a restriction or limitation on the power of the legislature to borrow money with the exceptions clearly stated in the section (see Montgomery v. Martin, <a href="/pa/294/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="294 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1113394" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0025-01">294 Pa. 25</a>, 34). Payment of the debt created by <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>the borrowing (as well as the debt existing when the Constitution was adopted) is provided for by-section 11 of article IX, through the sinking fund and annual payments of not less than $250,000. The prohibited mischief was the accumulation of a state debt (subject to the $1,000,000 lee-way for deficiency in revenue) by expenditures in excess of current biennial revenue. Unless a challenged debt is within that prohibition, it is permitted. The creation of these notes for payment out of current revenue adds nothing to the state debt<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> as defined. The proceeds, by the terms of the act, will enable the Commonwealth to make prompt payment of its obligations and thus avoid conducting the government on credit until the taxes are received. The act merely provides a method of obtaining ready money in exchange for obligations not yet collectible from taxables. It substitutes one creditor, the note holder, for another, the person to whom the Commonwealth must pay. No contention is made that the act is unreasonable, and therefore prohibited by section 4, on the ground that the total amount of the anticipatory notes is so large in its relation to the contemplated receipts from the taxing laws as to be condemned as a palpable subterfuge.</p>

    <p id="b101-3" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[180,840,1155,1356]]]'>When legislation provides for the levy and collection of current revenues, assets are created, though the exact amount receivable may not be determinable in advance. The Act of 1935 refers to statutes providing for present taxation. As these taxes, though due, are not collectible at the moment, but only after lapse of time, it may be that, in the near future, to conduct the affairs of the government, money not in hand will be necessary, and that, later in the fiscal period, more will be available than is then required. As we understand it, the legislature intended to provide for that contingency in the emergency referred to in the act. The solution of the problem involved immediate borrowing of money to be repaid out of current revenues when received, the money borrowed meanwhile being used for the purposes specified in the appropriation laws. In that light it cannot be said that the debt of the State is increased within the terms of article IX, section 4,- any more than the same thing can be said of municipal borrowing against current revenue. There is a mere exchange of one obligation for another. The total debt of the State is not increased. If such borrowing by the State is held to be a debt within section 4, we shall be overruling the cases dealing with the word “debt” in section 8 permitting municipalities to do what the State now proposes to do.</p>
