Shenk also knew prior to the execution of its contract that separate contracts must be let for the omitted portions of the completed structure. They knew the additional contracts must be approved by the court, and that later the court might disapprove them. Informal conversations were had with the judges to adjust the stone problem. Their contract contained no provision in relation to these contracts, nor the time when they would be let. Shenk’s understanding as to letting later contracts was gathered from the general intent of the project with the plans and specifications therefor. Shenk claimed it was delayed twenty-four weeks on account of the letting of this contract. These incidents and others to be noted have an important bearing on the county’s responsibility.</p>

The general contract was let in October, 1928, and Shenk states that he was ready for the facing stone the following March. There was nothing in his contract that required him to wait for the facing; it was entirely possible for the backing to have been put up with the facing to follow. But Shenk states that the architect issued instructions not to erect the backing until the facing stone was in place. He wanted both to <em>go </em>up together. There was no protest by Shenk as to these instructions, and no doubt they were proper. But this was an “act of the architect.” The contract for facing was let early in April and approved by the court two weeks later. There was no shipment of stone until early in July. Shenk was thus “delayed ... in the progress of the work by [the] act of . . . another contractor.” It took the facing contractor eleven months to complete his job, or until July, 1980. This was because an insufficient number of men were employed by the stone erector. Here again we have the ele<a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>ment of delay by “another contractor.” A simple statement of these facts will show that from April, 1929, to July, 1930, the incident of delay comes under the very terms of the provision in article 18. The owner took no affirmative steps to cause it. Nothing was done outside of the contract for construction. The stone facing contract was let to a responsible bidder, and was approved by the court. No delay can be conceived of in the progress of the work that will more clearly come within the provision in article 18 covering this sort of a delay.</p>

Because they were not in place it is claimed that the rubber flooring was delayed as the rubber must be fitted around the equipment resting on the floors. Also, in a few instances, marble was to be attached. For this delay Shenk charged the wages paid to some of his skeleton organization. Why this was permitted is not clear for Shenk says the work of flooring and fitting was the work of subcontractors and the only thing he did was to have his foreman occasionally supervise the work. If there was a loss by this delay, it was the loss of the subcontractors. But, as we view the situation, there was no delay in this work separate and distinct from the delay in the stone work just discussed and other delays that will be mentioned.</p>
    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[258,1763,1150,589]]]'>The equipment contract was let in January, 1930. Had this contractor been prompt in delivering his material it would have been on the ground in time. The first shipment came about the time the stone contract was finished, July, 1930; that would be the correct time as the work was then progressing. Meanwhile there was nothing to delay the contractor from working inside the old building, placing the flooring wherever required, but the architect instructed them not to lay the floor until the filing equipment was in place. The laying of floors is usually the last work on any job of this character.</p>

Appellee claimed that the Avork did not proceed as rapidly as it could. It took eleven months to complete the work when five months were ample. There were delays in redesigning the structural steel. Also in changing certain work from stucco to stone, and the plumber delayed the job because he did not have sufficient men on hand. These “delays were quite considerable” and were “concurrent” with the main delays. Then Shenk had a large amount of extra work, totaling over $50,000. These caused some delay. Manifestly there was no divisable' delay that could be fairly attributed to a delay in letting these two contracts.

In other words, plaintiff admitted that he could have put his men at work some place else or have procured others and he should have done one or the other and not load a bill of $18,000 on the county for wages, etc.</p>

To erect or repair it required not only the action of the commissioners, but also that of the court. The county could not proceed until the court approved the plans and specifications as well as the contract. There was delay in letting the contract, which was due, in a very large part, to the delay of the court in approving the materials that went into the building. The act of the county commissioners as well as that of the court was in the exercise of governmental functions. An adequate courthouse is necessary for the proper conduct of business of the county, not only with respect to what might be called “court business” but also all the various branches of government or county business located therein, as for instance the county treasurer, recorder of deeds, county controller, etc. Any delay that took place was the delay of the officers in the performance of governmental functions and any neglect was the neglect of such officers.</p>

The statutes not only contemplate such buildings, but provide and command their erection when necessary.

Thebe are sundry acts in connection with building and other operations, the negligent performance of which would impose this liability, and for which the county would have to respond in damages, but the damages resulting from the neglect or failure of the county officers, the court and the county commissioners to let the two contracts promptly, cannot be visited on the county. The neglect was the neglect of the officers to perform a public function, so that whatever damages resulted from October to March, and this record shows but little, if any, the county cannot be held liable therefor.</p>

The contract was let on the mistaken assumption that this had been done. The officers whose duty it was to procure it could have been compelled to do so. It was a mere ministerial act. If the price for land was too high, they could have proceeded by condemnation to secure the land. The contractor moved heavy equipment on the ground and waited daily to begin work while the city secured the land. The loss recovered was for the increased cost in labor, rent, etc. Here the act required consideration, approval and judgment of two bodies, the commissioners and the court. They could not be compelled to act, and this circumstance was known to the contractor, as it was to overyone, when he executed his contract. The difference between the Sheehan Case and the present case is obvious.</p>
