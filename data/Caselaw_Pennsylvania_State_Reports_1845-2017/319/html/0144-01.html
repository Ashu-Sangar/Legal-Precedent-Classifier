During the six months ending July 6, 1929, the company had lost $483,743. Between July 6th and October 5th a profit of about $48,000 was made. What was not foreseen was that from October to the end of December the Company would lose about $90,000.

The banks loaned $2,750,000. The Company repaid its existing bank loans, with interest, aggregating $2,668,901.14. The business was conducted until the following March 11, 1930, when, in consequence of the Company’s condition then appearing, the manager began liquidating the security in the interest of the banks as authorized by the agreement. There is no evidence that defendant participated in any manner in the administration of the agreement beyond- contributing its proportion of the new loan and receiving payment on account from time to time. The manager was not an officer or employee of the defendant corporation.

This liquidation was about completed, when, on June 17,1930, receivers were appointed by the United States District Court on a bondholders’ bill filed June 7, 1930, default having been made in the payment of interest due June 1, 1930. When the receivers took charge they found that substantially the only assets remaining were the land and buildings, machinery and equipment covered by the lien of the mortgage. During the receivership, the mortgage was foreclosed. On May 6, 1930, the appellant Bondholders’ Protective Committee was formed and received deposits of $1,249,500 bonds with coupons due June 1, 1930. The mortgaged property was sold in foreclosure to the committee’s agent for $226,000 in April, 1931.

This waiver was executed by defendant’s predecessor in the course of a transaction then consummated “for the purpose of providing for the enlargement and economical conduct of Fleisher’s business.” Three years later, when the loan agreement of 1929 was executed, the current assets were less than $500,000 in excess of current liabilities, constituting a default in that respect, though one which the trustee was expressly authorized to waive. The mortgage also provided : “The trustee shall not be required to take notice of any default hereunder unless specifically notified in writing of such default by the holders of at least twenty-five per cent (25%) in amount of the bonds then outstanding, and, until so notified, the trustee may assume that no default has happened. . . . ” It also provides: “The trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment or the exercise of its discretion hereunder; . . .

The exercise of this right was absolute and was not limited to periods when there was no default, always assuming that no steps to enforce the mortgage were in process.

The Company was solvent and, judging by the business of the immediately preceding-three months, was making money. Defendant’s debt ivas relatively small compared with the total bank loans, and with the bonded debt; it joined in the agreement in which an independent manager was appointed to receive the pledge of the Company’s assets and to see that the Company’s business was properly conducted, and, if necessary, to liquidate the collateral. If we assume, in the light of the subsequent events requiring liquidation, that nothing was gained by operating- under the agreement that would not have been realized by liquidating its business in October, we have not advanced in the solution of the problem presented by the record. On October 5th the books showed a net worth of $2,363,551.58 after allowing for payment of all creditors including bondholders, with current assets $327,765.03 in excess of current liabilities. There had been no default in the payment of interest on the bonds, and the only default (in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities), once waived, was one which the trustee was expressly authorized again to waive. What would prudent business men in like circumstances have done? Would they have closed the plant and liquidated? Or, in view of its solvency, and the profitable turn in its business in the preceding three months, would they have attempted to continue?</p>

The Company’s representations, contained in the agreement, and their intended effect, have been referred to above. In addition, it appears that one of the depositing- bondholders was a member of the board of directors of the Company when the agreement came up for action by the board before it <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>was adopted and was executed; he voted in favor of it. Certainly the approving action of a director of the Company who was also a bondholder, familiar with the facts set forth and the transaction provided for, is of importance in now determining whether this evidence should be submitted to a jury to determine whether defendant erred in taking the same view and, by so doing, became, as appellants charge, a fraudulent conspirator. In addition, Behr, a witness, also a member of the board of directors, testified that while he held neither stock nor bonds, he was probably “put on the board as a watch dog for the bondholders.” This witness was connected with the banking firm (Dillon, Reed <em>&amp; </em>Company) that originally marketed the bonds for the Company. He testified: “While I was on there because of the .fact that our firm sold the bonds, naturally as a director of the corporation I had an interest in its general welfare.” He informed the members of his firm of the transaction. There is no suggestion in the record that these members of the board acted otherwise than for the best interest of all parties concerned in the enterprise; they were not connected with defendant.) their knowledge and their participation (though Behr, of Dillon, Reed <em>&amp; </em>Company, did not vote on the resolution) must be taken as evidence supporting the wisdom of the transaction in the light of the circumstances appearing at the time to parties whose interests may be said to have been measurably opposed to the defendant’s interest as a loan creditor.</p>

The mortgage provided that the trustee need take no notice “of any default hereunder unless specifically notified in writing of such default by the holders of at least twenty-five per cent (25%) in amounts of the bonds then outstanding, and, until so notified, the . trustee may assume that no default has happened.” No such notice had <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>been given by or on behalf of the bondholders. The only <em>existing </em>default <em>was one that </em>the trustee was authorized to waive. The mortgage contained no provision for keeping the trustee advised of the names and addresses of the bondholders. While it is perhaps generally possible for a trustee with little trouble to acquire such information, the failure to do so and to notify the bondholders of the execution of the agreement will not sustain the charge of breach of trust, made against the defendant. As has been stated, two directors of the Company, one a bondholder, and the other “the watchdog for the bondholders,” were advised of the negotiations for the agreement and of the corporate proceedings authorizing its execution.</p>

The relation of bank and customer began before defendant became trustee by the merger with the Guarantee Trust and Safe Deposit Company. There is nothing in the evidence that would justify our concluding that defendant’s receiving payment of loans, in the circumstances described above, was a breach of trust. See Conover v. Guarantee Trust Co., <a href="/nj-eq/88/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="88 N.J. Eq. 450" data-case-ids="153841" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/88/0450-01">88 N. J.

If the record had shown that the Company was insolvent when the agreement was made, and the trustee knew or should have known the fact, a different question would be presented. Appellants also contend that by the agreement the bondholders were deprived of a right, to which they were entitled, to participate pro rata with the bank creditors in the funds distributed by the manager, and that defendant should have procured for them the right so to participate by instituting insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings básed on the agreement, and that this omission constituted a breach of trust. As we were informed at the argument that litigation on the subject is pending against the manager, we refrain from discussing it further than to remark that, for the purpose of determining whether the evidence should have been submitted to the jury, it is sufficient to say that the evi<a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>dence shows that the Company was solvent at the time and that apparently the bonds were amply secured.</p>
