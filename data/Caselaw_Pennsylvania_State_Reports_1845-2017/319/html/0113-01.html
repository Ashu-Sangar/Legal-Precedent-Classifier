The Anthracite Trust Company occupied quarters leased from appellants by lease made January 1, 1927, for a term of thirty years at an annual rental of $27,000 (subject to adjustment by provisions not now material) payable in advance at the monthly rate of $2,250. The lease contained no provision attempting to liquidate damages for default. When the receiver took possession, no rent was in arrear, payment to the end of September having been made. At the end of six months, the receiver surrendered possession pursuant to notice of disaffirmance given by him December 29, 1931.</p>

That statute has no application to the questions presented. It relates to matters of distribution and does not prevent set-off of a claim against the insolvent bank, if due when the receiver took possession: Thacher’s Est., <a href="/pa/311/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="311 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1146211" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0278-01">311 Pa. 278</a>, 282, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20873" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="166 A. 873">166 A. 873</a>; Fisher v.

The court was right in allowing the claim of $13,500 for use and occupation from October 1, 1931, to March 31, 1932. Appellants contend that the court should have gone further and ordered the receiver to pay that sum in cash. The distribution is, however, governed by equitable principles and, as the appellants were indebted to the bank in a sum largely in excess of $13,500, at the time the receiver took charge (if the set-off for loss of future <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>rental is not allowed), equity will not require the payment of the receivership expense of $13,500 to the appellants with one hand and taking it back from them with the other for the purpose of crediting it on their notes. Equity will at once credit it without going through the formality of payment and repayment: Davis v.

When the receiver took charge, the assets of the trust company became trust property to be administered for the benefit of creditors and stockholders, preferential distribution to be made according to the statute. .If, when he took charge, there came into his hands as an asset a claim against another who, at the same time, had a matured claim against the trust company equal to or less in amount than the trust company’s claim, the asset received by the receiver was, in fact, only the excess over the claim against him, or none at all, if the claims were equal: Fisher v. Davis, supra, 132. But it has long been settled that “a party whose debt is not due, has no equitable claim to have it set off against a debt of his own already due, in the hands <em>of </em>a party” whose insolvency is declared,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> “for all creditors have the right to share equally in the assets.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On the other hand, a party whose <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>claim has matured when insolvency is declared, may set it off against his own obligation to the insolvent, maturing after an assignment for creditors,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> or after the insolvent’s death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Joint claimants may agree that separate claims against them may be set off.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The claim for future loss of rental was computed at $130,-569.07; counsel for the receiver did not contest the reasonableness of these figures and accepted them for the purposes of this proceeding. The claim to set-off must be denied as not within the rule for many years applied in this State, forbidding set off of an insolvent’s unmatured <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>obligations. When the receiver rejected the lease, as he was authorized to do, his disaffirmance related back to the inception of the receivership. But the time of performance of the tenant’s covenants was not accelerated; any resulting damage remained a claim on obligations due in the future. The insolvency did not mature, or render presently payable, obligations by their terms to be paid in the future; nor was their maturity advanced by the fact that suit might be brought for anticipatory breach, if the contract be assumed to be in the class allowing such suits: Restatement, Contracts, sections 318, 338; McGraw v.

Y. 223</a>, 230, stated the reason as follows: “I think the principle to which we should adhere is this: When a party asks to have set-off against a demand upon him held by an assignee for the benefit of creditors, a claim against the insolvent estate, it will be allowed, provided his was a claim upon the <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>estate due when the assignment was made; upon the ground that, by reason of the existence of cross-demands at the time of the assignment, which were due (or might have become due at the creditor’s election), an equitable adjustment by set-off is made without interfering with the equities of others. But after the estate has passed to an assignee upon a trust to hold for and to distribute among creditors, the former and natural equity disappears in superior equities vesting in the general body of creditors. They are then interested in having equality of distribution, and if a creditor who, when the assignment was made, had no right to any offset, may be allowed it afterwards, he gains a preference. By the intervention of the rights of third persons, under the assignment, the equities change with the change in the situation of the original parties; to the misfortune of the creditor holding the demand against the insolvent estate, but, nevertheless, in accordance with equitable principles, as I deduce them from the decisions.”</p>
