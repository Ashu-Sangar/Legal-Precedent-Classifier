Blasting during the construction is alleged to have caused damage to abutting property.

A petition for a board of view was filed in Common Pleas No. 1 by the owner of certain property on South 8th Street; in Common Pleas No. 5, by the owner of property at the northeast corner of Broad and Master Streets; and in Common Pleas No. 2, by the owner of property on North 8th Street. Common Pleas Nos. 1 and 5 appointed boards of view; Common Pleas No. 2 dismissed the petition on the ground that there was no statute providing for viewers in such case. The two boards filed reports making awards of compensation. The city filed exceptions; when they were dismissed, appeals were taken to the Superior Court. From the refusal of Common Pleas No. 2 to appoint viewers, the petitioner appealed to the Superior Court. The three appeals were disposed of by affirming the action of courts Nos. 1 and 5 and reversing that of Common Pleas No. 2. Leave was then granted to the city to appeal to this court.</p>

L. 75, section 1, amended June 12, 1893, P. L. 459. They also refer to the Act of May 28, 1913, P. L. 368, containing substantially the same words; and to the Act of June 23, 1911, P.

Both Common Pleas No. 1 and No. 5 thought that the cases were within the Act of 1891, and that, in addition, the scope of the Transit Act of 1913 implied a remedy by viewers.

Schenley, <em><a href="/pa/204/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="204 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="927567" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0572-01">204 </a></em><a href="/pa/204/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="204 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="927567" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0572-01">Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/204/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="204 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="927567" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0572-01">572</a>, </em>already cited, the act adopted <em>no </em>new rule but merely accepted the law as it stood.” In the Howell Case, viewers had been appointed to assess damages resulting from the vacation of part of a street in the Borough of Morrisville in Bucks County. On the trial of an appeal from the report of the viewers, the borough contended that there was no legislative provision for the recovery of damages resulting from the vacation of a street. The court below held that the Act of 1891, P. L. 75, so provided, since vacation of streets was included in its provisions. This was reversed; it was said that for injury resulting from the vacation of streets, there was no right of action because vacation is not a taking and that unless the legislature had provided it, as was done, for example, for the vacation of streets in the City of Philadelphia, there was no right <em>to </em>recover; that the Act of 1891 did not give such right to damages in cases where the light did not already exist, although providing procedure applicable to cases where present or future statutes gave such right.</p>

The Stork Case grew out of work done pursuant to a city ordinance passed March 17, 1894; Ordinances, 1894, page 52, Some idea of its scope can be obtained from its title: “To authorize the work necessary to abolish all grade crossings on Pennsylvania Avenue and Noble Street, between the east side of Thirteenth Street and Poplar Street, in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Wards, by depressing the tracks and yards of the Philadelphia and Beading Railroad Company on Pennsylvania Avenue, between Broad Street and Thirtieth Street; providing for alterations in the lines and grades of its tracks and yards between the north side of Noble Street and Callowhill Street, and between Broad Street and Eleventh Street; and alterations in the lines and grades of the tracks of the Philadelphia and Beading Terminal Railroad Company east of Broad Street, between Noble Street and Carlton Street; to authorize the revision of lines and grades of streets, and otherwise provide for said constructions and all matters incident thereto; and providing for the carrying into effect such authority and certain conditions.” It provided for changes in street lines, widening streets and changes of street grades in a large area of the city, and was therefore directly within the terms of the Act of 1891, P. L. 75, providing a remedy by viewers. In the section of that improvement nearest Fairmount Park, a subway or tunnel was constructed for the relocation of railway tracks theretofore laid on the surface. Farther east, the tracks were in an open cut. At the intersection of 18th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue (Stork’s property fronted on 18th Street near the avenue), there was a change of grade of Pennsylvania Avenue resulting from its depression for the purpose of separating the existing grade crossing of 18th Street and the railway on the avenue. Property owners affected by this change in the surface grade of the avenue were of course directly within the change of grade provisions of the statute. But the decision is not author<a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>ity for, and did not discuss, the proposition that the statute provided a remedy by viewers for damages resulting from the construction of a subway or tunnel under the surface of a street where there was no change of grade in front of the abutter’s property.</p>

Indeed, the rule has been more broadly stated as follows: Un all doubtful matters and where the expression is in general terms, statutes are to receive such construction as may be agreeable to the rules of the common law in cases of that nature, for statutes are not presumed to make any alteration in the common law farther or otherwise than the act expressly declares; therefore, in all general matters, the law presumed the act did not intend to make any alteration, for if the legislature had had that design they would have expressed it in the act’: Pettit v.

L. 1123, establishing in each county a board of viewers from which viewers are selected for particular cases as required from time to time. The property owners in their brief select the word “altering” in section 5 (amended April 30, 1929, P. L. 866) of this act, and say it includes the construction of a tunnel or subway in a street. “The general purpose of the statute,” we said in Reber’s Petition, <a href="/pa/235/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="235 Pa. 622" data-case-ids="984868" data-case-paths="/pa/235/0622-01">235 Pa. 622</a>, at 627, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20587" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="84 A. 587">84 A. 587</a>, “was to create in each county a Board of Viewers from whose members a selection is to be made, to act as viewers and juries in particular cases.” At 629: “The chief purpose of the statute was to provide a competent and efficient piece of machinery, which when once in operation could be made available by any authority having need for its services. Once established, the membership of the Board of Viewers is to be at the service of any Court or Judge who may find it necessary to appoint viewers.” This statute did not pretend to furnish a remedy by viewers where none existed before. While the word “altering” appears in section 5, the meaning of the provision is that if, in a proper case, a petition for viewers is presented asking for viewers “for the purpose of viewing, laying out, opening, grading, altering, widening, vacating or constructing . . .,” etc., the viewers shall be chosen from the board. No right to a remedy by viewers is given to parties who had none before.</p>
