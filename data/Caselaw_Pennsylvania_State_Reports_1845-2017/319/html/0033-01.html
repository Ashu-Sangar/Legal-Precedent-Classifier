Eeinbold, situate in East Hanover Township, Lebanon County, and containing 517 acres and 37 perches of land.

Some four months later, and while the motion for a new trial was pending and undetermined, the Commonwealth, through its department of property and supplies, filed a petition for leave to discontinue the condemnation proceedings.

It is not necessary, on this appeal, to consider the differing statutes, but those interested in that subject will find the decisions of the several states construing their relevant statutes, set forth at some length in a note to the case of Cunningham v. Memphis R. R. Terminal Co., 30 Am. &amp; Eng. Annotated Cases 1062, where, before dealing with the varying rules in the separate jurisdictions, it is stated that: “In the absence of a statute fixing the time within which a discontinuance may be had, the general rule is unquestioned that an eminent domain proceeding may be discontinued at any time before the rights of the parties have become reciprocally vested.”</p>

Freeholders of Hudson, <a href="/njl/41/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="41 N.J.L. 161" data-case-ids="357544" data-case-paths="/njl/41/0161-01">41 N. J. L. 161</a>, 172, 173, where, in an opinion by Chief Justice Beasley of the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey, it is said that “whenever land is sought to be taken for a public purpose, the public authorities, in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary, have a reasonable time given them, after the ascertainment of the expense of the scheme, to decide whether to accept or refuse the land at the price fixed. On every account [he says] that rule commends itself to my judgment. With respect to the landowner, the procedure is fair and <em>just; </em>it calls for a reasonable <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>valuation of Ms land, and if the public reject it at such estimation, he suffers, in general, no detriment, and if, in any exceptional case, any injury is done him, he is entitled to reparation. On the other side, the rule in question is a necessity, in view of the rational conduct of public affairs: the question whether a projected improvement is wise or unwise, expedient or inexpedient, cannot be answered by any one who is ignorant of the expense that it involves, and therefore to require public agents, in handling these matters, to disregard this plain dictate of common sense, would be altogether absurd. A man of prudence relinquishes a project when he finds the cost is likely to exceed, in large measure, its benefits; it would seem intolerably unreasonable to require the agent of the public to pursue the opposite course. In construing any statute authorizing one of these undertakings, every reasonable intendment should be against reading it in a sense that would put the public in this false position. The legal effect of such acts should be held to be that they compel the landowner to offer the public the required, land at the ascertained price, and that, when such price has been finally ascertained, the public has a reasonable time within which to make an election either to accept or reject the offer.” In Franklin Street, <a href="/pa-super/14/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 Pa. Super. 403" data-case-ids="827834" data-case-paths="/pa-super/14/0403-01">14 Pa. Superior Ct. 403</a>, 411, in speaking of the rule that municipal corporations may discontinue at any time “before the landowner has obtained final judgment for the damages,” it is said in the opinion by President Judge Rice: “It is proper that this view should be taken. The public good, or the inability of the treasury to fairly bear the burden, may require that it should recede, and if the landowner is fully compensated for the actual injury he has sustained, no injustice is done in permitting the municipality to do so.”</p>

      <em>the property under completed proceedings, or before final confirmation, </em>recede from or discontinue the proceedings they have instituted. This may be done, unless it is otherwise provided by legislative enactment, at any time before vested rights in others have attached. Until the assessments of damages have been made, the amount cannot be known; and on the whole it is reasonable that after having ascertained the expense of the project the corporation should have a discretion to go on with it or not, as it sees fit. [In a footnote thereto a large number of cases, from many states, are cited as bearing out the text.]</p>

The right to discontinue proceedings, unless the statute otherwise provides, exists as long as the amount of compensation remains undetermined, except in cases where possession has been taken or the party seeking to condemn property has so far affirmed the proceedings as to give the owner a right to treat the taking as final. It is evident that a county, township, or municipal corporation ought not to be held bound to take and pay for property required for a road or street until it knows certainly and definitely what will be required- to pay for the property ... it cannot, in reason or justice, be compelled to take the property until it is informed what compensation will be exacted, and opportunity is <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>afforded it to determine whether the public welfare will justify the expenditure, or the treasury will fairly bear the burden. The weight of authority sustains the view we have expressed and it will be found on investigation that much of the apparent conflict is owing to the difference in the statutes under which the cases were decided.”</p>
    <p id="b79-3" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[187,695,1154,416]]]'>The question now being considered has been before this court on a number of occasions, and, while the conclusions, in the way they are stated, have not always seemed to be harmonious, this arises largely, if not entirely, from the fact that the apparently conflicting results were due to the differing statutes under which the several proceedings were had. This will appear from the following brief review of these decisions:</p>
    <p id="b79-4" data-blocks='[["BL_79.5",79,[184,1131,1156,907]]]'>In Sedgeley Ave., <a href="/pa/88/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="88 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1061244" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0509-01">88 Pa. 509</a>, we decided that “An award of damages by a road jury, under the provisions of the Act of April 1, 1864 [P. L. 206], when confirmed by the court, is a final judgment, and one for the payment of money, and the liability of the city is absolutely fixed thereby.” The Act of 1864, therein construed, provides, however, that the report of the jury shall fix and award the amount of damages and benefits, and “when said award is confirmed by the court . . . the said city shall pay, to the respective owners of the property damaged, or their legal representatives, the damages so assessed for said opening.” This, of course, is in effect a judgment concluding such proceedings, and upon its entry leaves the city no alternative but to pay the award. No such language appears in the relevant statutes in the instant ease, and hence no such conclusion can be reached thereunder.</p>
    <p id="b79-5" data-blocks='[["BL_79.6",79,[186,2059,1153,372]],["BL_80.1",80,[284,365,1152,1294]]]'>In Myers v.

It is not that the borough will owe the amount if, or when, it takes the property, but that it does owe now. All questions of opening, taking, etc., are concluded by it, so far at least as the plaintiff is concerned. As regards other parties the way of retreat may still be open, but a plaintiff who has been diligent and pressed his claim to judgment should not be prejudiced by the laches of other property owners on the same street, whose claims are still pending.” This case determines what is the true rule, which is not that the right to discontinue is always lost as soon as possession is taken, as the court below seemed to think; it is that the right continues until the proceedings are ended, and admittedly they were not ended in the instant case when the Commonwealth filed its petition for leave to discontinue. This matter will be more fully referred to a little later.</p>

It is not that the borough will owe the amount if, or when, it takes the property, but that it does owe now.’ His reasons in support of the judgment in that case, as well as the authorities cited, point to the conclusion that, before judgment in favor of the plaintiff, municipal corporations, on the general principles of law in force prior to the Act of 1891, might be permitted to recede and discontinue condemna<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>tion proceedings.” It follows that, unless there is in this case some controlling statute on the subject — and this we will consider later herein — since there was then no “judgment in favor of the plaintiff,” the court below erred in dismissing the petition to discontinue, solely because, as is alleged, the Commonwealth before the beginning of the proceedings had taken some kind of possession of the land.</p>

I have been unable to find any case in which the confirmation of a report of viewers nisi, or subject to appeal, has been held to have the effect ascribed to a final judgment. Myers v. South Bethlehem, supra, and the reasons given in that case by Mr. Justice Mitchell, are wholly inapplicable to a confirmation or judgment, which is not final, but subject to an appeal. . . . The meaning of the [Act of 1891] is that if, on the report of the viewers, it be found free from exception it shall be confirmed by the court; and if no appeal be taken within the time limited by law, judgment shall be entered thereon. Thus the confirmation of the report and the judgment are not one and the same thing, but separate and successive acts.” He held, however, that inasmuch as the statute gave the hospital the right of immediate possession, and when taken at once devoted the land to the use for which it was ultimately intended, and the hospital had in fact so taken and used it, it was too late to withdraw.</p>

This, as we have already pointed out, is likewise so expressed in Franklin Street, supra.</p>
    <p id="b84-4" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[276,457,1154,1134]]]'>It seems clear, therefore, that there is nothing in our prior decisions that negatives the claim made by the Commonwealth of a right to discontinue the proceedings, and hence the only remaining question to consider is whether or not the applicable statutes compel an opposite conclusion. The statement of the court below that the Commonwealth had lost the right to discontinue is largely, if not entirely, based on a misinterpretation of the relevant statutes. The basic Act of July 15, 1919, P. L. 976, provides for the appointment of a jury of view, whenever the Commonwealth and the property owner cannot agree, with the right of either party [section 5] to “file exceptions raising questions of law or to appeal” on the coming in of their report. Section 7, which is the only one that can have even a remote bearing on the subject, provides: “The board of commissioners of public grounds and buildings <em>shall have the </em>right, upon the filing of any report of viewers, to enter upon and take possession of the property <em>to be </em>acquiredwithout the filing of any bond or other security, where an appropriation has been made for the purchase of such property.”</p>
    <p id="b84-5" data-blocks='[["BL_84.5",84,[273,1601,1152,806]],["BL_85.1",85,[171,341,1154,1082]]]'>Upon this provision of the statute, the opinion below is founded. It says: “Whether the State has actually taken possession of the lands in question is immaterial. The controlling fact is that the State had the right of possession.” This is an erroneous conclusion. The statute says the board “shall have the right, upon the filing of any report of viewers, to enter upon and take possession of the property to be acquired,” etc. It does not'say the board “shall [then] enter upon and take possession of the property,” nor does it say that “upon the filing of any report,” the matter shall be treated as if the board had taken possession. It shall “have the right” so to do, and, if it does, doubtless the right to discontinue would then be lost. But this result would flow only from the exercise of the right, not also from a failure to exercise it. If the board <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>does not exercise the right “to enter upon and take possession of the property to be acquired,” then the status as to that matter remains unchanged, and the result which would flow from the exercise of the right does not arise. Any other conclusion would wholly exclude from consideration the words “shall have the right,” for, in that event, the statute would mean exactly the same without them as with them. This is never a permissible construction of a statute unless none other is reasonably possible: Orth &amp; Bro. v. Board of Education, <a href="/pa/272/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="272 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="1068363" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0411-01">272 Pa. 411</a>; McFadden v. Lineweaver &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/297/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="297 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1118217" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0278-01">297 Pa. 278</a>; West v. Lysle, <a href="/pa/302/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="302 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1129039" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0147-01">302 Pa. 147</a>. Directly applicable to the present situation is the opinion in Franklin Street, supra, where it is said at page 413: “We know of no case which holds that a right of entry is equivalent in effect to an actual entry and exclusion of the owner from the possession in precluding a municipal corporation from claiming the benefits of an abandonment of the proposed taking before final judgment for the landowner’s damages.” Nor is there any case, decided since Franklin Street, which so holds.</p>

If taken at the time averred by appellee it must have been submissively or by agreement, and not adversely, and hence, for <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>this reason also, cannot be given the effect of an adverse taking. It certainly was not “such an actual taking under the power of eminent domain as invests the donee of the power with title”: Wood v. Trustees of the State Hospital, supra.</p>
    <p id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[279,610,1153,586]]]'>Clause (f) of section 2402 of the Administrative Code of April 9, 1929, P. L. 177, 306, provides that “the condemnation of land hereunder shall be in the manner provided by the Act of July 15, 1919,” supra, and neither adds to nor subtracts therefrom. This is so, also, as to that section, as amended by the Act of June 1,1931, P. L. 350, 371, which neither adds to nor subtracts from the provisions of the Act of 1919, supra. Hence as the Act of 1919, on the facts here appearing, has no effect on the Commonwealth’s right to discontinue, these later statutes are equally wide of the mark.</p>
    <p id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[279,1208,1151,260]]]'>It follows that the order of the court below refusing the Commonwealth the right to discontinue the proceedings was erroneous and must be reversed, and with it must fall all the later proceedings, leading up, through the trial, to the final judgment, which must also be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b86-6" data-blocks='[["BL_86.6",86,[278,1480,1152,689]]]'>The judgment of the court below is reversed, the order dismissing appellant’s petition for leave to discontinue the eminent domain proceedings is also reversed, said petition is reinstated and granted, and the court below is directed to ascertain, by appropriate proceedings, the amount of costs, expenses and damages expended and suffered by appellee by reason of the intended condemnation of his land, from the date those proceedings were instituted until the time the Commonwealth applied for leave to discontinue them, and to direct the payment of such costs, expenses and damages, within such time as may be reasonable under the circumstances, the time to be designated in the decree.</p>
