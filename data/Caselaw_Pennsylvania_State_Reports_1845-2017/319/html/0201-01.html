Schneider for approximately 390 acres of land, designated in the record as the Carnegie Coal Co., Dorrington and the Forsythe tracts, is questioned. Schneider obtained options to buy or agreements with the owners to sell to him, and paid to the owners of the three tracts $64,188.50, retaining the difference. The learned court below stated that there was neither direct nor circumstantial evidence that defendants received any part of Schneider’s profits. The purchases were made in 1924, from February 16th to October 6th. Mr. McIntosh, who for many years had been solicitor for the Allegheny County Home, prepared the <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>contracts fot' the purchase of the lands, and the deeds by which the title was transferred and seems to have supervised the transfers. He arranged with a Pittsburgh Title Insurance Company for examination and insurance of the title, and participated ih the settlements conducted by the title company when the deeds<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> were delivered and the balance of the purchase money distributed, costs of title insurance and other adjustments were paid.</p>

All these agreements in the possession of the former owners, and all the records and accounts of the title insurance company relating to the transactions and showing receipts and disbursements, were of course available to the controller in the performance of his duties as auditor of defendants’ accounts for the year 1924. There is no evidence, indeed it is not even suggested, that the vendors, or the title insurance company, or any one on behalf of either, did, or omitted to do, anything which might have interfered with or obscured the performance by the controller of his duties. By calling for and examining these records, he would have learned at once all that was shown from the same sources at the trial. So, too, he might have availed himself of the records in the office of the solicitor for the Allegheny County Home, against whose connection with the transactions no charge is made. The documentary sources of information, over which the defendants exercised neither authority nor control, fully recorded all that was revealed in the trial; they were at all times available to the controller; certainly as to those sources <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>of information there was no concealment or other action by defendants.</p>

It was perhaps natural to identify the tracts during the negotiations, as well as when purchased, by the names of the owners with whose names they had been thus associated. At all events, we cannot say that, without more, the mere omission to record in the account the name of Schneider was such concealment by defendants as would permit the setting aside of the controller’s audit. Especially is this true in view of the existence of abundant documentary evidence in the hands of third parties available to the controller, and which defendants knew was so available, and the absence of proof that the defendants profited by the transaction in any way. We must therefore join with the learned court below in rejecting the contention made on behalf of the appellant.</p>
