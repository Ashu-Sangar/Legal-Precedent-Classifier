This remaining land with the restriction was sold to Grump and McQuillen, who built an apartment house thereon in violation of the building restriction. Goldberg, the first vendee, brought suit against the Nicolas, the original covenantors and grantors, for damages resulting from the violation of the covenant, recovered a verdict and a judgment was entered thereon.

The covenant not to erect a building more than three stories in height contained in the covenantors’ deed to their covenantee, the grantee, and binding the remaining part of this land owned by the covenantors, was a restrictive covenant.- Where an instrument conveying or granting an interest in land restricts the use of that land to a certain definite purpose which will be beneficial to the land affected and the remaining land in the grantor out of which <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>the grant is made or to other lands of the grantor adjacent thereto, such restriction is a covenant real and becomes a part of the estate that is granted, binding successively the owners of the land. It limits to the extent of the prohibition the unlimited use which would otherwise be incident to the fee granted. The privity of estate existing between successive owners causes such covenant to bind the assignees of the covenantor as well as the assignees of the covenantee; the beneficial right thereby created as well as the impediment to or burden on the full enjoyment of the land, follows the ownership of the land with which it is inseparably connected. The leading case on the subject is Spencer’s Case, 5 Coke 16, decided in 1583, and it was then determined that the test as to whether the contract or covenant ran with the land and would be binding upon and enforceable by successive owners was whether it “doth not touch or concern the thing demised.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A restriction on thé use of land contained in a deed is appurtenant or attached to the land conveyed, and where the restriction either benefits or also applies to other land remaining in the grantor it is attached to that land also.</p>

See Clark, Covenants and Interests Running with Land, page 148 et seq. The difficulty in determining whether a covenantor who has parted with his. title should be liable in the future for a breach of the covenant by a subsequent grantee comes from a failure to properly appraise the real intent and purpose of the restriction and its relation to the land involved. The difficulty has been augmented by the rule that has prevailed in leases of land where liability for breach of covenant may be imposed on the lessee regardless of the number of assign<a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>ments of the lease, and the grip of personal liability on a vendor in a deed for breach of covenant or warranty of quiet enjoyment.</p>

Undoubtedly in the restricted use that was imposed on this land, there was a direct and positive invasion of the ordinary rights of fee simple owners; indeed it carved an interest from an ordinary fee right. It was intended, however, to benefit the property affected and its owners by making it more attractive for sale and securing to it light and air. It was to the owners a direct <em>benefit; </em>while on the land both covenantor and covenantee, with their respective assigns, had a substantial interest in the life of the covenant. When either parted with the title he parted with that interest. The one thus separating himself from the land could not enter the aliened premises to prevent a breach, he could enjoy no benefit from it, nor could he perform the covenant. It was so intended by the parties and was effective alike on covenantor and covenantee. The interest thus created was centered in or attached to the land itself, for the benefit of the other parcel. When the person divested himself of title, he transferred to his grantee the same right in the covenant that he possessed, with the same obligation imposed. There was never any intention to impose personal responsibility apart from privity of estate, or to enter into an engagement on personal credit. On the contrary, there was set up a con<a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>tract operative and binding upon owners and future owners of the land as long as privity of estate lasted between them.</p>

The contractual aspect of a covenant in a lease, as for instance to pay rent, is never lost sight of; although it runs with the land, the original covenantor is liable even if he has assigned the lease. As to him the covenant subsists, as stated in Washington Natural Gas Co. v. Johnson, <a href="/pa/123/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="123 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="967142" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0576-01">123 Pa. 576</a>.. There are two classes of covenants annexed to land which follow it into the hands of heirs and assigns. The one class, such as the usual covenants for title, affect successively the owners of the land, who are bound by the privity of contract between them. The other class, represented by equitable easements, is attached to the land itself and follows the possession of the land: Norcross v. James, <a href="/mass/140/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="140 Mass. 188" data-case-ids="764036" data-case-paths="/mass/140/0188-01">140 Mass. 188</a>; 1 Smith’s Leading Cases 145; Holmes, The Common Law, 394 et seq. As long ago as Pakenham’s Case, Y. B. 42, Ed. III 3, which is thoroughly discussed and explained by Justice Holmes, the distinction between these two types of covenants was recognized and the subject of argument. It is impossible to distinguish between the landlord and tenant cases and the restricted covenant cases unless the principle is kept in sight that these latter covenants are attached to and for the benefit of the land, creating a property right. We have held that a restricted covenant <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>of this nature is a property right, in Clark v. Martin, <a href="/pa/49/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="49 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="998494" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0289-01">49 Pa. 289</a>, where it was said that a deed restricting buildings to a certain height gave the grantor, the covenantee, a right to have the “privilege or appurtenance” of light and air over the restricted land. And, in Muzzarelli v. Hulshizer, <a href="/pa/163/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="163 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="859042" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0643-01">163 Pa. 643</a>, we said: “On the other hand, it is claimed by plaintiff that the building restriction above quoted is in the nature of a covenant running with the land, and was intended to create and did create an easement of light and air in favor of her (plaintiff’s) lot. . . . Giving to the words employed their ordinary and proper meaning, we are unable to see that the clause in question is susceptible of any other reasonable construction.”</p>

According to the literal, and hence natural, interpretation of this language, the parties meant that the grantor should not personally do or cause to be done any of the inhibited acts.”</p>
      <p id="b231-8" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[207,1523,1155,678]]]'>In Sexauer v. Wilson, <a href="/iowa/136/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="136 Iowa 357" data-case-ids="8646670" data-case-paths="/iowa/136/0357-01">136 Iowa 357</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20L.R.A.N.S.%20185" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="14 L.R.A.N.S. 185">14 L. R. A. (N. S.) 185</a> (1907), a covenant was made by the grantee to maintain perpetually a tight fence. The new grantee failed to repair. Held, the covenant ran with the land but that the covenantor, having sold his land, was not liable. The court said: “Having found that the covenantor’s grantee is bound by the covenant, the next inquiry is whether the covenantor also is liable thereon subsequent to parting with the title. This necessarily depends on the intention of the party to the first deed. While the covenant is personal in form, this is not controlling, for the deed must have been executed with the understanding that Wilson, the grantee, would have no right to enter on the land after passing title to another in order to repair or replace the fence. ... It could not have been his intention to assume an obligation in perpetuam, and, in the event of disposing of the fee, to remain bound for life.”</p>
