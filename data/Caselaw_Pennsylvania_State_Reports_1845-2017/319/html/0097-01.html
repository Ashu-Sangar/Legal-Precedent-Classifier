    <p id="b138-5" data-blocks='[["BL_138.7",138,[275,547,1153,807]]]'>Plaintiff, here appellee, purchased twenty-one of appellant’s registered debentures, each in the principal sum of one thousand dollars payable “to the registered owner ... on demand.” Appellee at all times remained the registered owner of these debentures on appellant’s books, and demanded from appellant payment of the aggregate sum of the principal and interest of these bonds. Payment was refused because the debentures had been lost, on the ground that this might cause a double liability in the event that the bonds later appeared in the hands of a transferee for value without notice, and appellant demanded an indemnity bond which appellee was unable to give. In plaintiff’s action to recover the amount of the bonds a summary judgment was entered, this defense being held insufficient.</p>

L. 194, section 1 (4). This being so, a <em>bona fide </em>transferee of one of these bonds would not be entitled to the status of a holder in due course as an incident of. the instrument.</p>
    <p id="b139-4" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[170,902,1153,973]]]'>While there is no express provision in appellant’s bonds making surrender a condition to payment, such a condition may be fairly implied, and surrender should be required unless it reasonably appears that such is impossible by reason of loss, theft or destruction of the instrument. See Zander v. N. Y. S. &amp; T. Co., <a href="/ny/178/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="178 N.Y. 208" data-case-ids="2316574" data-case-paths="/ny/178/0208-01">178 N. Y. 208</a>. The registered owner cannot insist upon payment without either surrendering the bond or accounting for his failure to do so. The unexplained failure of an obligee to produce and surrender the bond at the time of payment is not the equivalent of notice of an assignment, but it is a circumstance which should put the obligor upon inquiry. The danger in making a voluntary payment to the obligee in such a situation exists only where there has actually been an assignment, and there are other known facts which show that an inquiry would have disclosed the truth: Tritt’s Admr. v. Colwell’s Admr., <a href="/pa/31/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="31 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="985078" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0228-01">31 Pa. 228</a> (1858).</p>

      <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>Here the appellant apparently concedes that the bonds have been lost, but insists upon appellee supplying it with an indemnity bond. There is no justification for such a demand. Where, as here, a lost instrument is not negotiable there is no risk of double payment arising out of the nature of the instrument, and hence no necessity for indemnifying the obligor: Gilbert v. First Nat. Bank of Middleburg, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Pa.%20D.%20931" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="22 Pa. D. 931">22 Pa. Dist. 931</a> (1913); Zander v. N. Y. S. &amp; T.
