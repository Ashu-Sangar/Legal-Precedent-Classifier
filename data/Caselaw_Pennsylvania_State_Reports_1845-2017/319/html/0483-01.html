    <p id="b524-11" data-blocks='[["BL_524.12",524,[269,1473,1151,480]]]'>Respondent, appellant in this court, in his answer claimed the right to remain in possession under an oral agreement alleged to have been made by him and the president of a corporation which (he averred) was the beneficial owner of the land. It is not necessary to set forth in detail the terms of the oral arrangement relied on; it is sufficient to say that it is within the prohibition of the statute of frauds, and of no binding effect in this proceeding.</p>
