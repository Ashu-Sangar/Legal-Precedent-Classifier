He died August 26, 1930, aged 73 years, unmarried, intestate, and leaving no issue. -Four claimants to his estate, residing in Germany, aver they are first cousins of decedent through his father. They are known as “Link claimants.” Two others living in the same country claim as first cousins through decedent’s mother, Elisabetha Hoffman Link. They are known as “Hoffman claimants.” There is no controversy between these cousins. There is a controversy between these six cousins and other claimants, especially those from Butler County, who have appealed to this <em>court; </em>the Commonwealth contends against all claimants to the estate. The fund in controversy, originally $81,504.52, after deducting taxes, transfer inheritance tax, legal and other expenses, is $42,-630.91. The court below found against the claimants and awarded the fund to the Commonwealth under section 1314 of the Fiscal Code, the Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343. From that decree these appeals have been taken by the six persons claiming to be cousins'of the decedent.</p>

The part objected to in the decree awarding the fund to the Commonwealth are the words “to be transmitted to the State Treasurer of Pennsylvania in .the nature of an escheat,” and’it is argued that the decree should read that the funds be paid “into the State Treasury, through the Department of Revenue” pursuant to the Act of 1929. The main objection to the decree is that there were no escheat proceedings under the Act of May 2, 1889, P. L. 66, and neither color nor title to the funds could be given under this act. The <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>point is well taken, the lines objected to should be deleted and the decree made to conform to the Act of 1929.</p>

The burden rested upon appellants to prove their claim by a fair preponderance of trustworthy and satisfying evidence, as in civil cases: Com. v. Sweeney, <a href="/pa/283/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="283 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="1090569" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0520-01">283 Pa. 520</a>. See Wigmore on Evidence (2d ed.), section 2498; 18 C. J. 874; 10 R. C. L. 204. Had the court below decided in favor of tfie claimants it could have directed in the present proceedings that the funds be turned over to them; if the decree of the court below against the claimants is sustained in this court, then as the record stands there are no claimants. There is then in the possession of the fiduciary moneys not awarded to any claimant, and which may be paid into the state treasury under the Act of 1929. Payment of.unclaimed moneys by a fiduciary under the Fiscal Code preserves to anyone legally entitled thereto the right <em>to </em>subsequently prove his claim as provided in the act. Among the matters accomplished by the Act of 1929 was that it saved the Commonwealth a large amount of money heretofore paid to escheaters in fees. See Miles v. Metzger, <a href="/pa/316/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="316 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="1159041" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0211-01">316 Pa. 211</a>.

It is only by the grace of the Commonwealth that heirs or legatees are permitted to receive any benefit from a decedent’s toil and energy. But it reserves to itself the right, as it always has, to take the property of a decedent when under its laws there is no one in a posi<a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>tion to inherit. The property of an intestate decedent who dies without known heirs is not mere flotsam or jetsam to be taken by anyone claiming it. In such circumstances, the Commonwealth stands in relation to the property of the decedent as one asserting a substantial right thereto. The Commonwealth’s claim is not based on charity, gratuity, or unearned benefit; it was by its protection that it was possible for the decedent to aecquire such accumulation of property as he possessed.</p>
    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[186,900,1155,1135]]]'>John H. Link was the son of Johann or John Link and Elisabetha Hoffman Link. John Link died April 2, 1901, at the age of 78, survived by his widow, who died August 20, 1901, aged 72, and three children: Catherine, who died in 1915, unmarried, intestate and without issue; Annie Catherine Zimmerman, who died in 1929, intestate and without issue, survived by her husband, Peter C. Zimmerman, and the intestate decedent, John H. Link. The latter, shortly after his parents’ death, erected a monument over their graves which states that Johann Link was born July 13, 1822, and that his wife, Elisabetha, was born December 21, 1829. A Bible subsequently offered in evidence showed the birth of Johann as July 13, 1823. Both the father and the son had, for many years, receded from association with their fellow men and confined themselves to a small farm in Ross Township where John Link had established the family home. There, exercising the utmost frugality, even to the point of squalor, they amassed a considerable estate, which was carefully invested. This increase in wealth came principally from the produce of a small plot of ground.</p>

Satisfactory evidence must be produced showing the place of origin, the town or place in Germany from which decedent’s parents came and where kinship was created. These affidavits utterly failed to make the connection and establish this link in the chain. Peter Zimmerman, decedent’s brother-in-law, was the principal witness before the master and the court below for this purpose. Zimmerman’s testimony attempts to fix the place that Johann Link and his wife came from in Germany. The testimony of Lothes, for a similar purpose, was also before the court, but it was found vague and indefinite. The court below refused to credit any of this testimony as reliable. It is stated in Judge Trimble’s findings and conclusions, concurred in by the other judges of the court in banc, “Nor is there any satisfying evidence in the case at bar that John H. Link left any relatives to succeed to his estate. In so far as Peter G. Zimmerman’s (the son-in-law) testimony about John H. Link’s family is reliable, we are confined to it for the facts about his provenance, his marriage, and his children.” Further: “It is now more than eighty years since John Link left Bavaria and perhaps quite as long since his wife left, if she ever lived there at all. There is no testimony from any witness called in this case before the master or the court, except Peter Zimmerman, to show that Elisabetha Hoffman, the widow who married John Link, ever lived in Bavaria. <em>There is not a word of reliable testimony in this ease to show from which one of the innumerable towns, of the large political division of Germany Icnoion as Bavaria, John Link of Ross Township came. </em>It is startling to think of any hope of founding a decree upon such flimsy hearsay testimony as we have in the ex parte affidavits offered by the Bavarian claimants or the unsatisfying testimony of Zimmerman.” Of course the affidavits would be of no evidential use or value unless John Link, the father, can be definitely located at some place in Bavaria. The court below was not satisfied that the witnesses relied on- by the claimants were <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>credible, and, not believing them, it refused to find a decree for appellants.</p>
    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[200,455,1155,1137]]]'>With respect to Zimmerman’s testimony, we quote from appellants’ brief: “In the first place, appellants desire to point out that Peter C. Zimmerman’s first and primary interest in all the matters involved in the estates of decedent, decedent’s father, and decedent’s sisters, was to get out of them all that he could for himself, which he certainly succeeded in doing. He was not friendly to the interests of any next of kin left by John H. Link, and his various affidavits and testimony shown on the record before the auditing judge gives very certain indication that it was only by slow degrees that he disclosed facts within his knowledge that could be, and eventually were, of assistance to the inquiry. After he was assured of the success of his own efforts to obtain as much as he could, his recollection improved. This is demonstrated by his withholding from the master the information about the family Bible and his knowledge of the friendship which existed between the Links and the South Side people, who turned out to be John Lothes and his uncles.” A judge who disbelieves such a witness should not be criticized when counsel speaks of him thus.</p>
    <p id="b559-6" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[198,1604,1156,700]]]'>Furthermore the court rejected the ex parte affidavits as being incompetent. Incompetency may come from deficiency within the affidavit or from some extraneous cause. Incompetency covers a wide field. Ex parte affidavits are generally inadmissible as not being the best evidence, especially when the persons making them are living and able to testify either in court or by deposition. The estate was well worth a trip from Germany and if appellants had sufficient faith in their cause they should have come. Direct testimony is of a higher grade and should be insisted upon in pedigree cases. If the statements contained in the ex parte affidavit are evidence, there is a proper way to place them in the record.</p>
    <p id="b559-7" data-blocks='[["BL_559.6",559,[201,2317,1152,99]],["BL_560.1",560,[262,340,1155,2006]]]'>We have no doubt that pedigree may be proven by certain types of hearsay evidence, but kinship which carries <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>with it a claim of property against the claim of the State should be proved by something more than a guess, it should be built on a sound basis. Johann Lindner stated in the ex parte affidavit that “I knew Johann Link who lived there and died at Neuhof in 1910. ... I often talked with Johann Link who died in 1910 about his brothers and sisters. He told me that some of them had gone to America and they had never heard from them. That he had a brother Johann, the same name as himself who was in America and was married to Elizabetlia Hoffman, a girl from Preunersfeld, which is about two or three miles from Neuhof.” Here the declarations as heresay evidence were those of a brother. In Sitler v. Gehr, <a href="/pa/105/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="105 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="454257" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0577-01">105 Pa. 577</a>, 596, it was stated: “I entirely agree that, in order to admit hearsay evidence in pedigree, you must, by evidence dehors the declaration, connect the person making them with the family.” Sitler v. Gehr, <a href="/pa/105/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="105 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="454257" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0577-01">supra,</a> holds that declarations are admissible if, first, the declarations are made ante litem motam; second, the declarant is dead; and, third, the quotation just noted; to which the court below adds, “there must be some evidence independent of the statement itself that the person making the statement is related to the family about which he speaks.” As stated in Gerrity v. Sovereign Camp, <a href="/pa-super/85/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="85 Pa. Super. 288" data-case-ids="665581" data-case-paths="/pa-super/85/0288-01">85 Pa. Superior Ct. 288</a>, 291: “The rule does not require that the witness who testifies in court must be related to the person whose pedigree is under consideration but that the declarant whose statements are given in evidence by the witness was so related.” The court below in holding that the chain of relationship was not proved, did not hold that the person who made the affidavit should be related to the Link or Hoffman families. It did require that the person who made the declaration, namely, Johann Link, should be related to the families, and that should be shown by “evidence dehors the declaration.” That is, evidence apart from Johann’s declaration to connect him with the family.</p>
    <p id="b561-4" data-blocks='[["BL_561.3",561,[188,338,1156,1674]]]'>
      <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>To support the catena or chain of relationship and furnish “evidence dehors the declaration” it is urged that the birth certificate offered in evidence (Johann Link, July 13, 1822, and John Georg Link, born January 27, 1828), prove that “the Johann Georg Link, as to whose declarations Johann Lindner made the affidavit, was the younger brother of Johann Link, the latter admittedly being the father of the decedent.” Johann Lindner’s ex parte affidavit does not speak of Johann Georg Link; he speaks of Johann Link who died in 1910, and who, this record shows, was not born in 1828, but according to the baptismal certificate was born in 1834, and according to the death certificate from the Eegistrar of the Bureau of Yital Statistics, was born in 1840; this Johann Link was not the Johann Link whose baptismal certificate shows him to have been born July 13, 1822. (It is claimed that Link was the father of John H., the decedent, but Zimmerman says he was born in 1823.) There is another reason why Lindner was not testifying as to Johann Georg Link’s declaration. Johann Georg, according to a death certificate in evidence, died February 18, 1868, while the Johann that Lindner speaks of died in 1910. These baptismal and other records do not prove Johann Link, or John Link, in America, the father of John H. Link, was the brother of Joliann Link who is supposed to have made the declaration, nor is there anything dehors the record that would prove that fact. It would appear that these parents named three of their boys Johann, a most unusual circumstance even in Germany. The name Georg can not be added to Johann in Lindner’s ex parte statement.</p>

After a careful review of the testimony, with the knowledge that the opinion writer in the court below saw the witnesses and observed their behavior while testifying, and duly noting what appellants’ counsel has stated as well as the contradictions and other matter appearing in the testimony, the court below did not err in rejecting the testimony as not being credible.

He petitioned the orphans’ court for a decree against the executors to pay him his legacy, setting out the assignment and alleging that it was obtained by fraud. It was held that the orphans’ court had jurisdiction. King’s Est., supra, involved no question of escheat. It related to the power of the orphans’ court to distribute a fund in partition. Brandt’s Est., supra, merely decided that where two creditors claim the same commissions owed by a decedent, the orphans’ court has the power to ascertain the persons to whom the distribution must be made.</p>

The Commonwealth in the instant case is relying upon the later acts above cited as superseding the Escheat Act of 1889. This court held in Miles’s Est., <a href="/pa/272/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="272 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="1068413" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0329-01">272 Pa. 329</a>, 339, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20A.%20300" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="116 A. 300">116 A. 300</a> (1922) : “When the statute under consideration is a general revision, ‘the law as therein written will be deemed to be the same as it stood prior to the revision, unless we find from the statute itself, or its history, a clear intention to change it’: In re Lis’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=139%20N.W.%20300" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="139 N.W. 300">139 N.

Therefore, I have no difficulty in deciding that these acts must be construed in pari materia with the Escheat Act <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>of 1889. In Russ v. Com., <a href="/pa/210/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="210 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="937866" data-case-paths="/pa/210/0544-01">210 Pa. 544</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20A.%20169" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="60 A. 169">60 A. 169</a>, this court said: “The correct rule of interpretation is, that if divers statutes relate to the same thing, they ought all to be taken into consideration in construing any one of them, and it is an established rule of law, that all acts in pari materia are to be taken together, as if they were one law: Doug. 30; 2 Term Rep. 387, 586; 4 Maule &amp; Selw. 210.” The Acts of 1917, 1923 and 1929 providing for the payment into the state treasury of the proceeds of the real and personal estate of an intestate who dies in default of known heirs or kindred or surviving spouse presuppose that no one has claimed to be “the known heirs, or kindred, or surviving spouse,” <em>or </em>that, if a claim or claims have been made, the issues thereby raised have been decided adversely to claimants. The provision in section 1314 of the Fiscal Code of 1929 that “the fiduciary shall, within sixty days after the date of said audit or adjudication, file, in the court having jurisdiction of his account, a sworn statement of such unawarded or unclaimed moneys,” is not inconsistent with section 9 of the Act of 1889, which provides that whenever “there shall be any disputed fact or facts touching said escheat, then and in that case, the said court shall, upon application of the escheator, or any other person interested or claiming to be interested in the said proceedings, prior to the filing of a finding or adjudication therein, frame an issue or issues to determine said disputed question or questions of facts; which said issue or issues shall be tried in the court of common pleas.” The appellee here cites on this question an opinion by Deputy Attorney General William M. Hargest, 29 Pa. Dist. Rep. 749, dated February 3, 1920, in response to a query asking whether section 24 of the General Escheat Act was repealed by section 5 of the Act of May 16, 1919, P. L. 169. Section 24 of the Act of 1889 provides for a reward to the person who shall first inform the auditor general, by writing, that an escheat has occurred by reason of the fact that any person has died intestate, etc. The attorney gen<a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>eral’s answer to that question was that this act merely “changed the policy of the State with reference to the payment to it of <em>unclaimed </em>funds. [Italics supplied.] . . . The conclusion is irresistible that in so far as the General Escheat Act of May 2,1889, P. L. 66, as amended by the Act of May 11, 1911, P. L. 281 [amending only the 3d, 5th, 24th and 27th sections of the former], applies to <em>unclaimed </em>moneys in the possession of any fiduciary, that act is supplanted, and therefore repealed by the Act of May 16, 1919, P. L. 169.” It follows that the opinion of the deputy attorney general is inapplicable here because the moneys now in controversy are not <em>unclaimed. </em>The opinion in Costello’s Est., <a href="/pa-d-c/15/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="15 Pa.

That was a case of where there were <em>no claims </em>made in behalf of heirs or next of kin, and the question at issue was whether or not the person who had given notice to the auditor general that the estate had escheated to the Commonwealth was entitled to the fee provided for in the General Escheat Act, supra. Appellee also cites Apsley’s Est., 8 D. &amp; C. 345, which likewise applies only to <em>unclaimed funds </em>in the hands of fiduciaries, and the only question raised related to the fee demanded by the informer.</p>

This court said in that case: “The power of the orphans’ court to send an issue to the common pleas in a contested will case is not dependent on the request of a party in interest, regardless of whether or not the granting of such issue by a register’s court was so dependent under the Acts of 1832. . . .

The language of the opinion is as follows: The balance of $41,-299.31 “. . . was distributed under the authority of the Fiscal Code Act of 1929, P. L. 343, article XIII, section 1314, P. L. 419, ‘to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to be transmitted to the state treasurer of Pennsylvania in the nature of an escheat,’ which form of decree is satisfactory to the Commonwealth and is now the practice of this court.” It is fair to assume that because of the practice prevailing in that court, claimants did not ask to have an issue framed and awarded as provided in section 9 of the Escheat Act of 1889. The voluminous record in this case discloses a substantial dispute on the question of whether or not the six claimants are first cousins of the intestate, and this dispute is one that is particularly appropriate for the determination of a jury. I think that justice requires that this record be returned to the orphans’ court and that when this is done, the court should notify the auditor general to appoint an escheator if he desires so to do, and upon the application of either the escheator or. the claimants, an issue should be framed and certified to the court of common pleas and <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>the result, after determination, certified back to the orphans’ court, in accordance with the provision of section 9 of the General Escheat Act of May 2, 1889, P.

The tombstone erected by his children on the grave of Johann Link bears the inscription: “Born July 13, 1822.” A photograph of this monument with its inscription was properly received in evidence. It was competent to prove the date of birth of the person whose grave it marked. See Wigmore on Evidence (2d ed.), section 1495 and 22 C. J., page 253, section 245. The fact that the tombstone of Johann Link bears the same date of his birth as the birth certificate of Johann Link, the son of Joh. Gg. Link, a farmer in Neuhof, is most convincing that the John H. Link, the intestate in this case, was the son of the Johann Link, who was the uncle, of the Link claimants. The majority opinion says: “A Bible subsequently offered in evidence showed the birth of Johann [Link] as July 13, 1823.” This discrepancy of one year to the day, even though unexplained, would not be sufficient to destroy the conviction that the Johann Link, who was born in Bavaria on July 13, 1822, was the same Johann Link, who was buried under the tombstone described above. But, this discrepancy is explained. Peter Zimmerman, who was the son-in-law of <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>Johann Link, and who testified in this case, said of this Bible with the inscription in question: “I think the student he bought it [i. e., the Bible] from put the first lines in. I am not sure. John did put something in himself and then he rubbed it out.” In other words, there is no evidence that this inscription in the family Bible was in the handwriting of Johann Link, or of anyone who knew the facts. If some student from whom Johann Link bought the Bible, entered the inscription, he could have misunderstood the date of 1822 and written 1823, and made an error of a year. There is absolutely no doubt that the inscription on the monument erected by Johann Link’s son, who presumably knew the date of his father’s birth, fixes the date of his birth as July 13, 1822. The birth certificate (Exhibit 1-6) offered in evidence in this case from the files of the Evangelical Lutheran Parish Church, Pegnitz, shows that in the year 1822 there was born at Neuhof, District of Eschenbach on July 13th, Johann Link, whose father’s name was Joh. Gg. Link, and whose mother’s name was Anna Elisabeth Lothes. This evidence alone ought to be sufficient to establish the fact that the Johann Link who was born on July 13, 1822, and the Johann Link who was buried under the tombstone which gives the date of his birth as July 13, 1822, are one and the same person. Besides, we have the testimony of Peter Zimmerman, the son-in-law of Johann Link, and a brother-in-law of the intestate, John H. Link, who testified that his father-in-law, Johann Link, and his mother-in-law, Elizabetha Hoffman Link, were born in Bayern, or Bavaria, in towns only three or four miles apart. Zimmerman testified that Johann Link’s wife, Elizabetha Hoffman, was born on December 21, 1829. This corresponds to the date on the tombstone. Zimmerman also testified that Johann Link was born on July 13, 1823. This was an error of one year. It was obviously based on his erroneous recollection of the date that was on the tombstone, for when asked what date was on the stone, he replied: “July 13, 1823.” In fact, the date is <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>July 13,1822. He also said that the date, July 13,1823, appears in the family Bible. He explains, as already quoted, that the entry in the family Bible was probably made by the student from whom the Bible was purchased. The relatives who erected the monument made no such error but inscribed on the stone as the date of Johann Link’s birth, July 13, 1822. Zimmerman further testified that Johann Link always declared that he had no relatives in this country and was one of a large family in Germany. He, Zimmerman, thought Mrs. Link’s family was small, consisting only of one or two brothers and no sisters. The records offered in evidence in this case corroborate Zimmerman as to this.</p>

This Johann Link was, as revealed by the record, one of 12 or 13 children born of Johann Georg Link and his wife, Anna Elisabetha Lothes. The records produced on behalf of the maternal claimants show them to be the surviving nephews of an Elisabetha Hoffman, who was born on December 21, <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>1829, in Prennersfeld, Bavaria, one of the three children of Peter Hoffmann and Barbara Breitenfelder.</p>

He had talked with all of them while they were alive, especially with Johann, and by him had been told that some of his brothers and sisters had gone to America, among them a brother Johann, who had married an Elisabetha Hoffmann, a girl from Preunersfeld. Lindner also stated that he knew an uncle of the maternal claimants, a Johann Hoffmann, who lived in Preunersfeld and who told him that he had a sister, Elisabetha, who went to Pittsburgh, and married a Johann Link from Neuhof, one of the Link family known to the affiant. Affiant further deposed that Johann Hoffmann had corresponded with his sister, Elisabetha, about the estate of their father, and he, Hoffman, told him, Lindner, that he paid Elisabetha her share. After that, Lindner believed, Johann Hoffmann did not correspond with his sister, although he continued to mention her from time to time.

Appellants have produced proof of their relationship to Johann Link and Elisabetha Hoffmann, and the evidence warrants the finding that the latter are the same persons who were married in the Lutheran Church on Smithfield Street, Pittsburgh, in 1854 or 1855, and who were the parents of John H. Link. The testimony establishes that Johann Link, the father of John H. Link, was born on July 13, 1822, and that his wife, who before her marriage was Elisabetha Hoffmann, was born December 21, 1829. They were both born in Bavaria in towns a few miles apart and ,were of the Lutheran faith. The Links came from “Nei<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>hoff” or “Niedorf” and Mrs. Link originally came from Preunersfeld near Pegnitz.

Gehr, <a href="/pa/105/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="105 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="454257" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0577-01">supra;</a> see Wigmore, Evidence (2d ed.), section 1480 et seq. These three conditions were fully complied with. The court below conceded that the first two conditions were complied with but fell into error in applying the law to the third condition. As to that the court said: “But a prior condition to both these [i. e., conditions 1 and 2] is that it should be proved by some source of evidence independent of the statement itself that the person making the statement is related to the family about which he speaks.” The court then quotes the following from Sitler v. Gehr, <a href="/pa/105/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="105 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="454257" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0577-01">supra</a> (<a href="/pa/105/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="105 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="454257" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0577-01">105 Pa. 577</a>): The “rule does not require that the witness who testifies in court must be related to the person whose pedigree is under consideration but that the declarant whose statements are given in evidence by the witness was so ise<a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>luted,” and adds: “The catena of relationship was not proved and, therefore, the objection of the Commonwealth’s deputy attorney to the competency of the affidavits must be sustained.” The court below misapplied the rule which it quoted. This rule does not require that Johann Lindner and the others who made affidavits in this case be related to the Link and Hoffmann families of which they spoke. It requires merely that <em>the persons whose declarations they quoted </em>should be related to the families about which <em>the declarant </em>spoke. The catena or chain of relationship between the declarant and the Link family was proved by competent evidence. The birth certificates offered in evidence prove that the Johann Link, as to whose declarations Johann Lindner made the affidavit, was the younger brother of Johann Link, the latter admittedly being the father of decedent. Many of the declarations in the affidavits were attributed to Johann Link, who was born in Neuhof on September 8, 1834, and died there in 1910. It <em>was </em>shown by “evidence aliunde,” i. e., by the birth records in evidence, that he was the younger brother of Johann Link, who was born in Neuhof on July 13, 1822, and who, appellants with good reason contend, was the same Johann Link who died in Ross Township, Allegheny County, in 1901, and who according to the inscription on his tombstone was born on July 13, 1822. The birth certificate shows sufficient relationship between Johann Link and Johann Link, the declarant referred to in the affidavit of Johann Lindner and others, as to make Lindner’s testimony on this point competent. The competency of this testimony is ruled by the decision in the case of Sitler v. Gehr <a href="/pa/105/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="105 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="454257" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0577-01">(supra),</a> <a href="/pa/105/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="105 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="454257" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0577-01">105 Pa. 577</a>. There the plaintiff’s father was Joseph Gehr, while the deceased’s ancestor, through whom he wished to establish relationship, was Balser Gehr. In that case the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Paxson, said: (page 592) “It was contended that the declarants must be shown by evidence aliunde to be related to Balser Gehr, of Berks County; in other words, to the person <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>last seised of the estate, or his particular branch of the family. To state the question in another form: the declarants were Anna Maria Gehr and John Gehr; the plaintiffs’ ancestor was Joseph Gehr; the deceased ancestor was Balser Gehr, of Berks County. It was not denied that the declarants were of the family of Joseph Gehr, and it was attempted to show by their declarations that the above named Joseph Gehr and Balser Gehr were related to each. The question was, whether sufficient ground had been laid for such declarations. The plaintiffs in error contend, not only that the declarants must be shown by evidence aliunde to be related to the family as to which the declarations were made, but also that they must also be thus shown to be related to the person who died seised. The first part of this proposition is undoubtedly true under all the authorities ; the latter portion of it is not so clear. I have carefully examined all the authorities cited on both sides upon this point, and many others to which our attention was not called upon the argument, and although there is some conflict in the cases the weight of authority seems to be that while a declarant must be shown by evidence aliunde to belong to the family, it does not appear to be necessary to show that he belongs to the same branch of it. In Vowles v. Young, 13 Vesey 147, it was held that the declarations of a deceased husband concerning the descent or pedigree of his wife are admissible. And in Jewell v. Jewell, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Howard%20219" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="1 Howard 219">1 Howard 219</a>, that the declarations of a deceased husband of one of the plaintiffs claiming as heir of her father, that his wife was not married to. her father, were admitted.” The evidence in the instant case was within the rule laid down in Sitler v. Gehr, <a href="/pa/105/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="105 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="454257" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0577-01">supra.</a> Johann Link who died at Neuhof in 1910, is shown by duly authenticated birth records to be the brother of Johann Link, who was born in Neuhof in 1822 the son of Johann Georg Link and Anna Elizabeth Lothes. In his affidavit, Johann Lindner declared that the Johann Link who died in 1910 (born 1834) in Neuhof “had a brother <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>Johann, the same name as himself who was in America and was married to Elisabetha Hoffman, a girl from Preunersfeld, two or three miles from Neuhof.” There was another brother, Johann <em>Georg </em>Link born in Neuhof on January 27, 1828. It is a matter of common knowledge that in large families in Europe two or more members of the same family may have the same or similar names, two or more sons taking the father’s surname and two or more daughters, the mother’s. In the affidavit of Barbara Imhof, she states: “It is a common thing in Germany for two or more children of the same parents to bear the same given name or names, especially where the family is large.” In fact, her mother and her stepmother, who were sisters, had the same name, to wit, Margarethe. The declarations of the Johann Link who was born in 1834, as to his brother Johann (12 years older), who emigrated to the United States, are competent. Justice Paxson in the Sitler v. Gehr Case cites Monkton v. The Attorney General, 2 Russ. &amp; M. 157, as follows: “To say that you cannot receive in evidence the declarations of A, who is proved to be a relation by blood of B, touching the relationship of B with G, unless you have first connected him also by evidence dehors his declaration with O, is a proposition which has no warrant either upon the principle upon which hearsay is let in, or in the decided cases; and it plainly involves this absurdity that if, in order to connect B with O, I am first to prove that A is connected with B, and then to superadd the proof that he is connected with G, I do a thing which is vain and superfluous, for then the declaration is used to prove the very fact which I have already established; inasmuch as it is not more true that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another, than that persons related by blood to the same individual are more or less related by blood to each other.” See also Wigmore, op. cit., sec. 1491.</p>

He had been married to the daughter (since deceased) of Johann Link, and certainly it is to be presumed that he knew something of the family history of his father-in-law. He should at least know where he was born. He was asked: “Did you ever hear old John Link tell where he was born?” A. “It was in Bavaria, but I don’t know what part.” Q. “Did you ever hear his wife Elizabeth say where she was born?” A. “She was born right close to where Link was — three or four miles.” This witness Zimmerman was an aged man and presumably was suffering with some of the infirmities of old age, but his testimony indicates that he told a straight-forward story and knew what he was talking about.</p>

The testimony was practically all in favor of the claimants and there was nothing in the case to controvert it. Criticism is offered in the majority opinion because the claimants did not come from Germany to testify. The majority opinion says: “The estate was well worth a trip from Germany and if appellants had sufficient faith in their cause they should have come.” One of the affiants, Barbara Imhoff, was at the time of making the affidavit later received in this case, 81 years of age. Johann Lindner, another one of the affiants, at the time of making his affidavit, was 69 years of age. Heinrich Hoffmann, another affiant, was 66 years of age at the time of making his affidavit.

They made clear-cut affidavits, in which they set forth the facts of the relationships of the Link and Hoffman claimants in a most convincing manner. These affidavits were competent evidence, as has been consistently ruled by this court in other cases in which pedigree was in issue. The affidavits, together with the competent evidence of the tombstone inscription, the birth certificates, and the testimony , of Peter Zimmerman, leave no room for doubt in my mind that the relationship claimed in this case was established. As I said in the early part of this opinion, there were substantial issues of fact raised in this case which were preeminently for the consideration of a jury, as the unrepealed Escheat Act of 1889 provides.</p>
